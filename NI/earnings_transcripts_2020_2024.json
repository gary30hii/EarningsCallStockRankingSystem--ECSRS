All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. And after the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].  I would now like to turn the call over to your speaker today, Randy Hulen, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.\nRandy Hulen: Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to the NiSource fourth quarter 2020 investor call. Joining me today are Joe Hamrock, our Chief Executive Officer; Donald Brown, our Chief Financial Officer; and Shawn Anderson, our Chief Strategy and Risk Officer. The purpose of this presentation is to review NiSource's financial performance for the fourth quarter and full year of 2020 as well as provide an update on our operations, growth drivers and financing plans. Following our prepared remarks, we'll open the call to your questions. Slides for today's call are available on nisource.com. Before turning the call over to Joe, Donald and Shawn, just a quick reminder, some of the statements made during this presentation will be forward-looking. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. Information concerning such risks and uncertainties is included in the MD&A and Risk Factors sections of our periodic SEC filings.  Additionally, some of the statements made on this call relate to non-GAAP measures. For additional information on the most directly comparable GAAP measure and a reconciliation of these measures, please refer to the supplemental slides and segment information, including our full financial schedules available at nisource.com. With all that out of the way, I'd like to turn the call over to Joe.\nJoseph Hamrock: Thanks, Randy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Hopefully, you've all had a chance to read our fourth quarter and full year earnings release, which we issued earlier today. 2020 was a year like no other. Despite the challenges of historic global pandemic, the NiSource team remained focused on our core mission of providing safe, reliable energy to our customers and the communities we serve, while at the same time, enhancing our position to execute on significant long-term growth opportunities.  Our 2020 financial and operational results reflect the resiliency of our business, and continued execution of our safety and asset modernization programs, as well as our transition away from coal generation. In Indiana, we completed two wind power projects in December. And we continue to expect that our infrastructure and generation investments will drive by compound annual growth of 7% to 9% in net operating earnings per share from 2021 through 2024, while reducing greenhouse gas emission 90% by 2030. Let's turn now to Slide 3 and take a closer look at our key takeaways. In 2020, we delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of $1.32 per share as our cost management and regulatory mitigation efforts reduced the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to some I've mentioned already, we achieved a number of other key milestones in 2020. We invested $1.7 billion in our gas and electric utilities, primarily on safety and asset modernization, which remains a top priority. We advanced and matured our Safety Management System and safety enhancement initiatives and 70% of our low-pressure systems are now protected with automatic shutoff devices and remote monitoring. We launched our transformative NiSource Next initiative to support our safety initiatives, build organizational capabilities and enhance our efficiency. We sold the Columbia Gas of Massachusetts business, completing the transaction in 8 months. We lowered the weighted average interest rate on our long-term debt by 60 basis points and enhanced our liquidity through the COVID-19 pandemic, and we continue to see strong demand for natural gas, experiencing a net gain of more than 30,000 gas customers across our 6 state footprint. We are today reaffirming our 2021 non-GAAP net operating earnings guidance of $1.28 to $1.36 per share. Consistent with the long-term growth plan we provided at Investor Day, we expect to make $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion in annual growth, safety and asset modernization investments from 2021 through 2024, and $1.8 billion to $2 billion in renewable generation investments through 2023. I will note that we do expect an order in our Pennsylvania base rate case in the first quarter, with rates that would be retroactive to January 23. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald, who will discuss our 2020 financial performance in more detail.\nDonald Brown: Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Looking at our 2020 results on Slide 4, we had non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $508 million or $1.32 per share compared to non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $495 million or $1.32 per share in 2019. I would note the loss of fourth quarter earnings related to the sale of CMA reduced 2020 non-GAAP earnings per share by approximately $0.05.  Looking more closely at our segment 12-month non-GAAP results on Slide 5, operating earnings were up about $36 million for the year in our gas segment. Operating revenues, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were down about $19 million due to the sale of CMA, partially offset by infrastructure program revenues and increased customer growth. Operating expenses, also net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were down about $55 million, mostly due to the CMA sale and lower employee and administrative expenses, partially offset by increased COVID-related costs. In our electric segment, 12-month non-GAAP operating earnings were down by nearly $40 million, driven primarily by an approximately $16 million increase in operating revenues, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses due to new rates from the recent rate case, partially offset by COVID-related impacts from customer usage, late payment fees and reconnection fees. Operating expenses, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were up by approximately $55 million due to the increased depreciation expenses. Turning to Slide 6, we provide additional details about the financial impact of COVID-19. As you can see, we're seeing lower commercial and industrial sales, which are partially offset by increased residential sales. We're also seeing reduced late payment and reconnection fees as well as higher bad debt and other expenses. The total growth impact of COVID-19 in 2020 was approximately $0.10 per share. This impact was partially offset by non-safety-related cost management and regulatory solutions, bringing the net 2020 impact of COVID-19 to approximately $0.05 per share. Consistent with our base case, we currently expect an additional COVID impact in 2021 of approximately $0.05 per share which is factored into our 2021 non-GAAP EPS guidance range. While we're monitoring the pandemic closely, to date, it has not presented significant barriers to our safety and infrastructure modernization programs or our long-term growth.  As Joe mentioned, we are reaffirming both our 2021 earnings guidance and the guidance for long-term CapEx and EPS CAGR that we outlined it in deck today. Now turning to Slide 7, I like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of December 31 was about $9.7 billion of which about $9.1 billion was long-term debt. Following the successful liability management transaction in the third quarter, the weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 15 years, and our weighted average interest rate was approximately 3.7%. At the end of the fourth quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.7 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility, and other accounts receivable securitization programs. Our credit rating from all three major rating agencies are investment grade and we remain committed to maintaining our current investment grade ratings. Taken together, this represents a solid financial foundation to support our long-term safety and infrastructure investments.  Let's take a quick look at Slide 9, which highlights our current financing plan. I would just note that we continue to look at ways to optimize the financing of our growth strategy. We are currently evaluating scenarios, utilizing hybrids and/or convertibles that get 50% or more equity credit with the rating agencies and could minimize the need for block equity offering in 2022 or 2023. We would anticipate a hybrid or convertible offering sometime in the first half of 2021. I would also note that next week, we plan to file a new at the market or ATM equity program to satisfy our ATM needs for the next 3 years. Just to remind everyone, our guidance is inclusive of this financing plan. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Joe, who will provide some infrastructure investment and regulatory updates for our gas and electric businesses.\nJoseph Hamrock: Thank you, Donald. Now, let's take a look at some NiSource utilities highlights for the fourth quarter and early first quarter of 2021, starting with our gas operations on Slide 10. In Pennsylvania, our base rate case remains pending before the Public Utility Commission. The application originally filed in April 2020 was modified in December and now seeks an annual revenue increase of $76.8 million to invest in, modernize and upgrade our existing natural gas distribution system as well as maintain the continued safety of the system. An order is expected in the first quarter of 2021 with new rates expected to become effective retroactive to January 23, 2021. In Maryland, the Public Service Commission approved the settlement in our base rate request in November 2020. The approved settlement supports further upgrading and replacement of our pipelines and is expected to increase annual revenue by $3.3 million, including $1.3 million of current tracker revenue. New rates became effective in December 2020. In Indiana, our latest tracker update was approved in December in our long-term gas infrastructure modernization program. The update covers $26 million in incremental capital invested under the program between January and June of 2020, and new rates became effective in January of 2021. The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission in 2020 approved a 6-year extension of the program, including nearly $950 million in planned capital investments through 2025 to be recovered through semiannual adjustments to the existing gas Transmission, Distribution and Storage Improvement Charge or TDSIC tracker. Now let's look at our electric operations on Slide 11. In January, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission approved the latest tracker update request in our long-term electric infrastructure modernization plan. The approved electric TDSIC tracker update covers more than $122 million in incremental capital investments made between July 2019 and June 2020, and new rates became effective this month. This well-established program includes enhancements to our electric transmission and distribution system designed to further enhance safety and reliability. The program originally approved by the IURC in 2016 includes approximately $1.2 billion in electric infrastructure investments expected to be made through 2022. And now, I'll ask Shawn Anderson to provide an update about our renewable generation projects.\nShawn Anderson: Thank you, Joe. As Joe shared earlier, we completed our first 2 wind projects, Rosewater and Jordan Creek on time in December, which is an exciting milestone in executing our generation transition. Rosewater is our joint venture with EDP Renewables North America and our tax equity partner, Wells Fargo. Jordan Creek represents a Power Purchase Agreement or PPA with NextEra Energy Resources. These completed projects are now powering more than 125,000 homes across Indiana with cleaner, more cost-effective energy. Our third wind project Indiana Crossroads remains under construction. This joint venture with EDP is expected to be in service at the end of this year. These renewable projects are consistent with their 2018 integrated resource plan, within which the preferred pathway plans to retire nearly 80% of our remaining coal-fired generation by 2023 and retire all coal generation by 2028 to be replaced by lower cost, reliable and cleaner options. The plan is expected to drive a 90% reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and is expected to save our electric customers an estimated $4 billion over 30 years. As Joe noted earlier, we continue to expect to make $1.8 billion to $2 billion of renewable generation investments through 2023. To date, we have executed agreements representing approximately $1.25 billion of this anticipated investment. Commercial negotiations for additional solar and storage capacity continue to advance. Half of the capacity and the replacement plan is targeted to be owned by joint ventures that will include NIPSCO and tax equity partners as the members. The balance of new capacity is expected to be primarily in the form of PPAs. In November 2020, we filed applications with the IURC for the approval of the Dunns Bridge I and II and Cavalry solar energy centers. These 3 Indiana projects or build transfer agreements with NextEra Energy Resources and represent a combined capital investment of approximately $850 million for NIPSCO. These projects are expected to be placed into service across 2022 and 2023.  NextEra will construct the solar and storage facilities, and we plan to form joint ventures with tax equity investors to own, operate and maintain these assets. An IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2021. We continue to fill out the balance of our capacity. In January, the IURC approved our Brickyard and Greensboro solar and storage PPAs. NextEra Energy Resources will develop these projects, which are expected to be completed in mid-2023. And in December 2020, NIPSCO announced a long-term PPA with the clean energy infrastructure business of Capital Dynamics to develop Gibson Solar, a 280-megawatt solar project in Gibson County, Indiana. NIPSCO filed an application with the IURC for approval of this project in January 2021. Construction is expected to begin in 2022 with commercial operations to begin in 2023. Also in December of 2020, NIPSCO filed an application with the IURC for approval of the Green River Solar PPA.  Advanced negotiations continue for additional build transfer agreements to fill out the remainder of our capacity needs. We expect those negotiations to be completed in the first half of 2021 and the necessary regulatory filings coming shortly thereafter. In the fourth quarter of 2021, NIPSCO will be submitting an integrated resource plan for the IURC that will continue to outline its long-term generation plans, including the planned retirement of Michigan City Generating Station. The preferred plan that emerges from the 2021 IRP could create additional capital investment opportunities. Before we move on from our electric story, I would like to provide a quick update on units 14 and 15 at our Schahfer Generating Station. As you know, all 4 coal units at Schahfer are planned to retire by May 2023, as outlined in the 2018 IRP. As we continue to evaluate the economics for that generating fleet and the ongoing costs and investments required to keep the coal units operational, we determined that the right path forward for us is to initiate the retirement of 2 of the 4 coal units at Schahfer. Units 14 and 15 will retire by the end of 2021, which is the most economic decision for our customers.  NIPSCO's remaining fleet and new renewable capacity and secured capacity purchases will continue to reliably serve the energy needs to our customers. To be clear, our earnings guidance is not impacted by this decision. We are excited about the significant progress in executing the plan we identified in our 2018 IRP and further detailed at our Investor Day, and we look forward to more projects and updates to come in future quarters. Now, I will turn the call back over to Joe.\nJoseph Hamrock: Thank you, Shawn. Let's turn back to our foundational commitment, safety. As I noted earlier, our safety enhancement initiatives advanced and matured in 2020. Our implementation of API's Safety Management System or SMS, transitioned from an accelerated project launch to an established operating model within NiSource, and we expanded the implementation to our electric business. With the ongoing support and advice from the independent quality review board, we are continuing to mature our SMS processes, capabilities and talent and we're collaborating with our industry peers to enhance safety and reduce operational risk.  We had a number of safety milestones in 2020 that are worth calling out. We launched mobile gas leak detection pilot project and implemented a service line mapping strategy to enhance records quality across our footprint. We added special clearance processes and other layers of protection to critical field operations activities. Our gas meter shops and our fabrication facility earned ISO 9001 certification, a strong first step in a continuing quality effort. And the final safety recommendation around emergency preparedness and response was closed by the National Transportation Safety Board as we continue to mature our emergency response processes. As noted, SMS has become our core operating model, built on our culture of empowering everyone to report and identify risk, including the authority to stop work whenever necessary, enhancing process safety with layers of protection and building accountability for effective asset management to reduce risk. You'll see additional enhancements to our safety plan in 2021.  I am also pleased to note some recognition that NiSource received in mid-November when we were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index for the seventh consecutive year. NiSource is 1 of 7 U.S. utilities on the 2020 list. The ranking is based on environmental, social and governance criteria and reflects our progress on our sustainability strategy which includes aggressive greenhouse gas reductions, safety enhancements and executing against $40 billion of long-term safety, asset modernization and renewable energy investment opportunities. We're honored to once again be included on this international benchmark for sustainable business practices, which recognizes the comprehensive focus on ESG principles at the core of how we run our business.  Before turning to the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call, I will share and reiterate a few key takeaways. Our 2020 financial and operational results reflect the resiliency of our business and our team as we executed on our safety and asset modernization programs. Our electric generation transition strategy reliably served customers through the historic COVID pandemic and took steps to reposition the company to execute on significant long-term growth opportunities. We continue to expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings per share in the range of $1.28 to $1.36 in 2021. Our long-term growth commitments remain in place. These include $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion in annual growth, safety and modernization investments from 2021 through 2024, plus $1.8 billion to $2 billion in renewable generation investments across 2022 and 2023. And compound annual earnings per share growth of 7% to 9% from 2021 through 2024, with near-term growth of 5% to 7% from 2021 to 2023.  Our electric generation strategy continues to advance with our first 2 wind projects complete and numerous other renewable projects in development.  Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. We're now ready to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andres Sheppard from Credit Suisse.\nMichael Weinstein: It's Mike Weinstein. So the -- you guys are going to be filing a new IRP this year. Is that right? I know\u2026.\nJoseph Hamrock: That's correct. We'll go through that process starting here in the next quarter or so.\nMichael Weinstein: Great. And what kind of pace should we expect in terms of future RFPs coming up in additional opportunities from more renewables? I think you mentioned the Michigan City retirement should provide additional opportunities. What kind of schedule of releases can we expect over the next year or two?\nJoseph Hamrock: Yes. I mean, in essence, we'll follow a process and a pattern that looks a lot like what we went through in 2018. We'll kick off the process with stakeholder engagement relatively soon. And then in the middle of the summer after we develop scenarios is when you'd likely see -- to the extent it helps provide insight at any RFPs that might be included. Keep in mind that the retirement schedule for the Michigan City plant drives the capacity need for the future, because we\u2019ve pretty much got the 2023 capacity replacement plan set. And so RFPs may or may not be as valuable looking out that far from a 2021 vantage point. So we'll take all of that under consideration.  The 1 thing I'd say though, Mike, and I think this is obvious to all of us with the current events that are going on across the industry right now, it just starkly demonstrates that reliability and capacity are essential, and the integrated resource planning process itself is critically important. So that's why our approach really starts with reliability and balances all the other attributes against that fundamental requirement. So this experience that we're seeing now will be -- should provide critical learning for us as we go through the next round of the IRP. And so I don't want to predict with a high degree of precision even the process at this point because there's a lot to learn from what's happening in the markets.\nMichael Weinstein: That makes sense. Hey, could you -- I know you don't want to -- I don't want to front run what might happen with -- in Pennsylvania. But could you talk about what the future pace of rate filings is likely to be based on the needs, based on the investments that's going on in that state? And what do you think will happen next after this rate case decision comes out?\nJoseph Hamrock: You're specifically asking about Pennsylvania. \nMichael Weinstein: Pennsylvania. \nJoseph Hamrock: Yes, I'm not going to speculate about an outlook. We should see a commission decision soon enough, and we'll certainly keep you and all of our stakeholders updated as that plays out. And I won't front run any future filings, but if you look at the pace of investment in Pennsylvania, and the historic cycle there, we've had over about a decade, 8 rate cases settled with the stakeholders in Pennsylvania and well supported by the commission. So I think that track record and that pattern is a good indicator because our investment pace is much -- is as strong as ever in Pennsylvania, is a good indicator of what the future will likely look like. Especially with the fully forecasted rate year convention, it almost sets up a pattern that calls for an annual filing. And that we've only missed that maybe one time in the last decade or may be 1 year out of the last 10 where we didn't file an annual case.  So good indicators, but not precisely front-running any plans at this point. And I think it will be important to see the outcome in this case before we make any of those decisions.\nMichael Weinstein: One last question. On convertibles and hybrids financing going forward, you mentioned that you'd be looking at that opportunistically. At what point do you think you'd be ready to make a decision regarding common equity versus convertibles hybrids?\nJoseph Hamrock: Michael, so as I said earlier, we plan to actually issue a hybrid or convertible in the first half of this year. And so ultimately, as talked about, looking at a structure that provides at least 50% equity content from the rating agencies, and ultimately, depending on the size and equity content of that security, it would then indicate how much equity we need, block equity we would need in 2022 or 2023. But we plan to execute that in the next few months and certainly the first half of the year.\nMichael Weinstein: I see. And then you\u2019d be ready to make a decision about the following year.\nJoseph Hamrock: That's right. Yes, then we'd be able to update.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Harry Pollans with Bank of America.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: It's Julian actually. So I suppose just to clean up on that last question on equity, if I can in brief. The total amounts are not shifting around. This would just be the form. And then more importantly, can you talk and discuss timing to the extent to which you would actually pull forward that block? Is that you would delay the convert in any way or just clarify that a little bit under that scenario, what that looks like? Is that still a \u201821 let\u2019s get everything done kind of issuance?\nJoseph Hamrock: Yes. So plan is, this year, we would do the issuance of the hybrid or the convertible. And then based upon that -- so ultimately, we're looking for -- if you assume $2 billion of renewable investments, 60% equity content, so that's $1.2 billion of equity content. We'll execute the hybrid or convertible this year. And then depending on equity content coming out of that, we\u2019d balance that out with a block later. In that, we do that block in '22 or '23. So we've got some timing and flexibility on that block.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Sorry to clarify that. When you say depending on the equity content, you're not firm on what kind of equity treatment you'll get based on what you're looking at today?\nJoseph Hamrock: Yes. We know we can get at least 50% equity content and the structures we're looking at. We're also trying to achieve more than that. If we can get more than that and then depending on the size or the quantity of that security, that will ultimately then determine what's the balance of equity we\u2019d need.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: And then not significant too much. What's the reasoning for the tweak in the '21 CapEx as well? Just also want to make sure I understand the financing update here.\nJoseph Hamrock: No. It's not really a tweak in our CapEx. At Investor Day, we gave a wide range to incorporate the 4 years of investment. And so it's consistent with our plan to kind of tighten up for the prompt year, and the CapEx that we have guided for this year is aligned with our long-term guidance. So no changes.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Excellent. Sorry, 1 last 1 that's not a clarification if I can. There are a lot of legislative bills out there this session. There's just a lot going on in Indiana. Anything that we should be paying attention to that could impact, broadly speaking, your renewable efforts and/or your LDC? I'm just trying to make sure we're not missing anything here across a lot of different developments that I'm sure you guys are tracking closer than we are.\nJoseph Hamrock: Yes, Julien. And we're, as you would expect, engaged and closely following all of that. And I would describe the full set of initiatives as essentially trying to create or level the playing field for renewable investment and to make sure that there's a clear playing field. All of that to us is neutral to positive for our plan. We don't see anything that's of concern. Certainly, we'll keep an eye up for that. And then I would note, part of the puzzle that's playing out is for the natural gas side of the business for the State to prohibit local ordinances that might restrict the use of natural gas. And I think that's a key indicator of policy support for the whole business in Indiana.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Richard Sunderland with JPMorgan Securities.\nRichard Sunderland: Just maybe at a high level thinking about the first heating season under COVID conditions. Curious how you've been managing through that, particularly on the gas side and any takeaways you can provide at this point on realized impact versus that base scenario of $0.05 baked into '21?\nJoseph Hamrock: Yes. Thanks, Richard. And I'll kick that off. And I'll note that front and center for us has been and will always be the health, safety and wellness of our employees and safety for our customers, and that's a key driver of the whole outlook for COVID. Regarding the economic recovery -- and you can see from our results, reason to be what I'd call, cautiously optimistic though there's other impacts to consider, including ongoing expenses, that could relate to adjustments to work protocols, other revenue collections, regulatory treatment and potential after-shocks in the economy. And all of those are hard to predict, but certainly something we should all be attentive to.  All considered to the spirit of your question and recognizing that we're deep in the first quarter right now and clearly deep in the heating season with the weather we're experiencing across the country, our guidance reaffirmation today reflects our base case for 2021 and also our long-term growth rate. From a margin standpoint, the residential usage has remained strong. It really came out of the block strong at the beginning of the COVID pandemic. And we've seen that trend continue into 2021. Commercial usage has been consistently down and continues to be a profile that we're going to closely monitor and perhaps is the most strong indicator of recovery across our territories.  Industrial usage, admittedly not all perfectly correlated with COVID factors. There's a number of things that can drive industrial usage. So it's hard to say deterministically that it's all COVID. But that was the most impacted in 2020, though the deep impacts were concentrated in the second quarter, right at the beginning of the pandemic, and we've seen steady recovery ever since then, and that continues today. But any change in that trend, and that's the aftershock question, could obviously be impactful to our results. So again, all of that kind of adds up to reason to be cautiously optimistic about recovery and the path ahead. And as we noted earlier on the call, we would expect to have more clarity by the time our first quarter call comes around, we'll certainly have the heating season behind us, always a big quarter for us. And that should put us in a position to tighten up our outlook on COVID.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim partners. \nUnidentified Analyst : It's actually [Cody Cork] on for Shar. So maybe starting, you have projects announced for $1.25 billion in CapEx, but you continue to point to a range of remaining investment for solar of $200 million. I'm just wondering why you wouldn't narrow it, why keep that range if you're kind of zeroing in on the remaining projects? And then just wondering when we might get an update on some of those projects?\nJoseph Hamrock: Thanks for the question. Appreciate that. At this point, we continue to track towards that $1.8 billion to $2 billion range. That range was really born out of the RFP process. And as we start to commercialize, we're step closer to the ending projects that we think will fill out the balance of need. We'll be able to tighten that. But at this point, there's no indication that it's any different than $1.8 billion to $2 billion. But we do expect to have additional announcements yet here in first quarter. That relates to that $1.8 billion to $2 billion.\nUnidentified Analyst : And then if I could, just wondering if you've given any more thought to portfolio optimization and how you could use it to offset some of your equity needs related to renewables. Do you think LDC still have some room to rerate on valuation before you can get comfortable with looking at a sale?\nJoseph Hamrock: That's something we certainly continue to watch both our stock price as well as transactions that have been announced as well as are in the market now. Trying to understand how that might provide value above our plan. Again, the financing we've outlined is inclusive -- or that the earnings we've outlined is inclusive of the financing that we've talked about. But we'll continue to look and see if there are strategic options that make sense long-term and would enhance our growth over the '21 to 2024 time period.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar.\nCharles Fishman: I know this is asked, but I'm still confused. On '21 CapEx, the range is about $100 million to $200 million lower than the Analyst Day as well as 3Q. And what is the reason for that if you could maybe talk about that again?\nJoseph Hamrock: Yes. We really just give a wide range to incorporate all of the years, all the individual years in the plan. And certainly, it grows over time because of -- as our capital and our monetization programs grow, but also the renewable investments. And so this first year is really kind of that first year of growth that builds into that long-range or the range that we provided over Investor Day. And again, it's aligned with the guidance that we provided for this year and long-term.  The other way to think about it is, last year, we spent about $1.7 billion. The midpoint of our guidance this year is $2 billion. So it's a significant increase and that's what we've been doing historically is kind of building each year, building our capabilities, making sure we've got construction crews and internal capabilities to execute that program.\nCharles Fishman: Okay. And then moving to Slide 15, you pulled out transmission project as a separate line item, $150 million. And I guess, it sounds like that's associated with 1 of the 4 wind projects. Is that sort of regulated?\nJoseph Hamrock: No. That would be Indiana rate base investments. And it's really to support the shutdown of the Schahfer plants.\nCharles Fishman: Okay. Got it. And then 1 final question. You talked about gas customer gains, I didn't write that down. I think it was 30,000 last year. Just any jurisdiction that you're seeing faster growth than the other ones? Or is it just spread out, is it coming from propane converts, any color you can add?\nJoseph Hamrock: Yes, thanks, Charles. It\u2019s actually strong across the board. We have seen just below 1% at the low end and close to 2% at the high end and Virginia is the strong, the leader in terms of the growth rate of customer additions. Some of that is actual growth in the economy there. New housing starts and new construction, that\u2019s always a differentiator. But across the board, you hit it, you see some propane conversion, some oil conversions at the edges. Now those numbers that we shared net out the Massachusetts contribution. So you should think about that 30,000 across the six states of NiSource now. So pretty balanced, strong 1%-ish growth across the board, and our outlook remains strong on that, too. We see continued demand.\nCharles Fishman : And then when there's a new hole being developed in your jurisdictions and gas is available, are you pants down getting the home versus the all-electric?\nJoseph Hamrock: Yes. Typically, that's a strong preference, and it's -- with the builders, in particular, it's typically an established relationship that drives that choice.\nOperator: And there are no further questions in queue at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Joe Hamrock for some closing remarks.\nJoseph Hamrock: Thanks, James. Appreciate it. And thank you all for tuning in today and engaging in the call. We look forward to ongoing engagement and future updates as we continue to execute on our growth plan, and we certainly see lots of opportunity in the quarters ahead for additional updates on the matters that we touched on today. So thank you for joining us today and please stay safe and stay warm.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Joe. As Joe shared earlier, we completed our first 2 wind projects, Rosewater and Jordan Creek on time in December, which is an exciting milestone in executing our generation transition. Rosewater is our joint venture with EDP Renewables North America and our tax equity partner, Wells Fargo. Jordan Creek represents a Power Purchase Agreement or PPA with NextEra Energy Resources. These completed projects are now powering more than 125,000 homes across Indiana with cleaner, more cost-effective energy. Our third wind project Indiana Crossroads remains under construction. This joint venture with EDP is expected to be in service at the end of this year. These renewable projects are consistent with their 2018 integrated resource plan, within which the preferred pathway plans to retire nearly 80% of our remaining coal-fired generation by 2023 and retire all coal generation by 2028 to be replaced by lower cost, reliable and cleaner options. The plan is expected to drive a 90% reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and is expected to save our electric customers an estimated $4 billion over 30 years. As Joe noted earlier, we continue to expect to make $1.8 billion to $2 billion of renewable generation investments through 2023. To date, we have executed agreements representing approximately $1.25 billion of this anticipated investment. Commercial negotiations for additional solar and storage capacity continue to advance. Half of the capacity and the replacement plan is targeted to be owned by joint ventures that will include NIPSCO and tax equity partners as the members. The balance of new capacity is expected to be primarily in the form of PPAs. In November 2020, we filed applications with the IURC for the approval of the Dunns Bridge I and II and Cavalry solar energy centers. These 3 Indiana projects or build transfer agreements with NextEra Energy Resources and represent a combined capital investment of approximately $850 million for NIPSCO. These projects are expected to be placed into service across 2022 and 2023.  NextEra will construct the solar and storage facilities, and we plan to form joint ventures with tax equity investors to own, operate and maintain these assets. An IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2021. We continue to fill out the balance of our capacity. In January, the IURC approved our Brickyard and Greensboro solar and storage PPAs. NextEra Energy Resources will develop these projects, which are expected to be completed in mid-2023. And in December 2020, NIPSCO announced a long-term PPA with the clean energy infrastructure business of Capital Dynamics to develop Gibson Solar, a 280-megawatt solar project in Gibson County, Indiana. NIPSCO filed an application with the IURC for approval of this project in January 2021. Construction is expected to begin in 2022 with commercial operations to begin in 2023. Also in December of 2020, NIPSCO filed an application with the IURC for approval of the Green River Solar PPA.  Advanced negotiations continue for additional build transfer agreements to fill out the remainder of our capacity needs. We expect those negotiations to be completed in the first half of 2021 and the necessary regulatory filings coming shortly thereafter. In the fourth quarter of 2021, NIPSCO will be submitting an integrated resource plan for the IURC that will continue to outline its long-term generation plans, including the planned retirement of Michigan City Generating Station. The preferred plan that emerges from the 2021 IRP could create additional capital investment opportunities. Before we move on from our electric story, I would like to provide a quick update on units 14 and 15 at our Schahfer Generating Station. As you know, all 4 coal units at Schahfer are planned to retire by May 2023, as outlined in the 2018 IRP. As we continue to evaluate the economics for that generating fleet and the ongoing costs and investments required to keep the coal units operational, we determined that the right path forward for us is to initiate the retirement of 2 of the 4 coal units at Schahfer. Units 14 and 15 will retire by the end of 2021, which is the most economic decision for our customers.  NIPSCO's remaining fleet and new renewable capacity and secured capacity purchases will continue to reliably serve the energy needs to our customers. To be clear, our earnings guidance is not impacted by this decision. We are excited about the significant progress in executing the plan we identified in our 2018 IRP and further detailed at our Investor Day, and we look forward to more projects and updates to come in future quarters. Now, I will turn the call back over to Joe."

            "name": "Donald Brown",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Looking at our 2020 results on Slide 4, we had non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $508 million or $1.32 per share compared to non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $495 million or $1.32 per share in 2019. I would note the loss of fourth quarter earnings related to the sale of CMA reduced 2020 non-GAAP earnings per share by approximately $0.05.  Looking more closely at our segment 12-month non-GAAP results on Slide 5, operating earnings were up about $36 million for the year in our gas segment. Operating revenues, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were down about $19 million due to the sale of CMA, partially offset by infrastructure program revenues and increased customer growth. Operating expenses, also net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were down about $55 million, mostly due to the CMA sale and lower employee and administrative expenses, partially offset by increased COVID-related costs. In our electric segment, 12-month non-GAAP operating earnings were down by nearly $40 million, driven primarily by an approximately $16 million increase in operating revenues, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses due to new rates from the recent rate case, partially offset by COVID-related impacts from customer usage, late payment fees and reconnection fees. Operating expenses, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were up by approximately $55 million due to the increased depreciation expenses. Turning to Slide 6, we provide additional details about the financial impact of COVID-19. As you can see, we're seeing lower commercial and industrial sales, which are partially offset by increased residential sales. We're also seeing reduced late payment and reconnection fees as well as higher bad debt and other expenses. The total growth impact of COVID-19 in 2020 was approximately $0.10 per share. This impact was partially offset by non-safety-related cost management and regulatory solutions, bringing the net 2020 impact of COVID-19 to approximately $0.05 per share. Consistent with our base case, we currently expect an additional COVID impact in 2021 of approximately $0.05 per share which is factored into our 2021 non-GAAP EPS guidance range. While we're monitoring the pandemic closely, to date, it has not presented significant barriers to our safety and infrastructure modernization programs or our long-term growth.  As Joe mentioned, we are reaffirming both our 2021 earnings guidance and the guidance for long-term CapEx and EPS CAGR that we outlined it in deck today. Now turning to Slide 7, I like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of December 31 was about $9.7 billion of which about $9.1 billion was long-term debt. Following the successful liability management transaction in the third quarter, the weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 15 years, and our weighted average interest rate was approximately 3.7%. At the end of the fourth quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.7 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility, and other accounts receivable securitization programs. Our credit rating from all three major rating agencies are investment grade and we remain committed to maintaining our current investment grade ratings. Taken together, this represents a solid financial foundation to support our long-term safety and infrastructure investments.  Let's take a quick look at Slide 9, which highlights our current financing plan. I would just note that we continue to look at ways to optimize the financing of our growth strategy. We are currently evaluating scenarios, utilizing hybrids and/or convertibles that get 50% or more equity credit with the rating agencies and could minimize the need for block equity offering in 2022 or 2023. We would anticipate a hybrid or convertible offering sometime in the first half of 2021. I would also note that next week, we plan to file a new at the market or ATM equity program to satisfy our ATM needs for the next 3 years. Just to remind everyone, our guidance is inclusive of this financing plan. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Joe, who will provide some infrastructure investment and regulatory updates for our gas and electric businesses."

            "name": "Joseph Hamrock",
            "content": "Thanks, Randy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Hopefully, you've all had a chance to read our fourth quarter and full year earnings release, which we issued earlier today. 2020 was a year like no other. Despite the challenges of historic global pandemic, the NiSource team remained focused on our core mission of providing safe, reliable energy to our customers and the communities we serve, while at the same time, enhancing our position to execute on significant long-term growth opportunities.  Our 2020 financial and operational results reflect the resiliency of our business, and continued execution of our safety and asset modernization programs, as well as our transition away from coal generation. In Indiana, we completed two wind power projects in December. And we continue to expect that our infrastructure and generation investments will drive by compound annual growth of 7% to 9% in net operating earnings per share from 2021 through 2024, while reducing greenhouse gas emission 90% by 2030. Let's turn now to Slide 3 and take a closer look at our key takeaways. In 2020, we delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of $1.32 per share as our cost management and regulatory mitigation efforts reduced the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to some I've mentioned already, we achieved a number of other key milestones in 2020. We invested $1.7 billion in our gas and electric utilities, primarily on safety and asset modernization, which remains a top priority. We advanced and matured our Safety Management System and safety enhancement initiatives and 70% of our low-pressure systems are now protected with automatic shutoff devices and remote monitoring. We launched our transformative NiSource Next initiative to support our safety initiatives, build organizational capabilities and enhance our efficiency. We sold the Columbia Gas of Massachusetts business, completing the transaction in 8 months. We lowered the weighted average interest rate on our long-term debt by 60 basis points and enhanced our liquidity through the COVID-19 pandemic, and we continue to see strong demand for natural gas, experiencing a net gain of more than 30,000 gas customers across our 6 state footprint. We are today reaffirming our 2021 non-GAAP net operating earnings guidance of $1.28 to $1.36 per share. Consistent with the long-term growth plan we provided at Investor Day, we expect to make $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion in annual growth, safety and asset modernization investments from 2021 through 2024, and $1.8 billion to $2 billion in renewable generation investments through 2023. I will note that we do expect an order in our Pennsylvania base rate case in the first quarter, with rates that would be retroactive to January 23. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald, who will discuss our 2020 financial performance in more detail. Thank you, Donald. Now, let's take a look at some NiSource utilities highlights for the fourth quarter and early first quarter of 2021, starting with our gas operations on Slide 10. In Pennsylvania, our base rate case remains pending before the Public Utility Commission. The application originally filed in April 2020 was modified in December and now seeks an annual revenue increase of $76.8 million to invest in, modernize and upgrade our existing natural gas distribution system as well as maintain the continued safety of the system. An order is expected in the first quarter of 2021 with new rates expected to become effective retroactive to January 23, 2021. In Maryland, the Public Service Commission approved the settlement in our base rate request in November 2020. The approved settlement supports further upgrading and replacement of our pipelines and is expected to increase annual revenue by $3.3 million, including $1.3 million of current tracker revenue. New rates became effective in December 2020. In Indiana, our latest tracker update was approved in December in our long-term gas infrastructure modernization program. The update covers $26 million in incremental capital invested under the program between January and June of 2020, and new rates became effective in January of 2021. The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission in 2020 approved a 6-year extension of the program, including nearly $950 million in planned capital investments through 2025 to be recovered through semiannual adjustments to the existing gas Transmission, Distribution and Storage Improvement Charge or TDSIC tracker. Now let's look at our electric operations on Slide 11. In January, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission approved the latest tracker update request in our long-term electric infrastructure modernization plan. The approved electric TDSIC tracker update covers more than $122 million in incremental capital investments made between July 2019 and June 2020, and new rates became effective this month. This well-established program includes enhancements to our electric transmission and distribution system designed to further enhance safety and reliability. The program originally approved by the IURC in 2016 includes approximately $1.2 billion in electric infrastructure investments expected to be made through 2022. And now, I'll ask Shawn Anderson to provide an update about our renewable generation projects. Thank you, Shawn. Let's turn back to our foundational commitment, safety. As I noted earlier, our safety enhancement initiatives advanced and matured in 2020. Our implementation of API's Safety Management System or SMS, transitioned from an accelerated project launch to an established operating model within NiSource, and we expanded the implementation to our electric business. With the ongoing support and advice from the independent quality review board, we are continuing to mature our SMS processes, capabilities and talent and we're collaborating with our industry peers to enhance safety and reduce operational risk.  We had a number of safety milestones in 2020 that are worth calling out. We launched mobile gas leak detection pilot project and implemented a service line mapping strategy to enhance records quality across our footprint. We added special clearance processes and other layers of protection to critical field operations activities. Our gas meter shops and our fabrication facility earned ISO 9001 certification, a strong first step in a continuing quality effort. And the final safety recommendation around emergency preparedness and response was closed by the National Transportation Safety Board as we continue to mature our emergency response processes. As noted, SMS has become our core operating model, built on our culture of empowering everyone to report and identify risk, including the authority to stop work whenever necessary, enhancing process safety with layers of protection and building accountability for effective asset management to reduce risk. You'll see additional enhancements to our safety plan in 2021.  I am also pleased to note some recognition that NiSource received in mid-November when we were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index for the seventh consecutive year. NiSource is 1 of 7 U.S. utilities on the 2020 list. The ranking is based on environmental, social and governance criteria and reflects our progress on our sustainability strategy which includes aggressive greenhouse gas reductions, safety enhancements and executing against $40 billion of long-term safety, asset modernization and renewable energy investment opportunities. We're honored to once again be included on this international benchmark for sustainable business practices, which recognizes the comprehensive focus on ESG principles at the core of how we run our business.  Before turning to the Q&A portion of today's call, I will share and reiterate a few key takeaways. Our 2020 financial and operational results reflect the resiliency of our business and our team as we executed on our safety and asset modernization programs. Our electric generation transition strategy reliably served customers through the historic COVID pandemic and took steps to reposition the company to execute on significant long-term growth opportunities. We continue to expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings per share in the range of $1.28 to $1.36 in 2021. Our long-term growth commitments remain in place. These include $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion in annual growth, safety and modernization investments from 2021 through 2024, plus $1.8 billion to $2 billion in renewable generation investments across 2022 and 2023. And compound annual earnings per share growth of 7% to 9% from 2021 through 2024, with near-term growth of 5% to 7% from 2021 to 2023.  Our electric generation strategy continues to advance with our first 2 wind projects complete and numerous other renewable projects in development.  Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. We're now ready to take your questions. That's correct. We'll go through that process starting here in the next quarter or so. Yes. I mean, in essence, we'll follow a process and a pattern that looks a lot like what we went through in 2018. We'll kick off the process with stakeholder engagement relatively soon. And then in the middle of the summer after we develop scenarios is when you'd likely see -- to the extent it helps provide insight at any RFPs that might be included. Keep in mind that the retirement schedule for the Michigan City plant drives the capacity need for the future, because we've pretty much got the 2023 capacity replacement plan set. And so RFPs may or may not be as valuable looking out that far from a 2021 vantage point. So we'll take all of that under consideration.  The 1 thing I'd say though, Mike, and I think this is obvious to all of us with the current events that are going on across the industry right now, it just starkly demonstrates that reliability and capacity are essential, and the integrated resource planning process itself is critically important. So that's why our approach really starts with reliability and balances all the other attributes against that fundamental requirement. So this experience that we're seeing now will be -- should provide critical learning for us as we go through the next round of the IRP. And so I don't want to predict with a high degree of precision even the process at this point because there's a lot to learn from what's happening in the markets. You're specifically asking about Pennsylvania. Yes, I'm not going to speculate about an outlook. We should see a commission decision soon enough, and we'll certainly keep you and all of our stakeholders updated as that plays out. And I won't front run any future filings, but if you look at the pace of investment in Pennsylvania, and the historic cycle there, we've had over about a decade, 8 rate cases settled with the stakeholders in Pennsylvania and well supported by the commission. So I think that track record and that pattern is a good indicator because our investment pace is much -- is as strong as ever in Pennsylvania, is a good indicator of what the future will likely look like. Especially with the fully forecasted rate year convention, it almost sets up a pattern that calls for an annual filing. And that we've only missed that maybe one time in the last decade or may be 1 year out of the last 10 where we didn't file an annual case.  So good indicators, but not precisely front-running any plans at this point. And I think it will be important to see the outcome in this case before we make any of those decisions. Michael, so as I said earlier, we plan to actually issue a hybrid or convertible in the first half of this year. And so ultimately, as talked about, looking at a structure that provides at least 50% equity content from the rating agencies, and ultimately, depending on the size and equity content of that security, it would then indicate how much equity we need, block equity we would need in 2022 or 2023. But we plan to execute that in the next few months and certainly the first half of the year. That's right. Yes, then we'd be able to update. Yes. So plan is, this year, we would do the issuance of the hybrid or the convertible. And then based upon that -- so ultimately, we're looking for -- if you assume $2 billion of renewable investments, 60% equity content, so that's $1.2 billion of equity content. We'll execute the hybrid or convertible this year. And then depending on equity content coming out of that, we'd balance that out with a block later. In that, we do that block in '22 or '23. So we've got some timing and flexibility on that block. Yes. We know we can get at least 50% equity content and the structures we're looking at. We're also trying to achieve more than that. If we can get more than that and then depending on the size or the quantity of that security, that will ultimately then determine what's the balance of equity we'd need. No. It's not really a tweak in our CapEx. At Investor Day, we gave a wide range to incorporate the 4 years of investment. And so it's consistent with our plan to kind of tighten up for the prompt year, and the CapEx that we have guided for this year is aligned with our long-term guidance. So no changes. Yes, Julien. And we're, as you would expect, engaged and closely following all of that. And I would describe the full set of initiatives as essentially trying to create or level the playing field for renewable investment and to make sure that there's a clear playing field. All of that to us is neutral to positive for our plan. We don't see anything that's of concern. Certainly, we'll keep an eye up for that. And then I would note, part of the puzzle that's playing out is for the natural gas side of the business for the State to prohibit local ordinances that might restrict the use of natural gas. And I think that's a key indicator of policy support for the whole business in Indiana. Yes. Thanks, Richard. And I'll kick that off. And I'll note that front and center for us has been and will always be the health, safety and wellness of our employees and safety for our customers, and that's a key driver of the whole outlook for COVID. Regarding the economic recovery -- and you can see from our results, reason to be what I'd call, cautiously optimistic though there's other impacts to consider, including ongoing expenses, that could relate to adjustments to work protocols, other revenue collections, regulatory treatment and potential after-shocks in the economy. And all of those are hard to predict, but certainly something we should all be attentive to.  All considered to the spirit of your question and recognizing that we're deep in the first quarter right now and clearly deep in the heating season with the weather we're experiencing across the country, our guidance reaffirmation today reflects our base case for 2021 and also our long-term growth rate. From a margin standpoint, the residential usage has remained strong. It really came out of the block strong at the beginning of the COVID pandemic. And we've seen that trend continue into 2021. Commercial usage has been consistently down and continues to be a profile that we're going to closely monitor and perhaps is the most strong indicator of recovery across our territories.  Industrial usage, admittedly not all perfectly correlated with COVID factors. There's a number of things that can drive industrial usage. So it's hard to say deterministically that it's all COVID. But that was the most impacted in 2020, though the deep impacts were concentrated in the second quarter, right at the beginning of the pandemic, and we've seen steady recovery ever since then, and that continues today. But any change in that trend, and that's the aftershock question, could obviously be impactful to our results. So again, all of that kind of adds up to reason to be cautiously optimistic about recovery and the path ahead. And as we noted earlier on the call, we would expect to have more clarity by the time our first quarter call comes around, we'll certainly have the heating season behind us, always a big quarter for us. And that should put us in a position to tighten up our outlook on COVID. Thanks for the question. Appreciate that. At this point, we continue to track towards that $1.8 billion to $2 billion range. That range was really born out of the RFP process. And as we start to commercialize, we're step closer to the ending projects that we think will fill out the balance of need. We'll be able to tighten that. But at this point, there's no indication that it's any different than $1.8 billion to $2 billion. But we do expect to have additional announcements yet here in first quarter. That relates to that $1.8 billion to $2 billion. That's something we certainly continue to watch both our stock price as well as transactions that have been announced as well as are in the market now. Trying to understand how that might provide value above our plan. Again, the financing we've outlined is inclusive -- or that the earnings we've outlined is inclusive of the financing that we've talked about. But we'll continue to look and see if there are strategic options that make sense long-term and would enhance our growth over the '21 to 2024 time period. Yes. We really just give a wide range to incorporate all of the years, all the individual years in the plan. And certainly, it grows over time because of -- as our capital and our monetization programs grow, but also the renewable investments. And so this first year is really kind of that first year of growth that builds into that long-range or the range that we provided over Investor Day. And again, it's aligned with the guidance that we provided for this year and long-term.  The other way to think about it is, last year, we spent about $1.7 billion. The midpoint of our guidance this year is $2 billion. So it's a significant increase and that's what we've been doing historically is kind of building each year, building our capabilities, making sure we've got construction crews and internal capabilities to execute that program. No. That would be Indiana rate base investments. And it's really to support the shutdown of the Schahfer plants. Yes, thanks, Charles. It's actually strong across the board. We have seen just below 1% at the low end and close to 2% at the high end and Virginia is the strong, the leader in terms of the growth rate of customer additions. Some of that is actual growth in the economy there. New housing starts and new construction, that's always a differentiator. But across the board, you hit it, you see some propane conversion, some oil conversions at the edges. Now those numbers that we shared net out the Massachusetts contribution. So you should think about that 30,000 across the six states of NiSource now. So pretty balanced, strong 1%-ish growth across the board, and our outlook remains strong on that, too. We see continued demand. Yes. Typically, that's a strong preference, and it's -- with the builders, in particular, it's typically an established relationship that drives that choice. Thanks, James. Appreciate it. And thank you all for tuning in today and engaging in the call. We look forward to ongoing engagement and future updates as we continue to execute on our growth plan, and we certainly see lots of opportunity in the quarters ahead for additional updates on the matters that we touched on today. So thank you for joining us today and please stay safe and stay warm."

I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Mr. Nick Drew, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nNick Drew: Thanks, Amy. Good morning, and welcome to the NiSource Third Quarter 2020 Investor Call. Joining me today are Joe Hamrock, our Chief Executive Officer; Donald Brown, our Chief Financial Officer; Shawn Anderson, our Chief Strategy and Risk Officer; and Randy Hulen, our Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer.  The purpose of this presentation is to review NiSource's financial performance for the third quarter of 2020, as well as provide an update on our operations, growth drivers and financing plans. Following our prepared remarks, we'll open the call to your questions. Slides for today's call are available on nisource.com.  Before turning the call over to Joe, Donald, Shawn and Randy, just a quick reminder. Some of the statements made during this presentation will be forward-looking. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. Information concerning such risks and uncertainties is included in the MD&A and Risk Factors sections of our periodic SEC filings.

For additional information on the most directly comparable GAAP measure and a reconciliation of these measures, please refer to the supplemental slides and segment information, including our full financial schedules available at nisource.com.  With all of that out of the way, I'd now like to turn the call over to Joe.\nJoseph Hamrock: Thanks, Nick. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Hopefully, you've all had a chance to read our third quarter earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning. With 2020 in its home stretch, NiSource continues to execute on a path to deliver premium value from our 100% regulated electric and gas utility platform. Our teams are focused on continued execution of our safety and asset modernization programs and our transition to renewable energy in our electric business. These investments are expected to drive compound annual growth of 7% to 9% in net operating earnings per share from 2021 through 2024, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions 90% by 2030. Sustaining this level of execution, while maintaining safe, reliable energy service through the COVID-19 pandemic is a testament to the thousands of dedicated employees throughout NiSource. With the announcement of additional solar and storage energy projects in Indiana, and the closing of the sale of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts last month, we have strengthened our foundation for future growth.  So let's dive into the update, starting on Slide 3. We delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of $0.09 per share in the third quarter compared to $0 in the same quarter a year ago. Our continued cost management and regulatory mitigation efforts are reducing the financial impacts of COVID-19, which we continue to monitor closely. Our transformational NiSource Next initiative is well underway and designed to enhance organizational capabilities, drive efficiencies and maintain affordable service for our customers. Despite challenges related to the pandemic, we continue to expect to make $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in capital investments in 2020 as our safety and asset modernization investments remain among our top priorities.  We advanced our renewable generation strategy last month by reaching build transfer agreements with NextEra for 3 Indiana solar and storage projects, representing an $850 million capital investment for NIPSCO. On the regulatory front, we received approval of the sale of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts assets to Eversource, and the transaction closed on October 9. We also reached a settlement in our gas base rate case in Maryland and received approval of our latest capital expenditure program tracker update in Ohio. We are also today reaffirming non-GAAP net operating earnings per share guidance for 2021 in the range of $1.28 to $1.36, which includes an expected COVID impact of $0.05, and we are reaffirming the financial guidance that we provided at our Investor Day on September 29. These include investments of $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion per year in safety, modernization and growth from 2021 through 2024, $1.8 billion to $2 billion in incremental renewable generation investment opportunities across 2022 and 2023, and compound annual earnings per share growth of 7% to 9% from 2021 through 2024, with 5% to 7% annual growth in the near term.  Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald, who will discuss our third quarter financial performance in more detail.\nDonald Brown: Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Looking at our third quarter results from Slide 4, we had non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $36 million or $0.09 per share, compared to a net loss operating loss of nearly $2 million or $0.00 per share in 2019. The year-over-year increase was driven primarily by increased gas segment results with relatively flat electric results in the quarter. For the year, our net operating earnings are up about $52 million or $0.11 per share compared to the same period of 2019.  Looking more closely at our segment results on Slide 5, operating earnings were up about $36 million for the quarter in our gas segment, driven primarily by infrastructure investment revenue and cost management measures put in place to offset COVID 19 impact. In our electric segment, operating earnings were down by $2.5 million, driven primarily by slightly higher revenues, excluding the cost of sales, with COVID-driven decreases in commercial and industrial sales, offset by increased residential sales. This net increase in revenue was offset by higher depreciation as a result of the accelerated depreciation of our coal-fired generation assets.  Turning to Slide 6. We provide additional details about the financial impact of COVID-19. As you can see, we're seeing lower commercial and industrial sales, which are partially offset by increased residential sales. We're also seeing reduced late payment and reconnection fees as well as higher bad debt and other expenses. The total impact of COVID-19 in the third quarter was approximately $0.01 per share and $0.07 per share year-to-date. As I mentioned, this impact was reduced by non-safety-related expense reductions as well as regulatory mitigation efforts. We currently expect covet to reduce EPS by $0.05 in 2021 under our base case scenario, and that amount has already been factored into our 2021 non-GAAP EPS guidance range.  While we're monitoring the pandemic closely, to date, it has not presented significant barriers to our safety and infrastructure modernization programs or our long-term growth. As Joe mentioned earlier, we continue to expect to invest $1.70 to $1.8 billion of capital in 2020. We are reaffirming the guidance for long-term CapEx and EPS CAGR guidance that we outlined at Investor Day.  Now turning to Slide 7, I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of September 30 was about $10.6 billion, of which about $9.1 billion was long-term debt. The weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 15 years and weighted average interest rate was approximately 3.68%. I will note that the liability management transaction that we completed during the quarter lowered our weighted average interest rate by more than 60 basis points and removed the need for any significant long-term debt refinancing through 2024. As Joe mentioned earlier, we closed on the sale of our Columbia Gas of Massachusetts assets on October 9. This produced net proceeds of $1.1 billion, which we used to pay down our term loan and other short-term debt in October. At the end of the third quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.6 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization program. Our credit ratings from all 3 major rating agencies are investment grade, and we're committed to maintaining our current investment-grade ratings. Taken together, this represents a solid financial foundation to support our long-term safety and infrastructure investments.  Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Joe, who will provide some infrastructure investment and regulatory updates from our gas and electric businesses.\nJoseph Hamrock: Thank you, Donald. Now let's look at some NiSource utilities highlights for the third quarter and early fourth quarter of 2020, starting with our gas operations on Slide 9. In Pennsylvania, our base rate case remains pending before the Public Utility Commission. The application filed in April seeks an annual revenue increase of $100.4 million to invest in, modernize and upgrade our existing natural gas distribution system as well as maintain the continued safety of the system. An order is expected in the first quarter of 2021, with new rates expected to become effective in January 2021.  In Maryland, we reached settlement with parties to the base rate case request we filed in May. The settlement supports further upgrading and replacement of our pipelines and would result in an annual revenue increase of $3.3 million, including $1.3 million of current tracker revenue, if approved as filed. A Maryland Public Service Commission order is expected in November 2020, with new rates effective in December 2020.  In Ohio, the Public Utilities Commission approved our annual application for adjustment to our capital expenditure program rider, and new rates went into effect in September 2020. The order allows us to begin recovery of approximately $185 million in capital invested under the CEP in 2019. In Indiana, our latest tracker update is pending in our long-term gas infrastructure modernization program. The application covers $26 million in incremental capital invested under the program between January and June 2020. Earlier in the quarter, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission approved a 6-year extension of the program, including nearly $950 million in planned capital investments through 2025 to be recovered through semiannual adjustments to the existing transmission, distribution and storage improvement charge or TDSIC tracker.  Now let's look at our electric operations on Slide 10. Shawn will update you in a moment on our progress transitioning our generation portfolio. Before then, I'll note that we continue to execute on our long-term electric infrastructure modernization plan in Indiana. This well-established program includes enhancements to our electric transmission and distribution system designed to further enhance safety and reliability. The program, originally approved by the IURC in 2016, includes approximately $1.2 billion in electric infrastructure investments expected to be made through 2022. In September, we filed our latest electric TDSIC tracker update request, covering more than $122 million in incremental capital investments made between July 2019 and June 2020. We expect an IURC order in January 2021, with new rates effective in February 2021.  And now I'll ask Shawn to talk about our renewable generation projects.\nShawn Anderson: Thank you, Joe. As Joe shared earlier, within the last month, we announced build transfer agreements with NextEra Energy Resources on 3 Indiana solar projects, representing a capital investment of approximately $850 million for NIPSCO. The Dunns Bridge I and II and Cavalry Solar Energy Centers are expected to be under construction by 2022 and placed into service across 2022 and 2023. NextEra will construct the solar and storage facilities, and we plan to form joint ventures with unrelated financial partners to own, operate and maintain some facets of these assets. We will request the addition of these new projects to our supply portfolio in filings with the IURC by the end of this year.  Construction is already underway on IURC approved wind projects, representing about $400 million in capital investment. Rosewater wind, a joint venture with EDP renewables North America, and Wells Fargo as the tax equity partner, is on track to be placed into service by the end of this year, and construction has begun on Indiana Crossroads, also a joint venture project with EDP and, is expected to be in service by the end of 2021. We continue to expect $1.8 billion to $2 billion of renewable generation investments through 2023. Inclusive of the aforementioned joint venture projects, we currently have executed agreements, representing approximately $1.25 billion of this anticipated investment and are well underway in negotiating additional agreements which we expect will complete the balance of need for replacement capacity at an anticipated $550 million to $750 million in capital investments.  We are also well underway to complete purchase power agreements to fill out the balance of our capacity needs. Our Jordan Creek project is IURC-approved, under construction and is expected to be in service by the end of this year. Our Brickyard and Greensboro Solar and storage PPAs are pending before the IURC. NextEra Energy Resources will develop Brickyard and Greensboro which are expected in-service in mid-2023.  In addition to the remaining JVs under negotiation, we are engaged in additional solar and wind PPA negotiations, all of which are anticipated to go into service in 2022 and 2023. These renewable projects are consistent with our 2018 integrated resource plan, which provides a preferred pathway to retire nearly 80% of our remaining coal-fired generation by 2023 and retire all coal generation by 2028 to be replaced by low-cost, reliable and cleaner options. The plan is designed to drive a 90% reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and is expected to save our electric customers an estimated $4 billion over 30 years.  Now I will turn the call back over to Joe.\nJoseph Hamrock: Thank you, Shawn. As you can see from what we've covered today, we're continuing to execute on our plan to deliver long-term value for all of our stakeholders. I want to touch on our foundational commitment to safety.  We're continuing to make progress on our safety initiatives across our gas and electric businesses, including our accelerated safety management system, or SMS implementation, which follows American Petroleum Institute's RP 1173 and provides a comprehensive approach to managing safety, emphasizing continual assessment and improvement as well as proactively identifying and mitigating potential risks. We can highlight a few areas of accomplishment thus far in 2020, including continued deployment of our upgraded service line maps and records, with significant progress made in Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Virginia, and we're on track for achieving this milestone in all of our states by the end of the year. We received regulatory approval in Ohio for a pilot of advanced mobile leak detection technology to perform quality assurance in our construction work. We have also continued to install automatic shutoff devices and enhanced monitoring on our low-pressure gas distribution systems, with work completed in Maryland, Kentucky and Virginia.  If you missed Investor Day, I encourage you to visit nisource.com to view the safety video we introduced, which brings our SMS work to life and which provides specific examples of these and other steps we're taking to help ensure safety for our customers, employees, business partners and the public.  I'm also pleased to note that our work to enhance customer service and make it easier to do business with us online has received national recognition. The American Business Awards recognized NiSource with its Gold Stevie Award for the work we did in 2019 to combine our utility website into a seamless customer experience, including a customer portal with bill payment and account management services. Our customer experience team is hard at work on other benefits that we hope to bring customers in the future, including digital service requests, high usage alerts, outage map improvements and enhanced views of their energy usage history. Our customers should expect more from us in the future and know that we are aiming higher to meet their needs.  Before opening the call to your questions, I'll share and reiterate a few key takeaways. Our teams are focused on continued execution of our safety and asset modernization programs and our transition to renewable energy in our electric business. We continue to expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings per share in the range of $1.28 to $1.36 in 2021, which reflects an expected COVID-19 impact of $0.05. The guidance that we provided at our Investor Day on September 29 remain in place. These include $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion in annual safety, modernization and growth investments from 2021 through 2024, $1.8 billion to $2 billion in incremental renewable generation investments across 2022 and 2023, and compound annual earnings per share growth of 7% to 9% from 2021 through 2024, with near-term growth of 5% to 7% from 2021 to 2023.  Our transformational NiSource Next initiative is well underway to enhance organizational capabilities, drive efficiencies and continued affordability for our customers. This effort is designed to ensure that we are optimally positioned to support both the significant capital investments we will be making in renewable generation and our ongoing asset modernization and safety enhancement investments. With the completion of the sale of our Massachusetts assets, we are firmly focused on the future in delivering premium value from our 100% regulated electric and gas utility platform across our 6 states.  Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. We're now ready to take your questions. Amy?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.\nShahriar Pourreza: So just a couple of quick questions. First, looking at sort of the '21 COVID impact, you obviously reaffirmed the $0.05 impact at the midpoint, but usage and cost mitigation in the third quarter seemed fairly strong. So wondering how you're seeing this trend progressing into 4Q since we're already into it, and also, how you're sort of thinking about '21 progressing? So is there a scenario where we could potentially see an updated guidance in '21 at sort of the year-end results? Or are you looking to sort of maintain the numbers in the near-term to keep some contingency in place, assuming that COVID realities are better than sort of your internal planning assumptions. So how do we sort of think of that?\nDonald Brown: Shar, it's Donald. So if we think about COVID, as you stated, we've got $0.05 in our guidance for 2021, and that's really based upon our scenario, our base case scenario that we outlined earlier. We're not seeing any changes in that scenario at this point, certainly continuing to see lower revenues from our commercial industrial customers, offset by the residential customers. But we're also seeing some higher bad debt expense. As we look forward into this quarter and into the heating season, it really is the first time that we'll have -- we'll experience COVID in our heating season on our gas business, so we'll continue to monitor that. And as we progressed through this quarter, we'll provide updates if we're seeing anything significant. But I would say we'll continue -- we are continuing to watch the impacts on our customers as we progress through this time.\nShahriar Pourreza: Got it, Donald. So just to reiterate, the few weeks we're in to the fourth quarter, you're not seeing any sort of variation in your current assumptions?\nDonald Brown: No, not at this point.\nJoseph Hamrock: And Shar, it's Joe. One of the things that I would note, Shar -- one of the things I would note is that, as Donald said, we haven't seen heating season yet with the COVID impacts. And keep in mind that on the gas side of the business, most of our residential rate structures are essentially decoupled, so you don't have the same volumetric shift that we've seen on the electric side through the second and third quarters. And so that's all factored into our thinking as we look both at Q4 and Q1, the two big heating season quarters for the gas side of the business.\nShahriar Pourreza: Perfect. And then Joe AND Donald, in your sort of prepared remarks, you obviously highlighted that 8 to 10 renewal projects were sort of in advanced commercial negotiations, you highlighted that. Obviously, 3 were announced very recently with NextEra. Wondering what the timeline looks like for the announcement of the remaining projects, could we get an update on this as soon as EEI?\nShawn Anderson: Good morning, Shar. This is Shawn Anderson. Great to hear from you. Thanks for the question. We continue to advance all facets of our generation transition journey. First and foremost, we're focused on the continued progress of the existing agreements that our teams have worked tirelessly to advance. So specifically, those under construction or in the regulatory process. For example, we look forward to Rosewater and Jordan Creek facilities to become operational and anticipate it even by the end of this year, perhaps.  As it relates to the commercial negotiations underway, we do expect to have additional information by the end of this year and perhaps early into next year as well as we step toward both the commercial agreements and any potential to file through the regulatory process simultaneously. So we're well underway focused on this. Meanwhile, we also expect to file for CPCN approval for the 3 projects just announced, Dunns Bridge I, II and Cavalry by the end of this year. So a lot going on just across the team and across the board, but we're excited for what fourth quarter will bring for us and plan to have more to share very soon.\nShahriar Pourreza: Got it. So just to reiterate, so the 8 to 10 that are currently in advanced negotiations, the next update should be at the year-end results.\nShawn Anderson: Yes, that's correct. And that 8 to 10 was 3 heat-free agreements that we didn't describe, so probably in that 5 to 7 range at this point.\nRandy Hulen: Shar, this is Randy. Just to interject something. You won't necessarily have to wait until the year-end results. We'll be announcing progress as this takes place, and you'll likely see a press release with the next set of projects that we would announce done at the NIPSCO level. So although you'll probably not going to see something new in a week when EEI starts, but as Shawn mentioned, certainly by year-end, a lot of things are in-flight to be announced. So it won't necessarily be February of next year; it will be more likely before the end of this year.\nOperator: Your next question today comes from the line of Andres Sheppard with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nMichael Weinstein: It's Mike Weinstein actually. Just to be clear on the CPCN process, when you get a CPCN for Dunns and Cavalry, that just establishes prudence later for the rate case, right? I mean, it's not a guarantee of anything?\nJoseph Hamrock: That's correct. That's correct.\nMichael Weinstein: Got you. And then the same thing, is this the same exact thing that you're waiting for? Or will -- yes, that you're waiting for on the PPAs for Greensboro and Brickyard?\nShawn Anderson: Yes. Yes. We are still waiting for CPCN approval for those projects and expect those by year-end.\nMichael Weinstein: Got you. Got you. And the block equity needs that you're citing for '22 to '23, just to be clear, that's intended to finance these projects, right? That's why the timing is '22 to '23?\nDonald Brown: That's correct. Yes, we -- as you think about the timing of those investments when we'll need to make the investments on those joint ventures will be in that '22 to '23 time period. And we'll top off the -- a block equity deal off of the whatever remaining equity content we need once we do are hybrid or convertible in 2021.\nMichael Weinstein: Got you. Got you. And then on the rate case issue, Columbia Gas and Maryland, they're expecting to receive something this month? Is that coming up soon or next -- the next week or two or?\nJoseph Hamrock: We have a settlement filed there. Yes, that's correct. We're awaiting an order.\nMichael Weinstein: Awaiting an order. Okay. So is that first half of the month usually, or do you have any idea? This November?\nJoseph Hamrock: Yes.\nOperator: Your next question today comes from the line of Harry Pollans with Bank of America.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: It's Julien here, actually. Just wanted to follow-up real quickly, if you can. A couple nuanced ones and then just following up more conceptually on the strategy side. How do you think about the timing of potential equity or equity-like solutions, especially in '21, relative to any evolution on strategic desires when you think about asset monetization? And where are you in that thought process? Just think about the timing more than anything else here around some of the ideas you floated at the time of your Analyst Day a few weeks back.\nDonald Brown: Julien, we've got flexibility in terms of timing of the -- going out to the markets for the hybrid or convertible next year. So we don't have any specific timing to give you at this point. Certainly will be by the end of 2021, and again, looking for equity content greater than 50% on those securities. As with regards to portfolio optimization, it's certainly analysis that is ongoing as we evaluate the plan. And certainly, as we have more information, if there's something to discuss, we'd provide updates to the investors.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. But basically, if I'm hearing you right, it's just too early to really say one way or another how serious of an intention is for asset sales rather than equity alternatives right now, if I'm hearing you right?\nDonald Brown: It is. We're just continuing to look at full plan and how we finance that. The plan that we outlined on Investor Day is still the same plan from a financing standpoint, and we're continuing to look at what the pricing is of those potential securities. As we look at those securities, we'll evaluate portfolio optimization and see what drives the highest shareholder value.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. And sorry to go back, to come back and clarify Shar's question a little bit if I can. You alluded to it. When you think about this $0.05 COVID impact, how much of that is the gas business and the fact that we haven't been through the winter season yet in the context of an LDC and seeing COVID impacts versus, say, just ongoing impacts from electric year-over-year here?\nDonald Brown: Yes. We probably haven't -- I don't think we've provided that level of detail. Certainly, as we look at the overall impacts to gas electric, it's almost -- I'd look at in terms of the $0.03 gas and $0.02 electric. But ultimately, we'll have to see where that comes out.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. Hence, why we might be a little early here in saying where you are against that range despite some nice tailwinds on COVID year-to-date already?\nDonald Brown: That's right. Yes. I mean, we're really going to have to look at sales as we get into the heating season. And then again, bad debt and see from a customer standpoint, what's the impact there. We do have really good regulatory programs in terms of our bad debt, and that has limited the impact so far this year, but it's something we continue to watch.\nOperator: Your next question today comes from the line of Richard Sunderland with JPMorgan.\nRichard Sunderland: Just following up real quick on the COVID impact question. One, are there any items specifically included or excluded from that $0.05 that you just stated for '21? And then two, any regulatory proceedings that could impact that number.\nDonald Brown: Thanks for the question. Let me start with the regulatory. At this point, we're not pursuing any additional regulatory items that would impact that number. Obviously, if there were any significant changes in our outlook that we could pursue regulatory mechanisms, we would. And so what we've got baked into that $0.05 is based upon the programs that we've got in hand right now. And the second question, I'm sorry, I missed that.\nRichard Sunderland: Just any specific to bid related items that are, I guess, really excluded from that impact? Or just kind of definitionally, anything that might see the COVID impact but wouldn't actually be included in the $0.05?\nDonald Brown: No, for us, we're really tracking sales impacts, bad debt expense, other fees that we might collect from customers and any kind of cleaning and safety expenses. Those are the key categories that we're tracking.\nRichard Sunderland: Great. And then just want to dig into the O&M on this quarter a little bit. The O&M results seem strong. Just curious if you can quantify one-off savings versus savings you expect it to recur in 2021?\nDonald Brown: Yes, I'd say most of the savings that we've had this year are temporary reductions in programs that we've slowed down, non-safety programs that we've reduced or slowed down or stopped this year. And so I'd say they're more temporary expenses. As we look forward, thinking about our NiSource Next program, that program really is driven to -- or designed to drive long-term lower costs through 2024.\nRichard Sunderland: And just to follow-up real quick on that. So the savings from that program really aren't driving results currently and wouldn't necessarily be a significant driver in '21? Is that fair?\nDonald Brown: I'd say the NiSource Next programs aren't driving significant results yet in 2020, but our -- will drive impacts in 2021 and beyond.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.\nDurgesh Chopra: Most of my questions have been answered. Just 1 big picture, can you talk about hydrogen? And a lot of your peers are doing some test projects. Obviously, you have extensive assets and gas LDCs. Maybe just what your view and outlook is there and are you going to be collaborating with others or projects of your own as it relates to blending hydrogen to your our gas system?\nJoseph Hamrock: Thanks, Durgesh. That's something we're closely monitoring. It's not yet part of our investment plan, and our programs, as we've outlined, are driven by safety, asset modernization and growth programs as well as our renewable transition on the electric side. But as we look forward at the role of natural gas in a decarbonizing economy, we certainly see opportunities, both for increased renewable natural gas and for hydrogen blending.  So it's an area we're watching. I would expect to see more information on that, more insight on that in terms of additional investment opportunities in the future. But at this time, it's what I would consider something that we're closely monitoring and very well positioned.  The other thing I'd stress there is one of the things that's always a key factor is just the fundamental economics of supply and demand. And you look at our territories where we sit across shale belts and the low basis cost and low volatility has really not been conducive to introducing much renewables or blending alternative fuels. But if you've kind of flipped that over, it also creates quite a bit of headroom for those kind of policies as we look forward. So we're very bullish on natural gas going forward in both environments, the current environment and a decarbonizing environment, because we have such strong fundamentals to work from across our territories.\nDurgesh Chopra: That's helpful, Joe. Maybe just 1 quick follow-up. On the insurance proceeds in Massachusetts, just any update there, and maybe a timeline that you could -- you know when to expect anything at all?\nShawn Anderson: Yes, thanks. This is Shawn. No update from what's reported, and no anticipated time line. We're still working through that process.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar.\nCharles Fishman: I think all my quarterly questions and guidance questions are answered. Let me -- if I could follow-up on a question I asked at your Investor Day a month ago, and the question was concerning the election prospect, what would happen if we had higher corporate income taxes, what would happen if we saw restrictions on fracking that caused natural gas price to go up. And I got some great answers from Joe, you, and Donald [indiscernible] was really good. But since then, we've had a debate, where one of the candidates has indicated they'd like to eventually get out of gas. And as somebody that owns an electric or a combined utility, electric and gas, in Northern Indiana, a place that is really, really cold at winter time, I mean, I look at the economics of -- I mean, I would assume you're going to see some parts going to work there in full day. And you're basically dealing with electric heating. And even, with all due respect to NIPSCO's low electric rates, electric heating is going to be really expensive.  But my question is, as somebody that owns the electric facility in that area, do you even have the capability to [indiscernible] to deliver the kind of BTUs that are needed on a really cold day with electric in Northern Indiana? Is that even feasible? And I guess my question would be the same for, obviously, you don't own the utilities there or have the generation assets in Ohio and Pennsylvania, but my question would be similar. Would any -- wouldn't we be struggling to deliver the BTUs the gas facility currently provides in really cold weather?\nJoseph Hamrock: Yes, Charles, thanks for your question there and for the follow-up from the Investor Day question because it's an insightful question. If you really look at the energy requirements on a peak day in the winter, especially if you look at our territory, and we're a good test bed for that in NIPSCO because we're on both sides of that, we're both electric and gas. We see the full customer demand profile, both winter peak and summer peak. And it's a very insightful question, even as you perhaps decarbonize the grid and with renewables, and therefore, decarbonize the energy equation, you still have to serve that peak winter day or those peak winter days.  And there are scenarios where you could imagine the gas system as the battery or the storage system for those kind of peak days. But certainly, as it's currently configured, at least across the territories that we're familiar with, electric grid itself, not just the supply component, but the grid itself, may not be well positioned to serve those kind of peak days. So there's a lot of engineering to be done to really see your way through to a world without natural gas. And we think the better question is, how do you position natural gas with renewable natural gas, potential hydrogen blending to decarbonize the gas stream itself as a part of the strategy for meeting customer requirements and providing resilience when you have multiple fuel sources.  So it's a tough -- it's complex engineering question. The economics of it are challenging. And it's an insightful question that you raised. There have been studies about this that actually converted the grid modernization required to a cost per ton of carbon avoided if you did renewable energy and upgraded the grid. And it's a pretty significant way to avoid carbon, a high-cost way to avoid carbon in most of the country, particularly in the areas that we serve.\nCharles Fishman: So I would assume you kind of demonstrate to the regulators as well as the policy people and government how -- the feasibility of this electrification mandates are really just not feasible in your service areas as they are maybe in some milder climate that we're seeing. Is that what's going on?\nJoseph Hamrock: Yes. I think it's not such an absolute thing. I think it's really a more complex picture than that in terms of what's the best role for natural gas, what's the best role for electric renewables, what's the best energy delivery system for the needs of our country. And so I don't think it's a yes, no question for gas. I don't think it's an all electrification solution either. I think we've got to solve this with the resources that are available to us to make sure that we keep our economy viable and rely on the resilience of the supply basin that we have.\nCharles Fishman: Okay. And I asked just because as an analyst, it seems to weigh on not just you, but your company but other utilities in the natural gas distribution, this thought or the discussion of electrification. And I guess I'm just having -- I'm struggling making it work economically or technically in the colder climates.\nJoseph Hamrock: Yes. I agree with you. There's a lot of work to do to help inform that perspective, and we think we're well positioned to help do that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs.\nInsoo Kim: Just one quick question from me. I think you talked about in the slide that you -- in the third quarter, you lowered your average interest rate by over 60 basis points. Is -- how much of that dropped to your bottom line? And was that type of refinancing and lowering of the rate embedded when you gave your longer term guidance?\nDonald Brown: Great question. When you think about that financing, it did lower our long-term financing cost. It is embedded in our guidance for 2021 and beyond. And so it's embedded in there and does provide savings for us going forward.\nInsoo Kim: Got it. And how much of that is more -- you get to keep your savings versus more at the utilities? I just haven't done the search yet.\nDonald Brown: Well, I'd say that's a little bit more complex because we do finance our utility separately than -- when they need cash, that saving doesn't necessarily drop to the utilities. Their financing is done over the course of the year, not necessarily when we actually go out to the external market to finance, and that's why I think -- just think about it from a standpoint of that those dollars and those savings are embedded in overall NiSource guidance and financing plans.\nInsoo Kim: Got it. And I know I said one question, but just one additional one. When we think about your gas utilities, and I think in Virginia and Maryland, the revenue decoupling at the residential side. So when we head into this winter season, any of the benefit that you're seeing on the demand for -- on residential, that will get decoupled away, is your point, then part of that was embedded when you gave your $0.05 of overall impact for 2021?\nDonald Brown: That is correct.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Levi with HITE Hedge.\nAndrew Levi: So just to follow-up on Julien's question, so on your Analyst Day, you definitely threw out and kind of threw out again today, the possibility of selling maybe it's an LDC, selling some assets, whatever it may be. And so I guess my first question just around that is, you wouldn't really bring that up unless it was a real possibility. Is that correct?\nJoseph Hamrock: So our messaging hasn't changed at all from Analyst Day. We've got a track record of evaluating and executing on structural changes when that makes sense, the separation or spin of the pipeline business, the sale of CMA are good examples of that. And our financing plan, as we said on Investor Day, does not assume any portfolio changes, but our point is that we always evaluate the portfolio as a matter of normal course to make sure that we're doing what's in the best long-term interest of shareholders and in the most credit-supportive way. So just want to reiterate, that's the key message, that's what we're conveying.\nAndrew Levi: And what would the process be as far as doing that? Meaning, obviously, you have to hire a banker, do all that type of stuff, but just can you kind of talk at a very high level what you're thinking about specifically on that because it is an event that would be significant to your company, even if it's a small LDC and, obviously, not having to issue as much equity and kind of the puts and takes around that, just be a little bit more specific, please?\nJoseph Hamrock: Yes. We're not going to speculate about particular scenarios or anything like that, but it obviously involves evaluating the impact of the loss of earnings in cash flows as well as any cost to synergies that we'd have to manage as a result of a transaction like that. And all of that, as you all know, can influence credit and the earnings trajectory. So we look at the long-term value drivers for the business, and we look at the contribution of each of our companies toward that. And we look at the alternatives anytime we're looking at equity issuances.\nAndrew Levi: Do you guys think there's a strong market out there for smaller LDC?\nJoseph Hamrock: Don't really know.\nAndrew Levi: Okay. And are any of your subsidiaries not earning their allowed return?\nJoseph Hamrock: Now all of our -- we've got really constructive regulatory support in all of our states. We expect all of our -- and have seen all of our companies earn at their allowed return. Of course, we've had the recent sale of CMA, but that's a different profile.\nAndrew Levi: Right. Right. And last question is, what is the timing of making the decision here? Is it kind of in step with the equity you have to issue next year, or is it hybrid you have to issue next year?\nJoseph Hamrock: No, we haven't set any timetable for that.\nOperator: And this concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I now turn the call back to Mr. Joe Hamrock.\nJoseph Hamrock: Thank you, Amy. And thank you all for joining us today and for your continued interest in and support of NiSource. Please stay safe, and make it a great day.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Joe. As Joe shared earlier, within the last month, we announced build transfer agreements with NextEra Energy Resources on 3 Indiana solar projects, representing a capital investment of approximately $850 million for NIPSCO. The Dunns Bridge I and II and Cavalry Solar Energy Centers are expected to be under construction by 2022 and placed into service across 2022 and 2023. NextEra will construct the solar and storage facilities, and we plan to form joint ventures with unrelated financial partners to own, operate and maintain some facets of these assets. We will request the addition of these new projects to our supply portfolio in filings with the IURC by the end of this year.  Construction is already underway on IURC approved wind projects, representing about $400 million in capital investment. Rosewater wind, a joint venture with EDP renewables North America, and Wells Fargo as the tax equity partner, is on track to be placed into service by the end of this year, and construction has begun on Indiana Crossroads, also a joint venture project with EDP and, is expected to be in service by the end of 2021. We continue to expect $1.8 billion to $2 billion of renewable generation investments through 2023. Inclusive of the aforementioned joint venture projects, we currently have executed agreements, representing approximately $1.25 billion of this anticipated investment and are well underway in negotiating additional agreements which we expect will complete the balance of need for replacement capacity at an anticipated $550 million to $750 million in capital investments.  We are also well underway to complete purchase power agreements to fill out the balance of our capacity needs. Our Jordan Creek project is IURC-approved, under construction and is expected to be in service by the end of this year. Our Brickyard and Greensboro Solar and storage PPAs are pending before the IURC. NextEra Energy Resources will develop Brickyard and Greensboro which are expected in-service in mid-2023.  In addition to the remaining JVs under negotiation, we are engaged in additional solar and wind PPA negotiations, all of which are anticipated to go into service in 2022 and 2023. These renewable projects are consistent with our 2018 integrated resource plan, which provides a preferred pathway to retire nearly 80% of our remaining coal-fired generation by 2023 and retire all coal generation by 2028 to be replaced by low-cost, reliable and cleaner options. The plan is designed to drive a 90% reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and is expected to save our electric customers an estimated $4 billion over 30 years.  Now I will turn the call back over to Joe. Good morning, Shar. This is Shawn Anderson. Great to hear from you. Thanks for the question. We continue to advance all facets of our generation transition journey. First and foremost, we're focused on the continued progress of the existing agreements that our teams have worked tirelessly to advance. So specifically, those under construction or in the regulatory process. For example, we look forward to Rosewater and Jordan Creek facilities to become operational and anticipate it even by the end of this year, perhaps.  As it relates to the commercial negotiations underway, we do expect to have additional information by the end of this year and perhaps early into next year as well as we step toward both the commercial agreements and any potential to file through the regulatory process simultaneously. So we're well underway focused on this. Meanwhile, we also expect to file for CPCN approval for the 3 projects just announced, Dunns Bridge I, II and Cavalry by the end of this year. So a lot going on just across the team and across the board, but we're excited for what fourth quarter will bring for us and plan to have more to share very soon. Yes, that's correct. And that 8 to 10 was 3 heat-free agreements that we didn't describe, so probably in that 5 to 7 range at this point. Yes. Yes. We are still waiting for CPCN approval for those projects and expect those by year-end. Yes, thanks. This is Shawn. No update from what's reported, and no anticipated time line. We're still working through that process."

            "name": "Donald Brown",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Looking at our third quarter results from Slide 4, we had non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $36 million or $0.09 per share, compared to a net loss operating loss of nearly $2 million or $0.00 per share in 2019. The year-over-year increase was driven primarily by increased gas segment results with relatively flat electric results in the quarter. For the year, our net operating earnings are up about $52 million or $0.11 per share compared to the same period of 2019.  Looking more closely at our segment results on Slide 5, operating earnings were up about $36 million for the quarter in our gas segment, driven primarily by infrastructure investment revenue and cost management measures put in place to offset COVID 19 impact. In our electric segment, operating earnings were down by $2.5 million, driven primarily by slightly higher revenues, excluding the cost of sales, with COVID-driven decreases in commercial and industrial sales, offset by increased residential sales. This net increase in revenue was offset by higher depreciation as a result of the accelerated depreciation of our coal-fired generation assets.  Turning to Slide 6. We provide additional details about the financial impact of COVID-19. As you can see, we're seeing lower commercial and industrial sales, which are partially offset by increased residential sales. We're also seeing reduced late payment and reconnection fees as well as higher bad debt and other expenses. The total impact of COVID-19 in the third quarter was approximately $0.01 per share and $0.07 per share year-to-date. As I mentioned, this impact was reduced by non-safety-related expense reductions as well as regulatory mitigation efforts. We currently expect covet to reduce EPS by $0.05 in 2021 under our base case scenario, and that amount has already been factored into our 2021 non-GAAP EPS guidance range.  While we're monitoring the pandemic closely, to date, it has not presented significant barriers to our safety and infrastructure modernization programs or our long-term growth. As Joe mentioned earlier, we continue to expect to invest $1.70 to $1.8 billion of capital in 2020. We are reaffirming the guidance for long-term CapEx and EPS CAGR guidance that we outlined at Investor Day.  Now turning to Slide 7, I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of September 30 was about $10.6 billion, of which about $9.1 billion was long-term debt. The weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 15 years and weighted average interest rate was approximately 3.68%. I will note that the liability management transaction that we completed during the quarter lowered our weighted average interest rate by more than 60 basis points and removed the need for any significant long-term debt refinancing through 2024. As Joe mentioned earlier, we closed on the sale of our Columbia Gas of Massachusetts assets on October 9. This produced net proceeds of $1.1 billion, which we used to pay down our term loan and other short-term debt in October. At the end of the third quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.6 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization program. Our credit ratings from all 3 major rating agencies are investment grade, and we're committed to maintaining our current investment-grade ratings. Taken together, this represents a solid financial foundation to support our long-term safety and infrastructure investments.  Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Joe, who will provide some infrastructure investment and regulatory updates from our gas and electric businesses. Shar, it's Donald. So if we think about COVID, as you stated, we've got $0.05 in our guidance for 2021, and that's really based upon our scenario, our base case scenario that we outlined earlier. We're not seeing any changes in that scenario at this point, certainly continuing to see lower revenues from our commercial industrial customers, offset by the residential customers. But we're also seeing some higher bad debt expense. As we look forward into this quarter and into the heating season, it really is the first time that we'll have -- we'll experience COVID in our heating season on our gas business, so we'll continue to monitor that. And as we progressed through this quarter, we'll provide updates if we're seeing anything significant. But I would say we'll continue -- we are continuing to watch the impacts on our customers as we progress through this time. No, not at this point. That's correct. Yes, we -- as you think about the timing of those investments when we'll need to make the investments on those joint ventures will be in that '22 to '23 time period. And we'll top off the -- a block equity deal off of the whatever remaining equity content we need once we do are hybrid or convertible in 2021. Julien, we've got flexibility in terms of timing of the -- going out to the markets for the hybrid or convertible next year. So we don't have any specific timing to give you at this point. Certainly will be by the end of 2021, and again, looking for equity content greater than 50% on those securities. As with regards to portfolio optimization, it's certainly analysis that is ongoing as we evaluate the plan. And certainly, as we have more information, if there's something to discuss, we'd provide updates to the investors. It is. We're just continuing to look at full plan and how we finance that. The plan that we outlined on Investor Day is still the same plan from a financing standpoint, and we're continuing to look at what the pricing is of those potential securities. As we look at those securities, we'll evaluate portfolio optimization and see what drives the highest shareholder value. Yes. We probably haven't -- I don't think we've provided that level of detail. Certainly, as we look at the overall impacts to gas electric, it's almost -- I'd look at in terms of the $0.03 gas and $0.02 electric. But ultimately, we'll have to see where that comes out. That's right. Yes. I mean, we're really going to have to look at sales as we get into the heating season. And then again, bad debt and see from a customer standpoint, what's the impact there. We do have really good regulatory programs in terms of our bad debt, and that has limited the impact so far this year, but it's something we continue to watch. Thanks for the question. Let me start with the regulatory. At this point, we're not pursuing any additional regulatory items that would impact that number. Obviously, if there were any significant changes in our outlook that we could pursue regulatory mechanisms, we would. And so what we've got baked into that $0.05 is based upon the programs that we've got in hand right now. And the second question, I'm sorry, I missed that. No, for us, we're really tracking sales impacts, bad debt expense, other fees that we might collect from customers and any kind of cleaning and safety expenses. Those are the key categories that we're tracking. Yes, I'd say most of the savings that we've had this year are temporary reductions in programs that we've slowed down, non-safety programs that we've reduced or slowed down or stopped this year. And so I'd say they're more temporary expenses. As we look forward, thinking about our NiSource Next program, that program really is driven to -- or designed to drive long-term lower costs through 2024. I'd say the NiSource Next programs aren't driving significant results yet in 2020, but our -- will drive impacts in 2021 and beyond. Great question. When you think about that financing, it did lower our long-term financing cost. It is embedded in our guidance for 2021 and beyond. And so it's embedded in there and does provide savings for us going forward. Well, I'd say that's a little bit more complex because we do finance our utility separately than -- when they need cash, that saving doesn't necessarily drop to the utilities. Their financing is done over the course of the year, not necessarily when we actually go out to the external market to finance, and that's why I think -- just think about it from a standpoint of that those dollars and those savings are embedded in overall NiSource guidance and financing plans. That is correct."

            "name": "Joseph Hamrock",
            "content": "Thanks, Nick. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Hopefully, you've all had a chance to read our third quarter earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning. With 2020 in its home stretch, NiSource continues to execute on a path to deliver premium value from our 100% regulated electric and gas utility platform. Our teams are focused on continued execution of our safety and asset modernization programs and our transition to renewable energy in our electric business. These investments are expected to drive compound annual growth of 7% to 9% in net operating earnings per share from 2021 through 2024, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions 90% by 2030. Sustaining this level of execution, while maintaining safe, reliable energy service through the COVID-19 pandemic is a testament to the thousands of dedicated employees throughout NiSource. With the announcement of additional solar and storage energy projects in Indiana, and the closing of the sale of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts last month, we have strengthened our foundation for future growth.  So let's dive into the update, starting on Slide 3. We delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of $0.09 per share in the third quarter compared to $0 in the same quarter a year ago. Our continued cost management and regulatory mitigation efforts are reducing the financial impacts of COVID-19, which we continue to monitor closely. Our transformational NiSource Next initiative is well underway and designed to enhance organizational capabilities, drive efficiencies and maintain affordable service for our customers. Despite challenges related to the pandemic, we continue to expect to make $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in capital investments in 2020 as our safety and asset modernization investments remain among our top priorities.  We advanced our renewable generation strategy last month by reaching build transfer agreements with NextEra for 3 Indiana solar and storage projects, representing an $850 million capital investment for NIPSCO. On the regulatory front, we received approval of the sale of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts assets to Eversource, and the transaction closed on October 9. We also reached a settlement in our gas base rate case in Maryland and received approval of our latest capital expenditure program tracker update in Ohio. We are also today reaffirming non-GAAP net operating earnings per share guidance for 2021 in the range of $1.28 to $1.36, which includes an expected COVID impact of $0.05, and we are reaffirming the financial guidance that we provided at our Investor Day on September 29. These include investments of $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion per year in safety, modernization and growth from 2021 through 2024, $1.8 billion to $2 billion in incremental renewable generation investment opportunities across 2022 and 2023, and compound annual earnings per share growth of 7% to 9% from 2021 through 2024, with 5% to 7% annual growth in the near term.  Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald, who will discuss our third quarter financial performance in more detail. Thank you, Donald. Now let's look at some NiSource utilities highlights for the third quarter and early fourth quarter of 2020, starting with our gas operations on Slide 9. In Pennsylvania, our base rate case remains pending before the Public Utility Commission. The application filed in April seeks an annual revenue increase of $100.4 million to invest in, modernize and upgrade our existing natural gas distribution system as well as maintain the continued safety of the system. An order is expected in the first quarter of 2021, with new rates expected to become effective in January 2021.  In Maryland, we reached settlement with parties to the base rate case request we filed in May. The settlement supports further upgrading and replacement of our pipelines and would result in an annual revenue increase of $3.3 million, including $1.3 million of current tracker revenue, if approved as filed. A Maryland Public Service Commission order is expected in November 2020, with new rates effective in December 2020.  In Ohio, the Public Utilities Commission approved our annual application for adjustment to our capital expenditure program rider, and new rates went into effect in September 2020. The order allows us to begin recovery of approximately $185 million in capital invested under the CEP in 2019. In Indiana, our latest tracker update is pending in our long-term gas infrastructure modernization program. The application covers $26 million in incremental capital invested under the program between January and June 2020. Earlier in the quarter, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission approved a 6-year extension of the program, including nearly $950 million in planned capital investments through 2025 to be recovered through semiannual adjustments to the existing transmission, distribution and storage improvement charge or TDSIC tracker.  Now let's look at our electric operations on Slide 10. Shawn will update you in a moment on our progress transitioning our generation portfolio. Before then, I'll note that we continue to execute on our long-term electric infrastructure modernization plan in Indiana. This well-established program includes enhancements to our electric transmission and distribution system designed to further enhance safety and reliability. The program, originally approved by the IURC in 2016, includes approximately $1.2 billion in electric infrastructure investments expected to be made through 2022. In September, we filed our latest electric TDSIC tracker update request, covering more than $122 million in incremental capital investments made between July 2019 and June 2020. We expect an IURC order in January 2021, with new rates effective in February 2021.  And now I'll ask Shawn to talk about our renewable generation projects. Thank you, Shawn. As you can see from what we've covered today, we're continuing to execute on our plan to deliver long-term value for all of our stakeholders. I want to touch on our foundational commitment to safety.  We're continuing to make progress on our safety initiatives across our gas and electric businesses, including our accelerated safety management system, or SMS implementation, which follows American Petroleum Institute's RP 1173 and provides a comprehensive approach to managing safety, emphasizing continual assessment and improvement as well as proactively identifying and mitigating potential risks. We can highlight a few areas of accomplishment thus far in 2020, including continued deployment of our upgraded service line maps and records, with significant progress made in Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Virginia, and we're on track for achieving this milestone in all of our states by the end of the year. We received regulatory approval in Ohio for a pilot of advanced mobile leak detection technology to perform quality assurance in our construction work. We have also continued to install automatic shutoff devices and enhanced monitoring on our low-pressure gas distribution systems, with work completed in Maryland, Kentucky and Virginia.  If you missed Investor Day, I encourage you to visit nisource.com to view the safety video we introduced, which brings our SMS work to life and which provides specific examples of these and other steps we're taking to help ensure safety for our customers, employees, business partners and the public.  I'm also pleased to note that our work to enhance customer service and make it easier to do business with us online has received national recognition. The American Business Awards recognized NiSource with its Gold Stevie Award for the work we did in 2019 to combine our utility website into a seamless customer experience, including a customer portal with bill payment and account management services. Our customer experience team is hard at work on other benefits that we hope to bring customers in the future, including digital service requests, high usage alerts, outage map improvements and enhanced views of their energy usage history. Our customers should expect more from us in the future and know that we are aiming higher to meet their needs.  Before opening the call to your questions, I'll share and reiterate a few key takeaways. Our teams are focused on continued execution of our safety and asset modernization programs and our transition to renewable energy in our electric business. We continue to expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings per share in the range of $1.28 to $1.36 in 2021, which reflects an expected COVID-19 impact of $0.05. The guidance that we provided at our Investor Day on September 29 remain in place. These include $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion in annual safety, modernization and growth investments from 2021 through 2024, $1.8 billion to $2 billion in incremental renewable generation investments across 2022 and 2023, and compound annual earnings per share growth of 7% to 9% from 2021 through 2024, with near-term growth of 5% to 7% from 2021 to 2023.  Our transformational NiSource Next initiative is well underway to enhance organizational capabilities, drive efficiencies and continued affordability for our customers. This effort is designed to ensure that we are optimally positioned to support both the significant capital investments we will be making in renewable generation and our ongoing asset modernization and safety enhancement investments. With the completion of the sale of our Massachusetts assets, we are firmly focused on the future in delivering premium value from our 100% regulated electric and gas utility platform across our 6 states.  Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. We're now ready to take your questions. Amy? And Shar, it's Joe. One of the things that I would note, Shar -- one of the things I would note is that, as Donald said, we haven't seen heating season yet with the COVID impacts. And keep in mind that on the gas side of the business, most of our residential rate structures are essentially decoupled, so you don't have the same volumetric shift that we've seen on the electric side through the second and third quarters. And so that's all factored into our thinking as we look both at Q4 and Q1, the two big heating season quarters for the gas side of the business. That's correct. That's correct. We have a settlement filed there. Yes, that's correct. We're awaiting an order. Yes. Thanks, Durgesh. That's something we're closely monitoring. It's not yet part of our investment plan, and our programs, as we've outlined, are driven by safety, asset modernization and growth programs as well as our renewable transition on the electric side. But as we look forward at the role of natural gas in a decarbonizing economy, we certainly see opportunities, both for increased renewable natural gas and for hydrogen blending.  So it's an area we're watching. I would expect to see more information on that, more insight on that in terms of additional investment opportunities in the future. But at this time, it's what I would consider something that we're closely monitoring and very well positioned.  The other thing I'd stress there is one of the things that's always a key factor is just the fundamental economics of supply and demand. And you look at our territories where we sit across shale belts and the low basis cost and low volatility has really not been conducive to introducing much renewables or blending alternative fuels. But if you've kind of flipped that over, it also creates quite a bit of headroom for those kind of policies as we look forward. So we're very bullish on natural gas going forward in both environments, the current environment and a decarbonizing environment, because we have such strong fundamentals to work from across our territories. Yes, Charles, thanks for your question there and for the follow-up from the Investor Day question because it's an insightful question. If you really look at the energy requirements on a peak day in the winter, especially if you look at our territory, and we're a good test bed for that in NIPSCO because we're on both sides of that, we're both electric and gas. We see the full customer demand profile, both winter peak and summer peak. And it's a very insightful question, even as you perhaps decarbonize the grid and with renewables, and therefore, decarbonize the energy equation, you still have to serve that peak winter day or those peak winter days.  And there are scenarios where you could imagine the gas system as the battery or the storage system for those kind of peak days. But certainly, as it's currently configured, at least across the territories that we're familiar with, electric grid itself, not just the supply component, but the grid itself, may not be well positioned to serve those kind of peak days. So there's a lot of engineering to be done to really see your way through to a world without natural gas. And we think the better question is, how do you position natural gas with renewable natural gas, potential hydrogen blending to decarbonize the gas stream itself as a part of the strategy for meeting customer requirements and providing resilience when you have multiple fuel sources.  So it's a tough -- it's complex engineering question. The economics of it are challenging. And it's an insightful question that you raised. There have been studies about this that actually converted the grid modernization required to a cost per ton of carbon avoided if you did renewable energy and upgraded the grid. And it's a pretty significant way to avoid carbon, a high-cost way to avoid carbon in most of the country, particularly in the areas that we serve. Yes. I think it's not such an absolute thing. I think it's really a more complex picture than that in terms of what's the best role for natural gas, what's the best role for electric renewables, what's the best energy delivery system for the needs of our country. And so I don't think it's a yes, no question for gas. I don't think it's an all electrification solution either. I think we've got to solve this with the resources that are available to us to make sure that we keep our economy viable and rely on the resilience of the supply basin that we have. Yes. I agree with you. There's a lot of work to do to help inform that perspective, and we think we're well positioned to help do that. So our messaging hasn't changed at all from Analyst Day. We've got a track record of evaluating and executing on structural changes when that makes sense, the separation or spin of the pipeline business, the sale of CMA are good examples of that. And our financing plan, as we said on Investor Day, does not assume any portfolio changes, but our point is that we always evaluate the portfolio as a matter of normal course to make sure that we're doing what's in the best long-term interest of shareholders and in the most credit-supportive way. So just want to reiterate, that's the key message, that's what we're conveying. Yes. We're not going to speculate about particular scenarios or anything like that, but it obviously involves evaluating the impact of the loss of earnings in cash flows as well as any cost to synergies that we'd have to manage as a result of a transaction like that. And all of that, as you all know, can influence credit and the earnings trajectory. So we look at the long-term value drivers for the business, and we look at the contribution of each of our companies toward that. And we look at the alternatives anytime we're looking at equity issuances. Don't really know. Now all of our -- we've got really constructive regulatory support in all of our states. We expect all of our -- and have seen all of our companies earn at their allowed return. Of course, we've had the recent sale of CMA, but that's a different profile. No, we haven't set any timetable for that. Thank you, Amy. And thank you all for joining us today and for your continued interest in and support of NiSource. Please stay safe, and make it a great day."

Hopefully, you've all had a chance to read our second quarter earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning. As we did in the release, our plan for this call is to cover topics much broader than just our second quarter results. 2020 is a year of transition for NiSource as we mitigate the financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, complete the sale of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts and reposition NiSource for enhanced execution in our key focus areas. While driving our well-established asset modernization and safety enhancement programs and advancing our transition to renewable generation, we have accelerated the initiative to realign our capabilities and cost structure. Together, these efforts are designed to ensure optimal performance as we execute on the significant opportunities in the NiSource business plan. It's an ambitious agenda. So let's turn now to Slide 3 and discuss our key takeaways. As we have all seen, COVID-19 continues to spread and disrupt the global economy. Throughout NiSource, we remain focused on employee and customer safety and providing reliable utility service as we adapt to the pandemic. Our COVID-19 protections for customers and employees, as outlined in our first quarter 2020 release remain in place. In line with the base case scenario we outlined in late May, we continue to see modest commercial and industrial load impacts due to COVID-19, which are partially offset by increases in residential load. Cost savings and other measures have been implemented that are intended to mitigate these negative impacts on sales. We continue to manage these impacts and will update investors in future quarters. Despite challenges related to the pandemic, we continue to expect to make $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in capital investments in 2020. Our planned sale of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts assets to Eversource remains on track for regulatory approval in the third quarter of 2020, with closing targeted shortly thereafter. Last month, NiSource and Eversource filed a joint petition with the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities, seeking approval of the transaction as well as a proposed settlement with the Attorney General's office and the Department of Energy Resources, which would resolve all remaining state investigations related to the 2018 Greater Lawrence event, including the DPU's investigations of pipeline safety and emergency response. NiSource has agreed to make a payment of $56 million in lieu of penalties into an energy relief fund for customers. With the Massachusetts transaction closure imminent, we have launched a multiyear strategic initiative intended to better leverage the company's current scale by improving our cost structure and capabilities across the organization. As part of this effort, today, we launched a voluntary separation program for certain groups of employees that will be rolled out in waves over the coming months, with the first wave commencing immediately. This initiative, along with the repositioning of executive leadership roles and responsibilities we announced earlier this year, is intended to ensure that our organization is best positioned to drive enhanced focus on safety, renewable energy, operational excellence and customer value. We are also today initiating non-GAAP net operating earnings per share guidance for 2021 in the range of $1.28 to $1.36. This guidance reflects our expectations about the initial savings we expect to achieve through the cost restructuring and includes the base case scenario impacts of COVID-19. It also establishes the starting point for a long-term plan that will extend through 2024 with an expected compound annual rate base growth of 10% to 12%. This rate base growth is expected to drive compound annual earnings per share growth in excess of our previous 5% to 7% annual growth commitment, driven by our renewable portfolio investments and our ongoing modernization programs. We plan to provide more detail around this new long-term growth strategy at our next Investor Day, which we're planning for September 29. At Investor Day, which we expect will be a virtual event, we plan to discuss updates on our safety management initiatives, the next stage of our current $1.8 to $1.9 billion annual capital investment in safety and asset modernization programs. We'll also share details about our anticipated incremental capital investment opportunities in the range of $1.8 to $2 billion across 2022 and 2023 related to our electric generation strategy. This investment represents ownership through joint venture partnerships of approximately half the renewable generation portfolio needed to replace our coal plants retiring by 2023. As we have previously indicated, we expect to retire nearly 80% of our remaining coal-fired generation by 2023 and 100% by 2028. Our replacement plan is designed to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by an industry-leading 90% by 2030 from a 2005 baseline. At Investor Day, we'll also share progress and additional details on the cost restructuring initiative we announced today. These strategic long-term cost reductions will support our growth, strategy, as they are expected to create offsets and future customer bills to allow for a robust capital investments. We'll provide details of our balanced financing plan to fund our robust capital investment plans, and this financing plan will be focused on maintaining our current investment-grade credit ratings. And we'll put all this together to underpin our updated net operating earnings per share growth outlook. We're pleased to preview this outline with you today, and we look forward to sharing all the details in September. Back to 2020, we continue to execute on our key priorities: asset modernization and safety enhancements and our electric generation strategy. We have gas base rate cases pending in Pennsylvania and Maryland, and we've received approval of an extension of our long-term gas modernization program in Indiana. In our Electric business, we made regulatory filings in Indiana seeking approval of PPAs, representing 300 megawatts of new solar generation and 30 megawatts of storage capacity. And commercial negotiations are advancing on build transfer agreements for a significant amount of additional solar capacity. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald, who will discuss our financial performance in more detail. Donald?\nDonald Brown: Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Looking at our second quarter results on Slide 4, we had non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $50 million or $0.13 per share compared to net operating earnings of about $19 million or $0.05 per share in 2019. The year-over-year increase was driven primarily by reduced employee and administrative expense measures put in place to offset the revenue impacts of COVID-19. Looking more closely at our segment results on Slide 5, operating earnings were up nearly $27 million in our Gas segment driven primarily by lower employee and administrative expenses and higher revenues from our safety and modernization investments. This was offset slightly by COVID impacts, including lower commercial and industrial demand, increased bad debt and COVID-specific O&M and reduced late payment and reconnect fees. In our Electric segment, operating earnings were up nearly $4 million, driven primarily by lower employee and administrative expenses, lower generation maintenance expenses, and higher COVID-related residential demand. And this was offset slightly by the same COVID impacts I outlined for the Gas segment. As for COVID-19, as outlined on Slide 6, and consistent with our base case, we saw lower revenue and cash flows in the quarter due to lower commercial and industrial sales and increases in bad debt and other COVID-related expenses. The total impact of COVID-19 in the quarter was approximately $30 million or $0.06 per share, with most of the demand-related impact in April when states in our service footprint were shut down. As I mentioned, this impact was completely offset by non-safety-related expense reductions. To date, the pandemic has not presented significant barriers to our safety and infrastructure modernization programs. As Joe mentioned earlier, we're continuing to -- we continue to expect to invest $1.7 to $1.8 billion of capital in 2020. And we're monitoring the COVID-19 situation closely, and will stand ready to make adjustments as necessary. We've been in dialogue with regulators in all of our states as we seek relief related to incremental COVID pandemic expenses, including bad debt. We've received orders in Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Maryland, which, to varying degrees, allow for deferral of these expenses for later recovery. As we stated on our first quarter call, the length and severity of the COVID pandemic will determine how significant the impact on our 2020 financial performance will be. Our base case still has us expecting a gradual recovery into the first half of 2021, and we haven't seen anything that would negatively impact our long-term growth. Turning to 2021 guidance on Slide 7. As Joe mentioned earlier, we have initiated 2021 net operating earnings per share guidance with the midpoint of $1.32. This guidance reflects our expectations about the initial cost savings, we expect to achieve through our cost restructuring and about a $0.05 impact due to COVID-19, which is our base case scenario. On this slide, we provided some detail about how we our 2021 guidance range. You will recall that our initial guidance range for 2020, which we withdrew when we announced the CMA transaction in February, was a $1.36 to $1.40. Once we factor in the initial results of our cost restructuring and the expected impact of COVID in 2021, that brings us to the $1.28 to $1.37 -- $1.36 guidance range for 2021 that we're initiating today. This 2021 guidance establishes the starting point for a long-term plan that will extend through 2024 with an expected rate base compound annual growth rate of 10% to 12%. This rate base growth is expected to drive earnings per share growth in excess of our previous 5% to 7% annual growth commitment with a shift to a CAGR due to the timing of our renewable portfolio investments. We're looking forward to sharing more details of our 4-year financial plan and our fresh long-term growth strategy at our Investor Day next month. Now turning to Slide 8. I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of June 30 was about $10 billion, of which about $8.7 billion was long-term debt. The weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 16 years, and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 4.3%. In April, we financed our $850 million term loan and issued $1 billion of 10-year notes. We expect these transactions will provide us the necessary liquidity to manage through the impacts of the pandemic. At the end of the second quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $2 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization programs. Our credit ratings from all three major rating agencies are investment grade, and we're committed to maintaining our current investment-grade ratings. Now I'd like to turn to Slide 9, which covers our 2020 financing plan. Our current plan, which is focused on providing funding for our ongoing safety and infrastructure investment programs continues to include annual equity in the range of $200 million to $300 million from our at-the-market or ATM equity issuance program as well as $35 million to $60 million from our employee stock purchase and other programs. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Joe, who will provide some infrastructure investment and regulatory updates from our Gas and Electric businesses.\nJoe Hamrock: Thank you, Donald. Now let's look at some NiSource utilities highlights for the second quarter and early third quarter of 2020, starting with our Gas Operations on Slide 10. In Pennsylvania, we filed a base rate case in April with the Public Utility Commission, seeking an annual revenue increase of $100.4 million to invest in, modernize and upgrade our existing natural gas distribution system as well as maintain the continued safety of the system. New rates are expected to become effective in February 2021. We also filed a rate case request with the Maryland Public Service Commission in May, the request supports further upgrading and replacement of our pipelines in the state. Our proposal updated in July would result in an annual revenue increase of $6.3 million, including $1.3 million of current tracker revenue if approved as filed. A PSC order is expected in the fourth quarter of 2020, with rates effective in December 2020. In Indiana, our application 6-year extension of our long-term gas infrastructure modernization program was approved by the Utility Regulatory Commission in July. The approved program includes nearly $950 million in capital investments through 2025 to be recovered through semiannual adjustments to the existing gas transmission distribution and storage improvement charge or TDSIC tracker. The gas TDSIC program has been in place since 2014. New rates went into effect in May in Ohio in our infrastructure replacement program following regulatory approval of our annual tracker adjustment. This allowed us to begin recovery of approximately $234 million in safety and infrastructure investments made in 2019. This well-established pipeline replacement program, authorized through 2022, covers replacement of priority mainline pipeline and targeted customer service lines. Also, in Ohio, our annual application for adjustment to our capital expenditure program rider remains pending before the Public Utilities Commission. This rider allows us to recover capital investments and related deferred expenses that are not recovered through the IRP. The adjustment application seeks to begin recovery of approximately $185 million in capital, invested in 2019. A commission order is expected this month with new rates effective in September 2020. Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on Slide 11. Shawn will cover our generation strategy progress in a moment, but I will mention that we continue to execute on our long-term electric infrastructure modernization plan in Indiana. This well-established program includes enhancements to our electric transmission and distribution system designed to further enhance safety and reliability. The program originally approved by the IURC in 2016 includes approximately $1.2 billion in electric infrastructure investments, we expect to make through 2022. And now I'll ask Shawn to talk about our renewable generation projects.\nShawn Anderson: Thank you, Joe. We're excited about the opportunity. And as mentioned earlier, NiSource has a significant incremental capital investment opportunity related to our electric generation strategy in Indiana. This strategy is consistent with our 2018 integrated resource plan, which outlines plans to retire nearly 80% of our remaining coal-fire generation by 2023 and retire all of our coal generation by 2028, which will be replaced by lower cost, reliable and cleaner options designed to drive a 90% reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions levels by 2030 compared to the 2005 baseline. Notably, we also expect this strategy to save our electric customers more than $4 billion over 30 years. We've laid out our replacement plan on Slide 13, and which points to a renewable portfolio designed with a combination of NIPSCO ownership, structured through joint ventures and purchase power agreements. Currently, we anticipate half of the capacity in the replacement plan. Targeting ownership in the joint ventures, which includes NIPSCO and tax equity partners as the members. The remaining new capacity is expected to be primarily in the form of PPAs. As part of the transition to cleaner energy and renewable generation, the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, recently approved our plan to retire the R.M. Schahfer Generating Station by 2023. We plan to replace approximately 1,400 megawatts of this retiring coal-fired generation, and we see the incremental capital investment opportunities to replace this capacity with our renewable platform in the range of $1.8 to $2 billion, primarily in 2022 and 2023. As you can see on Slide 14, we currently have 800 megawatts of wind, our Jordan Creek, Rosewater and Indiana Crossroads projects approved by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. And 300 megawatts of solar and 30 megawatts of storage PPAs, Brickyard solar and Greensboro solar pending before the IURC. Jordan Creek and Rosewater are under construction expected to be in service by the end of this year. NextEra Energy Resources who developed the Brickyard and Greensboro projects which are expected in service in mid 2023. Of the wind joint venture projects just mentioned, the IURC has already approved the construction for Rosewater and Indiana Crossroads projects, which represents $400 million in capital investments and rate base opportunity for NiSource. In July, we also moved forward with the tax equity financing agreement for the Rosewater project, closing the structure with Wells Fargo. We are working on the next steps for Indiana Crossroads, which is a 300-megawatt joint venture project with EDP Renewables North America, which was approved for construction in February and is expected to go in service by the end of 2021. Commercial negotiations are advancing on additional build transfer agreements, representing a significant amount of additional solar capacity. The construction and regulatory filings related to these build transfer agreements, are expected shortly after commercial agreements are executed. And we expect to have much more to share on our transition to renewable generation at our upcoming Investor Day in September. With that, now I'll turn the call back to Joe.\nJoe Hamrock: Thank you, Shawn. Before we wrap up, I'd like to take a moment to address the social issues and actions taking place across the United States. Earlier this summer, we made a commitment to our employees that at NiSource, we will address systemic racism head on, wherever we see it. We value diversity, and we will not tolerate intolerance based on race or any other aspect of diversity. Internally, this means we will hold ourselves and our colleagues accountable to ensure that valuing diversity is a fundamental requirement to work at NiSource. And for our managers, creating and nurturing this environment is a foundational job expectation to which they will be held accountable. Before we turn to the Q&A portion of the call, I'll share and reiterate a few key takeaways. 2020 represents a period of transition for NiSource as we mitigate the financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, complete the sale of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts and reposition NiSource for enhanced execution in our key focus areas. We have launched a strategic initiative, which involves the realignment of our organizational structure and costs. This effort is designed to ensure that we are optimally positioned to support both the significant capital investments we will be making in renewable generation, and our ongoing asset modernization and safety enhancement investments. We continue to see modest commercial and industrial load impacts due to COVID-19, which are partially offset by increases in residential load. Cost savings and other measures have been implemented to mitigate these negative impacts on sales. Despite challenges related to the pandemic, we continue to expect to make $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in capital investments in 2020. Looking ahead, for 2021, we have initiated non-GAAP net operating earnings per share guidance in the range $1.28 to $1.36. This guidance reflects the initial cost savings we expect to achieve through this strategic initiative and the base case scenario impacts of COVID-19. It also establishes the starting point for a long-term plan that will extend through 2024 with an expected best-in-class rate base compound annual growth rate of 10% to 12%. This rate base growth is expected to drive earnings per share growth in excess of our previous 5% to 7% annual growth commitment, with the shift to a CAGR due to the timing of our renewable portfolio investments. We're excited about sharing more details with you around this new long-term growth strategy at our next Investor Day, which, again, we're planning to September 29. So thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. We're now ready to take your questions. Cree?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse.\nMichael Weinstein: It says -- you guys -- I noticed that you guys are saying that the liquidity looks adequate for the next 12 to 24 months. So I'm assuming that means probably no block equity through 2021. But would it be safe to assume -- first of all, is that true? And then second of all, would it be safe to assume that there might be some block equity needed as you're building out the generation plan in '22, '23?\nDonald Brown: Michael, it's Donald. I'll take that question. We'll provide more detail on our Analyst Day about what the financing plan looks like. We will have to finance this in a balanced way. We're looking at, certainly, equity, hybrids, which we've done in the past and converts. So really taking into account all the different options as we deliver this plan that builds on that 10% to 12% rate base growth, and we're going to do that and at the least cost-effective way. But we'll come back in September with that detailed plan on financing.\nMichael Weinstein: All right. But that's built into your 5% to 7% CAGR, right? Which I assume is back-end loaded as you get more into the generation build part of the plan?\nDonald Brown: Yes. I mean most of the investments are in '22 and '23. And so it's really the timing of those projects that impact the financing. I'd say the other things that we're looking at as we continue to negotiate the generation projects, looking at our cost savings across that plan. And then ultimately, we need to align our regulatory with our financing plans to provide that earnings guidance for -- in September.\nOperator: Your next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: If I can pick it up where Mike left it off. When you think about the linearity of that 5% to 7%, especially since you're talking about being in excess, how do you think about the lumpiness in the back half? And let's just be a little bit more specific, if you can, as you think about the cycle of those rate cases and when those uplifts will be realized. I suspect, if I can, that '22 looks more like a '21 and then you get a bigger uptick as you normalize into '23 and then really the full year for '24. But can you talk about the trajectory, especially now that you're making this comment about being in excess of that 5% to 7%?\nDonald Brown: Yes. If you think about the -- we've got a chart in our supplemental slides that shows the timing of investments as well as regulatory outcomes. We're going to make significant investments in '22 and '23. We're aligning what that regulatory timing is and when we get the revenues from those investments. And certainly, those early investments will dilute '22 and '23 before we fully have new revenues to support those investments. And so it picks up, obviously, after we get the full revenues and you'd have the full impact of the earnings in 2024. And so that's the reason that we're looking at a CAGR in terms of both the rate base growth as well as the earnings growth.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. And then if I can ask for clarification on the tax equity bit here. You guys talk about roughly 1/3, 2/3 mix between tax equity and investment. How confident are you in that capital structure mix at this point in time? I know that that's been something of a moving target a little bit over time as you fine-tune the percent of wind and solar. And also as you fine-tune what is a novel structure in the industry. I just want to get a little clarity on that. And then also related to that, your level of confidence about where you could be within that $2.8 billion to $3 billion range just against the backdrop of getting approval for the JV-owned project.\nDonald Brown: Yes. I mean, the -- when you look at the solar, the wind projects, part of the structure of the 1/3, 2/3 is really built on the type of projects that we're seeing in terms of the RFPs that we got back, and we're starting to -- or we're continuing the negotiations on. And so that's a big driver of how much of that is tax equity. And at the same time, the pricing from the RFP is really determining how much ownership we have versus how much is PPA.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay. All right. Fair enough. But you feel this is pretty -- this is fairly well-established that at this point, this portion of the overall RFP will be JV projects. There's not too much ambiguity in PPA bucket versus ownership, et cetera?\nShawn Anderson: No, Julien. This is Shawn. We're highly confident in the range provided. We believe it strikes the balance of benefits to customers in the form of that lower energy cost over the 30-year horizon that we pointed to in the 2018 IRP as well as the significant capital investments yielding meaningful returns to our shareholders. We're confident in what that looks like. We're stepping through those commercial arrangements at the moment. We will provide much more detail in September. But we've been able to look at a couple of the structures already in front of the IURC and feel that, that's a good template for us to follow.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs.\nInsoo Kim: My first question, just in Indiana and the renewable projects, what type of customer bill impact can you see when you balance the impact of the renewable rate base and the coal capacity retirement?\nShawn Anderson: Yes. Great question. This is Shawn. The customer bill impact, actually, we expect the $4 billion savings over the 30-year horizon. As you imagine, the lower cost of overall O&M for customers. So we actually see that generation strategy driving savings over the long term. On the investment side and in the combined bill, we still expect that low single-digit bill increase when rates do increase on an annualized basis. In terms of the regulatory filing and time lines, you can see on the supplemental Slide number 14, we wouldn't expect this activity really to occur until 2023 and 2024, where we'll step through that. What's critical about that is the retirement as well of Schahfer, which would yield then that O&M savings back to customers almost simultaneously. So they have to work a little bit in concert with one another, but we believe that bill impact to be moderated overall.\nInsoo Kim: Got it. And then just from a balance sheet perspective, you're still targeting the 14% to 15% total debt, longer term. When we think about 2021, do you still -- do you expect to be at least at the 14% range just by using your annual ATM program?\nDonald Brown: Yes. Long term, we're targeting that 14% to 15%. Just recently met with the rating agencies and continue to have conversations with them about our investment plan over the next four years, and we're confident in that plan. Again, we'll provide more detail on what that looks like at our Analyst Day.\nOperator: Our next question is from Aga Zmigrodzka with UBS.\nAga Zmigrodzka: How should we think about the future renewable investments from '24 to '28? Should the CapEx size be similar to investments that you just announced for '22, '23?\nShawn Anderson: Great question. We'll have a number of IRP analyses that will help to inform the real answer to your question. In fact, 2021, we'll be stepping through the public IRP process again in Indiana. So we'll have much better insights as we grow closer to that. But speaking from the 2018 IRP's perspective, it did point to the retirement of the Michigan City generation facility by 2028. That facility, which is about 500 megawatts on MISO would then need to be -- that capacity we would anticipate need to be replaced. As far as the forum, we would step through the IRP process and as Donald referenced earlier, what the commercial costs and the fuel costs would be to then deliver what the solution would be for that capacity.\nAga Zmigrodzka: And recently, your peer in Pennsylvania announced a settlement for roughly 30% of progressive revenue in their rate case. Could you provide an update on your rate case in Pennsylvania? Are there any delays due to the COVID and social distancing?\nDonald Brown: Okay. No. So we have filed the rate case. We continue to work with intervenors and the commission. At this point, we're not seeing or expecting any change related to COVID in terms of the timing or the outcome of that rate case.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.\nDurgesh Chopra: Can I ask you, in terms of -- and I think you part answered my question, but the 10% to 12% rate base growth on a consolidated level, I think you answered my question in Indiana. But in your other jurisdictions, Pennsylvania, for instance, Ohio, what -- how should we think about sort of the bill impact from the 10% to 12% rate base growth?\nDonald Brown: Yes. Still, on the gas side, we continue to see rate base growth of about 10% to 12%. That's not changing. Again, we're always targeting to be in the low single digits in terms of total bill impact for our customers.\nDurgesh Chopra: Low single. Okay. That makes sense. And then maybe can I just go back to the earnings growth trajectory and the move to CAGR. Given the cost reductions that you alluded to earlier, should we be thinking about -- so in low growth years, you're still in that 5% to 7% range and in high-growth years, maybe you exceed that? Or any -- could you be below 5%? I'm not sure if you're ready to share that information yet or not, but how should we think about that?\nDonald Brown: Yes. We're not ready to share that yet. Again, as we think about the timing of those investments, the timing of cost savings and then aligning that with the regulatory plan is the work that we're finalizing now, and we'll be prepared to give more detail in our Analyst Day.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Charles Fishman with Morningstar.\nCharles Fishman: Guys, the $0.05 impact from COVID-19 as you go from -- well, I'm looking at Slide 7. You go from 2020 guidance to 2021 guidance, $0.05 in fact from COVID. You indicated you -- I think the comment was you don't see any long-term impact from COVID-19. So can I assume that, that $0.05 fades away post 2021?\nDonald Brown: Yes. Our base case really has an impact in 2021, lingering into early 2021. Long term, we'd expect to get that back through customers, either through base rate cases, if it were permanent demand reduction or through the commercial side coming back. So it's really the short term.\nCharles Fishman: Okay. So that -- and then that's built into the 5% to 7% plus EPS growth that you're guiding?\nDonald Brown: That's correct.\nCharles Fishman: Okay. And then a question on the renewables. It was a previous question about the 50% owned, and I know that's a number you've discussed in the past. But remind me, is that something that has regulatory approval? Have you just had just sort of informal discussions with the commission on that 50% owned? And you still would have to go back in Indiana, project by project, PPA by PPA for approval, correct?\nDonald Brown: Yes. That's absolutely correct. You would really look at it on a project-by-project basis, what the commercial arrangements would be. You'd look at the overall cost of then what that project would be. And then you'd push that out over a 30-year horizon, so to speak, to find the balance of affordability for customers and delivering reliable service. But you answered it correctly.\nCharles Fishman: Okay. Yes, has it -- go ahead.\nJoe Hamrock: Yes. Charles, it's Joe. I would just add, the blueprint is well established. We've already got approval of the joint venture approach, and it's that blueprint that we're using as a model for the future investments.\nCharles Fishman: Yes. And not to beat a dead horse here because I think you've answered this on a previous question this morning. The 50%, though, you feel pretty confident with. You've probably had informal conversations with staff and commission on that?\nDonald Brown: Yes. Actually, it's laid out fairly explicitly in terms of the 2018 IRP. And we're at this point following that plan rather closely. It is still tracking online. So it's been a pretty public process, and it will continue to be in 2021 as we provide those updates.\nCharles Fishman: Okay, I'm sorry. So the 50% is in the IRP?\nDonald Brown: Yes. It tracked through that analysis in the 2018 IRP. It's not statutorily mandated but that is the requirement. And it's still an approximation based on the commercial arrangements. But that is the analysis that was pointed to in the '18 IRP.\nOperator: Next question is from Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies LLC.\nChris Sighinolfi: I wanted to maybe follow-on from Charles' questions there. Just with regard to COVID impact Donald, you say the guidance is pretty clear, I think, for 2021. You had mentioned in, I think, your prepared remarks that COVID impacts on the second quarter were somewhere estimated around the $0.06 territory. I'm just curious if you could maybe frame up, is the guidance that you gave with the May presentation around 2020 COVID impacts still a good benchmark to use as we think about sort of how they may feather away over time?\nDonald Brown: That's right. Yes, we're still seeing our base case in the results. Certainly, June came in a little bit better than what we were estimating, but still kind of negative below kind of our original plan this year because of COVID. And we'll continue to watch kind of month-by-month to see how this plays out. But right now, what we provided in June is still consistent with our base case.\nChris Sighinolfi: Okay. And the base year for your EPS CAGR would be 2020, is that correct?\nDonald Brown: 2021.\nChris Sighinolfi: 2021 will be the new. Okay. And then I guess, separately, as I was thinking about comments that you made about non-safety expense management in the quarter, which looked pretty impressive given the financial performance. And then comments that Joe had made about maybe a more longer derated cost structure improvement on the company, things like the employee option, early retirement options, things like that. Just how do we think about things that maybe you pulled hard back on the reins during 2Q to offset for COVID or because you couldn't do certain things perhaps. Coming back in the back half of this year versus things that will then become more permanent in nature. Can you just maybe provide a little bit more color about the puts and takes on those two different type of expense management programs?\nDonald Brown: Yes. I'd say this year, there's certainly more temporary items that we can hold back on different programs and different initiatives to offset the impact of COVID. As we look at 2021 and beyond, it's really about having structural permanent cost reduction that will provide savings to customers long-term in the plan.\nChris Sighinolfi: Okay. And I guess by the time of the Investor Day, one point five months from now, I think Joe had mentioned some of these programs are being enacted immediately, I guess, based on the employee acceptance of some of those offers, you might have a better sense as to how successful further tranches might be. Is that -- are you going to frame up for us like buckets of cost improvement you're going to expect to see from different initiatives?\nDonald Brown: Yes, that's right. We'll provide more detail on what that long-term plan looks like. Certainly, VSP is just one step. Longer term, it really is around how do we structure our organization to reduce scale. There's opportunities to invest in digitization, which improves productivity across our operations. And then long term, it's really around how do we continue to drive operational excellence to continue to improve on how we perform our work, and we'll provide more details on that at our Analyst Day.\nJoe Hamrock: And Chris, this is Joe. Just in the spirit of the framing of the question and Donald's response, there's certainly, as Donald said, some temporary changes we made to help in the second quarter here. We'll see in the back half of the year, though, the beginning of the more permanent structural changes in cost. And I would add, this is really an acceleration of some initiatives that we've had underway for some time. We had a number of cost restructuring initiatives underway. As far back as two or three years ago, designed to flatten O&M. And as we step into this transition moment, we're accelerating a number of those initiatives. And we will, as Donald said, have a lot more detail on that in September when we get together.\nChris Sighinolfi: Okay. Great. Totally unrelated question, Donald. Just with regard to second quarter, you had flagged in the first quarter release, I think, some negative headwind from the performance of your company-owned life insurance. I'm assuming with the market rebound here in the second quarter that you got some of that back. I'm just curious if it was anything noteworthy in the results or anything you could frame for us there?\nDonald Brown: Yes. Certainly, the market did perform better in the second quarter and it came back, but nothing significant that drives our overall results this year.\nOperator: At this time, there are no questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Joe Hamrock.\nJoe Hamrock: Thank you, Cree. And thank you all again for participating today, for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. We do look forward to seeing you again in September when we go into more detail on the framing that we laid out today. So have a good day and make it a safe day. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Joe. We're excited about the opportunity. And as mentioned earlier, NiSource has a significant incremental capital investment opportunity related to our electric generation strategy in Indiana. This strategy is consistent with our 2018 integrated resource plan, which outlines plans to retire nearly 80% of our remaining coal-fire generation by 2023 and retire all of our coal generation by 2028, which will be replaced by lower cost, reliable and cleaner options designed to drive a 90% reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions levels by 2030 compared to the 2005 baseline. Notably, we also expect this strategy to save our electric customers more than $4 billion over 30 years. We've laid out our replacement plan on Slide 13, and which points to a renewable portfolio designed with a combination of NIPSCO ownership, structured through joint ventures and purchase power agreements. Currently, we anticipate half of the capacity in the replacement plan. Targeting ownership in the joint ventures, which includes NIPSCO and tax equity partners as the members. The remaining new capacity is expected to be primarily in the form of PPAs. As part of the transition to cleaner energy and renewable generation, the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, recently approved our plan to retire the R.M. Schahfer Generating Station by 2023. We plan to replace approximately 1,400 megawatts of this retiring coal-fired generation, and we see the incremental capital investment opportunities to replace this capacity with our renewable platform in the range of $1.8 to $2 billion, primarily in 2022 and 2023. As you can see on Slide 14, we currently have 800 megawatts of wind, our Jordan Creek, Rosewater and Indiana Crossroads projects approved by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. And 300 megawatts of solar and 30 megawatts of storage PPAs, Brickyard solar and Greensboro solar pending before the IURC. Jordan Creek and Rosewater are under construction expected to be in service by the end of this year. NextEra Energy Resources who developed the Brickyard and Greensboro projects which are expected in service in mid 2023. Of the wind joint venture projects just mentioned, the IURC has already approved the construction for Rosewater and Indiana Crossroads projects, which represents $400 million in capital investments and rate base opportunity for NiSource. In July, we also moved forward with the tax equity financing agreement for the Rosewater project, closing the structure with Wells Fargo. We are working on the next steps for Indiana Crossroads, which is a 300-megawatt joint venture project with EDP Renewables North America, which was approved for construction in February and is expected to go in service by the end of 2021. Commercial negotiations are advancing on additional build transfer agreements, representing a significant amount of additional solar capacity. The construction and regulatory filings related to these build transfer agreements, are expected shortly after commercial agreements are executed. And we expect to have much more to share on our transition to renewable generation at our upcoming Investor Day in September. With that, now I'll turn the call back to Joe. No, Julien. This is Shawn. We're highly confident in the range provided. We believe it strikes the balance of benefits to customers in the form of that lower energy cost over the 30-year horizon that we pointed to in the 2018 IRP as well as the significant capital investments yielding meaningful returns to our shareholders. We're confident in what that looks like. We're stepping through those commercial arrangements at the moment. We will provide much more detail in September. But we've been able to look at a couple of the structures already in front of the IURC and feel that, that's a good template for us to follow. Yes. Great question. This is Shawn. The customer bill impact, actually, we expect the $4 billion savings over the 30-year horizon. As you imagine, the lower cost of overall O&M for customers. So we actually see that generation strategy driving savings over the long term. On the investment side and in the combined bill, we still expect that low single-digit bill increase when rates do increase on an annualized basis. In terms of the regulatory filing and time lines, you can see on the supplemental Slide number 14, we wouldn't expect this activity really to occur until 2023 and 2024, where we'll step through that. What's critical about that is the retirement as well of Schahfer, which would yield then that O&M savings back to customers almost simultaneously. So they have to work a little bit in concert with one another, but we believe that bill impact to be moderated overall. Great question. We'll have a number of IRP analyses that will help to inform the real answer to your question. In fact, 2021, we'll be stepping through the public IRP process again in Indiana. So we'll have much better insights as we grow closer to that. But speaking from the 2018 IRP's perspective, it did point to the retirement of the Michigan City generation facility by 2028. That facility, which is about 500 megawatts on MISO would then need to be -- that capacity we would anticipate need to be replaced. As far as the forum, we would step through the IRP process and as Donald referenced earlier, what the commercial costs and the fuel costs would be to then deliver what the solution would be for that capacity."

            "name": "Donald Brown",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Looking at our second quarter results on Slide 4, we had non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $50 million or $0.13 per share compared to net operating earnings of about $19 million or $0.05 per share in 2019. The year-over-year increase was driven primarily by reduced employee and administrative expense measures put in place to offset the revenue impacts of COVID-19. Looking more closely at our segment results on Slide 5, operating earnings were up nearly $27 million in our Gas segment driven primarily by lower employee and administrative expenses and higher revenues from our safety and modernization investments. This was offset slightly by COVID impacts, including lower commercial and industrial demand, increased bad debt and COVID-specific O&M and reduced late payment and reconnect fees. In our Electric segment, operating earnings were up nearly $4 million, driven primarily by lower employee and administrative expenses, lower generation maintenance expenses, and higher COVID-related residential demand. And this was offset slightly by the same COVID impacts I outlined for the Gas segment. As for COVID-19, as outlined on Slide 6, and consistent with our base case, we saw lower revenue and cash flows in the quarter due to lower commercial and industrial sales and increases in bad debt and other COVID-related expenses. The total impact of COVID-19 in the quarter was approximately $30 million or $0.06 per share, with most of the demand-related impact in April when states in our service footprint were shut down. As I mentioned, this impact was completely offset by non-safety-related expense reductions. To date, the pandemic has not presented significant barriers to our safety and infrastructure modernization programs. As Joe mentioned earlier, we're continuing to -- we continue to expect to invest $1.7 to $1.8 billion of capital in 2020. And we're monitoring the COVID-19 situation closely, and will stand ready to make adjustments as necessary. We've been in dialogue with regulators in all of our states as we seek relief related to incremental COVID pandemic expenses, including bad debt. We've received orders in Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Maryland, which, to varying degrees, allow for deferral of these expenses for later recovery. As we stated on our first quarter call, the length and severity of the COVID pandemic will determine how significant the impact on our 2020 financial performance will be. Our base case still has us expecting a gradual recovery into the first half of 2021, and we haven't seen anything that would negatively impact our long-term growth. Turning to 2021 guidance on Slide 7. As Joe mentioned earlier, we have initiated 2021 net operating earnings per share guidance with the midpoint of $1.32. This guidance reflects our expectations about the initial cost savings, we expect to achieve through our cost restructuring and about a $0.05 impact due to COVID-19, which is our base case scenario. On this slide, we provided some detail about how we our 2021 guidance range. You will recall that our initial guidance range for 2020, which we withdrew when we announced the CMA transaction in February, was a $1.36 to $1.40. Once we factor in the initial results of our cost restructuring and the expected impact of COVID in 2021, that brings us to the $1.28 to $1.37 -- $1.36 guidance range for 2021 that we're initiating today. This 2021 guidance establishes the starting point for a long-term plan that will extend through 2024 with an expected rate base compound annual growth rate of 10% to 12%. This rate base growth is expected to drive earnings per share growth in excess of our previous 5% to 7% annual growth commitment with a shift to a CAGR due to the timing of our renewable portfolio investments. We're looking forward to sharing more details of our 4-year financial plan and our fresh long-term growth strategy at our Investor Day next month. Now turning to Slide 8. I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of June 30 was about $10 billion, of which about $8.7 billion was long-term debt. The weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 16 years, and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 4.3%. In April, we financed our $850 million term loan and issued $1 billion of 10-year notes. We expect these transactions will provide us the necessary liquidity to manage through the impacts of the pandemic. At the end of the second quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $2 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization programs. Our credit ratings from all three major rating agencies are investment grade, and we're committed to maintaining our current investment-grade ratings. Now I'd like to turn to Slide 9, which covers our 2020 financing plan. Our current plan, which is focused on providing funding for our ongoing safety and infrastructure investment programs continues to include annual equity in the range of $200 million to $300 million from our at-the-market or ATM equity issuance program as well as $35 million to $60 million from our employee stock purchase and other programs. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Joe, who will provide some infrastructure investment and regulatory updates from our Gas and Electric businesses. Michael, it's Donald. I'll take that question. We'll provide more detail on our Analyst Day about what the financing plan looks like. We will have to finance this in a balanced way. We're looking at, certainly, equity, hybrids, which we've done in the past and converts. So really taking into account all the different options as we deliver this plan that builds on that 10% to 12% rate base growth, and we're going to do that and at the least cost-effective way. But we'll come back in September with that detailed plan on financing. Yes. I mean most of the investments are in '22 and '23. And so it's really the timing of those projects that impact the financing. I'd say the other things that we're looking at as we continue to negotiate the generation projects, looking at our cost savings across that plan. And then ultimately, we need to align our regulatory with our financing plans to provide that earnings guidance for -- in September. Yes. If you think about the -- we've got a chart in our supplemental slides that shows the timing of investments as well as regulatory outcomes. We're going to make significant investments in '22 and '23. We're aligning what that regulatory timing is and when we get the revenues from those investments. And certainly, those early investments will dilute '22 and '23 before we fully have new revenues to support those investments. And so it picks up, obviously, after we get the full revenues and you'd have the full impact of the earnings in 2024. And so that's the reason that we're looking at a CAGR in terms of both the rate base growth as well as the earnings growth. Yes. I mean, the -- when you look at the solar, the wind projects, part of the structure of the 1/3, 2/3 is really built on the type of projects that we're seeing in terms of the RFPs that we got back, and we're starting to -- or we're continuing the negotiations on. And so that's a big driver of how much of that is tax equity. And at the same time, the pricing from the RFP is really determining how much ownership we have versus how much is PPA. Yes. Long term, we're targeting that 14% to 15%. Just recently met with the rating agencies and continue to have conversations with them about our investment plan over the next four years, and we're confident in that plan. Again, we'll provide more detail on what that looks like at our Analyst Day. Okay. No. So we have filed the rate case. We continue to work with intervenors and the commission. At this point, we're not seeing or expecting any change related to COVID in terms of the timing or the outcome of that rate case. Yes. Still, on the gas side, we continue to see rate base growth of about 10% to 12%. That's not changing. Again, we're always targeting to be in the low single digits in terms of total bill impact for our customers. Yes. We're not ready to share that yet. Again, as we think about the timing of those investments, the timing of cost savings and then aligning that with the regulatory plan is the work that we're finalizing now, and we'll be prepared to give more detail in our Analyst Day. Yes. Our base case really has an impact in 2021, lingering into early 2021. Long term, we'd expect to get that back through customers, either through base rate cases, if it were permanent demand reduction or through the commercial side coming back. So it's really the short term. That's correct. Yes. That's absolutely correct. You would really look at it on a project-by-project basis, what the commercial arrangements would be. You'd look at the overall cost of then what that project would be. And then you'd push that out over a 30-year horizon, so to speak, to find the balance of affordability for customers and delivering reliable service. But you answered it correctly. Yes. Actually, it's laid out fairly explicitly in terms of the 2018 IRP. And we're at this point following that plan rather closely. It is still tracking online. So it's been a pretty public process, and it will continue to be in 2021 as we provide those updates. Yes. It tracked through that analysis in the 2018 IRP. It's not statutorily mandated but that is the requirement. And it's still an approximation based on the commercial arrangements. But that is the analysis that was pointed to in the '18 IRP. That's right. Yes, we're still seeing our base case in the results. Certainly, June came in a little bit better than what we were estimating, but still kind of negative below kind of our original plan this year because of COVID. And we'll continue to watch kind of month-by-month to see how this plays out. But right now, what we provided in June is still consistent with our base case. 2021. Yes. I'd say this year, there's certainly more temporary items that we can hold back on different programs and different initiatives to offset the impact of COVID. As we look at 2021 and beyond, it's really about having structural permanent cost reduction that will provide savings to customers long-term in the plan. Yes, that's right. We'll provide more detail on what that long-term plan looks like. Certainly, VSP is just one step. Longer term, it really is around how do we structure our organization to reduce scale. There's opportunities to invest in digitization, which improves productivity across our operations. And then long term, it's really around how do we continue to drive operational excellence to continue to improve on how we perform our work, and we'll provide more details on that at our Analyst Day. Yes. Certainly, the market did perform better in the second quarter and it came back, but nothing significant that drives our overall results this year."

            "name": "Joe Hamrock",
            "content": "Thanks, Nick. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Hopefully, you've all had a chance to read our second quarter earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning. As we did in the release, our plan for this call is to cover topics much broader than just our second quarter results. 2020 is a year of transition for NiSource as we mitigate the financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, complete the sale of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts and reposition NiSource for enhanced execution in our key focus areas. While driving our well-established asset modernization and safety enhancement programs and advancing our transition to renewable generation, we have accelerated the initiative to realign our capabilities and cost structure. Together, these efforts are designed to ensure optimal performance as we execute on the significant opportunities in the NiSource business plan. It's an ambitious agenda. So let's turn now to Slide 3 and discuss our key takeaways. As we have all seen, COVID-19 continues to spread and disrupt the global economy. Throughout NiSource, we remain focused on employee and customer safety and providing reliable utility service as we adapt to the pandemic. Our COVID-19 protections for customers and employees, as outlined in our first quarter 2020 release remain in place. In line with the base case scenario we outlined in late May, we continue to see modest commercial and industrial load impacts due to COVID-19, which are partially offset by increases in residential load. Cost savings and other measures have been implemented that are intended to mitigate these negative impacts on sales. We continue to manage these impacts and will update investors in future quarters. Despite challenges related to the pandemic, we continue to expect to make $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in capital investments in 2020. Our planned sale of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts assets to Eversource remains on track for regulatory approval in the third quarter of 2020, with closing targeted shortly thereafter. Last month, NiSource and Eversource filed a joint petition with the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities, seeking approval of the transaction as well as a proposed settlement with the Attorney General's office and the Department of Energy Resources, which would resolve all remaining state investigations related to the 2018 Greater Lawrence event, including the DPU's investigations of pipeline safety and emergency response. NiSource has agreed to make a payment of $56 million in lieu of penalties into an energy relief fund for customers. With the Massachusetts transaction closure imminent, we have launched a multiyear strategic initiative intended to better leverage the company's current scale by improving our cost structure and capabilities across the organization. As part of this effort, today, we launched a voluntary separation program for certain groups of employees that will be rolled out in waves over the coming months, with the first wave commencing immediately. This initiative, along with the repositioning of executive leadership roles and responsibilities we announced earlier this year, is intended to ensure that our organization is best positioned to drive enhanced focus on safety, renewable energy, operational excellence and customer value. We are also today initiating non-GAAP net operating earnings per share guidance for 2021 in the range of $1.28 to $1.36. This guidance reflects our expectations about the initial savings we expect to achieve through the cost restructuring and includes the base case scenario impacts of COVID-19. It also establishes the starting point for a long-term plan that will extend through 2024 with an expected compound annual rate base growth of 10% to 12%. This rate base growth is expected to drive compound annual earnings per share growth in excess of our previous 5% to 7% annual growth commitment, driven by our renewable portfolio investments and our ongoing modernization programs. We plan to provide more detail around this new long-term growth strategy at our next Investor Day, which we're planning for September 29. At Investor Day, which we expect will be a virtual event, we plan to discuss updates on our safety management initiatives, the next stage of our current $1.8 to $1.9 billion annual capital investment in safety and asset modernization programs. We'll also share details about our anticipated incremental capital investment opportunities in the range of $1.8 to $2 billion across 2022 and 2023 related to our electric generation strategy. This investment represents ownership through joint venture partnerships of approximately half the renewable generation portfolio needed to replace our coal plants retiring by 2023. As we have previously indicated, we expect to retire nearly 80% of our remaining coal-fired generation by 2023 and 100% by 2028. Our replacement plan is designed to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by an industry-leading 90% by 2030 from a 2005 baseline. At Investor Day, we'll also share progress and additional details on the cost restructuring initiative we announced today. These strategic long-term cost reductions will support our growth, strategy, as they are expected to create offsets and future customer bills to allow for a robust capital investments. We'll provide details of our balanced financing plan to fund our robust capital investment plans, and this financing plan will be focused on maintaining our current investment-grade credit ratings. And we'll put all this together to underpin our updated net operating earnings per share growth outlook. We're pleased to preview this outline with you today, and we look forward to sharing all the details in September. Back to 2020, we continue to execute on our key priorities: asset modernization and safety enhancements and our electric generation strategy. We have gas base rate cases pending in Pennsylvania and Maryland, and we've received approval of an extension of our long-term gas modernization program in Indiana. In our Electric business, we made regulatory filings in Indiana seeking approval of PPAs, representing 300 megawatts of new solar generation and 30 megawatts of storage capacity. And commercial negotiations are advancing on build transfer agreements for a significant amount of additional solar capacity. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald, who will discuss our financial performance in more detail. Donald? Thank you, Donald. Now let's look at some NiSource utilities highlights for the second quarter and early third quarter of 2020, starting with our Gas Operations on Slide 10. In Pennsylvania, we filed a base rate case in April with the Public Utility Commission, seeking an annual revenue increase of $100.4 million to invest in, modernize and upgrade our existing natural gas distribution system as well as maintain the continued safety of the system. New rates are expected to become effective in February 2021. We also filed a rate case request with the Maryland Public Service Commission in May, the request supports further upgrading and replacement of our pipelines in the state. Our proposal updated in July would result in an annual revenue increase of $6.3 million, including $1.3 million of current tracker revenue if approved as filed. A PSC order is expected in the fourth quarter of 2020, with rates effective in December 2020. In Indiana, our application 6-year extension of our long-term gas infrastructure modernization program was approved by the Utility Regulatory Commission in July. The approved program includes nearly $950 million in capital investments through 2025 to be recovered through semiannual adjustments to the existing gas transmission distribution and storage improvement charge or TDSIC tracker. The gas TDSIC program has been in place since 2014. New rates went into effect in May in Ohio in our infrastructure replacement program following regulatory approval of our annual tracker adjustment. This allowed us to begin recovery of approximately $234 million in safety and infrastructure investments made in 2019. This well-established pipeline replacement program, authorized through 2022, covers replacement of priority mainline pipeline and targeted customer service lines. Also, in Ohio, our annual application for adjustment to our capital expenditure program rider remains pending before the Public Utilities Commission. This rider allows us to recover capital investments and related deferred expenses that are not recovered through the IRP. The adjustment application seeks to begin recovery of approximately $185 million in capital, invested in 2019. A commission order is expected this month with new rates effective in September 2020. Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on Slide 11. Shawn will cover our generation strategy progress in a moment, but I will mention that we continue to execute on our long-term electric infrastructure modernization plan in Indiana. This well-established program includes enhancements to our electric transmission and distribution system designed to further enhance safety and reliability. The program originally approved by the IURC in 2016 includes approximately $1.2 billion in electric infrastructure investments, we expect to make through 2022. And now I'll ask Shawn to talk about our renewable generation projects. Thank you, Shawn. Before we wrap up, I'd like to take a moment to address the social issues and actions taking place across the United States. Earlier this summer, we made a commitment to our employees that at NiSource, we will address systemic racism head on, wherever we see it. We value diversity, and we will not tolerate intolerance based on race or any other aspect of diversity. Internally, this means we will hold ourselves and our colleagues accountable to ensure that valuing diversity is a fundamental requirement to work at NiSource. And for our managers, creating and nurturing this environment is a foundational job expectation to which they will be held accountable. Before we turn to the Q&A portion of the call, I'll share and reiterate a few key takeaways. 2020 represents a period of transition for NiSource as we mitigate the financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, complete the sale of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts and reposition NiSource for enhanced execution in our key focus areas. We have launched a strategic initiative, which involves the realignment of our organizational structure and costs. This effort is designed to ensure that we are optimally positioned to support both the significant capital investments we will be making in renewable generation, and our ongoing asset modernization and safety enhancement investments. We continue to see modest commercial and industrial load impacts due to COVID-19, which are partially offset by increases in residential load. Cost savings and other measures have been implemented to mitigate these negative impacts on sales. Despite challenges related to the pandemic, we continue to expect to make $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in capital investments in 2020. Looking ahead, for 2021, we have initiated non-GAAP net operating earnings per share guidance in the range $1.28 to $1.36. This guidance reflects the initial cost savings we expect to achieve through this strategic initiative and the base case scenario impacts of COVID-19. It also establishes the starting point for a long-term plan that will extend through 2024 with an expected best-in-class rate base compound annual growth rate of 10% to 12%. This rate base growth is expected to drive earnings per share growth in excess of our previous 5% to 7% annual growth commitment, with the shift to a CAGR due to the timing of our renewable portfolio investments. We're excited about sharing more details with you around this new long-term growth strategy at our next Investor Day, which, again, we're planning to September 29. So thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. We're now ready to take your questions. Cree? Yes. Charles, it's Joe. I would just add, the blueprint is well established. We've already got approval of the joint venture approach, and it's that blueprint that we're using as a model for the future investments. And Chris, this is Joe. Just in the spirit of the framing of the question and Donald's response, there's certainly, as Donald said, some temporary changes we made to help in the second quarter here. We'll see in the back half of the year, though, the beginning of the more permanent structural changes in cost. And I would add, this is really an acceleration of some initiatives that we've had underway for some time. We had a number of cost restructuring initiatives underway. As far back as two or three years ago, designed to flatten O&M. And as we step into this transition moment, we're accelerating a number of those initiatives. And we will, as Donald said, have a lot more detail on that in September when we get together. Thank you, Cree. And thank you all again for participating today, for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. We do look forward to seeing you again in September when we go into more detail on the framing that we laid out today. So have a good day and make it a safe day. Thank you."

Some of the statements made during this presentation will be forward-looking. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. Information concerning such risks and uncertainties is included in the MD&A and Risk Factors sections of our periodic SEC filings. Additionally, some of the statements made on this call relate to non-GAAP measures. For additional information on the most directly comparable GAAP measure and a reconciliation of these measures, please refer to the supplemental slides and segment information, including our full financial schedules available at nisource.com. With all of that out of the way, I'd like to turn the call over to Joe.\nJoseph Hamrock: Thanks Nick. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before I summarize our performance in the first quarter, I want to take a moment to comment on the current global crisis and to thank our dedicated employees for the critical and tremendously important work they do every day to keep America running in our service areas. This pandemic has highlighted just how critical the NiSource team's work is to the communities we serve. Early on in the crisis, the states we serve designated us as a central service providers, recognizing that we provide an essential service to millions of end user customers across our service area. This also reflects the critical support we provide to the other essential service providers, hospitals, emergency responders, food providers and key supply chain operators on the front lines of this crisis. Those essential service providers are depending on us and our peers across the utility industry to continue to deliver a safe and uninterrupted supply of gas and electric power, so they can continue their critical work. We are deeply grateful for the dedication and selflessness of those on the front lines of this crisis and for the opportunity we have to support their important and lifesaving work. We have activated our incident command structure to coordinate strategy, execution and communication across our seven-state operating area. To protect our employees, we have encouraged all those who can work from home to do so. For those employees who must report to a work location, we have implemented social distancing protocols, temperature checks for people entering critical company buildings, more frequent cleaning of facilities and equipment and allowing only one person at a time in vehicles while doing our work. Also, certain critical functions have activated sequestration plans to prevent any outbreak among employees in specialized functions necessary to continue providing safe, reliable service to our customers. NiSource's sequestration approach is consistent with others in the utility industry. Across NiSource, we are following health and safety protocols recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and federal, state and local governments. We have taken a number of actions to help customers through the COVID-19 pandemic, including suspending shut-offs for non-payment until further notice and offering our most flexible payment plans to customers impacted by or facing hardship due to COVID-19. Additional measures the company has taken to protect customers include directing field employees to practice strict social distancing at any customer premise and minimizing non-essential field work that requires entering a customer's home. In March, the NiSource Charitable Foundation committed nearly $1.5 million in donations to provide relief support across our footprint. This included a $1 million donation to the American Red Cross and nearly $500,000 to support operating company initiatives at the local level. These donations are intended to support the delivery of care and comfort to communities in need across our footprint as a result of the COVID-19 public health crisis. While we can't see with perfect clarity how this crisis will play out, we remain confident that we will get through this and will emerge a stronger country and a stronger organization. We are resolute in our dual commitments to deliver essential gas and electric service to our customers and the equally important duty of protecting the health and safety of our 8,400 dedicated employees. Our business plan is resilient and will help us emerge from this event positioned to continue to deliver for all of our stakeholders. Now turning to Slide 3, and our results and key takeaways for the first quarter. Our non-GAAP net operating earnings per share of $0.76 compared to $0.82 per share in the first quarter of 2019. The first quarter of 2020 largely played out prior to COVID reaching crisis proportions in the United States and therefore, was minimal pandemic impact on our first quarter results. As we've all seen the continued spread of COVID-19 has resulted in widespread impacts on the global economy and financial markets and could lead to a prolonged reduction in economic activity, extended disruptions to supply chains and capital markets and reduced labor availability and productivity. We are continuing to evaluate the range of potential impacts of the pandemic on our business and on future operating results and liquidity. We currently expect to experience decreased sales volumes to commercial and industrial customers and increased bad debt expenses. We may also experience sustained customer attrition. We will continue to manage these impacts and will update you in future quarters as details become known. In order to help mitigate potential impacts on our cash flow, we have lowered our capital plan by $100 million and we now expect to make investments of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in 2020. We also recently took a pair of actions to reduce financing risk and increase liquidity. On April 1st, we refinanced our $850 million term loan with a new maturity date of March 31, 2021. On April 13, we issued $1 billion of 3.6% notes due May 1st, 2030. Additionally, the previously announced sale of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts' assets to Eversource Energy remains on track to close in the third quarter of 2020, and will provide additional liquidity. We remain committed to maintaining our current investment grade credit ratings. You will recall that we withdrew our non-GAAP earnings guidance in February due to the pending CMA sales transaction. We continue to believe that the long-term growth opportunity for our remaining operating companies is unchanged. We expect to, following the completion of the CMA transaction, initiate 2021 net operating earnings per share guidance and restate a 5% to 7% long-term growth rate for both net operating earnings per share and dividends with 2021 as the base year. This new long-term guidance is expected to be extended beyond 2022 to include incremental investment opportunities related to our electric generation strategy, which continues to advance. While discussions with bidders in our latest RFP are ongoing, we're currently targeting ownership of approximately half the generation portfolio needed to replace our retiring coal plants. This presents incremental capital investment opportunities in 2022 and 2023. With respect to our safety management system implementation, it's important to know that even with our current pandemic response efforts, our broader safety enhancements remain a top priority. SMS continues to mature in our gas business and in 2020, we have begun to implement SMS in our electric business as well. We are enhancing risk identification through our Corrective Action Program, which is providing valuable analytical insights. We are also piloting the use of mobile gas leak detection technology and we're enhancing our gas emergency preparedness and response capabilities, including the deployment of new state-of-the-art mobile command centers. Safety remains the foundation of our business. Our safety enhancements are delivering value in multiple ways, including the activation of our enhanced incident command structure to manage through the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Donald, who will discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail. Donald?\nDonald Brown: Thanks Joe, and good morning, everyone. Looking at our first quarter results on Slide 4. We had non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $291 million or $0.76 per share compared to net operating earnings of about $308 million or $0.82 per share in 2019. The year-over-year decline was driven primarily by increased safety O&M costs and reduced industrial demand in the electric business offset somewhat by increased revenue from base rate proceedings, our Infrastructure Replacement Programs and the effects of gas segment customer growth. As a reminder, most of the first quarter played out prior to the pandemic related shutdowns and stay-at-home orders in our states, so these results really do not reflect any meaningful COVID impact. Now turning to Slide 5, I like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of March 31st was about $9.9 billion, of which about $7.7 billion was long-term debt. The weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 17 years and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 4.4%. At the end of the first quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.3 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization programs. Our credit ratings from all three major rating agencies are investment grade and we're committed to maintaining our current investment grade ratings. I'd now like to turn to Slide 6, which covers our financing plan for a long-term growth investments. As we mentioned on our fourth quarter call, as a result of the CMA asset sale transaction, we no longer expect to pursue our previously planned 2020 block equity issuance. In April, we refinanced our $850 million term loan and issued $1 billion of 10-year notes at a 3.6% coupon. We expect these transactions will provide us the necessary liquidity to manage through the impacts of the pandemic. Our current plan, which is focused on providing funding for our ongoing safety and infrastructure investment programs continues to include annual equity in the range of $200 million to $300 million from our At-The-Market or ATM equity issuance program as well as $35 million to $60 million from our employee stock purchase and other programs. To-date, the pandemic has not presented significant barriers for our safety and infrastructure modernization programs. As Joe mentioned earlier, we have, as a cash conservation measure, scaled back our capital investment plan by a $100 million and now expect to invest $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in 2020. A warmer than normal January and February provided us some flexibility in our capital execution this year, but we're monitoring the COVID-19 situation closely and will stand ready to make further adjustments as necessary. We're also active on the state regulatory front as we seek relief related to incremental COVID pandemic expenses, including bad debt. In April, we received orders from state commissions in Maryland and Virginia giving us the authority to defer incremental COVID-related expenses for recovery at a later date. And we're currently working with our regulators in other states to address COVID-related financial impacts. Ultimately, the length and severity of the COVID pandemic will determine how significant the impact on our financial performance will be, but we haven't seen anything yet that would negatively impact our long-term growth drivers. We continued to expect that following closing of the Massachusetts transaction later this year, we will initiate 2021 net operating earnings per share guidance and establish a 5% to 7% long-term growth rate for both net operating earnings per share and dividends with 2021 as the base year. This new long-term growth rate is also expected to be extended beyond 2022 to include incremental investments related to our electric generation strategy. Now, I'll turn the call back to Joe for a few infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights.\nJoseph Hamrock: Thank you, Donald. Now let's turn to some highlights for the first quarter and early second quarter of 2020 from our gas operations on Slide 7. In Pennsylvania, we filed a base rate case last month with the Public Utility Commission seeking an annual revenue increase of $100.4 million to invest in, modernize and upgrade our existing natural gas distribution system as well as maintain the continued safety of the system. And order and new rates are expected to become effective in January 2021. The same day as our Pennsylvania rate case, we filed a petition with the PUC requesting authority to implement a temporary program that would make grants to residential customers who are experiencing a loss of income due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but who are not eligible to participate in our existing assistance programs. We proposed to use a portion of pipeline penalty credits that the PUC has previously approved for hardship funds, matched by a contribution from the NiSource Charitable Foundation to fund the grants. This is an example of how we're looking for ways to help our most vulnerable customers weather this pandemic financially, which is a priority for us across all of our states. In Ohio, the Public Utilities Commission approved our annual Infrastructure Replacement Program tracker adjustment. This order allows us to begin recovery of approximately $234 million in safety and infrastructure investments made in 2019. This well-established pipeline replacement program, authorized through 2022, covers replacement of priority mainline pipe and targeted customer service lines. New rates from this most recent filing went into effect this month. The Ohio Commission is also reviewing our latest annual adjustment request for our Capital Expenditure Program rider. This rider allows us to recover capital investments and related deferred expenses that are not recovered through the IRP. The pending application seeks to begin recovery of approximately a $185 million in capital invested in 2019 and an order is expected in August 2020. In Indiana, our application for a six-year extension of our long-term gas infrastructure modernization program remains pending before the Utility Regulatory Commission. The proposal includes nearly $950 million in capital investments through 2025, to be recovered through semi-annual adjustments to the existing gas Transmission, Distribution and Storage Improvement Charge or TDSIC tracker. The existing gas TDSIC program has been in place since 2014. An IURC order is expected in July 2020. Now, let's turn to our electric operations on Slide 8. Construction is underway on both the Rosewater and Jordan Creek wind projects. Both projects are expected to be replaced in service by the end of this year. Though inside that schedule, the Rosewater project could experience a construction delay due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we will continue to monitor closely any possible construction impacts related to the pandemic. The IURC on February 19th, 2020, approved our application for a third wind project, Indiana Crossroads, a joint venture with EDP Renewables North America. Indiana Crossroads will have an aggregate nameplate capacity of 302 megawatts and is expected to be in operation in the fourth quarter of 2021. Discussions continue with a number of commercial bidders who responded to our request for proposals which closed in November 2019. The RFP results were consistent with our 2018 integrated resource plan, which calls for 100% of our coal capacity to be retired by 2028, to be replaced by lower cost, reliable and cleaner options. The plan is expected to drive a 90% reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, and to save our electric customers more than $4 billion over 30 years. NIPSCO is considering all sources in the RFP process and is expecting to obtain adequate resources to facilitate the retirement of the R.M. Schahfer Generating Station in 2023. Currently, half of the capacity in the replacement plan is targeted to be owned by joint ventures that will include NIPSCO and unrelated financial investors as the members. The remaining new capacity is expected to be primarily in the form of purchase power agreements. NIPSCO expects to begin the appropriate regulatory compliance filings related to the new capacity as agreements are finalized with counterparties in 2020 and 2021. The planned replacement in 2023 of approximately 1,600 megawatts of retiring coal-fired generation could provide incremental NiSource capital investment opportunities for 2022 and 2023. We continued to execute on our seven-year electric infrastructure modernization program, which includes enhancements to our electric transmission and distribution system designed to further improve system safety and reliability. The program originally approved by the IURC in 2016, includes approximately $1.2 billion of electric infrastructure investments expected to be made through 2022. New rates under our latest modernization tracker update became effective in January 2020. Turning now to Slide 9. I'll focus on our system-wide safety enhancements. We are resolved to lead in safety and exceed existing industry standards anchored by three pillars, a culture where everyone is empowered to identify and report risk, process safety that adds layers of protection and enhanced asset risk analytics and management practices. Our ongoing implementation and refinement of a Safety Management System or SMS based on API's RP 1173 is driving improved planning and performance across our gas business. We've made great progress in our SMS implementation in our gas business and we begun to introduce these practices in our electric business as well. In our gas business, we have advanced the maturity of risk identification through the Corrective Action Program or CAP, which provides expanded insights and enhanced analytics. We are also piloting the use of mobile gas leak detection technology and we have also matured our gas emergency preparedness and response capabilities, including the ongoing deployment of new state-of-the-art mobile command centers. Ultimately, we're driving toward having new tools like CAP to help identify, analyze and proactively mitigate risk, new risk informed programs, projects and rate cases and more flexibility in risk investments. This work will continue to be a priority in 2020 and beyond. Turning to Slide 10. I'd like to focus for a moment on our ongoing focus on environmental, social and governance matters. While this slide is new to our presentation, our focus on ESG is not new. We have been reporting on ESG and sustainability for more than a decade now. As many of you likely have seen, we recently published our 2019 integrated annual report. If you haven't already, I encourage you to check it out at nisource.com. The report discusses our renewed commitment to strengthening our safety culture, modernizing our energy delivery infrastructure, transforming our electric business, reducing our emissions and contributing to the communities in which we live and work. Last summer, we published our 2018 Climate Report, also available at nisource.com, which is aligned with the framework developed by the task force on climate-related financial disclosures. We also have a track record of being recognized for our sustainability performance. For instance, we have been named to the Dow Jones North America Sustainability Index for six consecutive years. We've also been named to the FTSE4Good Index as well as the number of sustainability indexes maintained by S&P. We have an aggressive goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions 90% by 2030 from 2005 levels. We reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 13% in 2019, bringing the total decrease to 48% from 2005 levels. We were a founding member of the EPA's Methane Challenge Program in 2016 and we hold a top 20% environmental performance score from the Institutional Shareholder Services. And in January, we were named to the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index for the third consecutive year. The GEI tracks the financial performance of public companies committed to supporting gender equality through policy development, representation and transparency. We are committed to being recognized throughout our communities as one of the best places to work and grow and gender equality is a critical component of our inclusion and diversity efforts. Before we take your questions, I'll share and reiterate a few key takeaways. We remain focused on maintaining safe and reliable energy service through the COVID-19 pandemic. We have taken financial steps which position NiSource with ample liquidity to manage through the crisis and we're seeking supportive regulatory relief with respect to incremental pandemic expenses. We will continue to manage potential financial impacts and provide you more details as they become known. Consistent with recent years, we expect to complete $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in capital investments in 2020 and continue to expect to close on the CMA asset sale transaction in the third quarter and we remain committed to maintaining our current investment-grade credit ratings. We continue to prioritize safety initiatives across our footprint even as we manage through the pandemic. This includes implementation of our SMS, which continues to mature across our gas business and is being rolled out in our electric business in 2020. Our electric generation strategy is advancing with wind project construction continuing, our coal-fired generation retirement is on track and incremental capital investment opportunities identified as we further develop our replacement portfolio. Safety and infrastructure investments continue across our gas business with tracker updates progressing in a new base rate case filed in Pennsylvania. Thank you all for participating today [technical difficulty] of NiSource. We're now ready to take your questions. Mariyama?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is [Rob Porter] on for Shar. I know you guys obviously pulled 2020 guidance because of the pending sale base rate gas. But as we think 2021, prior language seems to allude 2021 should be at least as good as 2020, is that still the case and what are the drivers we should think about?\nJoseph Hamrock: Thanks for the question. As we think about COVID and we're early on into trying to understand what this could mean to our business and the economies. I think it's little early to provide specific guidance on 2021. As we stated earlier, we haven't seen a significant impact in the first quarter, because of COVID on - from an expense standpoint or - as well as a revenue standpoint, but we do expect we will see lower customer demand and some higher bad debt expense. So I think as we get - go through the quarters, we'll be able to provide more guidance and insight as we learn what the impacts COVID will have on our business going forward. Again, we don't think it affects our long-term growth drivers, but we do want to understand how it may impact our financials this year and our starting point next year.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: If I could follow-up on the last question - just the level set here on '21 expectation. You all talked about being largely flattish versus '20 earlier and some of that seems to be predicated on cost cuts to offset some of the - for earnings loss as part of the sale. How are you thinking about that today given - and I'm going to presuppose the certain amount of incremental cost cut as you think about '21 to offset some of the lost demand that might spill over into '21 from '20 here?\nDonald Brown: Yes, no, that's right. We continued to work on the separation plan with Eversource and for our own purposes and understanding what the dissynergies are and what are those mitigation steps to help offset some of the impact of the loss earnings from Massachusetts. Certainly COVID provide some incremental pressure as we think about operating expenses as well as cash flows and so we're working through that. At this point, not having any specifics on what the revenue impacts will be, it's - I'd say it's difficult to give any specific direction, but as we do our scenario analysis and look at potential impacts to our customers, we are taking into - we are taking that information into our analysis as we look at our own operating expenses and capital programs.\nJoseph Hamrock: And Julien, let me just...\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: So just to be clear you kind of missed....\nJoseph Hamrock: Talk a little bit of about - yeah, let me add just a little about of differentiation. When you think about the cost profile related to the CMA sale and the actions that we're taking there, those are really in the realm of changing cost structures on a permanent basis related to ongoing operations and largely across the shared enterprise platforms and in enterprise cost pools. Very different from what you might do to manage on a short-term basis through a downturn like this. Some of the discretionary spending that largely often comes back in future spending, it's timing of spending that you often look at for those kind of efforts. So I would differentiate the two efforts and highlight that our focus is on maintaining core strength for 2021 and beyond. So any cost shaping actions we'll take at the edge of this year will be to manage, as Donald said, through the tight spots here, but our core focus remains on execution capabilities and lean operating platforms for '21 and beyond. So there is a distinction there. They're - they maybe co-mingle at times but largely they're separate and distinct efforts.\nDonald Brown: Yes, I think the opportunity to...\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: I appreciate that.\nDonald Brown: Because we are...\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: If I can just clarify that. Sorry, go for it Donald. I apologize.\nDonald Brown: Yes, I'd say that because we've got a team that's focused on looking at the core operations and how we can change structure even looking at some of the temporary levers that we may be able to execute goes hand-in-hand with that work.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. So if - but just to clarify, with respect to that earlier expectation of flattish guidance, you're not necessarily restating that at this point in time, given the various puts and takes here. Just want to be clear about that.\nDonald Brown: I would say that it's too early to provide that guidance for 2021, not knowing what the impact of COVID will be on the business.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Understood. And then, if I can just go quickly, how are you seeing the April sales trend thus far? I know you sort of talked here on the 1Q impact thus far, but curious, what are you currently seeing if you can, just to give us a little bit of a sense of the flavor of the order of magnitude.\nDonald Brown: Yes, we're actually closing the books this week and so I don't have any specifics I can give you just yet. We'll have that, I'd say, over the next week and as we get more information and can provide that to investors, we will do so. Yeah, the one thing that...\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay.\nDonald Brown: That we are thinking about though, and I've said it on the - our investor fireside chat a couple of weeks ago, this part of the year is a shoulder season and so it's a lower supply and demand season. And so it's also little bit hard to translate what we'd see from an April standpoint into a long-term impact on the business as well as just understanding what businesses our customers are doing temporarily versus what they do long-term.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Peters with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nDavid Peters: Hope you and your families are doing well. On the RFP in Indiana, when should we expect an update on incremental CapEx opportunities and how do you guys see that shaping kind of the long-term growth trajectory of the company?\nJoseph Hamrock: Yes, let me about the timing as we view it now and Donald can talk about the longer-term view to the extent it's coming into view at this point. So we're - as we noted earlier, we're in the negotiations phase with the bidders into the RFP. We expect to come through that here in the next few months. So I would expect to see the regulatory filings associated with that, CPCN is associated with that with the mix of PPAs and the JV tax equity structures later this summer, maybe around our Q2 call, we'll see. We'll just see how that plays out, but later this summer, we should have a lot more to talk about in terms of the mix and that would obviously lay out the timetable for investments on both sides of that equation. As it relates to the longer term CapEx and growth profile, let me ask Donald to talk about current outlook on that.\nDonald Brown: Yes, I think it's - that guidance in terms of long term growth and the 2021 base that we've talked about likely be in the third quarter, so that we can talk about, here is what we're seeing for 2021, here's what the investment plan looks like over the next horizon. And again, we expect to extend that beyond 2022 to take into account the generation investments.\nDavid Peters: Great. And then another question I had just on the 2020 CapEx. Is that $100 million being deferred until say, next year or soon after or how should we just think about that $100 million?\nDonald Brown: I'd look at it as - it's a reduction this year, but obviously, it's work that we need to do. We will have to find - determine when we would make those investments in the future. We haven't looked that far out to say what - how that might impact 2021 or 2022, but ultimately, it's long-term investments that we're making in the business.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nInsoo Kim: My first question is on NIPSCO electric, could you just give a little bit more color on the types of commercial and industrial business - customers that you serve?\nJoseph Hamrock: Yes, sure, let me touch on it. I think probably, the most notable part of the profile from a low perspective is the concentration of energy intense industrials, the steel and petrochem profile that we have there. And those customers, as you may recall, are under a new rate structure that was implemented with the rate case from last year that essentially shifts the capacity commitment profile for us to the firm portion of the load and allows them to buy through to the market on a ongoing basis. A novel approach to derisk that for us and for them and for our other customers, and you will note, if you look at industrial sales, Q1 of '20 versus Q1 of '19, you'll note a decline in industrial sales, a significant portion of which is related to that buy through. So it's by design that we have some of that decline in there and we did see about a 6.5% decline on industrial electric Q1 '20 versus Q1 '19. The remainder is a pretty diverse set of sectors, the remainder of our commercial and industrial loads, pretty diverse set of sectors across a growing part of the state and so we see good diversity and good economic development there as well. We saw load and I would just highlight the load profile. If you look at the results for the quarter, on the electric side, residential load down quarter one versus quarter one of last year, same for commercial and that's been a bit of a continuing trend on use per customer. On - by contrast, on the gas side of the business, residential sales were up about 3% across our footprint year-on-year and commercial up close to 5%, all of which, as we noted before, was pre-COVID impact. So we're not really seeing COVID impacts in that. And then industrial, slightly down on the gas side. So - and we continue to see our customer count increase as we've gone through the first quarter here. We added a little more insight than you asked for, but I want to make sure the whole picture was in focus there.\nInsoo Kim: That's really good color. And my other question is, can you just give an update on the latest timing of the Massachusetts DPU's investigation into the Merrimack incident and is a final outcome on that required at all to close on the utility sale?\nJoseph Hamrock: That all remains on track. We're, as you would expect, engaged right now with stakeholders in the early phases of that process. People continue to work through that even it with the COVID implications for work from home. We've seen very good progress on that. We expect that to close, as we noted earlier on the call, by the end of the third quarter of this year, would note that there is the possibility of some slight delay just from the workload issues and the way COVID might impact just working conditions, but we're confident in that. And we are viewing that and approaching that as a combined effort to resolve all matters related to Massachusetts, including the pipeline safety investigation. So it's all essentially on the table and in the mix together.\nInsoo Kim: And also just, is that outcome required for the completion of the sale to Eversource?\nJoseph Hamrock: Well, again, it's - again we've put all of the matters together into the sale. It's an opportunity for a comprehensive package to - for NiSource to exit the state and Eversource to take the ongoing operations.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nMichael Weinstein: Just to be clear about the long term guidance of 5% to 7%. You indicated a base year of 2021, that base year would include - you're expecting that all of these cost savings to offset the synergies from the sale of Massachusetts, will be in that 2021 base year at that point right? There is not going to be an additional savings which would flow into 2022 and beyond?\nJoseph Hamrock: I'd actually expect that there would be savings that are ongoing. There is timing to some of the change in operations. If you think about doing a transaction, part of the work that we've got to do to separate will take multiple years. What we've got in this agreement is a transaction services agreement that lasts up to 30 months. And so as we analyze what that TSA looks like, we expect that we'll have some savings immediately, because we won't have to do that work and we can take the advantage of those savings opportunities. But over time, as the TSA comes off as well as we make other structural changes to our cost profile, that will take a couple of years.\nMichael Weinstein: Got you. And you're still saying it's about a $0.05 or so of ETS synergies that you're expecting after the sale is completed?\nJoseph Hamrock: I could see it in the range - that being in the range of savings.\nMichael Weinstein: On the - on generation, the new generation investments that you're expecting, you indicated there will be some financial partners involved non-related to NIPSCO. Are we talking about tax equity partners on wind projects or are we talking about something else here and what kind of an arrangement is that?\nDonald Brown: That's right, that's right. We are looking at tax equity partners to be able to take advantage of the tax credits related to those renewable investments and support the utility being able to re-base those investments.\nMichael Weinstein: So does that mean that at the end of the five-year period, recapture period that those tax equity partners would want to exit the investment and NIPSCO would gain more of the investment at that point, re-base would increase?\nDonald Brown: Yes. The way it's structured that over time it's a build-own-transfer arrangement. So over time, there would be steps where we would pick up more of the overall joint ventures.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nChris Sighinolfi: Maybe a follow up on that last question, Joe. Just had a - you talked about with the IRP having a combination of partners, but also things that you'd be investing yourself. I'm just wondering, how you think about the allocation of that or the breakdown of that? Is that the attributes of a particular project? Is that just the capital budget constraints of NiSource in any particular period of time? Can you just give us a sense of how you think about that component through time?\nJoseph Hamrock: It's really about optimizing the mix and starting with cost to customer as the key driver. When we analyze the RFP and the bids, we had a mix of PPA bids, bids that could go either PPA or JV and some straight JV and as we optimize that portfolio, the 50%-ish blend is what looks like the solution set that balances best cost to customer with the right ownership structure for us and opportunities for us, all subject to continuing negotiation and continuing evaluation, but that's a - that's kind of the target zone we're operating in right now.\nChris Sighinolfi: So I guess, as we think about the profile through time that's - that mix shift is something that could be something that's fairly constant or do you expect to have more NIPSCO participation earlier in the IRP process or later or can you give any color on that?\nJoseph Hamrock: Yes. I think we'll take a one step at a time as we go through. We certainly want to look for ownership opportunities and investment opportunities and I would say we have a preference for that, but we want to do that in a balanced way that reflects the best interest of all of our stakeholders. And so we'll take each step in this, each tranche on a kind of an independent basis and look at the portfolio needs at a point in time.\nChris Sighinolfi: Okay, great. I also had two other questions. I was just - clearly, there's an earlier question about and you kind of talked about the change in the NIPSCO customer set and rate dynamic maybe certainly since the last recession...\nJoseph Hamrock: Right.\nChris Sighinolfi: And clearly Columbia has been spun off since - Columbia Pipeline since that time, but I'm just curious, if there is any other things that you maybe have gone back through and looked at the performance of the company in '08-'09 just as like a proxy set and maybe just some of the things, if we were to do that, that you would point out that are quite a bit different this time versus that time or maybe any learnings from that time that inform how you and Donald think about the business. I know you're not giving guidance and I know you're still assessing COVID impacts and the dynamic this time is different, but there is still obviously an economic component, just curious, any thoughts on that.\nJoseph Hamrock: Yes. It's a good, good question, because it's a reference case, but you almost use it as a reference from which you adjust what's different about today and what's different about this particular set of circumstances. And the one thing that, as we've said and Donald highlighted is difficult and you're seeing it all around is sector-by-sector, you could see very different depths and duration. Some that might bounce right back and might actually bounce back stronger, some that are likely to see a little bit slower recovery and maybe don't recover back to where they were prior to this. And it's that blend of almost sector-by-sector and across our seven states or six-states as we go into 2021, the unique blend of those different sectors that we are analyzing very carefully and trying to get indicators, if you will, of what recovery looks like. And so we're early in trying to get to the next level of detail on that, but I think ultimately, when you start to look at that, it's a very different profile than what we experienced in '08, '09 and as you noted, our mix is different. We now have, without the Pipeline Group as you noted and with the different rate structure for our large industrials more protections in place, so to speak. We're better positioned or better hedged against some of the risks we faced here. So it's really - starts to become more of a duration question I think, ultimately and that's why as we step through Q2, I think we're going to get a much better sense of what we're seeing both in April as Donald noted, we'll see that pretty soon. And then by the end of Q2, even being shoulder months for our whole business for the most part, it's more of the economic recovery that will give you the leading indicators for Q3, Q4 and beyond when we'll be out of the shoulders. So looking forward to having more depth and detail on that, I want to be careful not to try to either be overly optimistic or overly pessimistic. I think we just have to step through this with eyes wide open.\nChris Sighinolfi: Sure. That's helpful. We'll pay attention to those data points as well. I guess, the final question from me, Joe, is just with regard to Massachusetts, I know you guys have given in your Qs the updates in terms of insurance recoveries and I know you've been somewhat cautious about anticipating any on the asset front. I'm just curious where that stands and what those discussions look like.\nDonald Brown: Yes, we're still in the midst of having discussions with our property insurer. The litigation was filed last quarter but we're - continue to have conversations. It's still too early to give any guidance on what any type of recovery might be there or the - even the timing, but I'd say that we are in constructive conversations with them.\nChris Sighinolfi: Is there a normal like length of time that you'd anticipate, Donald, for that process to take or is it just everyone's unique in and the range is too wider to even speculate?\nDonald Brown: Yes, it is. It's - every situation is very unique in terms of the information that you're providing as well as the negotiations.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Charles Fishman with Morningstar. Your line is open.\nCharles Fishman: Joe, just one maybe point of clarification on the $100 million CapEx reduction for this year. It sounded like it was more of a decision to delay some projects timing because of rate cases, the appetite of customers or regulators to take incremental rate increase, things like that rather than a supply chain issue. Is my read of that correct?\nJoseph Hamrock: It's really neither. It's more managing cash flow through this year and recognizing we're likely in a tight spot for a little while here and want to make sure we're prudent - taking prudent steps as we go. And as noted earlier, Donald talked about it, just by the nature of our capital portfolio, it's long dated and when we take a step like this, which by the way puts us on the same profile we've been on for the last couple of years, 17 to 18 is consistent with where we've been. This year, it was elevated a bit. So it's really just timing of key initiatives and probably blended across both tracked capital, growth capital and our maintenance capital. So likely to just have a very modest effect on the future.\nCharles Fishman: And then another question related to CapEx. Slide 17, which shows a recovery of those investments. Every time I look at that slide, the upper two bars seem to go higher, which is good. In other words, your recovery keeps getting shorter and more within the 18 months, you're up to, on this chart now, 80% yet down at the bottom, it says, greater than 75%, should I expect those two upper bars to come down a little or are you just little, I mean the some - greater than 75% is obviously correct, but where should we - over time, we've seen those go up, but what should we expect in the future?\nJoseph Hamrock: Yes, it's a good insight and a good question and you may notice that we've moved 2020 into roughly $10 million, roughly $70 million, roughly $20 million, because it's the nature of the $100 million pullback and how that ultimately lands, that will move a little bit across those different categories, but your question about the long term. If you look backwards, we had some larger generation projects and larger electric transmission projects that were in the mix and that's why you'd see the more pronounced shift in the mix back a few years. As you go forward, the next couple of years, what you see here is likely to be what we'll continue to see until and unless we get to the generation investments that we've been talking about, the replacement portfolio. We'd see a couple of years there of an excursion on what we view as the periodic rate cases or the maintenance and other. We would likely see those show up in that category for a short period of time, but obviously, we'd have that combined with a regulatory strategy for those kind of investments.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Joe Hamrock for closing remarks.\nJoseph Hamrock: Thanks, Mariyama, and thanks to all of you for your continued interest in and support of NiSource. As is the case for all of us, around the communities we serve and all of our stakeholders, we're navigating through this COVID crisis carefully and thoughtfully and we'll continue to stay transparent and talk with you about any implications we see and share any outlook on our business. We appreciate the time today and look forward to the next opportunity. Please stay safe.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Donald Brown",
            "content": "Thanks Joe, and good morning, everyone. Looking at our first quarter results on Slide 4. We had non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $291 million or $0.76 per share compared to net operating earnings of about $308 million or $0.82 per share in 2019. The year-over-year decline was driven primarily by increased safety O&M costs and reduced industrial demand in the electric business offset somewhat by increased revenue from base rate proceedings, our Infrastructure Replacement Programs and the effects of gas segment customer growth. As a reminder, most of the first quarter played out prior to the pandemic related shutdowns and stay-at-home orders in our states, so these results really do not reflect any meaningful COVID impact. Now turning to Slide 5, I like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of March 31st was about $9.9 billion, of which about $7.7 billion was long-term debt. The weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 17 years and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 4.4%. At the end of the first quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.3 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization programs. Our credit ratings from all three major rating agencies are investment grade and we're committed to maintaining our current investment grade ratings. I'd now like to turn to Slide 6, which covers our financing plan for a long-term growth investments. As we mentioned on our fourth quarter call, as a result of the CMA asset sale transaction, we no longer expect to pursue our previously planned 2020 block equity issuance. In April, we refinanced our $850 million term loan and issued $1 billion of 10-year notes at a 3.6% coupon. We expect these transactions will provide us the necessary liquidity to manage through the impacts of the pandemic. Our current plan, which is focused on providing funding for our ongoing safety and infrastructure investment programs continues to include annual equity in the range of $200 million to $300 million from our At-The-Market or ATM equity issuance program as well as $35 million to $60 million from our employee stock purchase and other programs. To-date, the pandemic has not presented significant barriers for our safety and infrastructure modernization programs. As Joe mentioned earlier, we have, as a cash conservation measure, scaled back our capital investment plan by a $100 million and now expect to invest $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in 2020. A warmer than normal January and February provided us some flexibility in our capital execution this year, but we're monitoring the COVID-19 situation closely and will stand ready to make further adjustments as necessary. We're also active on the state regulatory front as we seek relief related to incremental COVID pandemic expenses, including bad debt. In April, we received orders from state commissions in Maryland and Virginia giving us the authority to defer incremental COVID-related expenses for recovery at a later date. And we're currently working with our regulators in other states to address COVID-related financial impacts. Ultimately, the length and severity of the COVID pandemic will determine how significant the impact on our financial performance will be, but we haven't seen anything yet that would negatively impact our long-term growth drivers. We continued to expect that following closing of the Massachusetts transaction later this year, we will initiate 2021 net operating earnings per share guidance and establish a 5% to 7% long-term growth rate for both net operating earnings per share and dividends with 2021 as the base year. This new long-term growth rate is also expected to be extended beyond 2022 to include incremental investments related to our electric generation strategy. Now, I'll turn the call back to Joe for a few infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights. Yes, no, that's right. We continued to work on the separation plan with Eversource and for our own purposes and understanding what the dissynergies are and what are those mitigation steps to help offset some of the impact of the loss earnings from Massachusetts. Certainly COVID provide some incremental pressure as we think about operating expenses as well as cash flows and so we're working through that. At this point, not having any specifics on what the revenue impacts will be, it's - I'd say it's difficult to give any specific direction, but as we do our scenario analysis and look at potential impacts to our customers, we are taking into - we are taking that information into our analysis as we look at our own operating expenses and capital programs. Yes, I think the opportunity to... Because we are... Yes, I'd say that because we've got a team that's focused on looking at the core operations and how we can change structure even looking at some of the temporary levers that we may be able to execute goes hand-in-hand with that work. I would say that it's too early to provide that guidance for 2021, not knowing what the impact of COVID will be on the business. Yes, we're actually closing the books this week and so I don't have any specifics I can give you just yet. We'll have that, I'd say, over the next week and as we get more information and can provide that to investors, we will do so. Yeah, the one thing that... That we are thinking about though, and I've said it on the - our investor fireside chat a couple of weeks ago, this part of the year is a shoulder season and so it's a lower supply and demand season. And so it's also little bit hard to translate what we'd see from an April standpoint into a long-term impact on the business as well as just understanding what businesses our customers are doing temporarily versus what they do long-term. Yes, I think it's - that guidance in terms of long term growth and the 2021 base that we've talked about likely be in the third quarter, so that we can talk about, here is what we're seeing for 2021, here's what the investment plan looks like over the next horizon. And again, we expect to extend that beyond 2022 to take into account the generation investments. I'd look at it as - it's a reduction this year, but obviously, it's work that we need to do. We will have to find - determine when we would make those investments in the future. We haven't looked that far out to say what - how that might impact 2021 or 2022, but ultimately, it's long-term investments that we're making in the business. That's right, that's right. We are looking at tax equity partners to be able to take advantage of the tax credits related to those renewable investments and support the utility being able to re-base those investments. Yes. The way it's structured that over time it's a build-own-transfer arrangement. So over time, there would be steps where we would pick up more of the overall joint ventures. Yes, we're still in the midst of having discussions with our property insurer. The litigation was filed last quarter but we're - continue to have conversations. It's still too early to give any guidance on what any type of recovery might be there or the - even the timing, but I'd say that we are in constructive conversations with them. Yes, it is. It's - every situation is very unique in terms of the information that you're providing as well as the negotiations."

            "name": "Joseph Hamrock",
            "content": "Thanks Nick. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before I summarize our performance in the first quarter, I want to take a moment to comment on the current global crisis and to thank our dedicated employees for the critical and tremendously important work they do every day to keep America running in our service areas. This pandemic has highlighted just how critical the NiSource team's work is to the communities we serve. Early on in the crisis, the states we serve designated us as a central service providers, recognizing that we provide an essential service to millions of end user customers across our service area. This also reflects the critical support we provide to the other essential service providers, hospitals, emergency responders, food providers and key supply chain operators on the front lines of this crisis. Those essential service providers are depending on us and our peers across the utility industry to continue to deliver a safe and uninterrupted supply of gas and electric power, so they can continue their critical work. We are deeply grateful for the dedication and selflessness of those on the front lines of this crisis and for the opportunity we have to support their important and lifesaving work. We have activated our incident command structure to coordinate strategy, execution and communication across our seven-state operating area. To protect our employees, we have encouraged all those who can work from home to do so. For those employees who must report to a work location, we have implemented social distancing protocols, temperature checks for people entering critical company buildings, more frequent cleaning of facilities and equipment and allowing only one person at a time in vehicles while doing our work. Also, certain critical functions have activated sequestration plans to prevent any outbreak among employees in specialized functions necessary to continue providing safe, reliable service to our customers. NiSource's sequestration approach is consistent with others in the utility industry. Across NiSource, we are following health and safety protocols recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and federal, state and local governments. We have taken a number of actions to help customers through the COVID-19 pandemic, including suspending shut-offs for non-payment until further notice and offering our most flexible payment plans to customers impacted by or facing hardship due to COVID-19. Additional measures the company has taken to protect customers include directing field employees to practice strict social distancing at any customer premise and minimizing non-essential field work that requires entering a customer's home. In March, the NiSource Charitable Foundation committed nearly $1.5 million in donations to provide relief support across our footprint. This included a $1 million donation to the American Red Cross and nearly $500,000 to support operating company initiatives at the local level. These donations are intended to support the delivery of care and comfort to communities in need across our footprint as a result of the COVID-19 public health crisis. While we can't see with perfect clarity how this crisis will play out, we remain confident that we will get through this and will emerge a stronger country and a stronger organization. We are resolute in our dual commitments to deliver essential gas and electric service to our customers and the equally important duty of protecting the health and safety of our 8,400 dedicated employees. Our business plan is resilient and will help us emerge from this event positioned to continue to deliver for all of our stakeholders. Now turning to Slide 3, and our results and key takeaways for the first quarter. Our non-GAAP net operating earnings per share of $0.76 compared to $0.82 per share in the first quarter of 2019. The first quarter of 2020 largely played out prior to COVID reaching crisis proportions in the United States and therefore, was minimal pandemic impact on our first quarter results. As we've all seen the continued spread of COVID-19 has resulted in widespread impacts on the global economy and financial markets and could lead to a prolonged reduction in economic activity, extended disruptions to supply chains and capital markets and reduced labor availability and productivity. We are continuing to evaluate the range of potential impacts of the pandemic on our business and on future operating results and liquidity. We currently expect to experience decreased sales volumes to commercial and industrial customers and increased bad debt expenses. We may also experience sustained customer attrition. We will continue to manage these impacts and will update you in future quarters as details become known. In order to help mitigate potential impacts on our cash flow, we have lowered our capital plan by $100 million and we now expect to make investments of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in 2020. We also recently took a pair of actions to reduce financing risk and increase liquidity. On April 1st, we refinanced our $850 million term loan with a new maturity date of March 31, 2021. On April 13, we issued $1 billion of 3.6% notes due May 1st, 2030. Additionally, the previously announced sale of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts' assets to Eversource Energy remains on track to close in the third quarter of 2020, and will provide additional liquidity. We remain committed to maintaining our current investment grade credit ratings. You will recall that we withdrew our non-GAAP earnings guidance in February due to the pending CMA sales transaction. We continue to believe that the long-term growth opportunity for our remaining operating companies is unchanged. We expect to, following the completion of the CMA transaction, initiate 2021 net operating earnings per share guidance and restate a 5% to 7% long-term growth rate for both net operating earnings per share and dividends with 2021 as the base year. This new long-term guidance is expected to be extended beyond 2022 to include incremental investment opportunities related to our electric generation strategy, which continues to advance. While discussions with bidders in our latest RFP are ongoing, we're currently targeting ownership of approximately half the generation portfolio needed to replace our retiring coal plants. This presents incremental capital investment opportunities in 2022 and 2023. With respect to our safety management system implementation, it's important to know that even with our current pandemic response efforts, our broader safety enhancements remain a top priority. SMS continues to mature in our gas business and in 2020, we have begun to implement SMS in our electric business as well. We are enhancing risk identification through our Corrective Action Program, which is providing valuable analytical insights. We are also piloting the use of mobile gas leak detection technology and we're enhancing our gas emergency preparedness and response capabilities, including the deployment of new state-of-the-art mobile command centers. Safety remains the foundation of our business. Our safety enhancements are delivering value in multiple ways, including the activation of our enhanced incident command structure to manage through the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Donald, who will discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail. Donald? Thank you, Donald. Now let's turn to some highlights for the first quarter and early second quarter of 2020 from our gas operations on Slide 7. In Pennsylvania, we filed a base rate case last month with the Public Utility Commission seeking an annual revenue increase of $100.4 million to invest in, modernize and upgrade our existing natural gas distribution system as well as maintain the continued safety of the system. And order and new rates are expected to become effective in January 2021. The same day as our Pennsylvania rate case, we filed a petition with the PUC requesting authority to implement a temporary program that would make grants to residential customers who are experiencing a loss of income due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but who are not eligible to participate in our existing assistance programs. We proposed to use a portion of pipeline penalty credits that the PUC has previously approved for hardship funds, matched by a contribution from the NiSource Charitable Foundation to fund the grants. This is an example of how we're looking for ways to help our most vulnerable customers weather this pandemic financially, which is a priority for us across all of our states. In Ohio, the Public Utilities Commission approved our annual Infrastructure Replacement Program tracker adjustment. This order allows us to begin recovery of approximately $234 million in safety and infrastructure investments made in 2019. This well-established pipeline replacement program, authorized through 2022, covers replacement of priority mainline pipe and targeted customer service lines. New rates from this most recent filing went into effect this month. The Ohio Commission is also reviewing our latest annual adjustment request for our Capital Expenditure Program rider. This rider allows us to recover capital investments and related deferred expenses that are not recovered through the IRP. The pending application seeks to begin recovery of approximately a $185 million in capital invested in 2019 and an order is expected in August 2020. In Indiana, our application for a six-year extension of our long-term gas infrastructure modernization program remains pending before the Utility Regulatory Commission. The proposal includes nearly $950 million in capital investments through 2025, to be recovered through semi-annual adjustments to the existing gas Transmission, Distribution and Storage Improvement Charge or TDSIC tracker. The existing gas TDSIC program has been in place since 2014. An IURC order is expected in July 2020. Now, let's turn to our electric operations on Slide 8. Construction is underway on both the Rosewater and Jordan Creek wind projects. Both projects are expected to be replaced in service by the end of this year. Though inside that schedule, the Rosewater project could experience a construction delay due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we will continue to monitor closely any possible construction impacts related to the pandemic. The IURC on February 19th, 2020, approved our application for a third wind project, Indiana Crossroads, a joint venture with EDP Renewables North America. Indiana Crossroads will have an aggregate nameplate capacity of 302 megawatts and is expected to be in operation in the fourth quarter of 2021. Discussions continue with a number of commercial bidders who responded to our request for proposals which closed in November 2019. The RFP results were consistent with our 2018 integrated resource plan, which calls for 100% of our coal capacity to be retired by 2028, to be replaced by lower cost, reliable and cleaner options. The plan is expected to drive a 90% reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, and to save our electric customers more than $4 billion over 30 years. NIPSCO is considering all sources in the RFP process and is expecting to obtain adequate resources to facilitate the retirement of the R.M. Schahfer Generating Station in 2023. Currently, half of the capacity in the replacement plan is targeted to be owned by joint ventures that will include NIPSCO and unrelated financial investors as the members. The remaining new capacity is expected to be primarily in the form of purchase power agreements. NIPSCO expects to begin the appropriate regulatory compliance filings related to the new capacity as agreements are finalized with counterparties in 2020 and 2021. The planned replacement in 2023 of approximately 1,600 megawatts of retiring coal-fired generation could provide incremental NiSource capital investment opportunities for 2022 and 2023. We continued to execute on our seven-year electric infrastructure modernization program, which includes enhancements to our electric transmission and distribution system designed to further improve system safety and reliability. The program originally approved by the IURC in 2016, includes approximately $1.2 billion of electric infrastructure investments expected to be made through 2022. New rates under our latest modernization tracker update became effective in January 2020. Turning now to Slide 9. I'll focus on our system-wide safety enhancements. We are resolved to lead in safety and exceed existing industry standards anchored by three pillars, a culture where everyone is empowered to identify and report risk, process safety that adds layers of protection and enhanced asset risk analytics and management practices. Our ongoing implementation and refinement of a Safety Management System or SMS based on API's RP 1173 is driving improved planning and performance across our gas business. We've made great progress in our SMS implementation in our gas business and we begun to introduce these practices in our electric business as well. In our gas business, we have advanced the maturity of risk identification through the Corrective Action Program or CAP, which provides expanded insights and enhanced analytics. We are also piloting the use of mobile gas leak detection technology and we have also matured our gas emergency preparedness and response capabilities, including the ongoing deployment of new state-of-the-art mobile command centers. Ultimately, we're driving toward having new tools like CAP to help identify, analyze and proactively mitigate risk, new risk informed programs, projects and rate cases and more flexibility in risk investments. This work will continue to be a priority in 2020 and beyond. Turning to Slide 10. I'd like to focus for a moment on our ongoing focus on environmental, social and governance matters. While this slide is new to our presentation, our focus on ESG is not new. We have been reporting on ESG and sustainability for more than a decade now. As many of you likely have seen, we recently published our 2019 integrated annual report. If you haven't already, I encourage you to check it out at nisource.com. The report discusses our renewed commitment to strengthening our safety culture, modernizing our energy delivery infrastructure, transforming our electric business, reducing our emissions and contributing to the communities in which we live and work. Last summer, we published our 2018 Climate Report, also available at nisource.com, which is aligned with the framework developed by the task force on climate-related financial disclosures. We also have a track record of being recognized for our sustainability performance. For instance, we have been named to the Dow Jones North America Sustainability Index for six consecutive years. We've also been named to the FTSE4Good Index as well as the number of sustainability indexes maintained by S&P. We have an aggressive goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions 90% by 2030 from 2005 levels. We reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 13% in 2019, bringing the total decrease to 48% from 2005 levels. We were a founding member of the EPA's Methane Challenge Program in 2016 and we hold a top 20% environmental performance score from the Institutional Shareholder Services. And in January, we were named to the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index for the third consecutive year. The GEI tracks the financial performance of public companies committed to supporting gender equality through policy development, representation and transparency. We are committed to being recognized throughout our communities as one of the best places to work and grow and gender equality is a critical component of our inclusion and diversity efforts. Before we take your questions, I'll share and reiterate a few key takeaways. We remain focused on maintaining safe and reliable energy service through the COVID-19 pandemic. We have taken financial steps which position NiSource with ample liquidity to manage through the crisis and we're seeking supportive regulatory relief with respect to incremental pandemic expenses. We will continue to manage potential financial impacts and provide you more details as they become known. Consistent with recent years, we expect to complete $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in capital investments in 2020 and continue to expect to close on the CMA asset sale transaction in the third quarter and we remain committed to maintaining our current investment-grade credit ratings. We continue to prioritize safety initiatives across our footprint even as we manage through the pandemic. This includes implementation of our SMS, which continues to mature across our gas business and is being rolled out in our electric business in 2020. Our electric generation strategy is advancing with wind project construction continuing, our coal-fired generation retirement is on track and incremental capital investment opportunities identified as we further develop our replacement portfolio. Safety and infrastructure investments continue across our gas business with tracker updates progressing in a new base rate case filed in Pennsylvania. Thank you all for participating today [technical difficulty] of NiSource. We're now ready to take your questions. Mariyama? Thanks for the question. As we think about COVID and we're early on into trying to understand what this could mean to our business and the economies. I think it's little early to provide specific guidance on 2021. As we stated earlier, we haven't seen a significant impact in the first quarter, because of COVID on - from an expense standpoint or - as well as a revenue standpoint, but we do expect we will see lower customer demand and some higher bad debt expense. So I think as we get - go through the quarters, we'll be able to provide more guidance and insight as we learn what the impacts COVID will have on our business going forward. Again, we don't think it affects our long-term growth drivers, but we do want to understand how it may impact our financials this year and our starting point next year. And Julien, let me just... Talk a little bit of about - yeah, let me add just a little about of differentiation. When you think about the cost profile related to the CMA sale and the actions that we're taking there, those are really in the realm of changing cost structures on a permanent basis related to ongoing operations and largely across the shared enterprise platforms and in enterprise cost pools. Very different from what you might do to manage on a short-term basis through a downturn like this. Some of the discretionary spending that largely often comes back in future spending, it's timing of spending that you often look at for those kind of efforts. So I would differentiate the two efforts and highlight that our focus is on maintaining core strength for 2021 and beyond. So any cost shaping actions we'll take at the edge of this year will be to manage, as Donald said, through the tight spots here, but our core focus remains on execution capabilities and lean operating platforms for '21 and beyond. So there is a distinction there. They're - they maybe co-mingle at times but largely they're separate and distinct efforts. Yes, let me about the timing as we view it now and Donald can talk about the longer-term view to the extent it's coming into view at this point. So we're - as we noted earlier, we're in the negotiations phase with the bidders into the RFP. We expect to come through that here in the next few months. So I would expect to see the regulatory filings associated with that, CPCN is associated with that with the mix of PPAs and the JV tax equity structures later this summer, maybe around our Q2 call, we'll see. We'll just see how that plays out, but later this summer, we should have a lot more to talk about in terms of the mix and that would obviously lay out the timetable for investments on both sides of that equation. As it relates to the longer term CapEx and growth profile, let me ask Donald to talk about current outlook on that. Yes, sure, let me touch on it. I think probably, the most notable part of the profile from a low perspective is the concentration of energy intense industrials, the steel and petrochem profile that we have there. And those customers, as you may recall, are under a new rate structure that was implemented with the rate case from last year that essentially shifts the capacity commitment profile for us to the firm portion of the load and allows them to buy through to the market on a ongoing basis. A novel approach to derisk that for us and for them and for our other customers, and you will note, if you look at industrial sales, Q1 of '20 versus Q1 of '19, you'll note a decline in industrial sales, a significant portion of which is related to that buy through. So it's by design that we have some of that decline in there and we did see about a 6.5% decline on industrial electric Q1 '20 versus Q1 '19. The remainder is a pretty diverse set of sectors, the remainder of our commercial and industrial loads, pretty diverse set of sectors across a growing part of the state and so we see good diversity and good economic development there as well. We saw load and I would just highlight the load profile. If you look at the results for the quarter, on the electric side, residential load down quarter one versus quarter one of last year, same for commercial and that's been a bit of a continuing trend on use per customer. On - by contrast, on the gas side of the business, residential sales were up about 3% across our footprint year-on-year and commercial up close to 5%, all of which, as we noted before, was pre-COVID impact. So we're not really seeing COVID impacts in that. And then industrial, slightly down on the gas side. So - and we continue to see our customer count increase as we've gone through the first quarter here. We added a little more insight than you asked for, but I want to make sure the whole picture was in focus there. That all remains on track. We're, as you would expect, engaged right now with stakeholders in the early phases of that process. People continue to work through that even it with the COVID implications for work from home. We've seen very good progress on that. We expect that to close, as we noted earlier on the call, by the end of the third quarter of this year, would note that there is the possibility of some slight delay just from the workload issues and the way COVID might impact just working conditions, but we're confident in that. And we are viewing that and approaching that as a combined effort to resolve all matters related to Massachusetts, including the pipeline safety investigation. So it's all essentially on the table and in the mix together. Well, again, it's - again we've put all of the matters together into the sale. It's an opportunity for a comprehensive package to - for NiSource to exit the state and Eversource to take the ongoing operations. I'd actually expect that there would be savings that are ongoing. There is timing to some of the change in operations. If you think about doing a transaction, part of the work that we've got to do to separate will take multiple years. What we've got in this agreement is a transaction services agreement that lasts up to 30 months. And so as we analyze what that TSA looks like, we expect that we'll have some savings immediately, because we won't have to do that work and we can take the advantage of those savings opportunities. But over time, as the TSA comes off as well as we make other structural changes to our cost profile, that will take a couple of years. I could see it in the range - that being in the range of savings. It's really about optimizing the mix and starting with cost to customer as the key driver. When we analyze the RFP and the bids, we had a mix of PPA bids, bids that could go either PPA or JV and some straight JV and as we optimize that portfolio, the 50%-ish blend is what looks like the solution set that balances best cost to customer with the right ownership structure for us and opportunities for us, all subject to continuing negotiation and continuing evaluation, but that's a - that's kind of the target zone we're operating in right now. Yes. I think we'll take a one step at a time as we go through. We certainly want to look for ownership opportunities and investment opportunities and I would say we have a preference for that, but we want to do that in a balanced way that reflects the best interest of all of our stakeholders. And so we'll take each step in this, each tranche on a kind of an independent basis and look at the portfolio needs at a point in time. Right. Yes. It's a good, good question, because it's a reference case, but you almost use it as a reference from which you adjust what's different about today and what's different about this particular set of circumstances. And the one thing that, as we've said and Donald highlighted is difficult and you're seeing it all around is sector-by-sector, you could see very different depths and duration. Some that might bounce right back and might actually bounce back stronger, some that are likely to see a little bit slower recovery and maybe don't recover back to where they were prior to this. And it's that blend of almost sector-by-sector and across our seven states or six-states as we go into 2021, the unique blend of those different sectors that we are analyzing very carefully and trying to get indicators, if you will, of what recovery looks like. And so we're early in trying to get to the next level of detail on that, but I think ultimately, when you start to look at that, it's a very different profile than what we experienced in '08, '09 and as you noted, our mix is different. We now have, without the Pipeline Group as you noted and with the different rate structure for our large industrials more protections in place, so to speak. We're better positioned or better hedged against some of the risks we faced here. So it's really - starts to become more of a duration question I think, ultimately and that's why as we step through Q2, I think we're going to get a much better sense of what we're seeing both in April as Donald noted, we'll see that pretty soon. And then by the end of Q2, even being shoulder months for our whole business for the most part, it's more of the economic recovery that will give you the leading indicators for Q3, Q4 and beyond when we'll be out of the shoulders. So looking forward to having more depth and detail on that, I want to be careful not to try to either be overly optimistic or overly pessimistic. I think we just have to step through this with eyes wide open. It's really neither. It's more managing cash flow through this year and recognizing we're likely in a tight spot for a little while here and want to make sure we're prudent - taking prudent steps as we go. And as noted earlier, Donald talked about it, just by the nature of our capital portfolio, it's long dated and when we take a step like this, which by the way puts us on the same profile we've been on for the last couple of years, 17 to 18 is consistent with where we've been. This year, it was elevated a bit. So it's really just timing of key initiatives and probably blended across both tracked capital, growth capital and our maintenance capital. So likely to just have a very modest effect on the future. Yes, it's a good insight and a good question and you may notice that we've moved 2020 into roughly $10 million, roughly $70 million, roughly $20 million, because it's the nature of the $100 million pullback and how that ultimately lands, that will move a little bit across those different categories, but your question about the long term. If you look backwards, we had some larger generation projects and larger electric transmission projects that were in the mix and that's why you'd see the more pronounced shift in the mix back a few years. As you go forward, the next couple of years, what you see here is likely to be what we'll continue to see until and unless we get to the generation investments that we've been talking about, the replacement portfolio. We'd see a couple of years there of an excursion on what we view as the periodic rate cases or the maintenance and other. We would likely see those show up in that category for a short period of time, but obviously, we'd have that combined with a regulatory strategy for those kind of investments. Thanks, Mariyama, and thanks to all of you for your continued interest in and support of NiSource. As is the case for all of us, around the communities we serve and all of our stakeholders, we're navigating through this COVID crisis carefully and thoughtfully and we'll continue to stay transparent and talk with you about any implications we see and share any outlook on our business. We appreciate the time today and look forward to the next opportunity. Please stay safe."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q4 2021 NiSource Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. It's now my pleasure to turn today's call over to Mr. Chris Turnure, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nChristopher Turnure: Good morning, and welcome to the NiSource Fourth Quarter 2021 Investor Call. Joining me today are Lloyd Yates, our Chief Executive Officer; Donald Brown, our Chief Financial Officer; Shawn Anderson, our Chief Strategy and Risk Officer; Pablo Vegas, our Chief Operating Officer; and Randy Hulen, our VP of Investor Relations and Treasurer.  The purpose of this presentation is to review NiSource's financial performance for the fourth quarter and full year of 2021 as well as provide an update on our operations and growth drivers. Following our prepared remarks, we'll open the call to your questions. Slides for today's call are available on nisource.com.  Before turning the call over to Lloyd, Donald and Shawn, a quick reminder. Some of the statements made during this presentation will be forward-looking. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. Information concerning such risks and uncertainties is included in the MD&A section and Risk Factors sections of our periodic SEC filings.

With all of that out of the way, I'd like to turn the call over to Lloyd.\nLloyd Yates: Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we get started, I'd like to take a few moments to thank Joe Hamrock, my predecessor as President and CEO, for his outstanding service to NiSource. Joe retired last week as part of a long-planned transition. I'm grateful for Joe's leadership and his decade of service to this company. He left NiSource in a strong position poised for years of growth and success. We send him our best wishes as he begins the next chapter of his life.  I expect to build on the significant progress NiSource has made in the past year, including our strategic initiatives. NiSource Next, Safety Management System and Your Energy, Your Future, are transitioned to the future of energy. I want to take a step back and remind everyone of our mission, that is of NiSource being a great place to work where we are all relentlessly focused on safety, operational excellence, the customers' experience and delivering on our commitments to shareholders, as we did in 2021.  Our strategic initiatives are what will enable us to achieve our mission of being relentless champions of safety, comfort and service for our customers, and it will help set us up for long-term success. In short, these initiatives are all about people.  Our plans for investment-driven, long-term and sustainable growth remain on track. We continue to expect these plans to drive industry-leading compound growth of 7% to 9% in diluted net operating earnings per share through 2024. My experience in the past 2 years as the Board of Directors has given me unique insights for executing and extending NiSource's growth plan. I plan to conduct a review of the business with the goal of ensuring that we are best positioned to drive long-term value for all stakeholders. And I look forward to further discussing our strategic initiatives with our employees and with shareholders in the coming months.  Now let's start our discussion. Hopefully, you've all had a chance to read our fourth quarter earnings release, which we issued earlier today. As we look at NiSource results in 2021, we see strong financial and operational performance across key areas of the business. Advancing execution on our portfolio of renewable generation investments is matched by significant progress on regulatory initiatives across all our states. We are enhancing safety, providing customers with new ways to do business with us and moving forward on our plan to reduce Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions 90% by 2030 versus 2005 levels.  Let's now turn to Slide 3 and take a closer look at our key takeaways. I mentioned earlier our CEO succession. In addition to Joe's retirement, Sondra Barbour and Cassandra Lee, joined the NiSource Board of Directors. The additions of Sondra and Cassandra further strengthened the leadership, experience, diversity and talent on the NiSource Board.  Shifting to full year 2021 results. We exceeded both our original and updated guidance ranges. We reported earnings of $1.37 non-GAAP diluted net operating earnings per share or NOEPS. We are reaffirming our 2022 guidance of $1.42 to $1.48 diluted NOEPS non-GAAP, and we are reaffirming our forecast for 7% to 9% compound annual growth rate from 2021 through 2024, including near-term annual growth of 5% to 7% through 2023.  In 2022, we expect $2.4 billion to $2.7 billion in capital expenditures as we continue to execute our core infrastructure programs and our renewable generation plans. The preferred plan from NIPSCO's 2021 Integrated Resource Plan, or IRP, advances our intention to retire all coal-fired generations between 2026 and 2028. Opportunities for additional generation investments will be better understood, and we continue to analyze the results of the proposals received in the IRP process.  We received final orders in gas rate cases in Pennsylvania, Kentucky and Maryland, which provide balanced outcomes for all stakeholders. Ohio's case continues to advance towards a third quarter implementation, and NIPSCO's gas case is in constructive settlement discussions. Another key regulatory outcome is NIPSCO's electric TDSIC order, representing $1.6 billion of investments in safety, reliability and improved customer service.  Before we get into our specific NiSource utility highlights, I'd like to take a moment to call out our safety progress in 2021. NiSource has reached important safety milestones. They include substantially completing the installation of automated shutoff valves on our low-pressure gas systems. We also expanded deployment of Picarro advanced leak detection technology. We successfully completed Stage 1 of its certification of our Safety Management System by Lloyd's Register. And we bought an additional resources to strengthen our quality management system capabilities across all of our companies. I'm excited to say we expect to issue our very first annual sales report at about the same time as our annual report. I would encourage you to read more about our progress.  Now let's take a look at some NiSource gas distribution highlights for the fourth quarter, starting on Slide 9. The Columbia Gas of Ohio rate case continues to progress on schedule. The filing request an annual revenue increase $221 million, net of the trackers being rolled into base rates, which support continued investments in safety and reliability. We received an order approving a settlement in the Columbia Gas of Kentucky rate case. The settlement supports continued investments in safety and infrastructure replacement and includes an overall increase in revenues of approximately $18 million.  In Maryland, we received a final order from the Public Service Commission. The order includes a revenue increase of approximately $2.4 million.  The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved our rate case settlement as filed. It provides a revenue increase of $58.5 million, and new rates went into effect in late December. The settlement continues our program of infrastructure modernization, deploying safety and reliability.  We are engaged in constructive settlement discussions in NIPSCO's gas rate case. The case is focused on infrastructure modernization and providing safe, reliable service while remaining in compliance with state and federal nature requirements. If approved, new rates would take effect between September of this year and March of 2023.  Let's turn now to our electric operations on Slide 10. As noted earlier, NIPSCO's Electric TDSIC plan received final approval in December from the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, or IURC. This is a 5-year $1.6 billion program, which includes newly identified projects aimed at enhancing service and reliability for customers as well as some previously identified projects.  The other items on this slide relate to our renewable generation strategy, and I'll turn it over to Shawn Anderson to give more detail.\nShawn Anderson: Thank you, Lloyd. The preferred plan from NIPSCO's 2021 IRP confirmed the retirement of the last coal-fired generation unit at Michigan City as well as 2 vintage gas peaking units at the Schahfer Generating Station site and advance the window for these retirements to occur between 2026 and 2028. To support reliable generation when these units retire, enhancements to our portfolio will require replacement capacity from technology, including solar, stand-alone battery storage and natural gas taking resources. We estimate that the new investments of up to $750 million will be required to support the retirement of our last coal fired units.  As we evaluate the actual projects required to support these portfolio additions, we are evaluating all forms of technology, bid through the RFP process launched in May. We continue to analyze these proposals and complete due diligence on these projects available, which align with the preferred plan identified back in November.  We expect to be able to share the results of our analysis during the first half of 2022. Meanwhile, we are making steady progress on the execution and construction of renewable generation projects resulting from NIPSCO's 2018 IRP. We continue to expect to invest $2 billion in renewable generation by the end of 2023 to replace the retiring capacity at Schahfer.  Our most recent project to come online and begin operations is Indiana Crossroads I, a 302-megawatt wind facility, which entered service in December. This project joins the Rosewater and Jordan Creek wind farms already operational and contributing to NIPSCO's power generation fleet across 2021.  Meanwhile, we expect 4 additional projects to be in service by the end of this year. They are Dunns Bridge Solar I, Indiana Crossroads Solar, Brickyard Solar and Greensboro Solar. These projects will represent our first solar facilities, while the Greensboro project is our first project, which also includes storage. We expect the final 7 renewable generation projects needed to replace the retiring capacity of Schahfer to come online in 2023.  Our project and commercial teams continue to work tirelessly alongside our project partners to advance these projects as initially intended. As this work continues, we remain in close contact with some of the strongest developers in the renewable energy space regarding the progress of these projects and are actively monitoring any potential delays associated with the construction process, including the dynamic nature of the global supply chain.  NiSource also continues to engage with producers and developers focused on renewable natural gas, hydrogen and emerging storage technologies. We continue to support the advancement of these technologies and fuels to support accelerated and deeper decarbonization solutions, leveraging existing assets such as the natural gas system. We seek a risk-informed understanding of the options and technologies, which may emerge as pathways towards further decarbonization and are encouraged on how our communities and service territory could benefit from the development of these technologies.  Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald, who will discuss our 2021 financial performance in more detail.\nDonald Brown: Thanks, Shawn, and good morning, everyone. Before we dive in, I want to update everyone about our Investor Day. It will take place in May, and we'll get a specific date and location details to you as soon as they are finalized. We plan to provide an extension to our capital investment and growth plan, a detailed update on our generation transition and ESG profile as well as give you an opportunity to hear from the leaders of our businesses. I hope you will be able to attend, and I look forward to speaking with you. As Lloyd mentioned a few minutes ago, our 2021 earnings exceeded the top end of our guidance range of $1.32 to $1.36. We've also reaffirmed 2022 guidance of $1.42 to $1.48 and our long-term diluted NOEPS growth rates.  Looking at our full year 2021 results on Slide 4, we had non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $571 million or $1.37 per diluted share compared to non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $507 million or $1.32 per diluted share in 2020. The 2021 results reflect our ongoing execution of infrastructure investments and efficiencies resulting from our NiSource Next initiatives, offset somewhat by the sale of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts, which closed in October of 2020.  Taking a closer look at our segment non-GAAP results on Slide 5. Gas Distribution operating earnings were about $674 million for 2021, representing an increase of approximately $6 million versus last year. Operating revenues, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses, were lower by approximately $94 million due to the sale of CMA. Other operating expenses were lower by approximately $100 million due to the sale of CMA and our NiSource Next initiatives.  In our Electric segment, non-GAAP operating earnings for 2021 were about $387 million, which was about $25 million higher than in 2020. Operating revenues, net of the cost of energy and track expenses, increased by approximately $24 million, due primarily to infrastructure investment programs and increased customer demand. And other operating expenses were essentially flat to 2020 levels.  Now turning to Slide 6. I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of December 31 was about $9.8 billion, of which about $9.2 billion of long-term debt. The weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 14 years, and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 3.7%.  At the end of the fourth quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.6 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization programs. Last Friday, we successfully extended our revolving credit facility for another 5-year term. The new facility capacity remains at $1.85 billion with essentially the same borrowing terms.  We also continue our commitment to retaining our investment-grade credit ratings, and all 3 major rating agencies reaffirmed their ratings with stable outlooks in 2021. Taken together, this represents a solid financial foundation that will continue to support our long-term safety and infrastructure investments.  As you can see on Slide 7, we are reiterating our 2022 capital forecast of $2.4 billion to $2.7 billion.  Taking a quick look at Slide 8, which highlights our financing plan, there are no changes to our plan since April's equity unit issuance. I would highlight that this balanced financing plan continues to be consistent with all of our earnings growth and credit commitments.  Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. We're now ready to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Congratulations, Lloyd, again, on the latest opportunity for you. Can you perhaps give us some initial flavor by chance on what the strategy update might entail here? I know you made some comments already in the prepared remarks, but I know cost containment and reduction, admittedly has been top of mind for you, Lloyd. But wondering if you have any further thoughts you'd like to share at least at this point in terms of the process there in. I'm also cognizant that you stated in the prepared remarks that you still have this May time frame for an Analyst Day. But how are you thinking about this opportunity today and especially considering the inflationary backdrop that we've been talking with a lot of companies about?\nLloyd Yates: So thanks for your question, Julien. Let me start by saying, when you look at the current plan, I have a lot of confidence in the current plan. The current plan talks about 7% to 9% compound annual growth rate, and I think that's really good. Our strategic review is really going to take a hard look at how do we extend that plan past 2024.  So what does that mean? It means we want to look at everything. We're going to look hard at the portfolio, the current portfolio we have, and we want to look at the performance of that portfolio. Is that portfolio executing in a way that's providing -- is maximizing shareholder value? We're going to look at the content of that portfolio. Should we keep all of the LDCs or all the businesses we have? Should we buy some? Should we sell other businesses? But I think that's part of the view.  We're going to look hard at our cost structure and efficiency, productivity and some of our operational metrics. So we're just getting started on that. I think that we have a team, the Board will be involved, and that's moving forward, but a comprehensive look at the business.  And just to add a little bit to that, I think as a new CEO and on an ongoing basis, my plan is to constantly evaluate the NiSource portfolio to make sure we're maximizing shareholder value.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. And just if you can clarify that last comment, just in brief, what are the criteria here? How are you thinking about the merits? Or what kind of thresholds do we need to see in order to especially sell or divest other assets here and/or frankly, buy since you introduced them as well here, if you don't mind?\nLloyd Yates: I don't have the criteria established yet. A little bit too early for that. We are looking at the data points out there. We've seen the Dominion transaction. We've seen some of the other transactions. There will be data point that feed into our process. But I can't sit here and tell you I have the criteria established right now. I mean this is what my sixth day on the job. So I don't have all those things done yet, but we're working really hard on it.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes. Sorry, I don't mean to press you too much there. And just last little detail, if I can? Just on the solar projects here, I know that they're moving around a little bit because of the ongoing WRO policy backdrop. But no shift really in terms of meaningful earnings impact that you know of quite yet or more importantly, probably rate case timing, right?\nLloyd Yates: So not right now, but I'm going to turn it over to Shawn Anderson, maybe a little more detail on that.\nShawn Anderson: Yes. Thanks, Lloyd. Thanks for the question, Julien. You said it, it's premature to speculate how any potential the way might change the regulatory strategy here. And I know just as I did in my prepared remarks that we have not seen a delay yet that it's extended beyond the time line we initially planned for. So there's a lot that's going to play out here.  A couple of other considerations. Just to note, Indiana, as you probably already know, allows for a forward test year. We've utilized that historically for both our electric and gas cases in the past. So it has some precedent there. It also has some precedent for rate step implementations.  I think it's really important to remember that all of these projects have already received an approved CPCN. So while the timing might have some potential to flex we believe the need for these rate base additions is just really clear in terms of how they'll add value for our communities. So as you'd expect, we'll continue to be active, and we'll evaluate and monitor this and much more to come here in May or at the midpoint of 2022.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.\nDurgesh Chopra: Just -- Lloyd, congratulations on your appointment.\nLloyd Yates: Thank you.\nDurgesh Chopra: Just -- yes, sure. Just -- can you clarify for us on the Analyst Day in May, is that going to be extended through '28? Or do you have sort of a terminal year in mind that we're going to see your plans through?\nLloyd Yates: Yes, let me set expectations for our Analyst Day. I can't promise you on Analyst Day that our strategic review will be complete. I think that we'll have more clarity on where we are and what the plan looks like, but I want to dive in and understand the organization and the business a little better. We're talking about Analyst Day around the May time table. And I just don't believe we'll have the whole strategic review done by then. I think that's really fast.  So -- but I do think we'll have an idea of what the strategic review looks like and the time table for when will complete the strategic review by Analyst Day.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. That's very helpful. So it won't to be complete, but you'll give us sort of the book ends of what the process might look like and kind of when that process might come to a conclusion. But just in terms of like the extension of the CapEx plans and EPS growth, what year should we be expecting to see this plan get extended to?\nLloyd Yates: Let me turn it over to Donald, a little more detail on Analyst Day.\nDonald Brown: Yes. So thanks for the question. We are planning to extend the financial plan. If you think about that next IRP, the '21 IRP, we just filed last quarter. With the future retirement of Michigan City, we do want to take the plant out to at least the period of retiring that plant. So it would certainly be to 2027 or 2028, depending on what the outcome is there. And then certainly, we would provide an update on long-term strategy in the SG profile, as Lloyd has provided.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.\nJamieson Ward: It's Jamieson Ward on for Shar. We were wondering if -- just to piggyback on the last couple of questions about the Analyst Day and then one on the Indiana RFP. So we've got the 2028 year there. When you think about the way that you currently guide and provide disclosures, we were curious if we might expect to see some changes there or if we should be expecting to see the same type of disclosures, but simply moved forward out to future years. Would you use this as an opportunity to change the way you got?\nDonald Brown: It's something that we're exploring. We certainly want to look at the plan and how the plan comes out. We want to be able to communicate that in the most effective way for our shareholders. But if you still step back and you think about what drives our annual earnings, it's our annual CapEx programs and it's those trackers. That provides the predictability of our earnings growth and our cash flow growth.  And so that's always going to be the strong foundation of our long-term plan, but certainly want to make sure that as we look at the next phase of our plan. We're communicating that in a way that provides the most impact for shareholders to understand the long-term value of NiSource.\nJamieson Ward: Got it. And then on the Indiana IRP and the current RFP analysis, do you expect that you would have and include any amount of the $750 million of potential incremental CapEx there by the Analyst Day? Or would that be something that you'd be updating post Analyst Day?\nDonald Brown: Yes. That is our intention that, that next tranche of potential investment would be included in that financial plan at that time. So if you think about current last Analyst Day, we provided a range of the potential investment, and I'd expect would be in that same place in May.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar.\nTravis Miller: I was wondering, on the Indiana electric rate case, is there anything specific that has to happen either in your eyes or just administratively before you could file that later this year?\nLloyd Yates: Pablo, do you want to handle that one?\nPablo Vegas: Yes. Thanks for the question. No, I mean, I think we're set up in terms of the timing. What we're looking at right now is making sure that all the planned investments around the renewables that are going to be getting developed over the course of this year and next year and the timing issues we've talked about related to that are all going to line up with the expected in-service dates that we need in order to support that rate case.  All of the core approvals, the certificates for public convenience and necessity, the CPCNs, those have all been approved in advance. And so the prudence of these investments that we're going to do are essentially have been supported. So now it's just making sure that the timing of the projects aligns with the timing of the rate case and the windows for that rate case and that will be the driver, but everything is lined up for that for the second half of this year.\nTravis Miller: Okay. And then just real quick on that. It would be more the capital side of it than, say, anything that happened with operating expense, is that the idea that, that would be the biggest factor in terms of rate increase or whatever, right?\nPablo Vegas: Yes, that's right. It would be the CapEx associated with the renewable projects and when that would go in service and be considered using useful for the purpose of the rate case.\nTravis Miller: Perfect. Okay. Great. And then Lloyd, you obviously mentioned the portfolio review. If you were to make any kind of changes, particularly so, what would be the use of capital for that? And thinking particularly potential equity to fund either the electric side or some other initiatives, can you take me through your thought process in terms of how you use any kind of capital, incremental capital?\nLloyd Yates: I think there are a couple of ways to think about that. One is if you were to sell off some pieces of the portfolio, that would eliminate the need for equity in the future. So that's a possibility. There's also a possibility that if you're selling a piece of the portfolio or you could find some other attractive investments to make and whether it's in capital programs for Your Energy, Your Future on the ESG side or whether there are some attractive properties that we may want to purchase. So I think I don't want to speculate on that. But I think what we're trying to do is make the best use if we sell something, the best efficient use of that capital to add shareholder value.\nOperator: Your next question is from Richard Sunderland with JPMorgan.\nRichard Sunderland: Maybe just starting with Ohio, any sense on the near-term pace of the proceeding? Just really curious if you're seeing anything on the ground here?\nLloyd Yates: I don't know that Pablo handles the detail. I think Ohio is moving along at a what I'll call a reasonable pace. We don't have any concerns with Ohio, but it's just taking time. And Pablo, you want to give a little more detail if...\nNick Drew: Yes, happy to. Thanks, Richard. There's a lot on the docket at the PUCO right now. There's a DP&L case that is going to hearing. You've got a Duke electric case that is out there and is still in the discovery phase. And it's been a while since Columbia Gas of Ohio has filed the rate case. I'll say that about half or a little more than half of our total costs have already flowed through extensive reviews in our tracker programs, that we have over the last decade or so.  And so we're not expecting any issues or problems. The rate case is going fine. The next step is going to be to get the staff report. We expect to see that hopefully sometime in the next several weeks to a couple of months, and we're still projecting an overall rate case timing of concluding sometime in the middle of the year. But it's moving forward, as Lloyd said, as we would expect, and no concerns on our part there.\nRichard Sunderland: Understood. Maybe just one other one. What are the regulatory requirements with delivering the 2018 IRP projects? Curious if you see kind of supply chain risks within that context?\nLloyd Yates: Shawn.\nShawn Anderson: I'm sorry. Could you just repeat that the phone cut out right when you asked that question?\nRichard Sunderland: Apologies. Just the regulatory requirements with delivering the 2018 IRP projects and how you see supply chain risks specifically in that context?\nShawn Anderson: So the 2018 projects have all been approved from a CPCN standpoint. So that's the first step in the process. Well, there's a number of steps to process. That's the first real regulatory step that you've got to cross through that demonstrates the prudence.  In terms of the projects themselves, then they need to be executed. It's a process, of course, through the supply chain process to get the materials on site and then to construct the facilities, that could take 6 to 12 months, depending upon the size of the facility and where it's being constructed. That's where the remaining projects are outside the 3 that are operational, are in the construction phase or to-be-constructed phase and the project teams currently working with the developers to then stand those projects up. Right now, the schedule for the projects remains with 4 more projects to be COD or operational this year and then the remainder of the projects in 2023. That would all take you through construction.  And then as we've already sort of highlighted here on a rate case standpoint, you'll file a rate case and do a forward-look test year that moves through that in-service date to then pick up those investments as part of your regulatory requirement and your CapEx additions.\nRichard Sunderland: Got it. So just to be clear, it's really around timing of the rate case as we discussed earlier in terms of required delivery dates or other obligations coming out of the CPCN process, not so much to watch here. Is that fair?\nShawn Anderson: Yes, that's exactly right. And we'll step through each project individually. There's multiple steps through that in terms of getting those constructed, bringing materials on site, et cetera. So we'll step through each of those projects and then sweep all those investments into the rate case and proceed accordingly.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Ryan Levine with Citi.\nRyan Levine: A question for Lloyd. What are your priorities in the first 100 days as CEO? And more specifically, what work processes, streams are underway to evaluate the business operations as part of this broader business review?\nLloyd Yates: So I mean a couple of things that we're going to continue on. One is NiSource Next. We've taken some cost out of the business over the last couple of years with operational efficiencies. So we're going to kind of ramp up the next phase of NiSource Next.  I think as part of the strategic review process, we have an initiative called Your Energy, Your Future. When you look at that, that's retirement of the coal plants by 2028, what's the next phase of that, especially focused on the gas distribution system.  I think decarbonizing the gas distribution system is good for the customers, and I think it will present an opportunity for the company to make investments. So we're looking hard at that. And then as I mentioned earlier, continue to look hard at the portfolio. So those are probably the 3 focus areas.\nRyan Levine: And as you do this business review, should we look for some higher near-term costs to help evaluate these different options? And is the company doing this business review completely internally? Or is there more reliance on third-party consultants?\nLloyd Yates: Yes. I think the cost efficiencies that we know about today are in the current guidance. So when you look at our targets for next year and in the following year, the 7% to 9%, we have cost efficiencies built into those. We want to look harder to try and drive a little more. But right now, I mean those are the guidance numbers we have, and I have a lot of confidence in us hitting those numbers.\nRyan Levine: Okay. And then last question for me is, more specific on the quarter, what was the driver of some of the O&M cost declines in the electric business? And what drove some of the higher costs around O&M in the gas business?\nDonald Brown: Yes. When you look at the electric business, part of the cost decrease is related to shutdown of our coal plants, 2 of our Schahfer units that retired in 2021. And then on the gas business, it's continued spend an investment in our safety and SMS program. So we'll continue to see that over the next couple of years. But the objective of NiSource Next is to help mitigate the inflation that we see every year so that we can afford to continue to invest in safety and reliability.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs.\nInsoo Kim: My question, and it was more on the O&M side, but to piggyback up to your guys' comments on the higher gas O&M related to SMS. And my question was going to be kind of, have you hit a pretty good run rate in terms of the spending on the SMS side for safety and reliability purposes? Or are we seeing that continue to trend up over the years?  And Lloyd, you've talked about cost management as one of your key priorities as well. So other than this type of spend, which is definitely very important, I think, for the company, what are some other general areas of cost efficiencies that we should be looking out for?\nLloyd Yates: So let me start with SMS because I do -- I didn't mention it. So we are committed to continue with SMS. I think in this business, when I think about SMS, I think about operational excellence, I think that's table stakes in this business. We have to operate well and we have to continue to invest in those programs.  On the other hand, we're going to control the cost in those programs. We want to make sure that we invest effectively. And as a result of those programs, I think over time, you should get cost efficiencies out of them. So the cost ramps up a little bit, but as the people who operate get used to the new ways of doing business, you should gain efficiencies out of that.  And again, other issues -- not issues but in our guidance, we'll continue to look at corporate services, just like most companies, we're looking at productivity and any other cost that we spend in the business, making sure that those costs are aligned with other high-performing organizations.\nInsoo Kim: Understood. My only other question is, I think this is the second quarter that you've reiterated that 7% to 9%, but off technically a higher base and this time off of the actual 2021 results. So as we go forward, I guess, in future years, is that something that we should think about as something that you will do going forward and kind of guiding off of achievements on an annual basis -- on an actual basis?\nDonald Brown: Yes, I'd say it's too early for me to provide guidance on next year's results. And so give us some time. But again, I'll go back to the core drivers of our earnings. It's the annual CapEx programs, and that's really what provides that clarity and consistency of earnings and allows us to guide off of last year's earnings and an update off of that.  But I won't guide for 2023 yet. But certainly, I expect that we'll -- we've got confidence that we'll be in that 7% to 9% range off of 30 -- off of 2021.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Nicholas Campanella with Credit Suisse.\nNicholas Campanella: Just in terms of the strategic review comments and thinking about portfolio rotation, I recall when you sold the Massachusetts assets, you did have some dissynergies due to cost allocation model from the parent down to the OpCos. And I'm just curious if that hurdle exists kind of across the entire portfolio? And how we should kind of be thinking about that, if you are considering potentially rotating capital here?\nLloyd Yates: So I think that hurdle is going to exist across the portfolio. When you rotate something out, you got to deal with the dissynergies. I think that we're here and we need to manage those. We decide to rotate something off the portfolio, we have to consider that in the math, but we also have to consider the fact that you can -- dissynergies can be managed, and that will be a part of our strategic review process as we think about that. But we believe they can be managed.\nNicholas Campanella: Got it. And then just one for Donald on the 7% to 9% CAGR and just like the relevant puts and takes. You guys issued the equity units last spring and share count in the outer years can kind of move around depending on where those are remarketed. Does your updated 7% to 9% CAGR kind of take into account the increase in share price that we've seen since then?\nDonald Brown: It does. We're always paying attention to and updating our model for share price and share count that is in our guidance right now. But again, we want to make sure that we've got some cushion as share price moves around that we're not moving outside of our guidance. So we're confident where we are and certainly recognize the appreciation in the stock price over the last 1.5 years.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.\nSteven Fleishman: So Lloyd, just high level curious on the -- you've been around both now -- NiSource on the Board and at Electric Utilities over time. And curious if you have a view on kind of the mix between electric and gas? And is that an important aspect as part of your strategic review?\nLloyd Yates: I think it is, Steve. I think as we look at the strategic review, some of the companies that are receiving higher multiples have a higher mix of electric than gas, and I think we have to consider that as part of our strategic evaluation. And does that make sense? And is there -- are there opportunities to shift to more electric versus gas? I don't think we need to be out of gas. I think in the states that we operate in, gas is very valuable. It may not be popular, but it's valuable. So I think as we look at this portfolio, we have to consider all those options, but also consider where we operate.\nSteven Fleishman: Great. That's helpful. And then just -- I just wanted to follow up on the renewables projects because I just wanted to clarify maybe, I guess, with Shawn, just, are these projects all on schedule as of now? Or -- and just -- it sounded like they are on schedule, but then you're having to monitor everything. So I guess I just want to clarify just where things stand? And my recollection is you had pretty strong contract terms in the event that anything was delayed. So just could you remind us how you're protected there, if at all?\nShawn Anderson: Yes. Thanks, Steve. Appreciate the question. So all projects are currently scheduled to be in service by the end of 2023. That's the critical window. So we have the benefit of the remainder of the calendar for 2022 and 2023 for each project, which is at a different stage in its life cycle to work through what's necessary to get it into service by the end of 2023.  But that does require some active monitoring in terms of the partnership agreement, the developers themselves. They're all sophisticated top-tier developers. This is their critical core competency when you think of names like NextEra, EDPR and Vetergy. So there's diversity and that was intentional across the developers themselves so as not to have concentration risk around 1 developer, and we're working very closely with those developers as they continue to move through the process. But everything remains with a projected 2023 COD, and that's the critical date for us to watch.  And then in terms of contractual protections, each agreement is a little bit unique. But to your point, there are provisions to provide, NIPSCO capacity as it relates to the agreements. There's different levels of indemnity protection and flexibility in terms of even component suppliers when you start to get into the weeds of the agreements, each one is unique. But the important point for customers is that the energy is contracted at that price, that protects our customers, that's an important part of this. And that's what we're seeking for with all 14 of these projects.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of James Thalacker with BMO Capital Markets.\nJames Thalacker: Lloyd, just I guess circling back to your comments on the strategic review, I know you're just beginning the process, but it sounds like you're casting a fairly wide net, both in looking at both buying and selling assets. So going back to kind of Steve's question, is this kind of the initial scope is to kind of cast it wide and see what kind of falls out of that process? Or as part of the strategic review also looking at maybe even a more in-depth sort of view of how to sort of change the business profile, to your point, on the differences between the public market valuations on gas versus electric?\nLloyd Yates: Yes. So thanks for the question. And I think you're right. The goal here is to cast the net wide, to start broad and then kind of zoom back in. We're going to look at everything. And we're going to look at everything. So we're going to start wide cast back in, and we're going to take a hard look at everything. I think I've said it or I don't want to repeat myself, but we look at the portfolio, operational efficiencies, rotation, mix of electric versus gas, but everything is on the table is the point.\nJames Thalacker: Right. And then I guess the other question, and it's going -- and also's, I think Julien asked the question, too. But I know you -- and again, I realize you're 6 days on the job and we're starting this process. But when you kind of look at monetizations or even acquisitions, I'm assuming that there's probably some guideposts, whether it be credit accretion or maintenance of credit or EPS accretive. Do you see from your previous vantage point, a lot of opportunities to maybe go on the offensive and shift that mix through accretive acquisitions? Because in general, it seems like there's not a lot of really good values out there in the utility, especially when you go into a sort of a private market auction or even a competitive auction bid.\nLloyd Yates: Well, I think we're going to be -- if we buy, we're going to look for value. I mean, you got to say that. Our job is to create shareholder value, and we're going to look for accretive acquisitions if we purchase. If we sell, we want to try to get as much as we can for any asset that we have. And I think that's the challenge in the strategic evaluation. And everybody wants to accomplish the same objective, right, buy low, sell high.  So if we're in that game, I think how you look at those things and how you do that in your strategic, your criteria is going to be really important. But everything we do, I mean, is to gain shareholder value, which means we're going to try to get as many accretive -- we'll try to make everything accretive, but we also want to protect credit quality. And you got to pay attention to the balance sheet. So we get all those things, and we're going to get after it.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to the CEO, Mr. Lloyd Yates.\nLloyd Yates: So first of all, thank you for your questions. And I want to close by just to reiterate just a few key takeaways. Our 2021 earnings of $1.37 per share exceeded the top end of our guidance range. Number two, we're reaffirming our guidance for 2022, $1.42 to $1.48 per share, and our long-term growth commitments are reaffirmed as well.  Number three, we continue to evaluate NIPSCO's portion of the investment needed to replace the retiring coal-fired generation outlined in the preferred plan from the 2021 IRP. Four, our strong regulatory execution continues, further illustrated by -- we've got some late breaking news last night that NIPSCO reached the settlement principle in the gas rate case, but details to follow there. So I mean our regulatory team is really executing strong. And as Donald mentioned, we look forward to presenting the next phase of our strategy and financial plan at our Investor Day in May, where we will kind of give an update on where we're moving with our broad strategic review.  So thank you for your comments, and we appreciate you joining us this morning, and please stay safe. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Shawn Anderson",
            "content": "Thank you, Lloyd. The preferred plan from NIPSCO's 2021 IRP confirmed the retirement of the last coal-fired generation unit at Michigan City as well as 2 vintage gas peaking units at the Schahfer Generating Station site and advance the window for these retirements to occur between 2026 and 2028. To support reliable generation when these units retire, enhancements to our portfolio will require replacement capacity from technology, including solar, stand-alone battery storage and natural gas taking resources. We estimate that the new investments of up to $750 million will be required to support the retirement of our last coal fired units.  As we evaluate the actual projects required to support these portfolio additions, we are evaluating all forms of technology, bid through the RFP process launched in May. We continue to analyze these proposals and complete due diligence on these projects available, which align with the preferred plan identified back in November.  We expect to be able to share the results of our analysis during the first half of 2022. Meanwhile, we are making steady progress on the execution and construction of renewable generation projects resulting from NIPSCO's 2018 IRP. We continue to expect to invest $2 billion in renewable generation by the end of 2023 to replace the retiring capacity at Schahfer.  Our most recent project to come online and begin operations is Indiana Crossroads I, a 302-megawatt wind facility, which entered service in December. This project joins the Rosewater and Jordan Creek wind farms already operational and contributing to NIPSCO's power generation fleet across 2021.  Meanwhile, we expect 4 additional projects to be in service by the end of this year. They are Dunns Bridge Solar I, Indiana Crossroads Solar, Brickyard Solar and Greensboro Solar. These projects will represent our first solar facilities, while the Greensboro project is our first project, which also includes storage. We expect the final 7 renewable generation projects needed to replace the retiring capacity of Schahfer to come online in 2023.  Our project and commercial teams continue to work tirelessly alongside our project partners to advance these projects as initially intended. As this work continues, we remain in close contact with some of the strongest developers in the renewable energy space regarding the progress of these projects and are actively monitoring any potential delays associated with the construction process, including the dynamic nature of the global supply chain.  NiSource also continues to engage with producers and developers focused on renewable natural gas, hydrogen and emerging storage technologies. We continue to support the advancement of these technologies and fuels to support accelerated and deeper decarbonization solutions, leveraging existing assets such as the natural gas system. We seek a risk-informed understanding of the options and technologies, which may emerge as pathways towards further decarbonization and are encouraged on how our communities and service territory could benefit from the development of these technologies.  Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald, who will discuss our 2021 financial performance in more detail. Yes. Thanks, Lloyd. Thanks for the question, Julien. You said it, it's premature to speculate how any potential the way might change the regulatory strategy here. And I know just as I did in my prepared remarks that we have not seen a delay yet that it's extended beyond the time line we initially planned for. So there's a lot that's going to play out here.  A couple of other considerations. Just to note, Indiana, as you probably already know, allows for a forward test year. We've utilized that historically for both our electric and gas cases in the past. So it has some precedent there. It also has some precedent for rate step implementations.  I think it's really important to remember that all of these projects have already received an approved CPCN. So while the timing might have some potential to flex we believe the need for these rate base additions is just really clear in terms of how they'll add value for our communities. So as you'd expect, we'll continue to be active, and we'll evaluate and monitor this and much more to come here in May or at the midpoint of 2022. I'm sorry. Could you just repeat that the phone cut out right when you asked that question? So the 2018 projects have all been approved from a CPCN standpoint. So that's the first step in the process. Well, there's a number of steps to process. That's the first real regulatory step that you've got to cross through that demonstrates the prudence.  In terms of the projects themselves, then they need to be executed. It's a process, of course, through the supply chain process to get the materials on site and then to construct the facilities, that could take 6 to 12 months, depending upon the size of the facility and where it's being constructed. That's where the remaining projects are outside the 3 that are operational, are in the construction phase or to-be-constructed phase and the project teams currently working with the developers to then stand those projects up. Right now, the schedule for the projects remains with 4 more projects to be COD or operational this year and then the remainder of the projects in 2023. That would all take you through construction.  And then as we've already sort of highlighted here on a rate case standpoint, you'll file a rate case and do a forward-look test year that moves through that in-service date to then pick up those investments as part of your regulatory requirement and your CapEx additions. Yes, that's exactly right. And we'll step through each project individually. There's multiple steps through that in terms of getting those constructed, bringing materials on site, et cetera. So we'll step through each of those projects and then sweep all those investments into the rate case and proceed accordingly. Yes. Thanks, Steve. Appreciate the question. So all projects are currently scheduled to be in service by the end of 2023. That's the critical window. So we have the benefit of the remainder of the calendar for 2022 and 2023 for each project, which is at a different stage in its life cycle to work through what's necessary to get it into service by the end of 2023.

And that's what we're seeking for with all 14 of these projects."

            "name": "Pablo Vegas",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks for the question. No, I mean, I think we're set up in terms of the timing. What we're looking at right now is making sure that all the planned investments around the renewables that are going to be getting developed over the course of this year and next year and the timing issues we've talked about related to that are all going to line up with the expected in-service dates that we need in order to support that rate case.  All of the core approvals, the certificates for public convenience and necessity, the CPCNs, those have all been approved in advance. And so the prudence of these investments that we're going to do are essentially have been supported. So now it's just making sure that the timing of the projects aligns with the timing of the rate case and the windows for that rate case and that will be the driver, but everything is lined up for that for the second half of this year. Yes, that's right. It would be the CapEx associated with the renewable projects and when that would go in service and be considered using useful for the purpose of the rate case."

            "name": "Lloyd Yates",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we get started, I'd like to take a few moments to thank Joe Hamrock, my predecessor as President and CEO, for his outstanding service to NiSource. Joe retired last week as part of a long-planned transition. I'm grateful for Joe's leadership and his decade of service to this company. He left NiSource in a strong position poised for years of growth and success. We send him our best wishes as he begins the next chapter of his life.  I expect to build on the significant progress NiSource has made in the past year, including our strategic initiatives. NiSource Next, Safety Management System and Your Energy, Your Future, are transitioned to the future of energy. I want to take a step back and remind everyone of our mission, that is of NiSource being a great place to work where we are all relentlessly focused on safety, operational excellence, the customers' experience and delivering on our commitments to shareholders, as we did in 2021.  Our strategic initiatives are what will enable us to achieve our mission of being relentless champions of safety, comfort and service for our customers, and it will help set us up for long-term success. In short, these initiatives are all about people.  Our plans for investment-driven, long-term and sustainable growth remain on track. We continue to expect these plans to drive industry-leading compound growth of 7% to 9% in diluted net operating earnings per share through 2024. My experience in the past 2 years as the Board of Directors has given me unique insights for executing and extending NiSource's growth plan. I plan to conduct a review of the business with the goal of ensuring that we are best positioned to drive long-term value for all stakeholders. And I look forward to further discussing our strategic initiatives with our employees and with shareholders in the coming months.  Now let's start our discussion. Hopefully, you've all had a chance to read our fourth quarter earnings release, which we issued earlier today. As we look at NiSource results in 2021, we see strong financial and operational performance across key areas of the business. Advancing execution on our portfolio of renewable generation investments is matched by significant progress on regulatory initiatives across all our states. We are enhancing safety, providing customers with new ways to do business with us and moving forward on our plan to reduce Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions 90% by 2030 versus 2005 levels.  Let's now turn to Slide 3 and take a closer look at our key takeaways. I mentioned earlier our CEO succession. In addition to Joe's retirement, Sondra Barbour and Cassandra Lee, joined the NiSource Board of Directors. The additions of Sondra and Cassandra further strengthened the leadership, experience, diversity and talent on the NiSource Board.  Shifting to full year 2021 results. We exceeded both our original and updated guidance ranges. We reported earnings of $1.37 non-GAAP diluted net operating earnings per share or NOEPS. We are reaffirming our 2022 guidance of $1.42 to $1.48 diluted NOEPS non-GAAP, and we are reaffirming our forecast for 7% to 9% compound annual growth rate from 2021 through 2024, including near-term annual growth of 5% to 7% through 2023.  In 2022, we expect $2.4 billion to $2.7 billion in capital expenditures as we continue to execute our core infrastructure programs and our renewable generation plans. The preferred plan from NIPSCO's 2021 Integrated Resource Plan, or IRP, advances our intention to retire all coal-fired generations between 2026 and 2028. Opportunities for additional generation investments will be better understood, and we continue to analyze the results of the proposals received in the IRP process.  We received final orders in gas rate cases in Pennsylvania, Kentucky and Maryland, which provide balanced outcomes for all stakeholders. Ohio's case continues to advance towards a third quarter implementation, and NIPSCO's gas case is in constructive settlement discussions. Another key regulatory outcome is NIPSCO's electric TDSIC order, representing $1.6 billion of investments in safety, reliability and improved customer service.  Before we get into our specific NiSource utility highlights, I'd like to take a moment to call out our safety progress in 2021. NiSource has reached important safety milestones. They include substantially completing the installation of automated shutoff valves on our low-pressure gas systems. We also expanded deployment of Picarro advanced leak detection technology. We successfully completed Stage 1 of its certification of our Safety Management System by Lloyd's Register. And we bought an additional resources to strengthen our quality management system capabilities across all of our companies. I'm excited to say we expect to issue our very first annual sales report at about the same time as our annual report. I would encourage you to read more about our progress.  Now let's take a look at some NiSource gas distribution highlights for the fourth quarter, starting on Slide 9. The Columbia Gas of Ohio rate case continues to progress on schedule. The filing request an annual revenue increase $221 million, net of the trackers being rolled into base rates, which support continued investments in safety and reliability. We received an order approving a settlement in the Columbia Gas of Kentucky rate case. The settlement supports continued investments in safety and infrastructure replacement and includes an overall increase in revenues of approximately $18 million.  In Maryland, we received a final order from the Public Service Commission. The order includes a revenue increase of approximately $2.4 million.  The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved our rate case settlement as filed. It provides a revenue increase of $58.5 million, and new rates went into effect in late December. The settlement continues our program of infrastructure modernization, deploying safety and reliability.  We are engaged in constructive settlement discussions in NIPSCO's gas rate case. The case is focused on infrastructure modernization and providing safe, reliable service while remaining in compliance with state and federal nature requirements. If approved, new rates would take effect between September of this year and March of 2023.  Let's turn now to our electric operations on Slide 10. As noted earlier, NIPSCO's Electric TDSIC plan received final approval in December from the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, or IURC. This is a 5-year $1.6 billion program, which includes newly identified projects aimed at enhancing service and reliability for customers as well as some previously identified projects.  The other items on this slide relate to our renewable generation strategy, and I'll turn it over to Shawn Anderson to give more detail. So thanks for your question, Julien. Let me start by saying, when you look at the current plan, I have a lot of confidence in the current plan. The current plan talks about 7% to 9% compound annual growth rate, and I think that's really good. Our strategic review is really going to take a hard look at how do we extend that plan past 2024.  So what does that mean? It means we want to look at everything. We're going to look hard at the portfolio, the current portfolio we have, and we want to look at the performance of that portfolio. Is that portfolio executing in a way that's providing -- is maximizing shareholder value? We're going to look at the content of that portfolio. Should we keep all of the LDCs or all the businesses we have? Should we buy some? Should we sell other businesses? But I think that's part of the view.  We're going to look hard at our cost structure and efficiency, productivity and some of our operational metrics. So we're just getting started on that. I think that we have a team, the Board will be involved, and that's moving forward, but a comprehensive look at the business.  And just to add a little bit to that, I think as a new CEO and on an ongoing basis, my plan is to constantly evaluate the NiSource portfolio to make sure we're maximizing shareholder value. I don't have the criteria established yet. A little bit too early for that. We are looking at the data points out there. We've seen the Dominion transaction. We've seen some of the other transactions. There will be data point that feed into our process. But I can't sit here and tell you I have the criteria established right now. I mean this is what my sixth day on the job. So I don't have all those things done yet, but we're working really hard on it. So not right now, but I'm going to turn it over to Shawn Anderson, maybe a little more detail on that. Thank you. Yes, let me set expectations for our Analyst Day. I can't promise you on Analyst Day that our strategic review will be complete. I think that we'll have more clarity on where we are and what the plan looks like, but I want to dive in and understand the organization and the business a little better. We're talking about Analyst Day around the May time table. And I just don't believe we'll have the whole strategic review done by then. I think that's really fast.  So -- but I do think we'll have an idea of what the strategic review looks like and the time table for when will complete the strategic review by Analyst Day. Let me turn it over to Donald, a little more detail on Analyst Day. Pablo, do you want to handle that one? I think there are a couple of ways to think about that. One is if you were to sell off some pieces of the portfolio, that would eliminate the need for equity in the future. So that's a possibility. There's also a possibility that if you're selling a piece of the portfolio or you could find some other attractive investments to make and whether it's in capital programs for Your Energy, Your Future on the ESG side or whether there are some attractive properties that we may want to purchase. So I think I don't want to speculate on that. But I think what we're trying to do is make the best use if we sell something, the best efficient use of that capital to add shareholder value. I don't know that Pablo handles the detail. I think Ohio is moving along at a what I'll call a reasonable pace. We don't have any concerns with Ohio, but it's just taking time. And Pablo, you want to give a little more detail if... Shawn. So I mean a couple of things that we're going to continue on. One is NiSource Next. We've taken some cost out of the business over the last couple of years with operational efficiencies. So we're going to kind of ramp up the next phase of NiSource Next.  I think as part of the strategic review process, we have an initiative called Your Energy, Your Future. When you look at that, that's retirement of the coal plants by 2028, what's the next phase of that, especially focused on the gas distribution system.  I think decarbonizing the gas distribution system is good for the customers, and I think it will present an opportunity for the company to make investments. So we're looking hard at that. And then as I mentioned earlier, continue to look hard at the portfolio. So those are probably the 3 focus areas. Yes. I think the cost efficiencies that we know about today are in the current guidance. So when you look at our targets for next year and in the following year, the 7% to 9%, we have cost efficiencies built into those. We want to look harder to try and drive a little more. But right now, I mean those are the guidance numbers we have, and I have a lot of confidence in us hitting those numbers. So let me start with SMS because I do -- I didn't mention it. So we are committed to continue with SMS. I think in this business, when I think about SMS, I think about operational excellence, I think that's table stakes in this business. We have to operate well and we have to continue to invest in those programs.  On the other hand, we're going to control the cost in those programs. We want to make sure that we invest effectively. And as a result of those programs, I think over time, you should get cost efficiencies out of them. So the cost ramps up a little bit, but as the people who operate get used to the new ways of doing business, you should gain efficiencies out of that.  And again, other issues -- not issues but in our guidance, we'll continue to look at corporate services, just like most companies, we're looking at productivity and any other cost that we spend in the business, making sure that those costs are aligned with other high-performing organizations. So I think that hurdle is going to exist across the portfolio. When you rotate something out, you got to deal with the dissynergies. I think that we're here and we need to manage those. We decide to rotate something off the portfolio, we have to consider that in the math, but we also have to consider the fact that you can -- dissynergies can be managed, and that will be a part of our strategic review process as we think about that. But we believe they can be managed. I think it is, Steve. I think as we look at the strategic review, some of the companies that are receiving higher multiples have a higher mix of electric than gas, and I think we have to consider that as part of our strategic evaluation. And does that make sense? And is there -- are there opportunities to shift to more electric versus gas? I don't think we need to be out of gas. I think in the states that we operate in, gas is very valuable. It may not be popular, but it's valuable. So I think as we look at this portfolio, we have to consider all those options, but also consider where we operate. Yes. So thanks for the question. And I think you're right. The goal here is to cast the net wide, to start broad and then kind of zoom back in. We're going to look at everything. And we're going to look at everything. So we're going to start wide cast back in, and we're going to take a hard look at everything. I think I've said it or I don't want to repeat myself, but we look at the portfolio, operational efficiencies, rotation, mix of electric versus gas, but everything is on the table is the point. Well, I think we're going to be -- if we buy, we're going to look for value. I mean, you got to say that. Our job is to create shareholder value, and we're going to look for accretive acquisitions if we purchase. If we sell, we want to try to get as much as we can for any asset that we have. And I think that's the challenge in the strategic evaluation. And everybody wants to accomplish the same objective, right, buy low, sell high.  So if we're in that game, I think how you look at those things and how you do that in your strategic, your criteria is going to be really important. But everything we do, I mean, is to gain shareholder value, which means we're going to try to get as many accretive -- we'll try to make everything accretive, but we also want to protect credit quality. And you got to pay attention to the balance sheet. So we get all those things, and we're going to get after it. So first of all, thank you for your questions. And I want to close by just to reiterate just a few key takeaways. Our 2021 earnings of $1.37 per share exceeded the top end of our guidance range. Number two, we're reaffirming our guidance for 2022, $1.42 to $1.48 per share, and our long-term growth commitments are reaffirmed as well.  Number three, we continue to evaluate NIPSCO's portion of the investment needed to replace the retiring coal-fired generation outlined in the preferred plan from the 2021 IRP. Four, our strong regulatory execution continues, further illustrated by -- we've got some late breaking news last night that NIPSCO reached the settlement principle in the gas rate case, but details to follow there. So I mean our regulatory team is really executing strong. And as Donald mentioned, we look forward to presenting the next phase of our strategy and financial plan at our Investor Day in May, where we will kind of give an update on where we're moving with our broad strategic review.  So thank you for your comments, and we appreciate you joining us this morning, and please stay safe. Thank you."

            "content": "Thanks, Shawn, and good morning, everyone. Before we dive in, I want to update everyone about our Investor Day. It will take place in May, and we'll get a specific date and location details to you as soon as they are finalized. We plan to provide an extension to our capital investment and growth plan, a detailed update on our generation transition and ESG profile as well as give you an opportunity to hear from the leaders of our businesses. I hope you will be able to attend, and I look forward to speaking with you. As Lloyd mentioned a few minutes ago, our 2021 earnings exceeded the top end of our guidance range of $1.32 to $1.36. We've also reaffirmed 2022 guidance of $1.42 to $1.48 and our long-term diluted NOEPS growth rates.  Looking at our full year 2021 results on Slide 4, we had non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $571 million or $1.37 per diluted share compared to non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $507 million or $1.32 per diluted share in 2020. The 2021 results reflect our ongoing execution of infrastructure investments and efficiencies resulting from our NiSource Next initiatives, offset somewhat by the sale of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts, which closed in October of 2020.  Taking a closer look at our segment non-GAAP results on Slide 5. Gas Distribution operating earnings were about $674 million for 2021, representing an increase of approximately $6 million versus last year. Operating revenues, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses, were lower by approximately $94 million due to the sale of CMA. Other operating expenses were lower by approximately $100 million due to the sale of CMA and our NiSource Next initiatives.  In our Electric segment, non-GAAP operating earnings for 2021 were about $387 million, which was about $25 million higher than in 2020. Operating revenues, net of the cost of energy and track expenses, increased by approximately $24 million, due primarily to infrastructure investment programs and increased customer demand. And other operating expenses were essentially flat to 2020 levels.  Now turning to Slide 6. I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of December 31 was about $9.8 billion, of which about $9.2 billion of long-term debt. The weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 14 years, and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 3.7%.  At the end of the fourth quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.6 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization programs. Last Friday, we successfully extended our revolving credit facility for another 5-year term. The new facility capacity remains at $1.85 billion with essentially the same borrowing terms.  We also continue our commitment to retaining our investment-grade credit ratings, and all 3 major rating agencies reaffirmed their ratings with stable outlooks in 2021. Taken together, this represents a solid financial foundation that will continue to support our long-term safety and infrastructure investments.  As you can see on Slide 7, we are reiterating our 2022 capital forecast of $2.4 billion to $2.7 billion.  Taking a quick look at Slide 8, which highlights our financing plan, there are no changes to our plan since April's equity unit issuance. I would highlight that this balanced financing plan continues to be consistent with all of our earnings growth and credit commitments.  Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. We're now ready to take your questions. Yes. So thanks for the question. We are planning to extend the financial plan. If you think about that next IRP, the '21 IRP, we just filed last quarter. With the future retirement of Michigan City, we do want to take the plant out to at least the period of retiring that plant. So it would certainly be to 2027 or 2028, depending on what the outcome is there. And then certainly, we would provide an update on long-term strategy in the SG profile, as Lloyd has provided. It's something that we're exploring. We certainly want to look at the plan and how the plan comes out. We want to be able to communicate that in the most effective way for our shareholders. But if you still step back and you think about what drives our annual earnings, it's our annual CapEx programs and it's those trackers. That provides the predictability of our earnings growth and our cash flow growth.  And so that's always going to be the strong foundation of our long-term plan, but certainly want to make sure that as we look at the next phase of our plan. We're communicating that in a way that provides the most impact for shareholders to understand the long-term value of NiSource. Yes. That is our intention that, that next tranche of potential investment would be included in that financial plan at that time. So if you think about current last Analyst Day, we provided a range of the potential investment, and I'd expect would be in that same place in May. Yes. When you look at the electric business, part of the cost decrease is related to shutdown of our coal plants, 2 of our Schahfer units that retired in 2021. And then on the gas business, it's continued spend an investment in our safety and SMS program. So we'll continue to see that over the next couple of years. But the objective of NiSource Next is to help mitigate the inflation that we see every year so that we can afford to continue to invest in safety and reliability. Yes, I'd say it's too early for me to provide guidance on next year's results. And so give us some time. But again, I'll go back to the core drivers of our earnings. It's the annual CapEx programs, and that's really what provides that clarity and consistency of earnings and allows us to guide off of last year's earnings and an update off of that.  But I won't guide for 2023 yet. But certainly, I expect that we'll -- we've got confidence that we'll be in that 7% to 9% range off of 30 -- off of 2021. It does. We're always paying attention to and updating our model for share price and share count that is in our guidance right now. But again, we want to make sure that we've got some cushion as share price moves around that we're not moving outside of our guidance. So we're confident where we are and certainly recognize the appreciation in the stock price over the last 1.5 years."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q3 2021 NiSource Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.  Mr. Turnure, you may begin your conference.\nChris Turnure: For Joe Hamrock, Chief Executive Officer, Donald Brown, our Chief Risk Officer, and Randy Hugen, our VP of Investor Relations and Treasurer. The purpose of this presentation is to review NiSource's financial performance for the 3rd quarter of 2021, as well as provide an update on our operations and growth drivers, following our prepared remarks, we'll open the call to your questions. Slides for today's call are available on nisource.com. Before turning the call over to Joe, Donald, and Shawn.  Just a quick reminder. Some of the statements made during this presentation, we will be forward-looking. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. Information concerning such risks and uncertainties it included in the MD&A risk factors sections of our periodic SEC filings.  Additionally, some of the statements made on this call relate to non-GAAP measures. For additional information on the most directly comparable GAAP measure and a reconciliation of these measures, please refer to the supplemental slides and segment information. Including our full financial schedules available on NiSource.com. With all of that out of the way, I'd like to turn the call over to Joe.\nJoe Hamrock: Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Hopefully you've all had a chance to read our Third Quarter earnings release which we issued earlier today. Strong execution of NiSource's significant renewable energy investments continues to be the highlight of our foundation for future growth. And we continue to expect that our core infrastructure programs and renewable generation investments will drive industry-leading compound annual growth of 7% to 9% percent in diluted net operating earnings per share through 2024.  Growth driven by our commitment to safety, reliability, customer affordability, and sustainability. As we begin to refine our outlook for longer-term growth, the preferred path from NIPSCO 2021 integrated resource plan identifies additional investment opportunities while advancing the retirement of remaining coal-fired generation between 2026 and 2028. And it supports our plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 90% by 2030. Let's turn now to Slide 3, and take a closer look at our key takeaways.  We are updating our guidance for 2021 to target the top end of the range of a $1.32 to a $1.36 per share in non-GAAP diluted net operating earnings or and or EPS. We are also initiating guidance for 2022 of a $1.42 to a $1.48. and that is consistent with our 5 to 7% near-term growth commitment. Our long-term diluted EPS guidance of 7 to 9% through 2024 is now based on the expected top end of our 2021 guidance range. And we reaffirm 5% to 7% growth in 2023.  As I mentioned a moment ago, the preferred plan from NIPSCO's 2021 IRP advances our plans to retire remaining coal-fired generation between 2026 and 2028. As we shift to lower-cost, clean, and reliable generation. Investments of up to $750 million will be required to replace retiring coal-fired generation. The NIPSCO portion of this investment will be better understood following further evaluation of the proposals, we solicited associated with the IRP.  Our regulatory execution progresses with a proposed order approving a settlement in Pennsylvania, a settlement filed in Kentucky, and a proposed order in Maryland. In addition, we filled a gas rate case in Indiana in September. We achieved non-GAAP diluted NOEPS of $0.11 in the third quarter of 2021 versus $0.09 in 2020. Now let's look at some NiSource Utility's highlights for the 3rd quarter. Starting with our gas operations on Slide 9.  The Columbia Gas of Ohio rate case continues to progress. Net of the trackers being rolled into base rates, the filing requests an annual revenue increase of approximately $221 $221 million pending its decision next year from the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, new rates would be effective in mid-2022. NIPSCO filed a gas rate case on September 29th, requesting a revenue increase of a $115 million annually.  The case is focused on infrastructure modernization, and providing safe, reliable service while remaining in compliance with state and federal safety requirements. In Pennsylvania an administrative law judge issued a proposed order recommending that Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a settlement in our rate case. The settlement would increase revenue by $58.5 million with new rates effective December 29, of this year. The adjusted rates will help to continue investments in infrastructure upgrades, system reliability, and maintenance enhancements. We expect the commission's final order by mid-December.  In Kentucky, we have filed a proposed settlement of our rate case. The settlement includes an overall increase in revenues of $18.6 million to support continued investments in safety and replacing aging infrastructure. Columbia Gas of Maryland received a proposed order from an administrative law judge on Friday, recommending an increase of approximately $2.56 million in revenues as compared to our request of approximately $4.8 million.  We expect a final order from the Maryland Public Service Commission in December. Before we move on, I'd like to note that Columbia Gas of Ohio, our largest LDC is ranked number one in the Midwest region in JD Powers ' 2021 Gas Utility, Business Customer Satisfaction Study. Also, congratulations to our customer experience team for the successful launch of the Columbia Gas and NIPSCO mobile apps.  They're an important step forward in building our connected digital customer experience. Let's now turn to our electric operations on Slide 10.  NIPSCO electric T-disc plan is pending before the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission or IURC. This is a 5-year $1.6 billion proposal that would replace the previous plan, which NIPSCO filed in April to terminate. The pending plan includes newly identified projects aimed at enhancing service and reliability for customers, as well as some previously identified projects. The other items on this slide relate to our renewable generation strategy. And I'll turn it over to Shawn Anderson to give more detail.\nShawn Anderson: Thank you, Joe. The selection of the preferred path from NIPSCO's 2021 IRP is a significant milestone in our transition from coal-fired generation, towards cleaner and reliable forms of generation, all of which are expected to save NIPSCO customers approximately $4 billion over the long term. The preferred path from the 2021 IRP, refines the timelines to retire coal-fired generation at the Michigan City Generating Station to between 2026 and 2028.  It also calls for retirement of 2 vintage gas peaking units, 16A and 16 B, which are both located at the Schahfer Generating Station site. The most viable replacement option calls for a portfolio of resources including incremental solar, standalone battery storage, and natural gas peaking resources. We estimate that investment of up to $750 million will be required to support the retirement of these units.  We expect to be able to quantify the NIPSCO portion of this investment opportunity. In the first half of next year, after further evaluating bids and the request for proposals and completing due diligence on projects which align with the preferred path. Meanwhile, we continue to execute on a plan for retirement of remaining coal-fired generation at Schahfer. Units 14 and 15 retired as of October 1st, and units 17 and 18 are on track to retire by 2023.  We're making steady progress on the renewables project build-out, informed by the preferred path from NIPSCO's 2018 IRP. Our partners on these projects are some of the strongest developers in the renewable energy space. And we remain in close contact regarding the progress of these projects. We continue to expect to invest approximately $2 billion in renewable generation by 2023 to replace the retiring capacity at  As part of the execution of this plan, construction continues on the Indiana Crossroads one wind project, which is on track to become operational in the fourth quarter of this year. Construction has also started on a pair of solar projects. Dunns Bridge Solar I is being constructed by a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources under a build transfer agreement. EDP Renewables North America is building the Indiana Crossroads solar project, which will be operated as a joint venture. Both are expected to enter service next year.  The IURC provided regulatory approval of the Indiana Crossroads II Wind project on September 1. And with that action, all 14 renewables projects needed to replace the retiring capacity of Schahfer Generating Station have now received approval. In addition to the slate of renewables projects we have announced, NiSource plans to evaluate hydrogen and emerging storage technologies.  It's important for us to gain a risk informed understanding of the options and technologies that may emerge as pathways toward further de - carbonization. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Donald, who will discuss our third quarter financial performance in more detail.\nDonald Brown: Thanks, Shawn. And good morning, everyone. Before getting into the specific results, I just like to highlight the solid execution and progress that now has us guiding to the top end of our 2021 guidance range of $1.32 to $1.36. This new 2021 expectation also serves as the starting point for both our near-term and long-term growth commitment. We have also initiated 2022 guidance of a $1.42 to a $1.48, which at its midpoint represents a growth rate of over 6.6% from the 2021 top end.  Turning to our third quarter 2021 results on Slide 4, we had non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $47 million or $0.11 per diluted share, compared to non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $36 million or $0.09 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2020. The 2021 results reflect our ongoing execution of infrastructure investments, offset somewhat by the sale of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts, which closed in October of 2020. Looking more closely at our segment 3-month non-GAAP results from Slide 5, Gas Distribution operating earnings were about $18 million for the quarter, representing an increase of approximately $8 million versus last year. Operating revenue, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses, were down nearly $18 million due to the sale of CMA. Operating expenses, also, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were lower by about $26 million, mostly due to the CMA sale offset slightly by higher employee related costs and outside services spending.  In our Electric segment, 3-month non-GAAP operating earnings were about $130 million, which was nearly $3 million lower than the third quarter of 2020. Net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses, operating revenues decreased slightly by about $2 million due to slightly lower residential usage, offset by increased TDSIC revenues. Operating expenses, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were nearly flat compared to 2020.  Now, turning to Slide 6, I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of June 30 was about $9.6 billion of which about $9.2 billion of long-term debt. The weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 14 years, and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 3.7%.  At the end of the third quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.7 billion consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and other accounts receivable securitization programs. As we know that last quarter, all 3 major rating agencies have reaffirmed our investment grade credit ratings with stable outlooks in 2021. Taken together, this represents a solid financial foundation to continue the support for our long-term safety and infrastructure investments.  As you can see on slide seven, we've narrowed our 2021 capital investment estimate to approximately $2 billion, and reiterated our 2022 capital forecast of $2.4 to $2.7 billion. Taking a quick look at Slide 8, which highlights our financing plan. There are no changes to our plans since April's equity unit issuance. I would highlight that this balance financing plan continues to be consistent with all of our earnings growth, and credit commitments.  As I mentioned earlier, we have updated our 2021 earnings guidance, issued guidance for 2022 and reaffirmed our long-term growth commitments. I would also remind everyone that we're planning to provide an extension to our growth plan at an Investor Day during the first half of next year. So please stay tuned. Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. We're ready now to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, I would like to remind everyone. . Your first question comes from Richard Sunderland from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRichard Sunderland: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe starting with the IRP here. Curious to get outlined the guard rails on the potential investment in any gating items here as we progress to the update in the first-half of next year in terms of the high-low and where that could realistically fall in the $72 million?\nShawn Anderson: Thanks for that question. Good morning, this is Shawn. Ultimately, as you can imagine the range will be informed by the actual project selected. What we know now are the tranches of technology that we believe will provide the capacity. We need to step through the due diligence now to better understand those projects, and that will inform in some way, shape or form the specifics of the range.  So certainly, the selection of technology, the actual projects themselves, how efficient they can be constructed, those types of things will have a bearing on the ultimate CapEx for it. I'd also note that the MISO's Resource Adequacy rules, certainly as those finalized, could come into play a bit as well that we think that we've modeled those out and incorporated that in the indicative pathway.\nJoe Hamrock: Thanks, Shawn. Rich, let me just add. All else being comparable through that analysis, we have a bias to own these assets as we step through this next progression, and we believe we'll have a strong case and a value proposition for doing that. As Shawn noted the factors or guardrails, as you said, do include the MISO seasonal capacity factor, ultimate requirements in the evaluation of the proposals that is still underway. But also, the federal policy landscape that is a bit unpredictable right now, but that could shape timing and mix of investments as well. We look forward to being able to work through that in the next quarter or two.\nRichard Sunderland: Thanks Shawn. Maybe just following up on the federal aspects, could you unpack that a little bit more in terms of what could specifically impact the 2021 IRP considerations or maybe even more broadly, whether it's the financing plan. How could something like direct pay change those plans now?\nDonald Brown: Hi. I can take the direct pay question. Certainly, think that that provides some additional flexibility on how we finance our renewable investments. Certainly positive, if it allows us to reduce any equity needs for those future investments or external financing needs in terms of tax equity, but certainly need to understand how direct pay would be treated by our 6 jurisdictions from a base -- rate base in deferred tax standpoint.\nShawn Anderson: And then I just add on as it relates to how federal policy could shape the technology costs that we certainly can't speculate to that the 750 is a derivative of what we saw come through the RFP in May, related to the capacity and the technology required to meet that capacity, to the extent that the marketplace changes that efficiency. It again, it could get you back into a different selection of technology to comprise the capacity necessary. But you'd have to see how that federal policy landscape would impact that marketplace versus the due diligence, which we're performing on actionable projects that came through the RFP that we expect to be able to execute against.\nRichard Sunderland: Thank you, . Thank you for the time here. Thanks.\nJoe Hamrock: Thanks, Rich.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Insoo Kim from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nInsoo Kim: Yeah. Thank you. My first question is just going back to the RP, that $750 million potential. Is that the total opportunity set, whether it's Just TPA or owned or does it contemplate some percentage of ownership there? And then the follow-up to that is, if we're taking the more accelerated retirement options in the 2026 retirements, how much of that potential investment could come in the 2025 time period?\nShawn Anderson: Thank you for that. The 750 is the total inclusive number of investments expected to be able to functionally deliver the capacity, once the capacity gap is created through the retirement of Michigan City and  units, A and D. So, it'd be everything included. Also inclusive of the transmission that we anticipate necessary to construct to enable that to occur. And then in terms of timing, there is some flexibility because these projects in some ways could be a little bit modular in nature. It provides us a fair amount of flexibility to optimize that.  The transmission work, for example, is going to begin immediately, and it could take up to 3 years to complete the transmission work necessary to take those units offline. So, the other resources could be feathered in, likely starting in that 2024-time horizon. But we'll know a lot more through the first half of 2022, after we've gone through the due diligence process and started to select the exact projects that we think can deliver that capacity.\nInsoo Kim: Got it. That's good color. My second question is on the dividend policy, I think over the past, where this time around and then the past couple of years, I think the growth in the dividend has been a little bit more modest versus history, and as we get back into this more robust EPS, growth cycle, and I think you had a 60% to 70% payout ratio target as of the last disclosure. How should we think about some of the future dividend growth trends that we could see over the next few years?\nDonald Brown: Good morning. For the 60, 70% payout ratio that is still our guidance at this point, we will revisit our dividend on our -- in January as we normally do with the board. But when you look at our long-term plan and 7% to 9% EPS  that we've indicated, you certainly would expect to see growth in that range. Seeing growth along annually because of the earnings growth in that range of 60 to 70%. But again, we'll provide an update in January.\nInsoo Kim: Got it. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Julien Dumoulin -Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nCody Clark: Hey, good morning, this is actually Cody Clark on for Julien. Thanks for taking my questions.\nJoe Hamrock: Good morning, Cody.\nCody Clark: First, a housekeeping item and just to clarify, if I'm thinking about 2023 EPS, what base should I be using for the 5% to 7% growth? Is it the top end of '21 or the midpoint of the new '22 guidance?\nDonald Brown: I would use the top end of '21 as the guidance going forward for '22 and for long-term 7% to 9% EPS \nCody Clark: Okay. Got it. And then one of the main variables on NIPSCO share of  would be the breakdown of ownership versus PPA, and certainly understand the bias to own here. We're wondering if you can talk about how you, other stakeholders, and your regulators are thinking about ownership percentage of the resources? Have you had any conversations here or how do you think that's going to shake out?\nShawn Anderson: Thanks for that question. We have not had any discussions regarding ownership percentages. We've just focused on the tranche of technology delivered -- to deliver the capacity. And certainly, that's been the main focus to understand what the solutions and the pathway we expect to transpire. And then we would need to complete the full due diligence necessary on the projects themselves to better understand that ownership percentage, although I'd note that certain of these asset classes track towards a higher ownership percentage.  For example, a SugarCreek upgrade would make a lot of sense for us to own at our own plant. So, there is a bias down and some of these asset classes could track toward that. However, we'd need to complete the full due diligence to have a final point-of-view which we expect in the midpoint of next year.\nJoe Hamrock: I don't -- I'd only add to that, I'd note that key drivers, ultimately, the cost to customers over the life of the projects. And that's probably the first variable we look at for comparability across different ownership structures.\nCody Clark: So, looking forward to the first half update then, and we've seen some of your peers introduced longer-term capex and growth plans to highlight kind of the runway for spending. Do you see yourself in a position to be able to provide that level of disclosure when some of these spending items, around generation become a little bit clearer in the first half of next year?\nDonald Brown: Yeah. Absolutely. We are intending to have an Analyst Day somewhere in that first half of next year. The goal of that Analyst Day would be to provide more clarity around the next-generation investments to replace the Michigan City, as well as to extend the long-range plan for both our gas and electric businesses.\nCody Clark: Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks so much for the time and looking forward to seeing you all next week.\nJoe Hamrock: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Travis Miller from Morningstar. Please go ahead.\nTravis Miller : Good morning, everyone. Thank you.\nJoe Hamrock: Hey, good morning, Travis.\nTravis Miller : Question on the electric side of NIPSCO back to the IRP. How do you think about the timing and relationship between the IRP and as you go through the process, therapies, etc., and the T-Desk? Are regulators thinking about these in terms of the need for new transmission and distribution to supply and support the IRP? And how does that work?\nJoe Hamrock: Yes, that's a good question, Travis. The TDSIC really operates on kind of the existing transmission assets on maintenance and reliability improvements. Not so much new capacity related to new generation or retiring generation. So, there's no a direct relationship between Tejas. Depending Tejas schedule as you know it doesn't really depend in a meaningful way on the IRP. Typically, the projects we're looking at from the RFP within the integrated resource plan are tied to specific transmission investments that are inside the bids that we solicited. So, with those really don't crossover in a meaningful way.\nTravis Miller : Okay. So, we could see more transmission investment as you roll out some of the IRP steps?\nJoe Hamrock: That's right. Just like we have in the current cycle, we're in the 2 billion includes pretty healthy transmission investment as well.\nTravis Miller : Okay. Great. And then on the gas side, what are your latest thoughts on all the discussion about methane emissions? Where does that fit into your capex plan? Obviously, we've heard domestically and internationally.\nJoe Hamrock: The EPA methane rule is out now. We see clearly opportunities to improve the emissions profile, particularly that's focused on the upstream asset\u2019s exploration production, transmission, storage. A little bit of a light touch on our asset portfolio. But overall, we believe the right way to drive a cleaner profile for the gas business and the gas supply chain.  I would go to the other side and say, one of the provisions inside the pending legislation of the proposed legislation is the methane tax, which we are -- we think is a bad mechanism that basically just drives cost to customer without having the same effectiveness as the EPA methane will. Those 2 certainly work together but the methane rule is a better mechanism. And that helps to drive sustainability of natural gas and to do that in an affordable way, which we think is the right recipe.\nTravis Miller : Is there any upside to the gas capex, if the government U.S. or even international were to come down really hard on methane?\nJoe Hamrock: Yes,  will handle the methane rule for the distribution entities, still remains to be seen. We have to see how that rule plays out.\nTravis Miller : Okay. Great. Thanks so much.\nJoe Hamrock: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Peter, from Equity Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nDavid Peter: Hey, good morning, guys.\nJoe Hamrock: Good morning, David.\nDavid Peter: On the higher earnings outlook off the new base -- the 2021 base. Could you talk about some of the factors that are underlying that better outlook in the interim. And then through 24, and now you have a couple of bigger rate cases pending. Just wondering how sensitive to the the plan is to some of the outcomes there. And then just related to that, maybe you could comment where you are where you guys are at in those cases, I guess specifically, Ohio.\nDonald Brown: Thank you for the questions. Certainly, as we look at our plan it's really built on the modernization investments that we're making. Think about 75% of those investments being track, that gives us lots of confidence on our year-to-year earnings guidance. This year is a heavy year from a rate case standpoint. We did fall 5 base rate cases in our LDCs, we've got two supplements there and one other and Maryland, we're expecting to get an order in December and then the Ohio and NIPSCO case that we filed will have impact, significant impacts, from Ohio by the middle of next year and then the Fourth Quarter for NIPSCO.  That gives us confidence in our earnings guidance and the strength of overall growth plan. But that's what continues and really gives us confidence as we think about that 7% to 9% EPS growth, which includes a $2 billion of generation investments that are already approved through the Indiana Commission this year. So that's the strength of our plan. And that's where -- really what's gives us the confidence of being able to execute on that.  Otherwise, it comes down to O and M and managing that. We kicked off our nice horse next transformation program a little over a year ago. That is going well with our plan and our guidance. It really is intended to reduce costs to help offset inflation aspects for thinking long-term around customer affordability, but also improve the rigor of our processes and allow us to improve our safety and customer service to our customers.\nJoe Hamrock: And let me pick it up there on the related question around Ohio -- the Ohio rate case. Donald touched on its mid-year expectation in terms of the filing itself with the $221 million asked net of riders. So, there's a rider interplay there as well. But as we all know, not not a lot to report at this time as we all know, the PCO has been very busy. And so, as we see the current workload that the Commission play out, we would expect momentum to pick up no concerns with that. We're early in the schedule overall, but that said given that we're early and not a lot to report, as you would expect and as we expected, discovery activities have been heavy so far.  This being the first space case since 2008 for Columbia Gas of Ohio. So, no surprise there. And we believe that parties to the case recognize the long duration between the cases. And our strong investment history and commitment to the state across a range of different activities, including economic development. We remain confident in the mid-2020 resolutions and that's all baked into our outlook for next year.\nDavid Peter: Great. Thank you, I appreciate all the detail. I just had one follow-up just on the financing plan in around some of the things being proposed in Washington. Several of your peers have talked about how meaningful direct pay could be in helping find future renewable investments and lowering equity needs. Assuming that Options included on from guessing, it doesn't impact the approved projects at all since you've done the funding for that. But just in the RSP, there's the $750 million you've outlined. And I think historically you've said something like 60% equity content for new generation investments. But we effectively expect that to be materially reduced with the direct pay option?\nDonald Brown: Yeah. Let me address the equity content first. So, we think for the future investments, to the $750 million potential investment that we've got, it -- we would not need the same level of equity content. Our Balance Sheet is going to be in much stronger position by the end of 2023. And so certainly be in more typical regulatory cap structure of 50-50. But having said that, direct pay does provide some flexibility and potentially reducing the need for external financing or reducing equity needs. So, we do see it as a positive, but we've got to get more detail to understand how that would impact rate basis and deferred taxes to see what the pure impact would be to our financing plan.\nDavid Peter: Okay. Great. Thank you, guys.\nDonald Brown: Thanks, David.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim. Please go ahead.\nJames Moore: Hey guys, it's James Moore here on for Shar. How are you doing?\nJoe Hamrock: Good morning, James.\nJames Moore: Just curious with the IRP. If it's taking into account cost inflation for renewables when determining what the actual project costs will be, and if the submitting parties are going to be held to a fixed cost or if there's any allowance for cost inflation, and I have a second question on the gas side.\nShawn Anderson: Thanks, James. I'll take that. The estimate that we shared derives from the RFP process, which was for actionable projects towards the mid part of this decade which align with the contemplated retirement of 16 AB and initiative city. We have asked for a period of time for us to evaluate those projects.  When we go to the RFP marketplace, we ask for the opportunity to evaluate those for a period of time as you can imagine. We are still within that window, so we would be able to execute against those bids for those proposals still into 2022. And then continue through the refinement and due diligence process thereafter.\nJames Moore: Once the winners have been decided, just wanted to clarify if there's any potential for pass-through for higher commodity costs, higher other input costs, anything that could delay on components, etc., or if it's just like a fixed price, regardless of who the winners end up being, curious if you -- So it's not decidedly et?\nShawn Anderson: It's not decided yet, generally speaking, you'd think about it as a fixed cost that would then relate to that project, and that project is still executable through a window of time that it's been bid. That's really through 2024, 2025, maybe 2026, depending upon the project, and you'd have that fixed cost related to that project associated with that technology, to the extent that that bid is executed within this window that we're describing.  And to the extent that you continue due to -- through the due diligence process, you might understand more or less about what it would take on the total investment side. Most notably, transmission to action those projects.\nJames Moore: Got it. Thank you for the clarification there. The second questions on the LDCs. You've mentioned a number of times you're seeing an excess of 10% rate-base growth. First, how long should we think of that level of growth as being sustainable and now the follow up?\nJoe Hamrock: Yeah. I'll take the long view side of that question. If you look at the $40 billion of identified investments that we rolled out on Investor Day, just a little over a year ago, that\u2019s really predominantly on the kinds of investments that are already in flight in the gas business in particular. Electric flow a little different with the transition from coal to renewables and clean energy. So those are typically long-dated programs.  If you look at the underlying regulatory mechanisms like the T-Desk Gas Plan in NIPSCO, there's almost $1 billion of identified investment approved in the Gas TDSIC planned its multiyear beyond or 24 guidance horizons. Similarly, the Ohio IRP operates that way. In Virginia, the Gas Save program similarly. A lot of these are annualized programs with trackers that support them, that run beyond our current 2024 long-term guidance horizon.  I'm not going to guide to a specific point in time where 10% rate-base growth is predictable. That's the kind of update we'll give on Analyst Day next year. But the core point here is the underlying fundamental investment thesis is very long dated across all of the LDCs.\nJames Moore: Perfect that's those hoping you'd say and expecting their sort of leads into the second part of the question, given the recent attractive evaluation data points that we've been seeing for where the gas assets have been transacting. How do you think strategically about your 10% plus rate base growers versus long-term horizon station to win that other needs or other types of financing over your forecast horizon? Thank you.\nJoe Hamrock: Yes, I will take the front-end and ask Donald to touch on the financing side. So very much the same long-term strategic orientation. When we look at a portfolio of companies that have that kind of fundamental growth opportunity that we see as long dated and constructive jurisdictions that's well supported, any rotation would have to be accretive to a plan that reflects that kind of growth engine build and across really literally, each and every Company that we operate is -- has that same profile right now.  So, it's a strategic question about long-term growth first and foremost, that said we're very open-minded, very analytical about that very objective, and work very closely with our board to continuously assess that opportunity. As it comes to capital rotation and alternative forms of financing, let me ask Donald to touch on that side of the question.\nDonald Brown: It's a good question and certainly one we've gotten in the past. We'll continue to evaluate all forms of financing to finance our growth programs and our growth plan. it is a strategic question and we certainly want to think about how we enhance that plan long-term, certainly as you think about that next level of generation investments, here we'll evaluate that as well to see what makes the best sense for us long-term.\nJames Moore: Perfect. Thank you very much for the color and for taking my questions.\nJoe Hamrock: Thanks, James.\nOperator: And there are no further question at this time, I will turn the call back over to the presenters for closing remarks.\nJoe Hamrock: Hey, thanks, Julien. Thank you all for your questions. Let me just close by reiterating a few of the key takeaways from our release today. We are targeting the top end of our guidance range for  and we  the investments needed to replace this capacity will be evaluated in the coming months with an expectation to roll out more clarity and precision on that at an Investor Day to be held in the latter part of the first half of next year.  Our progress on the gas rate cases continues. We've got settlements on the table, or orders awaited in three states and filing of a new case in Indiana and along with the Ohio case that's pending. And finally, again, we do look forward to the steps between now and on Investor Day at the end of the first half of 2022. Key opportunity for us to extend this long-term growth trajectory. And we do appreciate you for joining us this morning. We know it's a busy day for all of you, so please stay safe and make it a good day. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call and you may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Joe. The selection of the preferred path from NIPSCO's 2021 IRP is a significant milestone in our transition from coal-fired generation, towards cleaner and reliable forms of generation, all of which are expected to save NIPSCO customers approximately $4 billion over the long term. The preferred path from the 2021 IRP, refines the timelines to retire coal-fired generation at the Michigan City Generating Station to between 2026 and 2028.  It also calls for retirement of 2 vintage gas peaking units, 16A and 16 B, which are both located at the Schahfer Generating Station site. The most viable replacement option calls for a portfolio of resources including incremental solar, standalone battery storage, and natural gas peaking resources. We estimate that investment of up to $750 million will be required to support the retirement of these units.  We expect to be able to quantify the NIPSCO portion of this investment opportunity. In the first half of next year, after further evaluating bids and the request for proposals and completing due diligence on projects which align with the preferred path. Meanwhile, we continue to execute on a plan for retirement of remaining coal-fired generation at Schahfer. Units 14 and 15 retired as of October 1st, and units 17 and 18 are on track to retire by 2023.  We're making steady progress on the renewables project build-out, informed by the preferred path from NIPSCO's 2018 IRP. Our partners on these projects are some of the strongest developers in the renewable energy space. And we remain in close contact regarding the progress of these projects. We continue to expect to invest approximately $2 billion in renewable generation by 2023 to replace the retiring capacity at  As part of the execution of this plan, construction continues on the Indiana Crossroads one wind project, which is on track to become operational in the fourth quarter of this year. Construction has also started on a pair of solar projects. Dunns Bridge Solar I is being constructed by a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources under a build transfer agreement. EDP Renewables North America is building the Indiana Crossroads solar project, which will be operated as a joint venture. Both are expected to enter service next year.  The IURC provided regulatory approval of the Indiana Crossroads II Wind project on September 1. And with that action, all 14 renewables projects needed to replace the retiring capacity of Schahfer Generating Station have now received approval. In addition to the slate of renewables projects we have announced, NiSource plans to evaluate hydrogen and emerging storage technologies.  It's important for us to gain a risk informed understanding of the options and technologies that may emerge as pathways toward further de - carbonization. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Donald, who will discuss our third quarter financial performance in more detail. Thanks for that question. Good morning, this is Shawn. Ultimately, as you can imagine the range will be informed by the actual project selected. What we know now are the tranches of technology that we believe will provide the capacity. We need to step through the due diligence now to better understand those projects, and that will inform in some way, shape or form the specifics of the range.  So certainly, the selection of technology, the actual projects themselves, how efficient they can be constructed, those types of things will have a bearing on the ultimate CapEx for it. I'd also note that the MISO's Resource Adequacy rules, certainly as those finalized, could come into play a bit as well that we think that we've modeled those out and incorporated that in the indicative pathway. And then I just add on as it relates to how federal policy could shape the technology costs that we certainly can't speculate to that the 750 is a derivative of what we saw come through the RFP in May, related to the capacity and the technology required to meet that capacity, to the extent that the marketplace changes that efficiency. It again, it could get you back into a different selection of technology to comprise the capacity necessary. But you'd have to see how that federal policy landscape would impact that marketplace versus the due diligence, which we're performing on actionable projects that came through the RFP that we expect to be able to execute against. Thank you for that. The 750 is the total inclusive number of investments expected to be able to functionally deliver the capacity, once the capacity gap is created through the retirement of Michigan City and  units, A and D. So, it'd be everything included. Also inclusive of the transmission that we anticipate necessary to construct to enable that to occur.

But we'll know a lot more through the first half of 2022, after we've gone through the due diligence process and started to select the exact projects that we think can deliver that capacity.

            "content": "Thanks, Shawn. And good morning, everyone. Before getting into the specific results, I just like to highlight the solid execution and progress that now has us guiding to the top end of our 2021 guidance range of $1.32 to $1.36. This new 2021 expectation also serves as the starting point for both our near-term and long-term growth commitment. We have also initiated 2022 guidance of a $1.42 to a $1.48, which at its midpoint represents a growth rate of over 6.6% from the 2021 top end.  Turning to our third quarter 2021 results on Slide 4, we had non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $47 million or $0.11 per diluted share, compared to non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $36 million or $0.09 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2020. The 2021 results reflect our ongoing execution of infrastructure investments, offset somewhat by the sale of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts, which closed in October of 2020. Looking more closely at our segment 3-month non-GAAP results from Slide 5, Gas Distribution operating earnings were about $18 million for the quarter, representing an increase of approximately $8 million versus last year. Operating revenue, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses, were down nearly $18 million due to the sale of CMA. Operating expenses, also, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were lower by about $26 million, mostly due to the CMA sale offset slightly by higher employee related costs and outside services spending.  In our Electric segment, 3-month non-GAAP operating earnings were about $130 million, which was nearly $3 million lower than the third quarter of 2020. Net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses, operating revenues decreased slightly by about $2 million due to slightly lower residential usage, offset by increased TDSIC revenues. Operating expenses, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were nearly flat compared to 2020.  Now, turning to Slide 6, I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of June 30 was about $9.6 billion of which about $9.2 billion of long-term debt. The weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 14 years, and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 3.7%.  At the end of the third quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.7 billion consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and other accounts receivable securitization programs. As we know that last quarter, all 3 major rating agencies have reaffirmed our investment grade credit ratings with stable outlooks in 2021. Taken together, this represents a solid financial foundation to continue the support for our long-term safety and infrastructure investments.  As you can see on slide seven, we've narrowed our 2021 capital investment estimate to approximately $2 billion, and reiterated our 2022 capital forecast of $2.4 to $2.7 billion. Taking a quick look at Slide 8, which highlights our financing plan. There are no changes to our plans since April's equity unit issuance. I would highlight that this balance financing plan continues to be consistent with all of our earnings growth, and credit commitments.  As I mentioned earlier, we have updated our 2021 earnings guidance, issued guidance for 2022 and reaffirmed our long-term growth commitments. I would also remind everyone that we're planning to provide an extension to our growth plan at an Investor Day during the first half of next year. So please stay tuned. Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. We're ready now to take your questions. Hi. I can take the direct pay question. Certainly, think that that provides some additional flexibility on how we finance our renewable investments. Certainly positive, if it allows us to reduce any equity needs for those future investments or external financing needs in terms of tax equity, but certainly need to understand how direct pay would be treated by our 6 jurisdictions from a base -- rate base in deferred tax standpoint. Good morning. For the 60, 70% payout ratio that is still our guidance at this point, we will revisit our dividend on our -- in January as we normally do with the board. But when you look at our long-term plan and 7% to 9% EPS  that we've indicated, you certainly would expect to see growth in that range. Seeing growth along annually because of the earnings growth in that range of 60 to 70%. But again, we'll provide an update in January. I would use the top end of '21 as the guidance going forward for '22 and for long-term 7% to 9% EPS Yeah. Absolutely. We are intending to have an Analyst Day somewhere in that first half of next year. The goal of that Analyst Day would be to provide more clarity around the next-generation investments to replace the Michigan City, as well as to extend the long-range plan for both our gas and electric businesses. Thank you for the questions. Certainly, as we look at our plan it's really built on the modernization investments that we're making. Think about 75% of those investments being track, that gives us lots of confidence on our year-to-year earnings guidance. This year is a heavy year from a rate case standpoint. We did fall 5 base rate cases in our LDCs, we've got two supplements there and one other and Maryland, we're expecting to get an order in December and then the Ohio and NIPSCO case that we filed will have impact, significant impacts, from Ohio by the middle of next year and then the Fourth Quarter for NIPSCO.  That gives us confidence in our earnings guidance and the strength of overall growth plan. But that's what continues and really gives us confidence as we think about that 7% to 9% EPS growth, which includes a $2 billion of generation investments that are already approved through the Indiana Commission this year. So that's the strength of our plan. And that's where -- really what's gives us the confidence of being able to execute on that.  Otherwise, it comes down to O and M and managing that. We kicked off our nice horse next transformation program a little over a year ago. That is going well with our plan and our guidance. It really is intended to reduce costs to help offset inflation aspects for thinking long-term around customer affordability, but also improve the rigor of our processes and allow us to improve our safety and customer service to our customers. Yeah. Let me address the equity content first. So, we think for the future investments, to the $750 million potential investment that we've got, it -- we would not need the same level of equity content. Our Balance Sheet is going to be in much stronger position by the end of 2023. And so certainly be in more typical regulatory cap structure of 50-50. But having said that, direct pay does provide some flexibility and potentially reducing the need for external financing or reducing equity needs. So, we do see it as a positive, but we've got to get more detail to understand how that would impact rate basis and deferred taxes to see what the pure impact would be to our financing plan. Thanks, David. It's a good question and certainly one we've gotten in the past. We'll continue to evaluate all forms of financing to finance our growth programs and our growth plan. it is a strategic question and we certainly want to think about how we enhance that plan long-term, certainly as you think about that next level of generation investments, here we'll evaluate that as well to see what makes the best sense for us long-term."

Hopefully you've all had a chance to read our Third Quarter earnings release which we issued earlier today. Strong execution of NiSource's significant renewable energy investments continues to be the highlight of our foundation for future growth. And we continue to expect that our core infrastructure programs and renewable generation investments will drive industry-leading compound annual growth of 7% to 9% percent in diluted net operating earnings per share through 2024.  Growth driven by our commitment to safety, reliability, customer affordability, and sustainability. As we begin to refine our outlook for longer-term growth, the preferred path from NIPSCO 2021 integrated resource plan identifies additional investment opportunities while advancing the retirement of remaining coal-fired generation between 2026 and 2028. And it supports our plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 90% by 2030. Let's turn now to Slide 3, and take a closer look at our key takeaways.  We are updating our guidance for 2021 to target the top end of the range of a $1.32 to a $1.36 per share in non-GAAP diluted net operating earnings or and or EPS. We are also initiating guidance for 2022 of a $1.42 to a $1.48. and that is consistent with our 5 to 7% near-term growth commitment. Our long-term diluted EPS guidance of 7 to 9% through 2024 is now based on the expected top end of our 2021 guidance range. And we reaffirm 5% to 7% growth in 2023.  As I mentioned a moment ago, the preferred plan from NIPSCO's 2021 IRP advances our plans to retire remaining coal-fired generation between 2026 and 2028. As we shift to lower-cost, clean, and reliable generation. Investments of up to $750 million will be required to replace retiring coal-fired generation. The NIPSCO portion of this investment will be better understood following further evaluation of the proposals, we solicited associated with the IRP.  Our regulatory execution progresses with a proposed order approving a settlement in Pennsylvania, a settlement filed in Kentucky, and a proposed order in Maryland. In addition, we filled a gas rate case in Indiana in September. We achieved non-GAAP diluted NOEPS of $0.11 in the third quarter of 2021 versus $0.09 in 2020. Now let's look at some NiSource Utility's highlights for the 3rd quarter. Starting with our gas operations on Slide 9.  The Columbia Gas of Ohio rate case continues to progress. Net of the trackers being rolled into base rates, the filing requests an annual revenue increase of approximately $221 $221 million pending its decision next year from the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, new rates would be effective in mid-2022. NIPSCO filed a gas rate case on September 29th, requesting a revenue increase of a $115 million annually.  The case is focused on infrastructure modernization, and providing safe, reliable service while remaining in compliance with state and federal safety requirements. In Pennsylvania an administrative law judge issued a proposed order recommending that Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a settlement in our rate case. The settlement would increase revenue by $58.5 million with new rates effective December 29, of this year. The adjusted rates will help to continue investments in infrastructure upgrades, system reliability, and maintenance enhancements. We expect the commission's final order by mid-December.  In Kentucky, we have filed a proposed settlement of our rate case. The settlement includes an overall increase in revenues of $18.6 million to support continued investments in safety and replacing aging infrastructure. Columbia Gas of Maryland received a proposed order from an administrative law judge on Friday, recommending an increase of approximately $2.56 million in revenues as compared to our request of approximately $4.8 million.  We expect a final order from the Maryland Public Service Commission in December. Before we move on, I'd like to note that Columbia Gas of Ohio, our largest LDC is ranked number one in the Midwest region in JD Powers ' 2021 Gas Utility, Business Customer Satisfaction Study. Also, congratulations to our customer experience team for the successful launch of the Columbia Gas and NIPSCO mobile apps.  They're an important step forward in building our connected digital customer experience. Let's now turn to our electric operations on Slide 10.  NIPSCO electric T-disc plan is pending before the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission or IURC. This is a 5-year $1.6 billion proposal that would replace the previous plan, which NIPSCO filed in April to terminate. The pending plan includes newly identified projects aimed at enhancing service and reliability for customers, as well as some previously identified projects. The other items on this slide relate to our renewable generation strategy. And I'll turn it over to Shawn Anderson to give more detail. Thanks, Shawn. Rich, let me just add. All else being comparable through that analysis, we have a bias to own these assets as we step through this next progression, and we believe we'll have a strong case and a value proposition for doing that. As Shawn noted the factors or guardrails, as you said, do include the MISO seasonal capacity factor, ultimate requirements in the evaluation of the proposals that is still underway. But also, the federal policy landscape that is a bit unpredictable right now, but that could shape timing and mix of investments as well. We look forward to being able to work through that in the next quarter or two. Thanks, Rich. Good morning, Cody. I don't -- I'd only add to that, I'd note that key drivers, ultimately, the cost to customers over the life of the projects. And that's probably the first variable we look at for comparability across different ownership structures. Thank you. Hey, good morning, Travis. Yes, that's a good question, Travis. The TDSIC really operates on kind of the existing transmission assets on maintenance and reliability improvements. Not so much new capacity related to new generation or retiring generation. So, there's no a direct relationship between Tejas. Depending Tejas schedule as you know it doesn't really depend in a meaningful way on the IRP. Typically, the projects we're looking at from the RFP within the integrated resource plan are tied to specific transmission investments that are inside the bids that we solicited. So, with those really don't crossover in a meaningful way. That's right. Just like we have in the current cycle, we're in the 2 billion includes pretty healthy transmission investment as well. The EPA methane rule is out now. We see clearly opportunities to improve the emissions profile, particularly that's focused on the upstream asset's exploration production, transmission, storage. A little bit of a light touch on our asset portfolio. But overall, we believe the right way to drive a cleaner profile for the gas business and the gas supply chain.  I would go to the other side and say, one of the provisions inside the pending legislation of the proposed legislation is the methane tax, which we are -- we think is a bad mechanism that basically just drives cost to customer without having the same effectiveness as the EPA methane will. Those 2 certainly work together but the methane rule is a better mechanism. And that helps to drive sustainability of natural gas and to do that in an affordable way, which we think is the right recipe. Yes,  will handle the methane rule for the distribution entities, still remains to be seen. We have to see how that rule plays out. Thank you. Good morning, David. And let me pick it up there on the related question around Ohio -- the Ohio rate case. Donald touched on its mid-year expectation in terms of the filing itself with the $221 million asked net of riders. So, there's a rider interplay there as well. But as we all know, not not a lot to report at this time as we all know, the PCO has been very busy. And so, as we see the current workload that the Commission play out, we would expect momentum to pick up no concerns with that. We're early in the schedule overall, but that said given that we're early and not a lot to report, as you would expect and as we expected, discovery activities have been heavy so far.  This being the first space case since 2008 for Columbia Gas of Ohio. So, no surprise there. And we believe that parties to the case recognize the long duration between the cases. And our strong investment history and commitment to the state across a range of different activities, including economic development. We remain confident in the mid-2020 resolutions and that's all baked into our outlook for next year. Good morning, James. Yeah. I'll take the long view side of that question. If you look at the $40 billion of identified investments that we rolled out on Investor Day, just a little over a year ago, that's really predominantly on the kinds of investments that are already in flight in the gas business in particular. Electric flow a little different with the transition from coal to renewables and clean energy. So those are typically long-dated programs.  If you look at the underlying regulatory mechanisms like the T-Desk Gas Plan in NIPSCO, there's almost $1 billion of identified investment approved in the Gas TDSIC planned its multiyear beyond or 24 guidance horizons. Similarly, the Ohio IRP operates that way. In Virginia, the Gas Save program similarly. A lot of these are annualized programs with trackers that support them, that run beyond our current 2024 long-term guidance horizon.  I'm not going to guide to a specific point in time where 10% rate-base growth is predictable. That's the kind of update we'll give on Analyst Day next year. But the core point here is the underlying fundamental investment thesis is very long dated across all of the LDCs. Yes, I will take the front-end and ask Donald to touch on the financing side. So very much the same long-term strategic orientation. When we look at a portfolio of companies that have that kind of fundamental growth opportunity that we see as long dated and constructive jurisdictions that's well supported, any rotation would have to be accretive to a plan that reflects that kind of growth engine build and across really literally, each and every Company that we operate is -- has that same profile right now.  So, it's a strategic question about long-term growth first and foremost, that said we're very open-minded, very analytical about that very objective, and work very closely with our board to continuously assess that opportunity. As it comes to capital rotation and alternative forms of financing, let me ask Donald to touch on that side of the question. Thanks, James. Hey, thanks, Julien. Thank you all for your questions. Let me just close by reiterating a few of the key takeaways from our release today. We are targeting the top end of our guidance range for  and we  the investments needed to replace this capacity will be evaluated in the coming months with an expectation to roll out more clarity and precision on that at an Investor Day to be held in the latter part of the first half of next year.  Our progress on the gas rate cases continues. We've got settlements on the table, or orders awaited in three states and filing of a new case in Indiana and along with the Ohio case that's pending. And finally, again, we do look forward to the steps between now and on Investor Day at the end of the first half of 2022. Key opportunity for us to extend this long-term growth trajectory. And we do appreciate you for joining us this morning. We know it's a busy day for all of you, so please stay safe and make it a good day. Thank you."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the NiSource Second Quarter 2021 Investor Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Chris Turnure, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nChris Turnure: Good morning, and welcome to the NiSource second quarter 2021 investor call. Joining me today are Joe Hamrock, our Chief Executive Officer; Donald Brown, our Chief Financial Officer; Shawn Anderson, our Chief Strategy and Risk Officer; and Randy Hulen, our VP of Investor Relations and Treasurer. The purpose of this presentation is to review NiSource\u2019s financial performance for the second quarter of 2021 as well as provide an update on our operations and growth drivers. Following our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open the call to your questions. Slides for today\u2019s call are available on nisource.com. Before turning the call over to Joe, Donald and Shawn, just a quick reminder, some of the statements made during this presentation will be forward-looking. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. Information concerning such risks and uncertainties is included in the MD&A and Risk Factors sections of our periodic SEC filings. Additionally, some of the statements made on this call relate to non-GAAP measures. For additional information on the most directly comparable GAAP measure and a reconciliation of these measures, please refer to the supplemental slides and segment information, included in our full financial schedules available at nisource.com. With all that out of the way, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Joe.\nJoe Hamrock: Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Hopefully, you\u2019ve all had a chance to read our second quarter earnings release, which we issued earlier today. We made significant progress in our generation transition and the current renewable replacement plan with Indiana commission approval now received for all of our joint venture renewable projects. In addition, we have received more than 180 proposals in our 2021 Integrated Resource Plan or IRP process, which will inform our generation replacement strategy in Indiana beyond 2023. We continue to expect that our infrastructure programs and generation investments will drive compound annual growth of 7% to 9% in diluted net operating earnings per share from 2021 through 2024 while reducing greenhouse gas emissions 90% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. Let\u2019s turn now to Slide 3 and take a closer look at our key takeaways. In the second quarter, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net operating earnings of $0.13 per share results reflect safety and modernization investments, COVID impacts, and they reflect the profile of our business without Columbia Gas of Massachusetts. We are reaffirming our earnings guidance and long-term financial commitments. We expect 2021 earnings of 41.32 to $1.36 per share in non-GAAP diluted net operating earnings. We continue to expect annual growth, safety and modernization investments of $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion, plus approximately $2 billion in renewables and associated transmission investments through 2023. NiSource expects to grow its diluted net operating earnings per share by 7% to 9% on a compound annual growth rate basis from 2021 through 2024 including near-term annual growth of 5% to 7% through 2023. As I mentioned, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission has approved 13 of our 14 proposed renewable energy projects and the new RFP for electric capacity and energy associated with NIPSCO\u2019s 2021 IRP that is currently underway has drawn strong engagement from the vendor community. In other parts of our business, we filed rate cases in Ohio, Kentucky, and Maryland during the quarter, in addition to the case filed during the first quarter in Pennsylvania, where we are in advanced settlement discussions. Safety advancements continue across NiSource guided by our implementation of the industries safety management system, which serves as our core operating model. Recent advancements include the accelerated integration of contractors into our safety plans and deployment of Picarro advanced leak detection technology in two more states. Our environmental performance targets represent another vital commitment. I\u2019m pleased to say that we remain on target. We expect to reduce total greenhouse gas emissions 90% by 2030 from 2005 levels. That includes a 50% reduction in methane emissions from gas mains and services by 2025. On that commitment, NiSource has already achieved an estimated 39% reduction in pipeline methane emissions compared to 2005 levels. Our infrastructure replacement programs are driving these improvements. Also last year, more than 1 million of our customers participated in our energy efficiency programs. On that note, let\u2019s look at some NiSource utilities highlights for the second quarter, starting with our gas operations on Slide 9. The Ohio rate cases, one of three new rate cases filed in the second quarter. We\u2019re requesting an annual revenue increase of approximately $221 million net of the trackers being rolled into base rates, pending a decision from the PUCO. New rates would be effective in mid-2022. In Kentucky, we filed a request for an approximately $27 million annual revenue increase net of trackers. And in Maryland, we filed a case on May 14, once again, net of trackers requesting about a $5 million annual revenue increase. New rates are proposed to go into effect in December of this year. In Pennsylvania, we filed a case just before the end of the first quarter, requesting an annual increase in revenue of approximately $98 million. Now let\u2019s look at our electric operations on Slide 10. I\u2019ll touch on NIPSCO\u2019s Electric TDSIC plan. We\u2019ve filed a new five-year plan in June. The $1.6 billion plan includes newly identified projects aimed at enhancing service and reliability for customers as well as some previously identified projects. We expect to receive an order from the IURC in December of this year. The other items on this slide relate to our transition out of coal generation, and I\u2019ll turn it over to Shawn Anderson to give more detail.\nShawn Anderson: Thank you, Joe. We continue to be encouraged by the strong progress, advancing our renewable generation projects stemming from NIPSCO\u2019s 2018 IRP. Over the course of the last three months, eight renewables projects informed by the 2018 IRP preferred pathway received approval from the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. This brings NIPSCO to the verge of an important milestone with 13 of 14 renewables projects approved to advance and replace the retiring capacity of the Schahfer Generating Station. Importantly, this includes all joint venture projects and leaves Crossroads II Wind, a power purchase agreement as the only project awaiting approval. Combining these new generating facilities, with a number of transmission projects to support system reliability across the new footprint. NiSource continues to track toward approximately $2 billion of renewable generation investments through 2023. We are excited, these projects will produce clean, reliable power for our communities, while saving NIPSCO customers, approximately $4 billion over the long-term. While the commercial and regulatory processes have advanced to support the preferred pathway from the 2018 IRP. NIPSCO\u2019s 2021 IRP process is well underway and continues to track within its timeline. As noted in our release, in second quarter, we completed a request for proposal solicitation, similar to the process deployed in 2018. We are pleased with the response in terms of both the quality and the quantity of the proposals, which continues to show high levels of engagement in the vendor community as we advance our generation transition. Furthermore, with these more than 180 proposals covering a wide range of technologies and ownership constructs. It continues to point to a robust market across generation technologies, which will drive value for our customers and stakeholders. A few notes about the process and timing, the IRP analysis that we are currently stepping through. We\u2019ll utilize data from the RFP to help inform the broad resource portfolio options for NIPSCO, in terms of Michigan City retirement timing, choices of replacement technologies and ownership constructs. We will share directional findings with stakeholders at public advisory meetings in the third quarter, incorporating stakeholder feedback along the way. We expect to develop the stakeholder supported preferred resource path within the 2021 IRP, which will be submitted to the IURC on or before November 1. Once the preferred plan is finalized and communicated, execution activities could commence, which may include commercial negotiations and further due diligence on specific assets or projects. Any specific projects then identified which support this preferred plan would represent incremental projects beyond the 14 highlighted earlier and in addition to the approximately $2 billion in renewable investments, NIPSCO has already filed. These are significant steps within NiSource and are part of our energy transition, which we were calling your energy, your future. As we work with stakeholders to create a dependable, affordable, and sustainable energy model, delivering the reliability our customers can trust. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Donald, who will discuss our second quarter financial performance in more detail.\nDonald Brown: Thanks, Shawn, and good morning, everyone. Looking at our second quarter 2021 results on Slide 4, we had non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $53 million or $0.13 per diluted share compared to non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $50 million or $0.13 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2020. I would note that 2021 results exclude earnings related to Columbia Gas of Massachusetts, due to the sale closing in October of 2020. Looking more closely at our segment three months non-GAAP results on Slide 5, gas distribution operating earnings were about $66 million for the quarter, representing a decline of approximately $8 million versus last year. Operating revenues, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were down about $28 million due to the sale of CMA and partially offset by increased infrastructure program revenues and customer growth. Operating expenses, also net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were lower by about $20 million, mostly due to the CMA sale offset by higher employee related costs and outside services spending. In our Electric segment, three months non-GAAP operating earnings were about $85 million, which was nearly $5 million lower than the second quarter of 2020. Operating revenues rose about $11 million, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses due to infrastructure investments and increased customer usage. Operating expenses, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were up about $16 million due to generation related maintenance and employee-related costs. Now turning to Slide 6, I\u2019d like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of June 30 was about $9.2 billion, which about $9.1 billion was long-term debt. The weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 15 years and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 3.7%. At the end of the second quarter, we maintain net available liquidity of about $2.2 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization program. With Moody\u2019s recently concluding their latest credit review, all three major rating agencies have reaffirmed our investment grade credit ratings with stable outlooks in 2021. Taken together, this represents a solid financial foundation to continue to support our long-term safety and infrastructure investments. Let\u2019s take a quick look at Slide 8, which highlights our financing plan. There are no changes to our plan since last quarter\u2019s equity unit issuance. Last quarter\u2019s issuance had significantly de-risked our financing plans and it\u2019s consistent with all of our earnings and credit commitments. As Joe mentioned in our key takeaways, we are reaffirming our 2021 earnings guidance and long-term financial commitments. I should remind everyone that we\u2019re stating the guidance and diluted earnings per share due to last quarter\u2019s equity issuance. Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest and support of NiSource. We\u2019re now ready to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Insoo Kim from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nInsoo Kim: Thank you. Good morning. My first question is on, I think the topic of the potential asset modernization that we have been talking about the past few months, it seems like just on these slides, that language is no longer on there. Just wanting to get your color and latest thoughts on any potential for that in your planning period and whether in the near-term, it\u2019s just that given the equity units and other funding that\u2019s already planned for the base CapEx, whether there is no immediate fee to raise that type of cash for further CapEx.\nJoe Hamrock: Yes. Good morning, Insoo. Thanks for joining us. You should not read anything into that slide update. We remain focused on long-term shareholder value that hasn\u2019t changed and we\u2019re evaluating market conditions and our portfolio as an ongoing part of that process. And so though it\u2019s related to the financing, as you noted, we continue to view any asset still is primarily a strategic decision based on long-term shareholder value, more than as a way to satisfy any near-term financing need. And that\u2019s really, I mean, we\u2019ve stated it over and over, that\u2019s underpinned by our plan that drives 7% to 9% long-term growth inclusive of all financing in the current planning horizon and without any assets sales. So clearly a strategic shift would need to enhance. What\u2019s already a strong plan? That said, given our exceptionally large known CapEx cycle, potential future investment opportunities that will unfold as we go forward and continued modest equity funding needs that go along with that or meaning our ATM program. It shouldn\u2019t be surprising that we\u2019re not taking those options off the table, just because it\u2019s not on a slide, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not continuing to be on the table. And those factors can converge with strategic alternatives at any point in time. So I appreciate the question.\nInsoo Kim: Got it. That makes a lot of sense. My other question is, just on the electric demand growth that you\u2019ve seen this quarter and year-to-date, Indiana seems like a pretty robust rebound, especially in the commercial and industrials. How does that trend compare versus your expectations, I guess earlier in the year. And are you seeing momentum that\u2019s continuing as we head into the second half.\nDonald Brown: I\u2019ll take that, good morning. I think what you\u2019re seeing on the C&I sales in electric business really is the impact of COVID last year in the second quarter. That second quarter where you had the businesses shutdown and certainly our largest customers shutdown operations had the biggest financial impact on us in that second quarter. So that\u2019s the recovery what you\u2019re seeing. And it certainly, as we expected and what we plan for, so very good outcome. And I\u2019d say on the smaller commercial, we continue to feed a recovery there. Again, that\u2019s expected in part of our plan and we\u2019ll continue to monitor and manage that.\nInsoo Kim: Got it. And just going forward, I guess when things \u2013 when we think about normal low growth overall, what\u2019s a good rule of thumb type of level we should be thinking there.\nDonald Brown: Yes. On the electric side, taking out the industrial, the largest industrial, which is pretty stable for the other customer classes we\u2019re seeing in the 1% range, maybe a little less than 1%.\nInsoo Kim: Understood. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey, good morning, team. Thanks for taking my question. Just on the 2021 IRP, I\u2019m just thinking about, of course, can you confirm for us that any incremental capital spend coming out of that 2021 IRP in Indiana that would be sort of above and beyond your current CapEx plan, am I thinking about this the right way.\nJoe Hamrock: Yes, that\u2019s right. I think you said that right, Durgesh. Anything we that emerges from that from the IRP process would set up our planning cycle for next year and would allow us to roll forward our CapEx plan. But it\u2019s too early to predict how that\u2019ll play out, given where we are in the IRP.\nDurgesh Chopra: That\u2019s great. And then just thinking about, you obviously had a lot of success in the 2018 IRP, $2 billion in CapEx. Should we think about the upside or directionally, I mean, I guess if I were the handicap CapEx opportunities is the 2018 IRP as sort of a good starting point to make that assessment.\nJoe Hamrock: Yes. I think it\u2019s little too early to say that, because the IRP itself is sets up the plan. There are other factors outside of the IRP, notably, MISO\u2019s continuing evolution of capacity credits and how to think about that, the evolving picture that we see through the RFP that we\u2019re running here. So I think of it as an envelope that you\u2019ll see, when we file the IRP, an envelope of opportunity. And all else being equal, our bias being to seek the investment opportunities that come through that plan. So we\u2019ll know a lot more as we get through the coming stages of the IRP. And then beyond that into the final stages of planning for the replacement of Michigan City, which the timing of which is also part of the question in the IRP process.\nDurgesh Chopra: Understood, thanks. And just one last one, just long the in terms of timing, sort of your Q4 call sets up pretty nicely with the filing of the IRP. Is that sort of for us to kind of look at what your forward looking plans are going to be in. What you might be able to accomplish in this IRP. Is that a good sort of a date for us to watch for an update from an IRP perspective?\nJoe Hamrock: Yes. Just the overall timelines, the way they overlay it would be our Q3 call will be pretty close to the timing of the filing of the IRP. So there\u2019ll be plenty to talk about there. That\u2019d be a little early to a roll forward our CapEx plan, because there\u2019s a lot of other parts of the business that go into the ultimate long range plan. And our business planning cycle, we\u2019ll push that out to first half of next year sometime before, we\u2019d likely be in a position to extend CapEx and growth rate guidance.\nDurgesh Chopra: [Indiscernible] Thank you so much. Appreciate the time.\nJoe Hamrock: Sure. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Peters from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nDavid Peters: Hey, good morning guys. Couple of questions for me. Yes. Just \u2013 first, nice to see that you have the CPCNs for all the JV projects. And obviously I know third parties are developing those, but just wondering, are they all currently on schedule and budget just given some of the inflationary pressures kind of supply chain bottlenecks we\u2019ve seen in the market. Have you guys seen any project \u2013 any impact your projects?\nShawn Anderson: Yes. Good morning. This is Shawn. I\u2019ll take that question. Yes is the answer to your question. Everything remains on time, on schedule on budget. We\u2019re confident in that schedule, we\u2019re \u2013 in constant communication with our developers and everything continues to track, including even one project, which we expect to be concluding construction here in fourth quarter of 2021. So much to look forward to as we sequence through that.\nDavid Peters: Great. Thank you. And then the other one, just on the ATM, can you guys share how much you have done year-to-date within your $200 million, $300 million target?\nDonald Brown: Yes. Good morning. We have satisfied this year\u2019s equity need of $200 million to $300 million. So we\u2019re pretty good this year, certainly as you know, we\u2019ve outlined it\u2019s $200 million to 300 million annually through 2022, and then we expect in 2023, up to $150 million of ATM.\nDavid Peters: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Travis Miller from Morningstar. Your line is open.\nTravis Miller: Good morning, everyone. Thank you. Thinking back one of the questions about CapEx, as you\u2019ve gone through the early stages here of replacing the coal with new renewables and thinking about your target out the 2028 and 2030. What does that trajectory look like in terms of more renewables that will be needed, right? If you give the \u2013 spend some of my question. You learn kind of what the investment need is relative to retiring coal plants and what that trajectory would look like going out.\nShawn Anderson: Yes, good morning. This is Shawn. So to get back to the 2018 preferred plan, it did as you noted have the retirement of Michigan City by 2028 with the replacement solution at that time pointing towards renewables. And so then you step into the current time where we\u2019re at with the 2021 IRP. We\u2019re putting all those assumptions back into reevaluate to ensure that that continues to path or if there\u2019s any changes, and Joe highlighted some of those as you think about MISO\u2019s changes or resource adequacy requirements, how that factors in into the blend of components that produce a plan and integrated resource plan with the reliability that\u2019s necessary as well as the affordability that\u2019s necessary, the compliance that\u2019s necessary and all the other factors that you would use to measure in an entire fleet and entire portfolio. So the current plan is still that plan, which would be the retirement of Michigan City by 2028 with the replacement of renewables. And then the RFP process that we just stepped through helps to inform the actionable bids or technology and portfolio solutions that could come online to help support that build out. And as you know, we did an all source RFP, which allows other technology to come in and compete, and then we can evaluate all those different factors back within the context of the IRP itself and then the affordability, as well as the reliability and compliance, et cetera.\nTravis Miller: Okay. So then that run rate that you\u2019ve been looking at just in terms of dollars, nothing material you\u2019ve learned new since the last two, three years going through that whole co-retirement reclosing with renewables. Is that\u2019s what I\u2019m kind of thinking about?\nShawn Anderson: That\u2019s accurate. Yes. The existing plan would still be the plan of reference and I\u2019d point you maybe towards the September, stakeholder meeting within the context of the IRP itself that will help to inform more of the existing fleet analysis, which speaks more to the timing question related to Michigan City or the retirement of existing assets, as well as understanding how the replacement technology could sequence it to support that.\nTravis Miller: Okay, great. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Levine from the Citi. Your line is open.\nRyan Levine: Hey, good morning. This might be for Shawn. What level of transparency do you have and the status of the solar development \u2013 the solar projects developments given the third-party nature and given a supply chain challenges, could it be a NiSource\u2019s interest to encourage that the way some of these projects.\nShawn Anderson: Yes. Thanks, Ryan. Appreciate it. As I said, we regularly speak with our developers and we have an ongoing dialogue and discussion with our developers to ensure that we remain part of the dialogue through the process. Of course, when those projects operationalize, that takes a significant amount of work on our team\u2019s side as well. And so there\u2019s constant communication to ensure that we\u2019re pacing alongside one another. Our counterparties have track records of being on time and on budget. This combined with the long lead time of the contracts themselves, give us the confidence that these projects continue to path.\nRyan Levine: To the extent that there were price escalations or bottlenecks in the logistics delivery, could that conversation be take place that would encourage NiSource to push these projects to be delayed, given the may result in a better net outcome or how do you think about puts and takes that would underwrite touch it decision?\nShawn Anderson: Yes, it\u2019s a great question. And maybe I\u2019d point you to the beginning of the process, because we worked hard to build it and contractual protections for our customers and our shareholders in the event of a delay. We feel our developer partners are also strongly incentivized to execute on time and on budget. So we have multiple tools available to protect customers and shareholders from any delay. And we\u2019re confident in the discussions, the level of transparency, as well as the construction timelines.\nRyan Levine: Okay. And then last question for me, in terms of the new technologies that are being proposed through the RFP, is there any that weren\u2019t being anticipated and may change the direction that you think the outcome could be in Indiana?\nShawn Anderson: Yes. Great question. So we did receive two actionable proposals related to hydrogen, so not having a bias entering the process, using the RFP results themselves to give an indication of where market developments and technology developments have come together. We were interested in \u2013 are interested to learn how those two proposals will stack up against all the other technology that we\u2019re probably more familiar with, as you can imagine. The fact that there were only really two actionable proposals might point to the nascency of the technology and itself, but that\u2019s not necessarily all that surprising as there might needs to be some more depth in the market to make those actionable, but we\u2019ll see that it\u2019s exciting to see that there\u2019s two on the horizon that could be actual within our window. And we\u2019ll see what the results are as the third-party starts to evaluate the quality of those bids and all the other components of the IRP itself.\nRyan Levine: Thanks for the update.\nShawn Anderson: You bet. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We have a follow-up question coming from the line of Insoo Kim from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nInsoo Kim: Yes, thanks for taking the additional question. I just have one just on your \u2013 the latest thoughts on the safety management system on program, after implementing that, and as the program continues to mature, how do you think about what the ultimate impact of those different actions and plans have on your operations and maybe just financially, whether it\u2019s on O&M, is it \u2013 can we think about it continue to add a contempt constant layer of cost, or do some of those actions actually help reduce some of the costs going forward?\nJoe Hamrock: Yes. Thanks, Insoo for that question. Very insightful framing too. We\u2019re at what I would call full implementation now of the SMS framework across our business and the way it\u2019s translating into the financial results that you pointed out are in a couple of different ways. It\u2019s broadening on a risk basis, the portfolio of investments that we\u2019re making, and ultimately that we\u2019re reflecting in our regulatory proceedings. And so think about the different asset classes, transmission pipe, distribution pipe, measurement regulation, even in our case, non-jurisdictional programs beyond the meter. So that we put all those side by side, evaluate the risk profile of each asset class and prioritize investments accordingly that\u2019s a much more sophisticated model than has been the case historically. And so it\u2019s shifting the investment mix. And in some cases, we\u2019ve seen the regulatory support for those follow along with tracker programs, for example, expanding to include differentiated programs. So it\u2019s been a sort of a net broadening of the investment plan. And then from an O&M standpoint, it\u2019s you\u2019ve seen the O&M trajectory here, we\u2019re down. And it\u2019s actually driving efficiencies in some ways, because of the nature of how the programs are designed. So that the actual program level cost is fully embedded in our current run rate. And I wouldn\u2019t expect to see an increasing layer of cost associated \u2013 O&M cost associated with the SMS program itself. And then finally, I think the \u2013 maybe the most important point is the de-risking that\u2019s happening as a result of those programs both in terms of asset programs and process safety, where we\u2019ve implemented incremental process controls across the risk areas in the business or critical tasks that might have high consequence risks associated with them. And we\u2019ve been implementing those. We\u2019ll continue to do that, but those generally are reconfiguration versus incremental capacity in the business model. So feel very good about where we are from a financial profile related to SMS and safety and a lot of opportunity in front of us for further de-risking of the business.\nInsoo Kim: That makes a lot of sense. So thank you so much.\nJoe Hamrock: Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions over the phone line at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Joe Hamrock for closing remarks. Sir?\nJoe Hamrock: Thank you, RJ, and thank you all for your questions. Let me close by just reiterating a few key points. One, that we\u2019re confident in our growth plan. We\u2019ve executed a number of key stages in the current growth plan. Notably the renewable generation projects the 13 to 14 now with regulatory approval or CPCN approval, and the related transmission projects that go with that now underscores and underpins the $2 billion in renewable transition investments through 2023. And then the RFP that\u2019s underway for the 2021 IRP as Shawn noted includes 180 new proposals and giving us an updated picture of the opportunities for the future. Add to that four of our gas utilities are in a base rate cases. Now all aligned with investments in modernization and safety that our customers value. And then finally, we\u2019ve reaffirmed our 2021 guidance and our long-term growth rate commitments. So pleasure to be with you today and have an opportunity to share that story. We appreciate you joining us, and we appreciate your interest in support of NiSource. Please stay safe.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. We thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Shawn Anderson",
            "content": "Thank you, Joe. We continue to be encouraged by the strong progress, advancing our renewable generation projects stemming from NIPSCO's 2018 IRP. Over the course of the last three months, eight renewables projects informed by the 2018 IRP preferred pathway received approval from the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. This brings NIPSCO to the verge of an important milestone with 13 of 14 renewables projects approved to advance and replace the retiring capacity of the Schahfer Generating Station. Importantly, this includes all joint venture projects and leaves Crossroads II Wind, a power purchase agreement as the only project awaiting approval. Combining these new generating facilities, with a number of transmission projects to support system reliability across the new footprint. NiSource continues to track toward approximately $2 billion of renewable generation investments through 2023. We are excited, these projects will produce clean, reliable power for our communities, while saving NIPSCO customers, approximately $4 billion over the long-term. While the commercial and regulatory processes have advanced to support the preferred pathway from the 2018 IRP. NIPSCO's 2021 IRP process is well underway and continues to track within its timeline. As noted in our release, in second quarter, we completed a request for proposal solicitation, similar to the process deployed in 2018. We are pleased with the response in terms of both the quality and the quantity of the proposals, which continues to show high levels of engagement in the vendor community as we advance our generation transition. Furthermore, with these more than 180 proposals covering a wide range of technologies and ownership constructs. It continues to point to a robust market across generation technologies, which will drive value for our customers and stakeholders. A few notes about the process and timing, the IRP analysis that we are currently stepping through. We'll utilize data from the RFP to help inform the broad resource portfolio options for NIPSCO, in terms of Michigan City retirement timing, choices of replacement technologies and ownership constructs. We will share directional findings with stakeholders at public advisory meetings in the third quarter, incorporating stakeholder feedback along the way. We expect to develop the stakeholder supported preferred resource path within the 2021 IRP, which will be submitted to the IURC on or before November 1. Once the preferred plan is finalized and communicated, execution activities could commence, which may include commercial negotiations and further due diligence on specific assets or projects. Any specific projects then identified which support this preferred plan would represent incremental projects beyond the 14 highlighted earlier and in addition to the approximately $2 billion in renewable investments, NIPSCO has already filed. These are significant steps within NiSource and are part of our energy transition, which we were calling your energy, your future. As we work with stakeholders to create a dependable, affordable, and sustainable energy model, delivering the reliability our customers can trust. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Donald, who will discuss our second quarter financial performance in more detail. Yes. Good morning. This is Shawn. I'll take that question. Yes is the answer to your question. Everything remains on time, on schedule on budget. We're confident in that schedule, we're \u2013 in constant communication with our developers and everything continues to track, including even one project, which we expect to be concluding construction here in fourth quarter of 2021. So much to look forward to as we sequence through that. Yes, good morning. This is Shawn. So to get back to the 2018 preferred plan, it did as you noted have the retirement of Michigan City by 2028 with the replacement solution at that time pointing towards renewables. And so then you step into the current time where we're at with the 2021 IRP.

That's accurate. Yes. The existing plan would still be the plan of reference and I'd point you maybe towards the September, stakeholder meeting within the context of the IRP itself that will help to inform more of the existing fleet analysis, which speaks more to the timing question related to Michigan City or the retirement of existing assets, as well as understanding how the replacement technology could sequence it to support that. Yes. Thanks, Ryan. Appreciate it.

            "name": "Donald Brown",
            "content": "Thanks, Shawn, and good morning, everyone. Looking at our second quarter 2021 results on Slide 4, we had non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $53 million or $0.13 per diluted share compared to non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $50 million or $0.13 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2020. I would note that 2021 results exclude earnings related to Columbia Gas of Massachusetts, due to the sale closing in October of 2020. Looking more closely at our segment three months non-GAAP results on Slide 5, gas distribution operating earnings were about $66 million for the quarter, representing a decline of approximately $8 million versus last year. Operating revenues, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were down about $28 million due to the sale of CMA and partially offset by increased infrastructure program revenues and customer growth. Operating expenses, also net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were lower by about $20 million, mostly due to the CMA sale offset by higher employee related costs and outside services spending. In our Electric segment, three months non-GAAP operating earnings were about $85 million, which was nearly $5 million lower than the second quarter of 2020. Operating revenues rose about $11 million, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses due to infrastructure investments and increased customer usage. Operating expenses, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were up about $16 million due to generation related maintenance and employee-related costs. Now turning to Slide 6, I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of June 30 was about $9.2 billion, which about $9.1 billion was long-term debt. The weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 15 years and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 3.7%. At the end of the second quarter, we maintain net available liquidity of about $2.2 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization program. With Moody's recently concluding their latest credit review, all three major rating agencies have reaffirmed our investment grade credit ratings with stable outlooks in 2021. Taken together, this represents a solid financial foundation to continue to support our long-term safety and infrastructure investments. Let's take a quick look at Slide 8, which highlights our financing plan. There are no changes to our plan since last quarter's equity unit issuance. Last quarter's issuance had significantly de-risked our financing plans and it's consistent with all of our earnings and credit commitments. As Joe mentioned in our key takeaways, we are reaffirming our 2021 earnings guidance and long-term financial commitments. I should remind everyone that we're stating the guidance and diluted earnings per share due to last quarter's equity issuance. Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest and support of NiSource. We're now ready to take your questions. I'll take that, good morning. I think what you're seeing on the C&I sales in electric business really is the impact of COVID last year in the second quarter. That second quarter where you had the businesses shutdown and certainly our largest customers shutdown operations had the biggest financial impact on us in that second quarter. So that's the recovery what you're seeing. And it certainly, as we expected and what we plan for, so very good outcome. And I'd say on the smaller commercial, we continue to feed a recovery there. Again, that's expected in part of our plan and we'll continue to monitor and manage that. Yes. On the electric side, taking out the industrial, the largest industrial, which is pretty stable for the other customer classes we're seeing in the 1% range, maybe a little less than 1%. Yes. Good morning. We have satisfied this year's equity need of $200 million to $300 million. So we're pretty good this year, certainly as you know, we've outlined it's $200 million to 300 million annually through 2022, and then we expect in 2023, up to $150 million of ATM."

            "name": "Joe Hamrock",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Hopefully, you've all had a chance to read our second quarter earnings release, which we issued earlier today. We made significant progress in our generation transition and the current renewable replacement plan with Indiana commission approval now received for all of our joint venture renewable projects. In addition, we have received more than 180 proposals in our 2021 Integrated Resource Plan or IRP process, which will inform our generation replacement strategy in Indiana beyond 2023. We continue to expect that our infrastructure programs and generation investments will drive compound annual growth of 7% to 9% in diluted net operating earnings per share from 2021 through 2024 while reducing greenhouse gas emissions 90% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. Let's turn now to Slide 3 and take a closer look at our key takeaways. In the second quarter, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net operating earnings of $0.13 per share results reflect safety and modernization investments, COVID impacts, and they reflect the profile of our business without Columbia Gas of Massachusetts. We are reaffirming our earnings guidance and long-term financial commitments. We expect 2021 earnings of 41.32 to $1.36 per share in non-GAAP diluted net operating earnings. We continue to expect annual growth, safety and modernization investments of $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion, plus approximately $2 billion in renewables and associated transmission investments through 2023. NiSource expects to grow its diluted net operating earnings per share by 7% to 9% on a compound annual growth rate basis from 2021 through 2024 including near-term annual growth of 5% to 7% through 2023. As I mentioned, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission has approved 13 of our 14 proposed renewable energy projects and the new RFP for electric capacity and energy associated with NIPSCO's 2021 IRP that is currently underway has drawn strong engagement from the vendor community. In other parts of our business, we filed rate cases in Ohio, Kentucky, and Maryland during the quarter, in addition to the case filed during the first quarter in Pennsylvania, where we are in advanced settlement discussions. Safety advancements continue across NiSource guided by our implementation of the industries safety management system, which serves as our core operating model. Recent advancements include the accelerated integration of contractors into our safety plans and deployment of Picarro advanced leak detection technology in two more states. Our environmental performance targets represent another vital commitment. I'm pleased to say that we remain on target. We expect to reduce total greenhouse gas emissions 90% by 2030 from 2005 levels. That includes a 50% reduction in methane emissions from gas mains and services by 2025. On that commitment, NiSource has already achieved an estimated 39% reduction in pipeline methane emissions compared to 2005 levels. Our infrastructure replacement programs are driving these improvements. Also last year, more than 1 million of our customers participated in our energy efficiency programs. On that note, let's look at some NiSource utilities highlights for the second quarter, starting with our gas operations on Slide 9. The Ohio rate cases, one of three new rate cases filed in the second quarter. We're requesting an annual revenue increase of approximately $221 million net of the trackers being rolled into base rates, pending a decision from the PUCO. New rates would be effective in mid-2022. In Kentucky, we filed a request for an approximately $27 million annual revenue increase net of trackers. And in Maryland, we filed a case on May 14, once again, net of trackers requesting about a $5 million annual revenue increase. New rates are proposed to go into effect in December of this year. In Pennsylvania, we filed a case just before the end of the first quarter, requesting an annual increase in revenue of approximately $98 million. Now let's look at our electric operations on Slide 10. I'll touch on NIPSCO's Electric TDSIC plan. We've filed a new five-year plan in June. The $1.6 billion plan includes newly identified projects aimed at enhancing service and reliability for customers as well as some previously identified projects. We expect to receive an order from the IURC in December of this year. The other items on this slide relate to our transition out of coal generation, and I'll turn it over to Shawn Anderson to give more detail. Yes. Good morning, Insoo. Thanks for joining us. You should not read anything into that slide update. We remain focused on long-term shareholder value that hasn't changed and we're evaluating market conditions and our portfolio as an ongoing part of that process. And so though it's related to the financing, as you noted, we continue to view any asset still is primarily a strategic decision based on long-term shareholder value, more than as a way to satisfy any near-term financing need. And that's really, I mean, we've stated it over and over, that's underpinned by our plan that drives 7% to 9% long-term growth inclusive of all financing in the current planning horizon and without any assets sales. So clearly a strategic shift would need to enhance. What's already a strong plan? That said, given our exceptionally large known CapEx cycle, potential future investment opportunities that will unfold as we go forward and continued modest equity funding needs that go along with that or meaning our ATM program. It shouldn't be surprising that we're not taking those options off the table, just because it's not on a slide, doesn't mean it's not continuing to be on the table. And those factors can converge with strategic alternatives at any point in time. So I appreciate the question. Yes, that's right. I think you said that right, Durgesh. Anything we that emerges from that from the IRP process would set up our planning cycle for next year and would allow us to roll forward our CapEx plan. But it's too early to predict how that'll play out, given where we are in the IRP. Yes. I think it's little too early to say that, because the IRP itself is sets up the plan. There are other factors outside of the IRP, notably, MISO's continuing evolution of capacity credits and how to think about that, the evolving picture that we see through the RFP that we're running here. So I think of it as an envelope that you'll see, when we file the IRP, an envelope of opportunity. And all else being equal, our bias being to seek the investment opportunities that come through that plan. So we'll know a lot more as we get through the coming stages of the IRP. And then beyond that into the final stages of planning for the replacement of Michigan City, which the timing of which is also part of the question in the IRP process. Yes. Just the overall timelines, the way they overlay it would be our Q3 call will be pretty close to the timing of the filing of the IRP. So there'll be plenty to talk about there. That'd be a little early to a roll forward our CapEx plan, because there's a lot of other parts of the business that go into the ultimate long range plan. And our business planning cycle, we'll push that out to first half of next year sometime before, we'd likely be in a position to extend CapEx and growth rate guidance. Sure. Thank you. Yes. Thanks, Insoo for that question. Very insightful framing too. We're at what I would call full implementation now of the SMS framework across our business and the way it's translating into the financial results that you pointed out are in a couple of different ways. It's broadening on a risk basis, the portfolio of investments that we're making, and ultimately that we're reflecting in our regulatory proceedings.

And it's actually driving efficiencies in some ways, because of the nature of how the programs are designed. So that the actual program level cost is fully embedded in our current run rate. And I wouldn't expect to see an increasing layer of cost associated \u2013 O&M cost associated with the SMS program itself. And then finally, I think the \u2013 maybe the most important point is the de-risking that's happening as a result of those programs both in terms of asset programs and process safety, where we've implemented incremental process controls across the risk areas in the business or critical tasks that might have high consequence risks associated with them. And we've been implementing those. We'll continue to do that, but those generally are reconfiguration versus incremental capacity in the business model. So feel very good about where we are from a financial profile related to SMS and safety and a lot of opportunity in front of us for further de-risking of the business. Thank you.

Hopefully, you've all had a chance to read our first quarter earnings release which we issued earlier today. With the successful completion of last month's convertible issuance, NiSource is well-positioned to execute the next stage of our growth plan, driven by safety and asset modernization programs, as well as our electric generation transmission strategy. In Indiana, we kicked off our 2021 Integrated Resource Plan process, which will inform our strategy beyond 2023 and we initiated four new renewable energy projects. We continue to expect that our infrastructure and generation investments will drive compound annual growth of 7% to 9% in diluted net operating earnings per share from the midpoint of our narrowed 2021 guidance through 2024. We also expect to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 90% by 2030. Let's turn now to Slide 3 and take a closer look at our key takeaways. In the first quarter, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net operating earnings of $0.77 per share. These results include increased earnings from our safety and modernization investments and reflect the profile of our business without Columbia Gas of Massachusetts. As you saw in our release, today we narrowed our 2021 non-GAAP diluted net operating earnings guidance to a $1.32 to a $1.36 per share, which represents the upper half of the previous range. This narrowed range reflects lower than previously expected COVID impacts and more certainty with regulatory outcomes offset by slightly higher diluted share count resulting from the equity unit issuance. We expect to make approximately $10 billion in capital investments through 2024. These include annual investments of $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion in growth, safety and modernization programs. In addition, our investments in renewable generation are now expected to total approximately $2 billion over this period. As we outlined at our 2020 Investor Day, NiSource expects to grow its diluted net operating earnings per share by 7% to 9% on a compound annual growth rate basis from 2021 through 2024 including near-term annual growth of 5% to 7% through 2023. Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania received an order in its 2020 rate case and it has filed a new rate case to support its safety and modernization plans, which I will discuss in more detail later in this call. In addition, we have continued to successfully execute on our renewable energy strategy adding four new renewable energy projects as part of our Your Energy, Your Future initiative. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald who will discuss our first quarter financial performance in more detail.\nDonald Brown: Thanks, Joe and good morning, everyone. Looking at our first quarter 2021 results in Slide 4, we had non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $305 million or $0.77 per diluted share compared to non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $291 million or $0.76 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2020. I would note that 2021 results exclude earnings related to Columbia Gas of Massachusetts or CMA due to the sale closing in October of 2020. Looking more closely at our segment three-month non-GAAP results on Slide 5, gas distribution operating earnings were about $374 million for the quarter, representing a decline of approximately $18 million versus last year. Operating revenues, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were down about $84 million due to the sale of CMA, partially offset by increased infrastructure program revenues and customer growth. Operating expenses also net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were lower by about $66 million, mostly due to the CMA sale and lower employee-related costs, partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization expense. In our Electric segment, three-month non-GAAP operating earnings were about $91 million, which was approximately $11 million higher than the first quarter of 2020. This increase was driven primarily by an approximately $9 million increase in operating revenues, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses due to infrastructure investments and increased customer usage. Operating expenses net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were slightly lower due to environmental and employee-related cost. Now, turning to Slide 6, I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of March 31 was about $9.8 billion, of which about $9.1 billion was long-term debt. The weighted average maturity in our long-term debt was approximately 15 years, and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 3.7%. At the end of the first quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.9 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and other accounts receivable securitization program. Our credit rating from all three major rating agencies are investment grade and we remain committed to maintaining our current investment grade ratings. Taken together, this represents a solid financial foundation to support our long-term safety and infrastructure investments. Let's take a quick look at Slide 8, which highlights our updated financing plan. I would just note that following last month's equity unit issuance, we no longer expect to issue block or discrete equity through 2024. This issuance that received 100% equity credit from all three agencies allows NiSource to capture share price upside and provide timely proceeds for our renewable investment. Most importantly, this issuance significantly de-risks our financing plans and is consistent with all of our earnings and credit commitments. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Joe, who will provide some infrastructure investment and regulatory updates for our gas and electric business.\nJoseph Hamrock: Thank you, Donald. Now, let's look at some NiSource utilities highlights for the first quarter of 2021 starting with our gas operations on Slide 9. In Pennsylvania, the Public Utility Commission approved an annual revenue increase of $63.5 million in the rate case we filed in 2020. This reflects our investments to modernize and upgrade our natural gas distribution system, as well as maintain the continued safety of the system. The commission also approved an ROE of 9.86% with rates effective as of January 23 of this year. In addition, the company filed another base rate case in March to support its ongoing safety and modernization program. In Kentucky, we received an order on April 30 from the Public Service Commission in our Safety Modification and Replacement Program Tracker filing. This order approves $40 million in upgrades and replacements under way in 2021 and $2.6 million of incremental revenue. In Indiana, NIPSCO continues its long-term gas modernization program. Nearly $950 million in capital investments are planned through 2025 to be recovered through semi-annual adjustments to the existing gas transmission, distribution and storage improvement charge or TDSIC tracker. Rates approved in our 2020 filing became effective in January of this year. In Virginia, we implemented rates approved in our 2020 Steps to Advance Virginia Energy or SAVE tracker filing. Now let's look at our electric operations on Slide 10. NIPSCO has filed notice to terminate its current electric transmission, distribution and storage improvement charge or TDSIC plan. We expect to file a new five-year plan on or soon after June 1. The updated plan will include newly identified projects aimed at enhancing service and reliability for customers, as well as some previously identified projects. As mentioned earlier, we have begun our 2021 Integrated Resource Plan or IRP process. Similar to our 2018 IRP, the process will include an RFP for new resources. We plan to receive input from customers in a wide variety of other stakeholders throughout the year and expect to submit our plan to the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission by November. I would now like to ask Shawn to provide more on the significance of the IRP and an update about our renewable generation projects.\nShawn Anderson: Thank you, Joe. We continue to make strong progress on our renewable generation transition. In total, we have announced 14 renewable projects which will likely fill the balance of capacity necessary to replace the retiring units at our Schahfer generating station, which continues to track for retirement by May 2023. Four new projects have been announced in 2021. They include two projects with EDP renewables, Indiana Crossroads Solar Park, which is a build-transfer agreement and is expected to enter service in 2022. And Indiana Crossroads II which is a wind project announced as a power purchase agreement or PPA and is expected to enter service in 2023. We also announced Fairbanks Solar, a build-transfer agreement with Invenergy for a 250-megawatt project expected to be online in 2023. And finally, we signed a build-transfer agreement with Capital Dynamics for a 200-megawatt project expected to be operational in 2023 named Elliot Solar. We've already begun the regulatory approval process for these projects. Upcoming shortly in the second quarter of 2021 we expect an order from the IURC on four previously filed projects our Dunns Bridge I and II, Cavalry Solar Energy Center and Green River Solar Projects. All of these updates continue to track on time to retire nearly 80% of our remaining coal-fired generation by 2023 and retire all coal generation by 2028 to be replaced by lower cost, reliable and cleaner options. The plan is expected to drive a 90% reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and is expected to save our electric customers an estimated $4 billion over 30 years. The executed agreements we've announced are also within budget, representing approximately $2 billion of renewable generation investments. The projects these agreements support represent NIPSCO's investment interest in the replacement capacity which equates to approximately half of the total capacity needed. The remaining new capacity is in the form of power purchase agreements. Finally, as Joe has highlighted, in the fourth quarter of 2021, NIPSCO plans to submit a new integrated resource plan to the IURC that will continue to outline its long-term generation plans including the planned retirement of Michigan City Generating Station. The preferred plan that emerges from the 2021 IRP could create additional capital investment opportunities. We are excited about the significant progress in executing our plan and we look forward to more updates in the future quarters. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Joe.\nJoseph Hamrock: Thank you, Shawn. I'd like to turn to our foundational commitment; safety. Our Safety Management System, SMS, is an established operating model within NiSource. Recent advances in SMS include expanded quality management and achieving Gold Shovel Standard Certification. We are continuously enhancing process safety capabilities and ensuring effective asset management to reduce risks. I'd also like to note that we've begun a third-party validation of our SMS implementation and we are working toward accreditation in 2022. Before turning to the Q&A portion of today's call, I'll share and reiterate a few key takeaways. With last month's convertible issuance, NiSource is well positioned to execute the next stage of our growth plan driven by continued execution of our safety and asset modernization programs as well as our electric generation transition strategy. We are narrowing our 2021 non-GAAP deluded net operating earnings guidance to $1.32 to $1.36 per share, which represents the upper half of the previous guidance. We expect to make approximately $10 billion in capital investments through 2024. These include annual investments of $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion in growth, safety and modernization programs. In addition, our investments in renewable generation are now expected to total approximately $2 billion over this period. As we outlined at our 2020 Investor Day, NiSource continues to expect to grow its deluded net operating earnings per share by 7% to 9% on a compound annual growth rate basis from 2021 through 2024 including near-term annual growth of 5% to 7% through 2023. In addition, we now have a total of 14 renewable energy projects as part of our Your Energy, Your Future initiative. Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. We're now ready to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from the line of Shahriar Pourreza of Guggenheim.\nShahriar Pourreza: So, just a couple quick questions here, Joe and Donald. So, obviously, the block equity needs are solved but maybe curious how you're sort of thinking about further asset optimization, especially with some of the healthier prints we've seen with Centerpoint and Duke. I guess, Joe, do you see value maybe to further simplify your jurisdictional footprint, maybe shrink your balance sheet, shut off the ATMs and internal programs, and take some incremental dry powder especially as we're seeing additional opportunities on the renewable side ramp up over the next few years? Further of a strategic start question.\nJoseph Hamrock: Yes. Thanks, Shar. And as we've said consistently, we're always exploring opportunities to drive and sustain long-term shareholder value. That's really the underpinning of the question. And options for shaping our footprint and our business mix are a key part of that. And we objectively and thoroughly evaluate those on an ongoing basis. The key backdrop for us is the current plan that has 10% or higher rate base growth in each of our utility companies. And that comprises the $40 billion of identified investments over 20 years that I think is uniquely well balanced and supported by constructive regulatory mechanisms and policy environments across our jurisdiction. So, that all adds up to a strong hand with options and time to ensure any moves that we might make truly enhance value on a risk-adjusted basis. So, very open minded, very deliberate and thoughtful about that and as we work through particularly this year, our electric IRP as we've talked about today and we refine other long-range investment plans particularly beyond 2023, it's pretty clear plan out through '23. These options will all remain on the table. We'll continue to look at those opportunities. And then on the point about LDC values, we're all seeing that LDC value indicators in the private markets appear to be really strong and either more aligned with the fundamentals and the sustainable growth that we see in the business. And so, I think it's important to take that as an input that kind of cuts both ways and then maybe even extending that perspective just a bit in a clean energy transition supporting a modern high-tech economy. It's more important that we solve for and plan for secure, reliable, resilient energy systems. And we think the natural gas system has a key role in that transition. So, we're looking at all of that with a long-term shareholder value perspective. And it'll always be an alternative to traditional financing as you noted.\nDonald Brown: And let me add Joe, I'd say if you look at the financing we've done, it really does put us in a place of having more flexibility because it firmly puts this in our target range of 14% to 15% episode of debt, which gives us some flexibility really think strategically about how we grow the business. And certainly, as we continue to look at the long-term plan, we'll look at portfolio, but we'll also look at what are those growth opportunities in our business, and the timing of the growth investments and how we finance those.\nShahriar Pourreza: Terrific. Thanks, Donald. And then, just on sort of the uptick in renewable spend get to see that there. And obviously, you guys highlighted there could be incremental spend coming from the new IRP. Can you just remind us if the incremental spend that can come about is that sort of embedded in your current trajectory as we think about rate base growth or earnings especially as you guys extend through '24, right, or potential new opportunities that come about from the IRP potentially accretive to the - to how you guys currently guide? So, extend the runway or accretive and assuming that you guys are embedding a 50/50 PPA versus JV structure on any new opportunities anyway it appears.\nDonald Brown: Yes. If we think about the - if you're referring to the new IRP that we just entered into that's really going to look at opportunities and what that generation strategy is post-2024, so Michigan City replacement opportunities. So, it'll be an extension of that. And so, we'll get through that by the end of the year. That will provide some insight in terms of what that portfolio would look like beyond 2024 and potentially provide some insight on what investment opportunities there might be for us.\nJoseph Hamrock: Yes. And so, just to bring that back around, the $2 billion we talked about today is all included in the growth rate guidance that we reaffirmed today. And I'd note that just this morning, even as we speak, the Indiana Commission approved three more renewable projects and another PPA, so really four projects like those being the Dunns Bridge project and the Cavalry project. So, with those now approved, approximately two-thirds of the $2 billion that we've talked about is already approved by the commission.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Charles Fishman of Morningstar.\nJoseph Hamrock: Good morning, Charles.\nOperator: Charles, your phone is muted, please unmute.\nCharles Fishman: I'm sorry. Joe, you said that you had more certainty with respect to regulatory outlook and you just had a decision or recently had a decision in Pennsylvania. Is that what you base that statement on? Is it because you have a ROE in that decision where you had a settlement the time before or is there any more color you can provide to that statement you made?\nJoseph Hamrock: Yes. Thanks, Charles. Good to hear from you this morning. That's a big part of the '21 regulatory agenda but also a number of our trackers are already approved. So we're well through the regulatory calendar for 2021. And so that total picture is the basis for the revision to our guidance.\nCharles Fishman: Okay. And then if I could just ask just a couple housekeeping things probably for Donald. On the guidance now, when we say the 7% to 9% on top of '21 guidance, is that the original guidance of $1.28 to $1.36 or the revised guidance this morning?\nDonald Brown: It would be the revised guidance, the narrowed guidance.\nCharles Fishman: The growth is off the narrowed guidance?\nDonald Brown: That's right.\nCharles Fishman: Okay. And then, I certainly had a discussion with Randy and Chris on the equity units. But just I guess a question I forgot to ask them is, if you're willing to answer or giving an answer to this. Can you give us any guide at the weighted average shares in '21?\nDonald Brown: Weighted average shares in '21.\nCharles Fishman: Yes. That's for your EPS.\nDonald Brown: Have patience. I don't know if Randy - if you've got - why don't we follow up with you?\nCharles Fishman: That's fine. That's just a modeling question. Thank you. Thank you. That's all I had.\nJoseph Hamrock: If I can insert just a second. If you just take where we ended 2020, Charles which was about $392 million and you assume the equity units and even the price they were issued at $24.51 that would be approximately $35 million additional shares. But of course, you'd only take seven-twelfths of that if you will from a weighted average standpoint. And then of course then you would add in an assumption around the ATM which we've guided toward $200 million to $300 million and divide it by a price perhaps $24 or $25 you get about $12 million additional shares there. But usually, we settle on those shares in December so they won't have a huge impact from a weighted average standpoint. But that should give you a good indication for modeling on where the share count is.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Thanks for the time and opportunity to connect here.\nJoseph Hamrock: Hey. Morning, Julian.\nDonald Brown: Good morning.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Thank you. Hey, perhaps if I could follow up on Charles question a little bit here. You talk about being more front footed and thinking strategically here after raising the latest liquidity and improving your metrics. Can you elaborate what those criteria might be or how are you thinking about things? I mean, is it about having a certain critical mass in certain states? Is it about being weighted electric versus gas or are there other factors? I just want to - if you don't mind elaborating a little bit.\nDonald Brown: Yes. Sure. I mean it goes back to risk-adjusted growth prospects and strong balance sheet for the cash generation. But among the factors that you mentioned, business mix, and I would characterize the scale and the jurisdiction as one of those factors as well. All of those things go into the way we look at the portfolio. And we'll continue to look at those as we go forward. But you put in front of that the $40 billion of identified investment and the growth rate that's driven off of the current footprint. And then it's really that's kind of your base case for evaluation of strategic alternatives.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Richard Sunderland of JPMorgan.\nRichard Sunderland: Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just starting off with the narrow guidance range. What are your COVID assumptions baked into that over the balance of the year and realized on the quarter?\nDonald Brown: Yes. Thanks for the question. So, for the quarter, overall, COVID did not have a material impact on us. Really had some offsetting items in terms of higher residential sales offsetting continued lower sales from our small commercial and some industrial. And so as we think - so, what we've done is we removed that $0.05 that we had in our guidance with the expectation that it's not going to be material for the balance of this year. Certainly, we've got some risk from a bad debt expense. But even with that, we think that won't be material for us for the balance of this year.\nRichard Sunderland: Got it. That's very clear. And then just turning back to the optimization discussion. I can appreciate that the financing strategy has been derisked materially falling to equity units. But just curious as a financing tool specifically how you view that as a piece of the toolset meaning you removed these discrete equity needs for the renewables through 2024. So, does that kind of push out the financing driven timing of any elements there or is it may be tied to that longer term look around the 2021 IRP that we should be getting later this year? I know it's kind of a specific angle here but curious for any thoughts.\nDonald Brown: Yes. Certainly, as Joe talked about, we're always evaluating the plan and there's quote in each of our operating companies so we'll continue to do that. As we look at portfolio, that's an ongoing analysis as we look at what's the best alternative to finance the plan. So, I would not say that we have to wait for any other catalysts in terms of our business plan changing including that IRP. It's something that we'll continue to use the data points from those transactions and others to update our analysis. And if it makes sense to do something with portfolio, we would absolutely do that. Again, it's always against evaluating our plan with significant growth 8% to 10% or 10% to 12% rate base growth in all of our businesses and financing that in the most effective way.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your next question is from the line of [David Peter] with [indiscernible] Research.\nUnidentified Analyst: Just on the TDSIC filing in Indiana in June. I guess what prompted the termination of the old program and I guess what should we sort of expect kind of in this new filing? Is it more of the same?\nDonald Brown: Yes. For the TDSIC program, yes, there's opportunity driven off of the legislation from a couple of years ago to enhance the investment mix in a TDSIC filing. So that's certainly one of the opportunities we'll be looking at. In the areas of grid modernization even technology footprint, all of those are in the mix of consideration for the next plan. And then, you also have an interplay between your TDSIC timing and your rate cases. So, that's another driver of the timing for this filing.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. And then, the second question just with respect to potential legislation out there at the federal level. If you were to see some form of direct payment for PTCs or ITCs come across, have you looked at how that might impact your renewable strategy current or future projects just given that you guys are using a good amount of tax equity?\nJoseph Hamrock: Yes. That's something we're paying attention to. There's not a lot of detail yet on how that might happen, and from the timing of where we are in our plan, how to impact that plan. So, I think current expectations our plan won't change, but certainly direct payments could provide some upside. But we've got to get more information on what that means. And again, it's also based upon the timing of that legislation with our financing of our current projects.\nDonald Brown: And then, strategically, longer term, while we're on that topic of the tax credits, we like to see that concept expanded to support renewable natural gas and/or hydrogen because in the clean energy transition there's not only a room for but a need for alternative energy across the spectrum. So, we think there's an opportunity there as well.\nOperator: At this time, there are no further questions. I'll hand over the call to Joe Hamrock, President and Chief Executive Officer for any closing remarks.\nJoseph Hamrock: Thanks, Stephanie. Appreciate it. And thanks again to all of you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest and your support. We look forward to more updates in the future. Our plan is dynamic, a number of things moving at any given time. So, it's always a good opportunity. And we appreciate catching up with you. Look forward to seeing many of you at the upcoming AGA Financial conference. So, until then, make every day a safe day. Take care.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Donald Brown",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe and good morning, everyone. Looking at our first quarter 2021 results in Slide 4, we had non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $305 million or $0.77 per diluted share compared to non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $291 million or $0.76 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2020. I would note that 2021 results exclude earnings related to Columbia Gas of Massachusetts or CMA due to the sale closing in October of 2020. Looking more closely at our segment three-month non-GAAP results on Slide 5, gas distribution operating earnings were about $374 million for the quarter, representing a decline of approximately $18 million versus last year. Operating revenues, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were down about $84 million due to the sale of CMA, partially offset by increased infrastructure program revenues and customer growth. Operating expenses also net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were lower by about $66 million, mostly due to the CMA sale and lower employee-related costs, partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization expense. In our Electric segment, three-month non-GAAP operating earnings were about $91 million, which was approximately $11 million higher than the first quarter of 2020. This increase was driven primarily by an approximately $9 million increase in operating revenues, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses due to infrastructure investments and increased customer usage. Operating expenses net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were slightly lower due to environmental and employee-related cost. Now, turning to Slide 6, I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of March 31 was about $9.8 billion, of which about $9.1 billion was long-term debt. The weighted average maturity in our long-term debt was approximately 15 years, and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 3.7%. At the end of the first quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.9 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and other accounts receivable securitization program. Our credit rating from all three major rating agencies are investment grade and we remain committed to maintaining our current investment grade ratings. Taken together, this represents a solid financial foundation to support our long-term safety and infrastructure investments. Let's take a quick look at Slide 8, which highlights our updated financing plan. I would just note that following last month's equity unit issuance, we no longer expect to issue block or discrete equity through 2024.

That will provide some insight in terms of what that portfolio would look like beyond 2024 and potentially provide some insight on what investment opportunities there might be for us. It would be the revised guidance, the narrowed guidance. That's right. Weighted average shares in '21. Have patience. I don't know if Randy - if you've got - why don't we follow up with you? Good morning. Yes. Sure. I mean it goes back to risk-adjusted growth prospects and strong balance sheet for the cash generation. But among the factors that you mentioned, business mix, and I would characterize the scale and the jurisdiction as one of those factors as well.

So, I would not say that we have to wait for any other catalysts in terms of our business plan changing including that IRP. It's something that we'll continue to use the data points from those transactions and others to update our analysis. And if it makes sense to do something with portfolio, we would absolutely do that. Again, it's always against evaluating our plan with significant growth 8% to 10% or 10% to 12% rate base growth in all of our businesses and financing that in the most effective way. Yes. For the TDSIC program, yes, there's opportunity driven off of the legislation from a couple of years ago to enhance the investment mix in a TDSIC filing. So that's certainly one of the opportunities we'll be looking at. In the areas of grid modernization even technology footprint, all of those are in the mix of consideration for the next plan. And then, you also have an interplay between your TDSIC timing and your rate cases. So, that's another driver of the timing for this filing. And then, strategically, longer term, while we're on that topic of the tax credits, we like to see that concept expanded to support renewable natural gas and/or hydrogen because in the clean energy transition there's not only a room for but a need for alternative energy across the spectrum. So, we think there's an opportunity there as well."

            "content": "Thanks, Randy. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us. Hopefully, you've all had a chance to read our first quarter earnings release which we issued earlier today. With the successful completion of last month's convertible issuance, NiSource is well-positioned to execute the next stage of our growth plan, driven by safety and asset modernization programs, as well as our electric generation transmission strategy. In Indiana, we kicked off our 2021 Integrated Resource Plan process, which will inform our strategy beyond 2023 and we initiated four new renewable energy projects. We continue to expect that our infrastructure and generation investments will drive compound annual growth of 7% to 9% in diluted net operating earnings per share from the midpoint of our narrowed 2021 guidance through 2024. We also expect to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 90% by 2030. Let's turn now to Slide 3 and take a closer look at our key takeaways. In the first quarter, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net operating earnings of $0.77 per share. These results include increased earnings from our safety and modernization investments and reflect the profile of our business without Columbia Gas of Massachusetts. As you saw in our release, today we narrowed our 2021 non-GAAP diluted net operating earnings guidance to a $1.32 to a $1.36 per share, which represents the upper half of the previous range. This narrowed range reflects lower than previously expected COVID impacts and more certainty with regulatory outcomes offset by slightly higher diluted share count resulting from the equity unit issuance. We expect to make approximately $10 billion in capital investments through 2024. These include annual investments of $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion in growth, safety and modernization programs. In addition, our investments in renewable generation are now expected to total approximately $2 billion over this period. As we outlined at our 2020 Investor Day, NiSource expects to grow its diluted net operating earnings per share by 7% to 9% on a compound annual growth rate basis from 2021 through 2024 including near-term annual growth of 5% to 7% through 2023. Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania received an order in its 2020 rate case and it has filed a new rate case to support its safety and modernization plans, which I will discuss in more detail later in this call. In addition, we have continued to successfully execute on our renewable energy strategy adding four new renewable energy projects as part of our Your Energy, Your Future initiative. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald who will discuss our first quarter financial performance in more detail. Thank you, Donald. Now, let's look at some NiSource utilities highlights for the first quarter of 2021 starting with our gas operations on Slide 9. In Pennsylvania, the Public Utility Commission approved an annual revenue increase of $63.5 million in the rate case we filed in 2020. This reflects our investments to modernize and upgrade our natural gas distribution system, as well as maintain the continued safety of the system. The commission also approved an ROE of 9.86% with rates effective as of January 23 of this year. In addition, the company filed another base rate case in March to support its ongoing safety and modernization program. In Kentucky, we received an order on April 30 from the Public Service Commission in our Safety Modification and Replacement Program Tracker filing. This order approves $40 million in upgrades and replacements under way in 2021 and $2.6 million of incremental revenue. In Indiana, NIPSCO continues its long-term gas modernization program. Nearly $950 million in capital investments are planned through 2025 to be recovered through semi-annual adjustments to the existing gas transmission, distribution and storage improvement charge or TDSIC tracker. Rates approved in our 2020 filing became effective in January of this year. In Virginia, we implemented rates approved in our 2020 Steps to Advance Virginia Energy or SAVE tracker filing. Now let's look at our electric operations on Slide 10. NIPSCO has filed notice to terminate its current electric transmission, distribution and storage improvement charge or TDSIC plan. We expect to file a new five-year plan on or soon after June 1. The updated plan will include newly identified projects aimed at enhancing service and reliability for customers, as well as some previously identified projects. As mentioned earlier, we have begun our 2021 Integrated Resource Plan or IRP process. Similar to our 2018 IRP, the process will include an RFP for new resources. We plan to receive input from customers in a wide variety of other stakeholders throughout the year and expect to submit our plan to the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission by November. I would now like to ask Shawn to provide more on the significance of the IRP and an update about our renewable generation projects. Thank you, Shawn. I'd like to turn to our foundational commitment; safety. Our Safety Management System, SMS, is an established operating model within NiSource. Recent advances in SMS include expanded quality management and achieving Gold Shovel Standard Certification. We are continuously enhancing process safety capabilities and ensuring effective asset management to reduce risks. I'd also like to note that we've begun a third-party validation of our SMS implementation and we are working toward accreditation in 2022. Before turning to the Q&A portion of today's call, I'll share and reiterate a few key takeaways. With last month's convertible issuance, NiSource is well positioned to execute the next stage of our growth plan driven by continued execution of our safety and asset modernization programs as well as our electric generation transition strategy. We are narrowing our 2021 non-GAAP deluded net operating earnings guidance to $1.32 to $1.36 per share, which represents the upper half of the previous guidance. We expect to make approximately $10 billion in capital investments through 2024. These include annual investments of $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion in growth, safety and modernization programs. In addition, our investments in renewable generation are now expected to total approximately $2 billion over this period. As we outlined at our 2020 Investor Day, NiSource continues to expect to grow its deluded net operating earnings per share by 7% to 9% on a compound annual growth rate basis from 2021 through 2024 including near-term annual growth of 5% to 7% through 2023. In addition, we now have a total of 14 renewable energy projects as part of our Your Energy, Your Future initiative. Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. We're now ready to take your questions. Yes. Thanks, Shar. And as we've said consistently, we're always exploring opportunities to drive and sustain long-term shareholder value. That's really the underpinning of the question. And options for shaping our footprint and our business mix are a key part of that. And we objectively and thoroughly evaluate those on an ongoing basis. The key backdrop for us is the current plan that has 10% or higher rate base growth in each of our utility companies. And that comprises the $40 billion of identified investments over 20 years that I think is uniquely well balanced and supported by constructive regulatory mechanisms and policy environments across our jurisdiction. So, that all adds up to a strong hand with options and time to ensure any moves that we might make truly enhance value on a risk-adjusted basis. So, very open minded, very deliberate and thoughtful about that and as we work through particularly this year, our electric IRP as we've talked about today and we refine other long-range investment plans particularly beyond 2023, it's pretty clear plan out through '23. These options will all remain on the table. We'll continue to look at those opportunities. And then on the point about LDC values, we're all seeing that LDC value indicators in the private markets appear to be really strong and either more aligned with the fundamentals and the sustainable growth that we see in the business. And so, I think it's important to take that as an input that kind of cuts both ways and then maybe even extending that perspective just a bit in a clean energy transition supporting a modern high-tech economy. It's more important that we solve for and plan for secure, reliable, resilient energy systems. And we think the natural gas system has a key role in that transition. So, we're looking at all of that with a long-term shareholder value perspective. And it'll always be an alternative to traditional financing as you noted. Yes. And so, just to bring that back around, the $2 billion we talked about today is all included in the growth rate guidance that we reaffirmed today. And I'd note that just this morning, even as we speak, the Indiana Commission approved three more renewable projects and another PPA, so really four projects like those being the Dunns Bridge project and the Cavalry project. So, with those now approved, approximately two-thirds of the $2 billion that we've talked about is already approved by the commission. Good morning, Charles. Yes. Thanks, Charles. Good to hear from you this morning. That's a big part of the '21 regulatory agenda but also a number of our trackers are already approved. So we're well through the regulatory calendar for 2021. And so that total picture is the basis for the revision to our guidance. If I can insert just a second. If you just take where we ended 2020, Charles which was about $392 million and you assume the equity units and even the price they were issued at $24.51 that would be approximately $35 million additional shares. But of course, you'd only take seven-twelfths of that if you will from a weighted average standpoint. And then of course then you would add in an assumption around the ATM which we've guided toward $200 million to $300 million and divide it by a price perhaps $24 or $25 you get about $12 million additional shares there. But usually, we settle on those shares in December so they won't have a huge impact from a weighted average standpoint. But that should give you a good indication for modeling on where the share count is. Hey. Morning, Julian. Yes. That's something we're paying attention to. There's not a lot of detail yet on how that might happen, and from the timing of where we are in our plan, how to impact that plan. So, I think current expectations our plan won't change, but certainly direct payments could provide some upside. But we've got to get more information on what that means. And again, it's also based upon the timing of that legislation with our financing of our current projects. Thanks, Stephanie. Appreciate it. And thanks again to all of you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest and your support. We look forward to more updates in the future. Our plan is dynamic, a number of things moving at any given time. So, it's always a good opportunity. And we appreciate catching up with you. Look forward to seeing many of you at the upcoming AGA Financial conference. So, until then, make every day a safe day. Take care."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Chris and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q4 2022 NiSource Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you, Chris Turnure, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nChris Turnure: Good day, and welcome to the NiSource Fourth Quarter 2022 Investor Call. Joining me today are Chief Executive Officer, Lloyd Yates; Chief Financial Officer, Donald Brown, Senior Vice President, Strategy and Chief Risk Officer, Shawn Anderson; and Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Randy Hulen. The purpose of this presentation is to review NiSource's financial performance for the fourth quarter of 2022 as well as provide an update on our operations and growth drivers. Following our prepared remarks, we'll open the call to your questions. Slides for today's call are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. We would like to remind you that some of the statements made during this presentation will be forward-looking. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. Information concerning such risks and uncertainties is included in the MD&A and Risk Factors sections of our periodic SEC filings. Additionally, some of the statements made on the call relate to non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the supplemental slides, segment information and full financial schedules for information on the most directly comparable GAAP measure and a reconciliation of these measures. I'd now like to turn the call over to Lloyd.\nLloyd Yates: Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. By the end of the call, we want to leave you with 3 takeaways of our business and our future. I'd like to reiterate our confidence, progress and focus. Our confidence in our strategic plan and our strong progress in delivering on our commitments. Our progress on our regulatory initiatives, including pursuing a potential settlement in the NIPSCO electric rate case, and our focus on realizing the upside potential beyond our existing plan. We will touch on some of these incremental investment opportunities later in today's presentation. Turning to our performance, 2022 was a year of relentless and consistent execution by our team. Among the keys to our success in 2022 was our comprehensive business review. We believe the goals detailed at our Investor Day are both significant and achievable, and we will measure our progress against our premium utility growth plan each quarter. Our results this quarter and in 2022 were strong and demonstrate that we are off to a great start in the execution of our plan. We delivered earnings above our 2022 guidance and are raising our 2023 guidance. We also grew our dividend 6.4%. We remain on track to drive shareholder value for a compelling 9% to 11% total shareholder return. At Investor's Day, we committed to optimizing our cost profile and enhancing operational efficiency. We are doing it by transforming both our IT systems and the work process of [a support], behind processes and technology of our people, I want to thank each of our employees for their performance throughout 2022 and a deep commitment to serving our customers. Let's turn to Slide 5 of the presentation and take a closer look at our 2022 key achievements. NiSource's 2022 earnings exceeded our guidance range. We delivered $1.47 non-GAAP diluted NOEPS. That's up more than 7% from last year, It reflects our continued investment in safety, reliability, customer affordability and sustainability. Looking to 2023, we've increased our guidance range to $1.54 to $1.60 per share. This reflects our outperformance in 2022 and confidence in 2023 execution. We're reaffirming our expectation of a 6% to 8% annual NOEPS growth through 2027 as well as our annual 8% to 10% rate base growth. Slide 6 illustrates 2023 guidance and our commitment to grow 6% to 8% annually through 2027. Driving this top-tier growth are investments of $15 billion in regulated CapEx from 2023 through 2027. A high-level summary of which you can see on Slide 7. Looking out further, we continue to expect to invest $30 billion from 2023 to 2032. As I alluded to earlier, execution by our regulatory team continues to be a strength. In 2022, we filed 4 rate cases and resolved 3, in Pennsylvania, Maryland, and the Indiana gas case. In addition, the Ohio rate case concluded last month. These cases represent balanced outcomes supporting all stakeholders. Turning to Page 8. We have the following key priorities for 2023. First, continue to enhance our focus on safety and operational excellence. Second, the successful sale of our minority interest in NIPSCO to strengthen our balance sheet. Next, a balanced outcome in the NIPSCO electric rate case, which we will cover in a few moments. Fourth, drive efficiencies to achieve flat O&M spending to enhance customer affordability. These efforts will keep our customer rates sustainable with expected total annual rate increases that are in line with inflation. And finally, our commitment to delivering on our 2023 guidance. These are the priorities that we will keep top of mind throughout the year. On Slide 9, you will see the additional investment opportunities NiSource may pursue in both the near and long term. NiSource's investment opportunities include replacing pre-1985 plastic gas pipes as well as gas transmission replacements and reconfirmations to comply with PHMSA regulation. In addition, electric generation tax credit transferability and advanced gas metering infrastructure also represent attractive opportunities for NiSource in the near term. Beyond 2027, we see the need to add electric generation capacity in the marketplace and to enhance electric grid hardening. NiSource electric long-range transmission projects, elect transportation renewable gas infrastructure and hydrogen production hubs also make up long-term and large-scale projects we will seek to participate in to enhance our investment portfolio and drive greater value for our customers. Now let's turn to Page 10 to review some fourth quarter and recent highlights from gas distribution operations. Columbia Gas of Ohio received an order, except in the settlement in its rate case on January 26. The order includes a revenue increase of $68.2 million net of riders. New rates will be effective on March 1. The settlement in our Pennsylvania rate case was approved in December. It enables continued investments in the replacement of aging pipe and system upgrades needed to ensure service reliability and pipeline safety. New rates went into effect December 17. Finally, Columbia Gas of Maryland received an order in November, approving its rate case settlement. The settlement supports the company's continued investments in infrastructure replacement and system upgrades. Now for updates on our electric operations and renewables projects, I'd like to turn it over to Shawn Anderson.\nShawn Anderson: Thank you, Lloyd, and good morning, everyone. You'll find information about our electric operations on Slide 11. NIPSCO is actively working with stakeholders toward a settlement in its electric rate case, it's first since 2018. New rates are anticipated to take effect in September 2023 with an incremental rate step applied in 2024. Meanwhile, the company remains on track to support a reliable generation portfolio and to retire all coal-fired generation by the end of 2028 with new assets, predominantly wind and solar facilities coming online. All of the renewable generation projects remain on target with previously revised in-service dates. The construction underway at Indiana Crossroads Solar and Dunns Bridge Solar 1 is nearing completion, with both facilities projected to be in service in the first half of 2023. Also under construction, the Indiana Crossroads 2 wind project continues to pace to start of commercial operations by the end of 2023. We have entered into contract amendments for our Dunns Bridge 2, Cavalry and Fairbanks projects to address our previously communicated project completion dates and reflect market pressures on pricing. Both Dunns Bridge 2 and Cavalry projects have begun initial construction with activities ramping into full construction this spring. We continue to evaluate the provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act and its applicability to the projects in our generation portfolio, including the potential application of tax transferability, along with the enhanced tax credits provided for in the act. We believe the legislation has enabled the opportunities to drive greater value to both our customers and shareholders while advancing our remaining projects. It is important to note that the application of all tax credits is analyzed on a project-by-project basis and is impacted by various factors such as capital costs and the expected production of the asset. Meanwhile, NIPSCO is in active commercial negotiations with potential counterparties to fulfill the preferred portfolio outlined in its 2021 integrated resource plan. Project agreements resulting from the all-sources RFP as well as the targeted gas peaking RFP at Schahfer Generating Station are expected to be announced this summer. Additional work continues around capturing direct and indirect funding opportunities from all of the federal legislation passed recently, most notably the nearly $500 billion generated from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the inflation Reduction Act. We have been active in several hydrogen hub proposals across our territory, each of which have received encouragement from the DOE to submit a full application for the regional clean hydrogen hub funding opportunity announcement as designated in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. I'd like to close by confirming we are on track to achieve our industry-leading environmental impact targets, namely a 90% reduction in Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 levels by 2030. This progress is consistent with the reductions needed to achieve our goal of net 0 Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2040, which we announced in November. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald, who will discuss our financial performance in more detail.\nDonald Brown: Thanks, Shawn, and good morning, everyone. Turning to our fourth quarter 2022 results on Slide 13. Fourth quarter non-GAAP net operating earnings were $221 million or $0.50 per share compared to $167 million or $0.39 per share in the fourth quarter of 2021. Full year earnings were $648 million or $1.47 per share compared to $571 million or $1.37 per share in 2021. Taking a closer look at our fourth quarter segment, non-GAAP results on Slide 14. Gas distribution operating earnings were $288 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of $72 million versus the same quarter last year. Operating revenues, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were higher by $66 million, mainly due to new rates resulting from base rate cases and regulatory capital programs. Operating expenses, again, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were lower by $6 million due primarily to lower O&M and other taxes. In our electric segment, non-GAAP operating earnings for the fourth quarter were $68 million, $14 million lower than in the same quarter last year. Operating revenues, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were lower by $4 million, mainly due to slightly lower weather-normalized customer usage. Operating expenses, once again excluding the cost of energy and tracked expenses were higher by $10 million, primarily due to increased depreciation and amortization. Now I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of December 31, 2022, was $11.3 billion, of which $9.6 billion was long-term debt with a weighted average maturity of 14 years and a weighted average interest rate of 3.7%. At the end of the fourth quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of over $1.6 billion. consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization programs. We remain committed to our current investment-grade credit ratings. Slide 16 highlights our financing strategy and credit commitments. We issued a $1 billion 1-year term loan in December and used the proceeds to reduce our commercial paper balances and the loan bridges the gap into our equity unit remarketing in the fall. Our financing plan includes no block or ATM equity issuances in 2023 or 2024. And is consistent with all of our earnings growth and credit commitments through 2027 and remains unchanged from Investor Day in November. I'd like to highlight that the recent drop in natural gas prices directly reduces our customers' bills over time and reduces the natural gas impact on working capital and financing charges. A year in 2022, deferred fuel amounted to roughly 54 basis points of FFO to debt versus 76 basis points at year-end 2021. For some context of the impact of higher gas prices over the last 2 years, at year-end 2020, deferred fuel only had a 6 basis point impact on our FFO to debt. In summary, we reported 2022 EPS of $1.47, exceeding our $1.44 to $1.46 guidance range. We have raised our 2023 guidance to $1.54 to $1.60, an increase of over $0.03 versus our prior midpoint. We're also reiterating our long-term growth commitment of 6% to 8% annual NOEPS growth through 2027. Despite persistent macroeconomic headwinds and volatility, we are advancing key elements of our 5-year plan, and we remain focused on safety, reliability, affordability and sustainability. Before we open up the line to answer your questions, I'd like to reiterate our confidence, progress and focus. Our confidence in our strategic plan and our strong progress in delivering on those commitments. Our progress on our regulatory initiatives, including pursuing a potential settlement in the NIPSCO electric rate case, and our focus on realizing the upside potential beyond our existing plan. Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. We're now ready to take your questions.\nOperator: First question is from Nicholas Campanella with Credit Suisse.\nNicholas Campanella: So I guess just on the NIPSCO rate case and the time line for potential settlement, would you prospectively want to have that done before the March 13 hearings? Or just how do we kind of think about the time line there, if you can move to settlement?\nLloyd Yates: Nick, Lloyd Yates here. So when we think about the NIPSCO rate case, we filed our rebuttal testimony February 16, and we've already started discussions with the various parties on that rate case. I'm optimistic about settling that rate case, I think that you started thinking about time line around February 27, If hearings are starting March 13, I think that the time line is you should expect to see something around the end of February. If things are progressing, we could -- history has been to extend those a week or so to get settlement discussions complete. But I think that's the track we're on right now.\nNicholas Campanella: That's really helpful. And then I guess just on the minority interest sale. Can you kind of just give us a sense, I know in the prepared remarks, you said you're on track. What type of demand are you kind of seeing from either financial or strategics? And then how are you kind of framing the time line for an announcement here? Do you expect to have something by next quarter? Or just any additional color would be helpful.\nLloyd Yates: So Shawn is leading that initiative for the company. I'm going to let Shawn Anderson answer that.\nShawn Anderson: Yes. Thanks, Nick. Appreciate the question. We\u2019ve observed a broad range of qualified partners, which are positioned to help NIPSCO and NiSource realize its strategic goals. We\u2019re confident this is the right audience to evaluate a partnership with NiSource as we laid out in November. And we\u2019re also confident the process we\u2019ve launched will lead us to a successful outcome this year.\nOperator: The next question is from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.\nShahriar Pourreza: Look, just on -- starting with the CapEx, when you shifted sort of a fair amount of the generation spending from '24 to '23, it looks like you also slightly increased the overall CapEx plan at the same time as sort of the '23 range moved up more than the '24 CapEx reduction, can you maybe just elaborate on this and whether we should treat this as incremental to sort of your overall planning assumptions?\nLloyd Yates: So I would not treat that as incremental. That shift was really for progress payments for our renewable projects, I mean I think our plan is still as is, spending around $3 billion a year in CapEx is what we're committed to. We feel like we can execute that really, really well, but there's no increase in CapEx at all. Those are just progress payments for the projects.\nShahriar Pourreza: Got it. And then just a follow up on Nick's question on the GRC. I guess, how are you sort of thinking about the potential for the coal plant cost recovery mechanism to get approved?\nLloyd Yates: So we're in the middle of conversations. There's been some debate about that mechanism. We think that mechanism is really good for customers. As we shut those coal plants down, that cost goes back to customers immediately. We're in conversations with the various parties about how to make that work, I'm optimistic that we can do that because I think that's good for customers, and passing that cost back immediately. But I think those are an integral part of the settlement discussions right now.\nShahriar Pourreza: Got it. Okay. Perfect. And then just real quick, lastly, Donald, I know you sort of mentioned equity, but you threw out the word block in there as well, so just not ATM, but you also mentioned the word block post '25. Is there any reason to believe like you would come to market with block equity, especially post this minority sale?\nDonald Brown: No. And let me correct. It certainly didn\u2019t say block. Our financing plan has not changed. It still is that we expect to enter into ATM post 2025. And that\u2019s really to keep us in that 14% to 16%, FFO to debt range, but no blocks planned are expected at this point.\nOperator: The next question is from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.\nDurgesh Chopra: Team, good morning. Can you hear me okay?\nLloyd Yates: We hear you fine.\nDurgesh Chopra: Okay. Perfect. Sorry. just Donald, thank you for sharing details on the deferred fuel and impact to your credit metrics. But maybe can you talk about the customer bill implications? And when could we sort of see the lower gas prices flow through your customer bills? And I know it's different states are different, but just at a very high level, can you discuss that?\nDonald Brown : Yes. No, great question. Certainly, seeing favorable natural gas prices, including today, we're seeing NYMEX March price around $2 or below $2. So that's great impact for our customers. As we look at it, we're expecting probably a 20% to 25% decrease in customer bills, '23 versus 2022. So really good outcome.\nDurgesh Chopra: That's super helpful. And then just maybe I just want to switch gears and see if you could give us any additional color on the updated, this is Slide 9 now. I'm on the near-term opportunities on CapEx. Any way that you can size the overall CapEx dollars we are talking about here in terms of your overall capital plan. How should we think about that? Any color you can share there, whether it's increased ownership of the generation assets, AMI, et cetera, et cetera.\nLloyd Yates: Durgesh, we realize -- I mean those opportunities are out there. We don't have a size for those opportunities yet. I think as we get closer to those opportunities and know more about pre-1985 plastic pipe or MISO issue in new transmission opportunities, we'll be able to size it then. But as soon as we can size it, we'll let you guys know about it.\nDurgesh Chopra: I understand it. And maybe just 1 quick 1 real quick. On the timing itself, Shawn, at Analyst Day last year, you guys might have suggested a mid-year announcement on the assets, is that still -- on NIPSCO sale, is that still on track? Or we've seen some of your peers were trying to sell some renewable assets shift their time line?\nShawn Anderson: Yes. Thanks for the question. The time line has not changed. We still expect to be able to complete this in 2023. And as you can imagine, we\u2019re still early days in the process itself. So we\u2019ll be able to provide updates along the way when it\u2019s appropriate to do so.\nOperator: The next question is from Travis Miller with Morningstar.\nTravis Miller: Just following up on that, the idea of the timing on the sale. I imagine you have to get the rate case either settled or concluded before that sale. Is that correct? Is there -- is that a gating factor essentially for making that financing move?\nShawn Anderson: These are really 2 separate processes, and we believe both can proceed as we've laid out today.\nTravis Miller: Okay. So not necessarily conclusion on the rate case before you could have a transaction done?\nShawn Anderson: That's correct.\nTravis Miller: Okay. And then separately, obviously, some good moves on the gas side. What's your thought in terms of cadence, given the different regulatory mechanisms you have in the CapEx plan in terms of general rate cases or base rate cases at the gas businesses, what's your sense on timing of that going forward.\nDonald Brown: Yes, great question. If you look at our history, we're typically in every 2 to 3 years in most jurisdictions. We're actually coming off a pretty heavy year last year where we were in 5 rate cases, Ohio, Indiana, new rates in 2022, Virginia, Kentucky and Maryland. So last year was a pretty heavy year. But if you look at our history, Maryland's almost every year, PA is almost every year, and then other states typically every 2 to 3 years.\nTravis Miller: Okay. And that cadence to continue, roughly?\nDonald Brown: Yes. We\u2019re evaluating Pennsylvania, but I\u2019d say otherwise, it\u2019s every 2 to 3 years on the other states. .\nOperator: The next question is from Ryan Levine with Citi.\nRyan Levine: In your prepared remarks, if I heard correctly, there was some mention of revised contracts for select renewable projects. Can you impact the materiality of these changes and what remaining risks you see from a time line execution standpoint?\nShawn Anderson: Yes. Thanks, Ryan. Appreciate the question. As you can imagine, we're still working through the process. So we still consider these contract amendments confidential. But the 1 thing I'd say is that we will work forward with our partners in the appropriate filings with the commission to move these forward. We're talking about the 4 remaining projects that are not substantively under construction, apart from those that are already in service. The market seeing increases in cost in the 10% to 25% range. What we've seen is consistent with that. And we've also been able to benchmark that off of the most recent RFP in August of 2022. So we feel good about the value proposition that these projects still provide to our customers in Northwest Indiana, and we'll proceed accordingly.\nRyan Levine: And in terms of the time line on Slide 12, you highlighted potential changes to kind of the cadence around execution. Are those amendments reflective of future potential changes in time line? Or could you see further adjustments if it's time lines slow?\nShawn Anderson: No, great question. Let me clarify. The contract amendments that were made are to support the time lines that we disclosed in 2022 and support the time lines that you see on that slide. which placed those remaining projects in service in '24 and '25.\nRyan Levine: Okay. And then 1 follow-up on the NIPSCO sale process, have betting rooms been formed? And have you seen any initial rounds of bids, any color you could share around how early in the process you may be?\nShawn Anderson: Yes. Unfortunately, there isn\u2019t additional color I can offer at this time. We\u2019re focused on advancing the process, and we\u2019ll just have to come back with updates around these topics when it\u2019s appropriate to do so.\nOperator: The next question is from Richard Sunderland with JPMorgan.\nRichard Sunderland : I joined late, so apologies if I missed this earlier. Just curious, what are you seeing on O&M trends coming out of 4Q relative to what you discussed this fall at Analyst Day. And curious if there are any moving pieces here relative to the latest 2023 outlook versus initial.\nLloyd Yates: Richard, this is Lloyd. First of all, I would say we're on track for flat O&M year-over-year. And I'd like to characterize it, we are really developing our O&M muscle. We have something going on at the company called Project Apollo we have outlined various processes and projects that we have teams working on to target doing things safer, better, more efficiently and for lower cost, and we're on track to achieve those.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: So just sticking with Richard's question, cost reduction seems to be a focus in the narrative with NIPSCO in the case. How do you think about effectively settling that issue here and how that marries up with the time line that you've articulated here with Project Apollo and wider O&M savings. Again, I'm not trying to ask you to negotiate the settlement on the call here per se, but how does that line up and especially vis-a-vis time line here with some of these efforts that you have underway, you talked about holding it flat for this year in particular. And then I suppose related question following up on the earlier 1 but from Nick is, if you're looking at the next couple of weeks, potentially trying to sell this out, is there anything that you really need to get out there in the record in a hearing context? Or is it all sufficiently hashed out at this point as far as you're concerned?\nLloyd Yates: So let me handle both those questions. Starting with the O&M and the time line. I think that we try to align those with our rate cases, but I think -- our strategy here is any O&M that we can take out of the system that we can lean out of the system on any given day is better for our customers. And our O&M is about keeping customer -- keeping our customers or keeping our rates affordable. So we're not necessarily trying to line that up with rate cases, if it lines up signed, if not I think we're okay too. Ultimately, we're going to this coming out of the system. It's going to be good for customers, and we're going to continue down that path and not try to be cute there. I think when you look at the NIPSCO rate case and if you look at the intervenor testimony, what you see is there's no argument over the capital investments. All the capital investments, the renewable -- primarily renewable projects in Titus, all that's been agreed to. So we're debating over O&M and ROE, which I think is really positive. And typically, when you have that -- when those 2 limited subject matters, you can typically come to some reasonable settlement on those 2 issues. So I think we're in a good spot with respect to the NIPSCO rate case, with respect to the O&M, and I'm optimistic the next 2 weeks are going to pan out real well for all involved stakeholders.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Excellent. And then just going back to the related question on the minority asset sale and the equity that Shawn brought up. So given the indications that you see today, I mean I suppose the question is, do you have equity needs in that longer-term period? How do you think about the early indications in the process relative to the beyond 25 balance sheet needs. Again, clearly, you're trying to take out a lot of those cumulative capital needs here with this asset sale. The question is to what extent can you more meaningfully address it?\nDonald Brown: Yes. I'd say our financing plan hasn't changed. And as Shawn stated that the process is going as expected. When we get more details that we can communicate on the sale transaction, we'll do that. But no change to the financing plan at this point.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. And just lastly here, I heard that you said you reaffirmed the time lines for the various, I believe, the 4 solar projects solar storage project. Just on that point on time line, again, obviously, you're paying to have these on a timely manner. Do you see them as broadly on track, given some of the interconnection issues and given some of the deliverability, I think specifically in the interconnect side here, just curious on your level of covenants on that front.\nShawn Anderson : Yes. As we shared, our projects are all continuing on schedule with the revised in-service dates we updated in 2022, Dunns Bridge 1 and Crossroad Solar specifically at the stage of construction, we\u2019re each are receiving panels on a regular basis to support the in-service dates within the first half of this year. And we\u2019re continuing to work in good faith with our developer partners and all the remaining \u2013 all the other remaining projects to advance accordingly.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn it over to Lloyd Yates, Chief Executive Officer, for any closing remarks.\nLloyd Yates: So thank you for your questions. And as we close, I want to reiterate what Donald and I have said about our confidence, progress and focus. Our confidence in our strategic plan and our strong progress in delivering on our commitments. Our progress on our regulatory initiatives, including pursuing a potential settlement in the NIPSCO electric rate case, and our focus on realizing the upside potential beyond our existing plan. I believe the future is bright for NiSource and we\u2019re confident in the execution of the 5-year plan we had unveiled at Investor Day. We appreciate you joining us this morning, and I hope all of you stay safe. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Shawn Anderson",
            "content": "Thank you, Lloyd, and good morning, everyone. You'll find information about our electric operations on Slide 11. NIPSCO is actively working with stakeholders toward a settlement in its electric rate case, it's first since 2018. New rates are anticipated to take effect in September 2023 with an incremental rate step applied in 2024. Meanwhile, the company remains on track to support a reliable generation portfolio and to retire all coal-fired generation by the end of 2028 with new assets, predominantly wind and solar facilities coming online. All of the renewable generation projects remain on target with previously revised in-service dates. The construction underway at Indiana Crossroads Solar and Dunns Bridge Solar 1 is nearing completion, with both facilities projected to be in service in the first half of 2023. Also under construction, the Indiana Crossroads 2 wind project continues to pace to start of commercial operations by the end of 2023. We have entered into contract amendments for our Dunns Bridge 2, Cavalry and Fairbanks projects to address our previously communicated project completion dates and reflect market pressures on pricing. Both Dunns Bridge 2 and Cavalry projects have begun initial construction with activities ramping into full construction this spring. We continue to evaluate the provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act and its applicability to the projects in our generation portfolio, including the potential application of tax transferability, along with the enhanced tax credits provided for in the act. We believe the legislation has enabled the opportunities to drive greater value to both our customers and shareholders while advancing our remaining projects. It is important to note that the application of all tax credits is analyzed on a project-by-project basis and is impacted by various factors such as capital costs and the expected production of the asset. Meanwhile, NIPSCO is in active commercial negotiations with potential counterparties to fulfill the preferred portfolio outlined in its 2021 integrated resource plan. Project agreements resulting from the all-sources RFP as well as the targeted gas peaking RFP at Schahfer Generating Station are expected to be announced this summer. Additional work continues around capturing direct and indirect funding opportunities from all of the federal legislation passed recently, most notably the nearly $500 billion generated from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the inflation Reduction Act. We have been active in several hydrogen hub proposals across our territory, each of which have received encouragement from the DOE to submit a full application for the regional clean hydrogen hub funding opportunity announcement as designated in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. I'd like to close by confirming we are on track to achieve our industry-leading environmental impact targets, namely a 90% reduction in Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 levels by 2030. This progress is consistent with the reductions needed to achieve our goal of net 0 Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2040, which we announced in November. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald, who will discuss our financial performance in more detail. Yes. Thanks, Nick. Appreciate the question. We've observed a broad range of qualified partners, which are positioned to help NIPSCO and NiSource realize its strategic goals. We're confident this is the right audience to evaluate a partnership with NiSource as we laid out in November. And we're also confident the process we've launched will lead us to a successful outcome this year. Yes. Thanks for the question. The time line has not changed. We still expect to be able to complete this in 2023. And as you can imagine, we're still early days in the process itself. So we'll be able to provide updates along the way when it's appropriate to do so. These are really 2 separate processes, and we believe both can proceed as we've laid out today. That's correct. Yes. Thanks, Ryan. Appreciate the question. As you can imagine, we're still working through the process. So we still consider these contract amendments confidential. But the 1 thing I'd say is that we will work forward with our partners in the appropriate filings with the commission to move these forward. We're talking about the 4 remaining projects that are not substantively under construction, apart from those that are already in service. The market seeing increases in cost in the 10% to 25% range.

            "name": "Lloyd Yates",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. By the end of the call, we want to leave you with 3 takeaways of our business and our future. I'd like to reiterate our confidence, progress and focus. Our confidence in our strategic plan and our strong progress in delivering on our commitments. Our progress on our regulatory initiatives, including pursuing a potential settlement in the NIPSCO electric rate case, and our focus on realizing the upside potential beyond our existing plan. We will touch on some of these incremental investment opportunities later in today's presentation. Turning to our performance, 2022 was a year of relentless and consistent execution by our team. Among the keys to our success in 2022 was our comprehensive business review. We believe the goals detailed at our Investor Day are both significant and achievable, and we will measure our progress against our premium utility growth plan each quarter. Our results this quarter and in 2022 were strong and demonstrate that we are off to a great start in the execution of our plan. We delivered earnings above our 2022 guidance and are raising our 2023 guidance. We also grew our dividend 6.4%. We remain on track to drive shareholder value for a compelling 9% to 11% total shareholder return. At Investor's Day, we committed to optimizing our cost profile and enhancing operational efficiency. We are doing it by transforming both our IT systems and the work process of [a support], behind processes and technology of our people, I want to thank each of our employees for their performance throughout 2022 and a deep commitment to serving our customers. Let's turn to Slide 5 of the presentation and take a closer look at our 2022 key achievements. NiSource's 2022 earnings exceeded our guidance range. We delivered $1.47 non-GAAP diluted NOEPS. That's up more than 7% from last year, It reflects our continued investment in safety, reliability, customer affordability and sustainability. Looking to 2023, we've increased our guidance range to $1.54 to $1.60 per share. This reflects our outperformance in 2022 and confidence in 2023 execution. We're reaffirming our expectation of a 6% to 8% annual NOEPS growth through 2027 as well as our annual 8% to 10% rate base growth. Slide 6 illustrates 2023 guidance and our commitment to grow 6% to 8% annually through 2027. Driving this top-tier growth are investments of $15 billion in regulated CapEx from 2023 through 2027. A high-level summary of which you can see on Slide 7. Looking out further, we continue to expect to invest $30 billion from 2023 to 2032. As I alluded to earlier, execution by our regulatory team continues to be a strength. In 2022, we filed 4 rate cases and resolved 3, in Pennsylvania, Maryland, and the Indiana gas case. In addition, the Ohio rate case concluded last month. These cases represent balanced outcomes supporting all stakeholders. Turning to Page 8. We have the following key priorities for 2023. First, continue to enhance our focus on safety and operational excellence. Second, the successful sale of our minority interest in NIPSCO to strengthen our balance sheet. Next, a balanced outcome in the NIPSCO electric rate case, which we will cover in a few moments. Fourth, drive efficiencies to achieve flat O&M spending to enhance customer affordability. These efforts will keep our customer rates sustainable with expected total annual rate increases that are in line with inflation. And finally, our commitment to delivering on our 2023 guidance. These are the priorities that we will keep top of mind throughout the year. On Slide 9, you will see the additional investment opportunities NiSource may pursue in both the near and long term. NiSource's investment opportunities include replacing pre-1985 plastic gas pipes as well as gas transmission replacements and reconfirmations to comply with PHMSA regulation. In addition, electric generation tax credit transferability and advanced gas metering infrastructure also represent attractive opportunities for NiSource in the near term. Beyond 2027, we see the need to add electric generation capacity in the marketplace and to enhance electric grid hardening. NiSource electric long-range transmission projects, elect transportation renewable gas infrastructure and hydrogen production hubs also make up long-term and large-scale projects we will seek to participate in to enhance our investment portfolio and drive greater value for our customers. Now let's turn to Page 10 to review some fourth quarter and recent highlights from gas distribution operations. Columbia Gas of Ohio received an order, except in the settlement in its rate case on January 26. The order includes a revenue increase of $68.2 million net of riders. New rates will be effective on March 1. The settlement in our Pennsylvania rate case was approved in December. It enables continued investments in the replacement of aging pipe and system upgrades needed to ensure service reliability and pipeline safety. New rates went into effect December 17. Finally, Columbia Gas of Maryland received an order in November, approving its rate case settlement. The settlement supports the company's continued investments in infrastructure replacement and system upgrades. Now for updates on our electric operations and renewables projects, I'd like to turn it over to Shawn Anderson. Nick, Lloyd Yates here. So when we think about the NIPSCO rate case, we filed our rebuttal testimony February 16, and we've already started discussions with the various parties on that rate case. I'm optimistic about settling that rate case, I think that you started thinking about time line around February 27, If hearings are starting March 13, I think that the time line is you should expect to see something around the end of February. If things are progressing, we could -- history has been to extend those a week or so to get settlement discussions complete. But I think that's the track we're on right now. So Shawn is leading that initiative for the company. I'm going to let Shawn Anderson answer that. So I would not treat that as incremental. That shift was really for progress payments for our renewable projects, I mean I think our plan is still as is, spending around $3 billion a year in CapEx is what we're committed to. We feel like we can execute that really, really well, but there's no increase in CapEx at all. Those are just progress payments for the projects. So we're in the middle of conversations. There's been some debate about that mechanism. We think that mechanism is really good for customers. As we shut those coal plants down, that cost goes back to customers immediately. We're in conversations with the various parties about how to make that work, I'm optimistic that we can do that because I think that's good for customers, and passing that cost back immediately. But I think those are an integral part of the settlement discussions right now. We hear you fine. Durgesh, we realize -- I mean those opportunities are out there. We don't have a size for those opportunities yet. I think as we get closer to those opportunities and know more about pre-1985 plastic pipe or MISO issue in new transmission opportunities, we'll be able to size it then. But as soon as we can size it, we'll let you guys know about it. Richard, this is Lloyd. First of all, I would say we're on track for flat O&M year-over-year. And I'd like to characterize it, we are really developing our O&M muscle. We have something going on at the company called Project Apollo we have outlined various processes and projects that we have teams working on to target doing things safer, better, more efficiently and for lower cost, and we're on track to achieve those. So let me handle both those questions. Starting with the O&M and the time line. I think that we try to align those with our rate cases, but I think -- our strategy here is any O&M that we can take out of the system that we can lean out of the system on any given day is better for our customers.

So thank you for your questions. And as we close, I want to reiterate what Donald and I have said about our confidence, progress and focus. Our confidence in our strategic plan and our strong progress in delivering on our commitments. Our progress on our regulatory initiatives, including pursuing a potential settlement in the NIPSCO electric rate case, and our focus on realizing the upside potential beyond our existing plan.

We appreciate you joining us this morning, and I hope all of you stay safe. Thank you."

            "name": "Donald Brown",
            "content": "Thanks, Shawn, and good morning, everyone. Turning to our fourth quarter 2022 results on Slide 13. Fourth quarter non-GAAP net operating earnings were $221 million or $0.50 per share compared to $167 million or $0.39 per share in the fourth quarter of 2021. Full year earnings were $648 million or $1.47 per share compared to $571 million or $1.37 per share in 2021. Taking a closer look at our fourth quarter segment, non-GAAP results on Slide 14. Gas distribution operating earnings were $288 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of $72 million versus the same quarter last year. Operating revenues, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were higher by $66 million, mainly due to new rates resulting from base rate cases and regulatory capital programs. Operating expenses, again, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were lower by $6 million due primarily to lower O&M and other taxes. In our electric segment, non-GAAP operating earnings for the fourth quarter were $68 million, $14 million lower than in the same quarter last year. Operating revenues, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were lower by $4 million, mainly due to slightly lower weather-normalized customer usage. Operating expenses, once again excluding the cost of energy and tracked expenses were higher by $10 million, primarily due to increased depreciation and amortization. Now I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of December 31, 2022, was $11.3 billion, of which $9.6 billion was long-term debt with a weighted average maturity of 14 years and a weighted average interest rate of 3.7%. At the end of the fourth quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of over $1.6 billion. consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization programs. We remain committed to our current investment-grade credit ratings. Slide 16 highlights our financing strategy and credit commitments. We issued a $1 billion 1-year term loan in December and used the proceeds to reduce our commercial paper balances and the loan bridges the gap into our equity unit remarketing in the fall. Our financing plan includes no block or ATM equity issuances in 2023 or 2024. And is consistent with all of our earnings growth and credit commitments through 2027 and remains unchanged from Investor Day in November. I'd like to highlight that the recent drop in natural gas prices directly reduces our customers' bills over time and reduces the natural gas impact on working capital and financing charges. A year in 2022, deferred fuel amounted to roughly 54 basis points of FFO to debt versus 76 basis points at year-end 2021. For some context of the impact of higher gas prices over the last 2 years, at year-end 2020, deferred fuel only had a 6 basis point impact on our FFO to debt. In summary, we reported 2022 EPS of $1.47, exceeding our $1.44 to $1.46 guidance range. We have raised our 2023 guidance to $1.54 to $1.60, an increase of over $0.03 versus our prior midpoint. We're also reiterating our long-term growth commitment of 6% to 8% annual NOEPS growth through 2027. Despite persistent macroeconomic headwinds and volatility, we are advancing key elements of our 5-year plan, and we remain focused on safety, reliability, affordability and sustainability. Before we open up the line to answer your questions, I'd like to reiterate our confidence, progress and focus. Our confidence in our strategic plan and our strong progress in delivering on those commitments. Our progress on our regulatory initiatives, including pursuing a potential settlement in the NIPSCO electric rate case, and our focus on realizing the upside potential beyond our existing plan. Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. We're now ready to take your questions. No. And let me correct. It certainly didn't say block. Our financing plan has not changed. It still is that we expect to enter into ATM post 2025. And that's really to keep us in that 14% to 16%, FFO to debt range, but no blocks planned are expected at this point. Yes. No, great question. Certainly, seeing favorable natural gas prices, including today, we're seeing NYMEX March price around $2 or below $2. So that's great impact for our customers. As we look at it, we're expecting probably a 20% to 25% decrease in customer bills, '23 versus 2022. So really good outcome. Yes, great question. If you look at our history, we're typically in every 2 to 3 years in most jurisdictions. We're actually coming off a pretty heavy year last year where we were in 5 rate cases, Ohio, Indiana, new rates in 2022, Virginia, Kentucky and Maryland. So last year was a pretty heavy year. But if you look at our history, Maryland's almost every year, PA is almost every year, and then other states typically every 2 to 3 years. Yes. We're evaluating Pennsylvania, but I'd say otherwise, it's every 2 to 3 years on the other states. . Yes. I'd say our financing plan hasn't changed. And as Shawn stated that the process is going as expected. When we get more details that we can communicate on the sale transaction, we'll do that. But no change to the financing plan at this point."

For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Chris Turnure, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nChristopher Turnure: Good morning, and welcome to the NiSource Second Quarter 2022 Investor Call. Joining me today are Chief Executive Officer, Lloyd Yates; Chief Financial Officer, Donald Brown; Chief Strategy and Risk Officer, Shawn Anderson; Group President, NiSource Utilities, Pablo Vegas; and VP of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Randy Hulen. The purpose of this presentation is to review NiSource's financial performance for the second quarter of 2022 as well as provide an update on our operations and growth drivers. Following our prepared remarks, we'll open the call to your questions.  Slides for today's call are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. We would like to remind you that some of the statements made during this presentation will be forward-looking. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements.  Information concerning such risks and uncertainties is included in the MD&A and Risk Factors sections of our periodic SEC filings. Additionally, some of the statements made on this call relate to non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the supplemental slides, segment information and full financial schedule information on the most directly comparable GAAP measure and a reconciliation of these measures.  I'd now like to turn the call over to Lloyd.\nLloyd Yates: Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Hopefully, you've all had a chance to read our second quarter earnings release, which we issued earlier today. In the second quarter, the NiSource team's focus on safety and operational excellence continue to drive our plans for growth and sustainability while providing the reliable service our customers deserve. While the Commerce Department's pause on solar panel tariffs does not restore the original time lines for our renewable generation projects, it does give us more confidence and clarity on the revised project time lines. We expect our renewable investments, along with the flexibility of our mitigation plan to provide the path to meeting our commitment to deliver 7% to 9% compound annual growth and non-GAAP NOEPS from 2021 through 2024.  Let's turn now to Slide 3 and take a closer look at our key takeaways. We are reaffirming our 2022 guidance of $1.42 to $1.48 diluted non-GAAP NOEPS. We are reaffirming our forecast for 7% to 9% compound annual growth rate from 2021 through 2024, including near-term annual growth of 5% to 7% through 2023. Our renewable generation projects remain on track to meet the revised in-service dates we shared last quarter. Retirement dates for our remaining coal generation assets are unchanged since last quarter as well. We continue to make strong progress in our regulatory agenda with a settlement approved in NIPSCO gas rate case and settlement discussions underway in both Ohio and Pennsylvania.  And NiSource posted non-GAAP diluted net operating earnings per share or NOEPS of $0.12 in the second quarter versus $0.13 in the second quarter of last year. Before we move forward, I'd like to briefly cover 2 items. First, our strategic review continues and is progressing very well. This robust process involves our senior management team with a few Board members and explore potential internal and external opportunities to maximize risk-adjusted shareholder value. As we have indicated previously, all strategic scenarios are being benchmarked against a very competitive organic plan. We intend to share the results together with our full long-term growth plan beyond 2024 at Investor Day in November.  Second, we've added Melody Birmingham and Bill Jefferson to our executive leadership team. Both are well-respected and highly experienced. We have also elevated Chief Human Resource Officer, Melanie Berman, to the team. These changes will drive clearer lines of accountability across the organization and excellence in everything we do. I'm excited about our team and the contributions they will make as we move NiSource forward.  Now I'd like to update you on the progress we are making on our regulatory agenda. Let's turn to Slide 10 and the NiSource gas distribution highlights for the second quarter. We received an order from the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission on NIPSCO's gas rate case. It provides a revenue increase of $72 million annually with new rates effective September 2022 and March 2023. This balanced outcome demonstrates a positive path toward continuing investments in essential resources that will support safe operations, upgrading aging infrastructure and enhancing the customer experience.  Columbia Gas, Ohio has requested to reschedule hearings in its rate case until October to facilitate continued settlement discussions. The company has requested an increase of $221 million, net of capital expenditure program and infrastructure replacement program riders. Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania is also in settlement discussions. Its rate case request additional revenues of about $82.2 million, which are intended to further upgrade and replace gas lines for the long-term safety of customers and communities. It also seeks to provide additional energy efficiency options while balancing costs. We are also making progress with our rate case in Virginia. Columbia Gas of Virginia requested an increase in annual revenues of $40.6 million, net of the FA tracker to continue safety and modernization investments.  And finally, Columbia Gas of Maryland filed a rate case on May 13. It seeks to further upgrade and replace portions of the company's underground natural gas distribution pipelines. If approved, the proposed rate adjustments will go into effect at the end of 2022. Now for updates on our electric operations and renewables projects, I'd like to bring in Shawn Anderson. Shawn?\nShawn Anderson: Thank you, Lloyd, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slides 11 and 14. As Lloyd mentioned earlier, the pause on solar panel tariffs provide some clarity regarding the application of tariffs across the solar marketplace, creating some stability in the near-term for the market. This is a positive development to advance our solar projects and to ultimately ensure a diverse, reliable electric generation portfolio with significant environmental benefits stemming from wind and solar resources. As each asset comes online, we continue to grow our percentage of generation attributed to renewable sources.  We continue to firmly believe that this portfolio of projects has delivered and will continue to deliver significant economic benefits to our customers and communities, including less volatile electric generation costs, something that is especially relevant in today's energy commodity environment. As we've reported, the commercial and construction processes associated with the development of our renewable generation projects continue to track in line with our revised in-service dates discussed last quarter. NIPSCO's Indiana Crossroads Solar and Dunns Bridge Solar 1 projects continue to advance with solar panel installation well underway at both projects. We are receiving a steady stream of panel deliveries and we anticipate both entering service in the first half of 2023.  NIPSCO continues to work closely with developer partners of the remaining IURC approved solar projects to refine the time lines and tighten the ranges of in-service dates as each project advances in the development life cycle toward final in-service dates. NiSource remains on track to make capital investments totaling approximately $10 billion during the 2021 to 2024 period. Capital investments for renewable projects of approximately $2 billion are expected primarily between 2022 and 2024, with any remainder expected in 2025.  In total, capital investments are expected to drive compound annual rate base growth of 10% to 12% for each of the company's businesses through 2024. We are also excited to share that we expect NIPSCO to issue an RFP for all sources of capacity resources including renewable generation projects and a targeted RFP for gas peaking units later this month, a refresh of our recent RFP results will provide better market perspective on pricing and availability of resources in line with the preferred pathway outlined in the 2021 NIPSCO Integrated Resource Plan. Plans to retire existing coal-fired generation are unchanged from our discussion last quarter. The Schahfer generating stations remaining 2 coal units are expected to retire by the end of 2025 and with Michigan City Generating Station retiring between 2026 and 2028.  And now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald, who will highlight our financial performance in more detail.\nDonald Brown: Thanks, Shawn, and good morning, everyone. As Lloyd mentioned, we've narrowed the timing of our planned Investor Day to November and we're making progress towards sharing a definitive long-term plan for NiSource beyond 2024. As you might imagine, the results of our strategic review, timing of planned solar projects and the RFP, Shawn just mentioned, are significant factors in our planning. I hope all of you will be able to join us as we discuss our path forward.  Turning to our second quarter 2022 results on Slide 4. We had non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $53.9 million or $0.12 per diluted share compared to non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $52.6 million or $0.13 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2021. We have reaffirmed our 2022 guidance of $1.42 to $1.48 and all of our long-term diluted non-GAAP net operating earnings per share growth rates.  Taking a closer look at our second quarter segment non-GAAP results on Slide 5, gas distribution operating earnings were about $81 million for Q2 of 2022, representing an increase of approximately $15 million versus the same quarter last year. Operating revenues, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were higher by approximately $36 million, mainly due to new rates resulting from base rate cases and regulatory capital programs. Operating expenses, again, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were higher by approximately $21 million due primarily to higher employee and depreciation expenses.  In our electric segment, non-GAAP operating earnings for the second quarter were about $73 million, which is about $11 million lower than in the same quarter last year. Second quarter operating revenues, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were higher by approximately $8 million in 2022. This is primarily due to the joint venture revenues offset in expense. This quarter also saw increased capital investment recoveries and customer growth. Operating expenses, once again, excluding the cost of energy and tracked expenses, were approximately $19 million higher than 2021 due primarily to increase joint venture depreciation and amortization as well as joint venture-related operating expenses, both of which are partially offset in revenues.  Now turning to Slide 6, I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of June 30, 2022, was about $10.1 billion, of which about $9.6 billion was long-term debt with a weighted average maturity of approximately 14 years and a weighted average interest rate of approximately 3.7%. At the end of the second quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of over $1.6 billion consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization programs. We continue our commitment to retaining our current investment-grade credit ratings.  Late last week, Moody's reaffirmed our ratings and outlook, which now has all 3 agencies reaffirming NiSource's ratings in 2022. Our debt and credit profile continued to represent a solid financial foundation to support our long-term safety and infrastructure investments.  As you can see on Slide 7 and 8, we are continuing the process of making some adjustments to our financial plan to reflect the expected delays in solar generation projects. These potential adjustments will help mitigate the earnings impact of project delays and enable us to maintain our 2024 EPS growth commitment. The long-term visibility of our capital plan and the flexibility in our regulatory mechanisms illustrate the resiliency and strength of our business to maintain all of our commitments, including EPS growth.  Taking a quick look at Slide 9, which highlights our financing plan. There's no change to the overall financing plan, and I'm excited to highlight that on June 10, we successfully executed our first green bond issuance, which was a 30-year bond at 5%. The proceeds for this note are intended to be used for the purchase of our Rosewater and Crossroads wind projects next year. I would also highlight that this balanced financing plan continues to be consistent with all of our earnings growth and credit commitments.  Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. We're ready now to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We will now take our first question from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.\nShahriar Pourreza: Can you hear me?\nLloyd Yates: We hear you.\nShahriar Pourreza: You mentioned in your prepared remarks that the pause on tariffs adds more confidence and clarity but obviously, no change in project timing delays. Maybe just focusing on '23 sort of with the reiterated slides, looks like still a little bit of a near-term growth divot. Any sort of offsetting opportunities that could further mitigate this drag, like maybe incremental O&M savings. So any sense on how we should think about growth as we bridge from '22 to '23?\nDonald Brown: Great. I can hit that in terms of earnings. So as we outlined in our -- as we outlined in our Q1 call, what we are doing to mitigate the impact of the solar delays is pulling forward capital into this year and next year to offset some of the impacts of that balanced with some interest savings because of delay in that remaining $0.5 billion of capital and some O&M savings. So we feel like we've got a good plan that mitigates those delays while we continue to negotiate with our developers to understand the timing of these projects. Shawn, any other?\nShawn Anderson: No, that's all. That's all correct. And as we look at the projects, most of those projects we're really looking at a '23, '24 in service date. So we'd have to go back and line that up. So we feel like the rate case outcomes that we could achieve can still stagger in a similar path of revenue that can also be consistent with the plan we had in place before.\nShahriar Pourreza: Got it. So we shouldn't look at the '23 bar chart where it kind of shows that the tracker investments are slightly trailing the delayed renewable investments. There's a timing issue there. So we shouldn't think about that as being a divot.\nLloyd Yates: That's correct. We expect to mitigate that.\nShahriar Pourreza: Perfect. And then, Lloyd, with sort of another quarter now under your belt as a CEO, just want to get a sense on how some of the drivers may have changed since initiating the strategic review process as we think about sort of maybe the LDCs within the portfolio? I guess 1 thing comes to mind is, obviously, we're in a much higher interest rate environment. Is there any other factors we should be thinking about that may have swung your thinking? And are you still seeing serious demand for the LDCs?\nLloyd Yates: So let me answer the second question first, and then we'll go. So we still believe there is serious demand for the LDCs. I think when you talk about -- when we think about our strategic review process, I mean, I always say it's a really robust process. We have -- as I mentioned, senior management and our Board involved -- and we're just weighing that against what we call a pretty robust stand-alone plans. When you look at our stand-alone plans and also inside of our stand-alone plans, we see O&M opportunities inside of NiSource to make it better. We're comparing that to what it would look like to monetize the LDCs to see how we can best finance the growth going forward.  So all those things are on the table, a robust stand-alone plan, but with us working real hard inside to enhance that. We've done some extensive benchmarking. We still see a demand for the LDCs due to some infrastructure funds out there, some big infrastructure funds out there. And we're just comparing those things and we'll come out with decisions in November.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Nick Campanella with Credit Suisse.\nNicholas Campanella: So I guess just on inflation Reduction Act potential for minimum tax. Just can you discuss how you're thinking about the impacts to your business if an AMT was implemented? And then maybe just any kind of benefits out of IRA that we should be thinking through as well?\nDonald Brown: Yes. Thanks for the question. So as we look at the act, and obviously, it's early, we need to do some more analysis of what it means long-term. But I'd say there's no near-term material impact to our plan to look at the plan and the earnings thresholds. We don't meet the earnings thresholds here in the near-term. And so we still have NOLs through the first half of the decade. Second half of the decade is when we expected the NOLs to expire, we've become a cash taxpayer. That's about also the time that we meet that income threshold. So nothing -- no change to how we were thinking about the business and the tax payment of the business.  Long-term, we do need to really understand this legislation, how it's going to play out. In terms of renewables, long-term, energy efficiency and what potential opportunities that might exist for us in the business.\nNicholas Campanella: Fantastic. Okay. And then I guess just on Ohio. I know the proceedings have been delayed a bit, just primarily because you're working -- you said you're working towards a settlement there. I guess if you have new rates being delayed, are you still comfortable within your '22 guidance range that you gave today? And are there any timing considerations there to better understand?\nLloyd Yates: I'll let Pablo who's President of our Utilities weigh in.\nPablo Vegas: Thanks, Lloyd. And yes, thanks for the question. The -- we did anticipate the potential for more extended settlement set of discussions. This being a case that covers a pretty broad period of time, 14 years in total. A lot of things to work through and want to make sure that everyone has an opportunity to thoroughly understand our positions and that we can thoroughly understand all of theirs. So we do have levers that we can leverage through the back half of this year to try to mitigate some of the timing implications of the delay in the in those discussions. And so we're confident in the guidance range that we're reaffirming today.\nOperator: Next, we have Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Maybe just to continue here. You used the word benchmarking a couple of times here. Can you elaborate a little bit more on what exactly you're benchmarking to? I think that was in reference to some of the cost-cutting opportunities and opportunities to enhance your stand-alone plan. Can you elaborate a little bit more? You said you've done extensive benchmarking and you provided that in response to the question earlier, where you also talked about extensive LDC demand. Just talk about like what this benchmarking opportunity holds for you in terms of that organic plan?\nLloyd Yates: So we're still in the middle of it, but -- and I'll let Shawn talk but I'll start it off. We've done an extensive study what I'll say, other low-cost, top-performing gas and electric utilities, and we understand how we perform versus those. We've had a significant -- and then we go, we had a significant focus on improving our safety, our pipeline safety. But going forward, we see some opportunities for enhanced productivity, getting more done, getting more work done with the people we have and possibly displace and getting some of our people to do some of the capital work that we've had contractors to do because we become a lot more efficient on the O&M side.  So I think this drive for efficiencies is a significant opportunity for us. Also, when we think about our technology costs as compared to others, a modernization of our technology system. There's also a significant O&M opportunity for us. And when we look hard at our A&G costs as compared to others, we're a little bit high. So we're working through all those things. We see an opportunity to enhance our plan, and we're going to lay that out for you in the near future. Shawn, do you want to add to that?\nShawn Anderson: No, I'll just expand on a couple of the pieces. I think it applies also to CapEx efficiency and our ability to execute capital, which can create either more capital opportunities, which, of course, is attractive, but also a maximum value across safety, technology, renewables development, all of the different elements that we're trying to support with the businesses that we have on the electric and the gas side.  So by becoming more efficient, it can also create better financial performance, but it also just maximize the value of the work that we do as we operate our system and run our businesses. So each of our businesses have a 10% to 12% rate base opportunity in their horizon and the more that we can become efficient upon that, the better work we can do, the more safe of the system we can run and the maximum value we can get on the recovery of those assets and the values.  I'd also say that it's benchmarking beyond just O&M and CapEx. I think we're studying our ability to be a leader in the decarbonization space, which we are on the electric side. I think we're studying how our overall return to shareholders can be maximized, including our compelling dividend that we offer. I think we're looking at the 7% to 9% and studying what opportunities exist for us to extend that 7% to 9% for a period into the future and how that total shareholder return could look compared to being monetized in a more short-term environment.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Yes. Understood. Compelling here. In fact, just to keep going towards opportunities here, let's just talk about structuring the renewals ownership opportunity in that upcoming RFP. Any thoughts about your own ability to own? And then specifically, in the context of IRA with the Solar PTC and some of these other elements on normalization. To what extent could that actually enable more ownership, given the apples-to-apples economics as well?\nShawn Anderson: A couple of pieces into that question, Julien. Thanks for that. First off, on the RFP itself, it is agnostic to ownership structure. So it's an all-source RFP which is really going to include any dispatchable, semi-dispatchable generation, renewables stand-alone and call in all those projects so that we can then evaluate what those proposals are and how ownership could then be structured thereafter.  We would expect some to be PPAs. We'd expect some to come in with NIPSCO ownership, which, of course, we have the bias for provided we can keep the cost of customer in a reasonable range relative to other alternatives. Contrast that with the Schahfer RFP, which is really targeted for dispatchable Blackstar capable resources at Schahfer on gas peaking units, which is consistent with the plan we rolled out in November of last year. That would really utilize MISO generate replacement interconnections that we would expect to be the owner of as part of that RFP. So I think that in that piece, it's fully implied the ownership for NIPSCO whereas the all-source RFP we'd evaluate the full suite and understand from an affordability standpoint, how NIPSCO could maximize the ownership structure while also delivering a compelling cost to customer in consideration of all other competing projects.  And then I think on the second part of your question, Donald highlighted it. On the legislation itself, just specific to PTC, ITC and transferability, it's still fresh in terms of what that means and how the legislation is formed. So we'll absolutely take a look at the provisions and their applicability to our plan. As you know, our current plan does not contemplate something like this direct pay or transferability. So if we can find a way to utilize these concepts, it's going to help us increase investment and hopefully keep costs down for customers, we'll be a supporter of that.  We need to figure out in the language, if that's possible, given where we're at. And I think we've got some flexibilities on the remaining -- remainder of our projects. but we've got to also keep time lines in mind. They matter greatly to our ability to retire Schahfer by 2025 and making sure that these projects can track in alignment with the scheduled dates that we provided to you today. So as we look further out, it might be applicable for Michigan City's retiring capacity. And of course, that could be a solution as well. But we need to make sure that we consider the legislation, the time horizon to make sure things track to be applicable to the plan we have in the 14 projects that we have approved by the IURC.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes. Fair enough. Okay. Yes. But specifically would help you guys compete versus other RFPs, not just customers receive a lower price, right?\nShawn Anderson: Yes, it's possible. But there are other considerations that we need to evaluate, notably IRS rules for regulated utilities, and we need to make sure everything can comport with an entire structure that can make sense. So a number of considerations we need to see ironed out. We view it as something as a possible upside and let's review the language and see how we can apply it to the projects when it gets formulated.\nOperator: The next questions we have come from Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs.\nInsoo Kim: First question on just the weather normal demand trends. I think last quarter and this quarter as well, at least on the industrial side, it seems like on a year-over-year basis, it's been trending down. I don't know if you had already covered this before if there's something that I'm missing, but just more color on those trends when a lot of other parts of the country, it seems like industrial demand has been relatively strong this quarter.\nDonald Brown: Insoo, great to hear from you. Certainly, we are seeing some weakness on our industrial sales. As you know, a portion of our customers, our industrial customers in Indiana electric revenues are down because of the steel industry being down a little bit. I'd say that is offset by usage up on both residential and commercial as well as customer growth. So we might be having some short-term weakness on the industrial, but overall, seeing growth on the electric side.  The other item that I just want to make sure everyone understood was a few years ago in the last electric rate case, we did change the tariff to really minimize the impact of electric code on our overall earnings. And so despite the industrials being down somewhat, our overall earnings are not down or not being driven down the cost of the industrials.\nInsoo Kim: Got it. I do remember that. Got it. And then when we think about some of that softness in industrials, some of the delays in the solar in '23 to '24 and the pension item where I think disclosed pretty well how you calculate that with the quarter message and all that.  As you Put all that together, I know you reiterated the 5% to 7% on the '23 growth rate, that midpoint at the 6%, all these considered, are you -- you feel like you're still at a point to hit that midpoint at least?\nDonald Brown: Yes, absolutely. We build contingencies into our plan, recognizing that there's going to be changes -- potential changes in interest rates and financing costs as well as timing of -- an amount from rate cases. And so absolutely confident in our plan to meet this year's guidance as well as our long-term guidance.\nOperator: Next, we have Travis Miller with Morningstar.\nTravis Miller: Wonder if you could update your thinking on the NIPSCO base rate filing and timing, especially given how inflation would potentially hit your CapEx or the renewable delays and shifts? Just any thoughts there in terms of timing?\nPablo Vegas: Yes. Travis, this is Pablo. We're still thinking that a case sometime before the end of this year makes sense because if you think about the projects that are already completed and the ones that we have in flight that we expect to go in service next year, the timing for case filed sometime before this end of this year, makes sense to start stepping in those investments into our rate structure. And the way that we have the flexibility in Indiana, Indiana structure with pace is one of the more flexible ones where we can time the kind of project investments completions with extensions out of the test year to try to capture and maximize the time lines that will eventually evolve from the projects that have been delayed.  And so we'll evaluate which can be incorporated into this next rate case in which would have to go into a subsequent. But with the ability to kind of flex the test year in Indiana and then the ability to flex in the step in of rates that align when projects go into construction to service. We still think that a rate case probably sometime before the end of this year makes the most sense. And then we would look to then pick up the balance of any of the projects that fall outside of those test years in a subsequent filing. But we would have the ability to again, timing of those rates going into effect. So that's the overall earnings profile that we'll be discussing would still be able to be achieved.\nTravis Miller: Okay. Got it. And then just thinking overall about the customer ability there on the electric side or gas side. How do you see the higher commodity costs from the first half flowing through? Are customers are going to start to see that in their summer bills are more delayed into their winter bills? Just wondering, and I guess that would go to your hedging program also on behalf of customers?\nDonald Brown: Yes. So customers are seeing the higher commodity prices in their bills already. We look at kind of year-over-year customer bills are up about 19%, 20% because gas prices really started to increase last summer. Once we look at our fuel adjustment clauses across our jurisdictions, we're typically adjusting -- we can't adjust quarterly, in some cases, and we're trying to balance out our payment of those commodities with adjusting those prices over a 12- or 18-month period. And so we've got some flexibility. But at the same time, we want to make sure that we're managing cash flow appropriately. So customers are seeing the impacts, and it's something that we're paying attention to. Long-term, I think the forecast still continues to show that natural gas prices will go back down to $4, $5 range. But obviously, we've got some higher prices and more volatility in the period.\nOperator: Next question comes from Ryan Levine with Citi.\nRyan Levine: Something to touch on the in-flight renewable projects. Where is NiSource in key supply chain queues with these in-flight renewable projects? And how is the company looking to manage the execution at this stage in the process?\nShawn Anderson: Yes. Thanks, Ryan. So to answer your question, we have panels flowing on the 2 projects under construction. So those 2 projects continue to track online with the first half 2023 Horizon 4 in service. And then the remaining 4 projects, if we're talking about the PTAs here, are finalizing the commercial negotiations associated with the supply constructs and what would get them to constructability. So that process is underway right now to ensure that they can continue to hit the deadlines that we've put together on Slide 14.\nRyan Levine: Okay. And then are there contingencies that those dates aren't met?\nShawn Anderson: Yes. We've got active dialogue with our developers to understand what those time lines look like, and we continue to refresh those time lines alongside our developers. I'll point to the near-term RFP as well as another opportunity for us to refresh the marketplace and understand outside of the book of the 14 projects that we've contracted for, what else might be available as a potential contingency should that arise.  We still believe strongly that the 14 projects that are being developed are compelling value for our customers. Most notably due to the low cost of energy in 2018, 2019, when those projects were negotiated, but also the value in the CPCNs that are already approved from our regulators and just the immense amount of time and energy from a number of stakeholders. The developer partners, our internal teams or community members to help support the development of those projects.  At this time, we have no delays other than the refreshed deadlines and time lines that we've provided last quarter, and our continued dialogue with our developers have us tracking online with that.\nRyan Levine: And given the time line that you just highlighted, do you expect to address any cost increases for these renewable projects through future GRCs or through the existing CPCN processes?\nShawn Anderson: The build transfer contracts are turnkey, which leaves the construction cost and timing risk really to be borne by the developer counterparties, some level of tariff impacts contemplated with the contracts. So given the circumstances that have happened over the last few months, we're in discussions with our developers to understand that impact to the project. And then any price increase associated with any of the projects would require approval from the IURC either through a CPCN or through a rate case process or a regulatory process. So we'll evaluate each of the projects and their circumstances and decide which path to go should there be increases that require that refresh with our regulators.\nRyan Levine: And then last question for me. You highlighted ongoing negotiations in Pennsylvania or settlement discussions. Any color you could share around the state of that process and path forward?\nPablo Vegas: Yes. Sure, Ryan. This is Pablo. Discussions have been, I think, very constructive. We've seen since in the last -- the case that we settled last year and in the settlement discussions this year, a reasonable tack taken by all the stakeholders. The focus on customer value remains at the front of those discussions, making sure that the economics of the case stay reasonable for all customer classes.  And Pennsylvania continues to be very supportive in our modernization program, wanting us to advance our pipeline replacement program and continue on that safety work. So all around, I'd say those conversations have gone constructively, and we look forward to continue to drive towards the settlement there.\nOperator: Your last question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.\nSteven Fleishman: Yes. I appreciate it. I just wanted to close the loop on the ongoing review. And so Lloyd, you mentioned robust review of the extending the core plan and then comparing that to kind of other options with the LDCs and the like. Could you just maybe just to fill the whole slate here. How about any review of options for the whole company relative to that, not just assets?\nLloyd Yates: So that is also a part of the review. I mean, we have reviewed what it looks like for the whole company. If you look at the private equity market there with some of the large infrastructure funds. And we're trying to understand what that looks like as compared to our stand-alone plan. So that is also part of the review that we are doing.\nSteven Fleishman: Okay. And just -- and then on the stand-alone plan on the kind of core plan and such. I mean, it sounds like -- and I mean this has been true, I think since you got there, there's decent conviction with O&M and the rate base opportunities to potentially sustain the 7% to 9% growth. Is that...\nLloyd Yates: That is it. I mean I'm a firm believer, and I mean our job 1 is to run the business you have as best you can. And then you want to compare that to other opportunities, whether you sell an LDC or selling the whole company, your obligation when you walk in the door is to run the business every day as best you can, safer, better, faster and for lower costs. Look at our plan to do that and how it compares to these other opportunities and do the best you can for your shareholders.  So that's the fundamental base of running the business to me, and that will continue to always have that conviction.\nSteven Fleishman: Okay. And just since that's the scenario you probably control the most, just again, with the work you've done so far, how are you feeling about the way the stand-alone opportunity is coming together?\nLloyd Yates: I feel very good about them. So I feel very good about it.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Lloyd Yates for closing remarks.\nLloyd Yates: Thank you. Thank you for your questions. And let me close by reiterating a few key takeaways. One, we are reaffirming our 2022 guidance of $1.42 to $1.48 diluted non-GAAP NOEPS, and we are reaffirming our forecast for 7% to 9% on compound annual growth rate from 2021 through 2024, including near-term annual growth of 5% to 7% through 2023.  Second, our renewable generation projects remain on track to meet the revised in-service dates that we shared with you last quarter. We continue to make strong progress in our regulatory agenda with a settlement approved in NIPSCO gas rate case and constructive settlement talks in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia.  And finally, we intend to present NiSource's long-term growth plan at an Investor Day in November. We look forward to seeing you all there. We appreciate you joining us this morning, and please stay safe. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Lloyd, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slides 11 and 14. As Lloyd mentioned earlier, the pause on solar panel tariffs provide some clarity regarding the application of tariffs across the solar marketplace, creating some stability in the near-term for the market. This is a positive development to advance our solar projects and to ultimately ensure a diverse, reliable electric generation portfolio with significant environmental benefits stemming from wind and solar resources. As each asset comes online, we continue to grow our percentage of generation attributed to renewable sources.  We continue to firmly believe that this portfolio of projects has delivered and will continue to deliver significant economic benefits to our customers and communities, including less volatile electric generation costs, something that is especially relevant in today's energy commodity environment. As we've reported, the commercial and construction processes associated with the development of our renewable generation projects continue to track in line with our revised in-service dates discussed last quarter. NIPSCO's Indiana Crossroads Solar and Dunns Bridge Solar 1 projects continue to advance with solar panel installation well underway at both projects. We are receiving a steady stream of panel deliveries and we anticipate both entering service in the first half of 2023.  NIPSCO continues to work closely with developer partners of the remaining IURC approved solar projects to refine the time lines and tighten the ranges of in-service dates as each project advances in the development life cycle toward final in-service dates. NiSource remains on track to make capital investments totaling approximately $10 billion during the 2021 to 2024 period. Capital investments for renewable projects of approximately $2 billion are expected primarily between 2022 and 2024, with any remainder expected in 2025.  In total, capital investments are expected to drive compound annual rate base growth of 10% to 12% for each of the company's businesses through 2024. We are also excited to share that we expect NIPSCO to issue an RFP for all sources of capacity resources including renewable generation projects and a targeted RFP for gas peaking units later this month, a refresh of our recent RFP results will provide better market perspective on pricing and availability of resources in line with the preferred pathway outlined in the 2021 NIPSCO Integrated Resource Plan. Plans to retire existing coal-fired generation are unchanged from our discussion last quarter. The Schahfer generating stations remaining 2 coal units are expected to retire by the end of 2025 and with Michigan City Generating Station retiring between 2026 and 2028.  And now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald, who will highlight our financial performance in more detail. No, that's all. That's all correct. And as we look at the projects, most of those projects we're really looking at a '23, '24 in service date. So we'd have to go back and line that up. So we feel like the rate case outcomes that we could achieve can still stagger in a similar path of revenue that can also be consistent with the plan we had in place before. No, I'll just expand on a couple of the pieces. I think it applies also to CapEx efficiency and our ability to execute capital, which can create either more capital opportunities, which, of course, is attractive, but also a maximum value across safety, technology, renewables development, all of the different elements that we're trying to support with the businesses that we have on the electric and the gas side.  So by becoming more efficient, it can also create better financial performance, but it also just maximize the value of the work that we do as we operate our system and run our businesses. So each of our businesses have a 10% to 12% rate base opportunity in their horizon and the more that we can become efficient upon that, the better work we can do, the more safe of the system we can run and the maximum value we can get on the recovery of those assets and the values.  I'd also say that it's benchmarking beyond just O&M and CapEx. I think we're studying our ability to be a leader in the decarbonization space, which we are on the electric side. I think we're studying how our overall return to shareholders can be maximized, including our compelling dividend that we offer. I think we're looking at the 7% to 9% and studying what opportunities exist for us to extend that 7% to 9% for a period into the future and how that total shareholder return could look compared to being monetized in a more short-term environment. A couple of pieces into that question, Julien. Thanks for that. First off, on the RFP itself, it is agnostic to ownership structure. So it's an all-source RFP which is really going to include any dispatchable, semi-dispatchable generation, renewables stand-alone and call in all those projects so that we can then evaluate what those proposals are and how ownership could then be structured thereafter.  We would expect some to be PPAs. We'd expect some to come in with NIPSCO ownership, which, of course, we have the bias for provided we can keep the cost of customer in a reasonable range relative to other alternatives. Contrast that with the Schahfer RFP, which is really targeted for dispatchable Blackstar capable resources at Schahfer on gas peaking units, which is consistent with the plan we rolled out in November of last year. That would really utilize MISO generate replacement interconnections that we would expect to be the owner of as part of that RFP. So I think that in that piece, it's fully implied the ownership for NIPSCO whereas the all-source RFP we'd evaluate the full suite and understand from an affordability standpoint, how NIPSCO could maximize the ownership structure while also delivering a compelling cost to customer in consideration of all other competing projects.  And then I think on the second part of your question, Donald highlighted it. On the legislation itself, just specific to PTC, ITC and transferability, it's still fresh in terms of what that means and how the legislation is formed. So we'll absolutely take a look at the provisions and their applicability to our plan. As you know, our current plan does not contemplate something like this direct pay or transferability. So if we can find a way to utilize these concepts, it's going to help us increase investment and hopefully keep costs down for customers, we'll be a supporter of that.  We need to figure out in the language, if that's possible, given where we're at. And I think we've got some flexibilities on the remaining -- remainder of our projects. but we've got to also keep time lines in mind. They matter greatly to our ability to retire Schahfer by 2025 and making sure that these projects can track in alignment with the scheduled dates that we provided to you today. So as we look further out, it might be applicable for Michigan City's retiring capacity. And of course, that could be a solution as well. But we need to make sure that we consider the legislation, the time horizon to make sure things track to be applicable to the plan we have in the 14 projects that we have approved by the IURC. Yes, it's possible. But there are other considerations that we need to evaluate, notably IRS rules for regulated utilities, and we need to make sure everything can comport with an entire structure that can make sense. So a number of considerations we need to see ironed out. We view it as something as a possible upside and let's review the language and see how we can apply it to the projects when it gets formulated. Yes. Thanks, Ryan. So to answer your question, we have panels flowing on the 2 projects under construction. So those 2 projects continue to track online with the first half 2023 Horizon 4 in service. And then the remaining 4 projects, if we're talking about the PTAs here, are finalizing the commercial negotiations associated with the supply constructs and what would get them to constructability. So that process is underway right now to ensure that they can continue to hit the deadlines that we've put together on Slide 14. Yes. We've got active dialogue with our developers to understand what those time lines look like, and we continue to refresh those time lines alongside our developers. I'll point to the near-term RFP as well as another opportunity for us to refresh the marketplace and understand outside of the book of the 14 projects that we've contracted for, what else might be available as a potential contingency should that arise.  We still believe strongly that the 14 projects that are being developed are compelling value for our customers. Most notably due to the low cost of energy in 2018, 2019, when those projects were negotiated, but also the value in the CPCNs that are already approved from our regulators and just the immense amount of time and energy from a number of stakeholders. The developer partners, our internal teams or community members to help support the development of those projects.  At this time, we have no delays other than the refreshed deadlines and time lines that we've provided last quarter, and our continued dialogue with our developers have us tracking online with that. The build transfer contracts are turnkey, which leaves the construction cost and timing risk really to be borne by the developer counterparties, some level of tariff impacts contemplated with the contracts. So given the circumstances that have happened over the last few months, we're in discussions with our developers to understand that impact to the project. And then any price increase associated with any of the projects would require approval from the IURC either through a CPCN or through a rate case process or a regulatory process. So we'll evaluate each of the projects and their circumstances and decide which path to go should there be increases that require that refresh with our regulators."

            "name": "Pablo Vegas",
            "content": "Thanks, Lloyd. And yes, thanks for the question. The -- we did anticipate the potential for more extended settlement set of discussions. This being a case that covers a pretty broad period of time, 14 years in total. A lot of things to work through and want to make sure that everyone has an opportunity to thoroughly understand our positions and that we can thoroughly understand all of theirs. So we do have levers that we can leverage through the back half of this year to try to mitigate some of the timing implications of the delay in the in those discussions. And so we're confident in the guidance range that we're reaffirming today. Yes. Travis, this is Pablo. We're still thinking that a case sometime before the end of this year makes sense because if you think about the projects that are already completed and the ones that we have in flight that we expect to go in service next year, the timing for case filed sometime before this end of this year, makes sense to start stepping in those investments into our rate structure. And the way that we have the flexibility in Indiana, Indiana structure with pace is one of the more flexible ones where we can time the kind of project investments completions with extensions out of the test year to try to capture and maximize the time lines that will eventually evolve from the projects that have been delayed.  And so we'll evaluate which can be incorporated into this next rate case in which would have to go into a subsequent. But with the ability to kind of flex the test year in Indiana and then the ability to flex in the step in of rates that align when projects go into construction to service. We still think that a rate case probably sometime before the end of this year makes the most sense. And then we would look to then pick up the balance of any of the projects that fall outside of those test years in a subsequent filing. But we would have the ability to again, timing of those rates going into effect. So that's the overall earnings profile that we'll be discussing would still be able to be achieved. Yes. Sure, Ryan. This is Pablo. Discussions have been, I think, very constructive. We've seen since in the last -- the case that we settled last year and in the settlement discussions this year, a reasonable tack taken by all the stakeholders. The focus on customer value remains at the front of those discussions, making sure that the economics of the case stay reasonable for all customer classes.  And Pennsylvania continues to be very supportive in our modernization program, wanting us to advance our pipeline replacement program and continue on that safety work. So all around, I'd say those conversations have gone constructively, and we look forward to continue to drive towards the settlement there."

            "name": "Lloyd Yates",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Hopefully, you've all had a chance to read our second quarter earnings release, which we issued earlier today. In the second quarter, the NiSource team's focus on safety and operational excellence continue to drive our plans for growth and sustainability while providing the reliable service our customers deserve. While the Commerce Department's pause on solar panel tariffs does not restore the original time lines for our renewable generation projects, it does give us more confidence and clarity on the revised project time lines. We expect our renewable investments, along with the flexibility of our mitigation plan to provide the path to meeting our commitment to deliver 7% to 9% compound annual growth and non-GAAP NOEPS from 2021 through 2024.  Let's turn now to Slide 3 and take a closer look at our key takeaways. We are reaffirming our 2022 guidance of $1.42 to $1.48 diluted non-GAAP NOEPS. We are reaffirming our forecast for 7% to 9% compound annual growth rate from 2021 through 2024, including near-term annual growth of 5% to 7% through 2023. Our renewable generation projects remain on track to meet the revised in-service dates we shared last quarter. Retirement dates for our remaining coal generation assets are unchanged since last quarter as well. We continue to make strong progress in our regulatory agenda with a settlement approved in NIPSCO gas rate case and settlement discussions underway in both Ohio and Pennsylvania.  And NiSource posted non-GAAP diluted net operating earnings per share or NOEPS of $0.12 in the second quarter versus $0.13 in the second quarter of last year. Before we move forward, I'd like to briefly cover 2 items. First, our strategic review continues and is progressing very well. This robust process involves our senior management team with a few Board members and explore potential internal and external opportunities to maximize risk-adjusted shareholder value. As we have indicated previously, all strategic scenarios are being benchmarked against a very competitive organic plan. We intend to share the results together with our full long-term growth plan beyond 2024 at Investor Day in November.  Second, we've added Melody Birmingham and Bill Jefferson to our executive leadership team. Both are well-respected and highly experienced. We have also elevated Chief Human Resource Officer, Melanie Berman, to the team. These changes will drive clearer lines of accountability across the organization and excellence in everything we do. I'm excited about our team and the contributions they will make as we move NiSource forward.  Now I'd like to update you on the progress we are making on our regulatory agenda. Let's turn to Slide 10 and the NiSource gas distribution highlights for the second quarter. We received an order from the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission on NIPSCO's gas rate case. It provides a revenue increase of $72 million annually with new rates effective September 2022 and March 2023. This balanced outcome demonstrates a positive path toward continuing investments in essential resources that will support safe operations, upgrading aging infrastructure and enhancing the customer experience.  Columbia Gas, Ohio has requested to reschedule hearings in its rate case until October to facilitate continued settlement discussions. The company has requested an increase of $221 million, net of capital expenditure program and infrastructure replacement program riders. Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania is also in settlement discussions. Its rate case request additional revenues of about $82.2 million, which are intended to further upgrade and replace gas lines for the long-term safety of customers and communities. It also seeks to provide additional energy efficiency options while balancing costs. We are also making progress with our rate case in Virginia. Columbia Gas of Virginia requested an increase in annual revenues of $40.6 million, net of the FA tracker to continue safety and modernization investments.  And finally, Columbia Gas of Maryland filed a rate case on May 13. It seeks to further upgrade and replace portions of the company's underground natural gas distribution pipelines. If approved, the proposed rate adjustments will go into effect at the end of 2022. Now for updates on our electric operations and renewables projects, I'd like to bring in Shawn Anderson. Shawn? We hear you. That's correct. We expect to mitigate that. So let me answer the second question first, and then we'll go. So we still believe there is serious demand for the LDCs. I think when you talk about -- when we think about our strategic review process, I mean, I always say it's a really robust process. We have -- as I mentioned, senior management and our Board involved -- and we're just weighing that against what we call a pretty robust stand-alone plans. When you look at our stand-alone plans and also inside of our stand-alone plans, we see O&M opportunities inside of NiSource to make it better. We're comparing that to what it would look like to monetize the LDCs to see how we can best finance the growth going forward.  So all those things are on the table, a robust stand-alone plan, but with us working real hard inside to enhance that. We've done some extensive benchmarking. We still see a demand for the LDCs due to some infrastructure funds out there, some big infrastructure funds out there. And we're just comparing those things and we'll come out with decisions in November. I'll let Pablo who's President of our Utilities weigh in. So we're still in the middle of it, but -- and I'll let Shawn talk but I'll start it off. We've done an extensive study what I'll say, other low-cost, top-performing gas and electric utilities, and we understand how we perform versus those. We've had a significant -- and then we go, we had a significant focus on improving our safety, our pipeline safety. But going forward, we see some opportunities for enhanced productivity, getting more done, getting more work done with the people we have and possibly displace and getting some of our people to do some of the capital work that we've had contractors to do because we become a lot more efficient on the O&M side.  So I think this drive for efficiencies is a significant opportunity for us. Also, when we think about our technology costs as compared to others, a modernization of our technology system. There's also a significant O&M opportunity for us. And when we look hard at our A&G costs as compared to others, we're a little bit high. So we're working through all those things. We see an opportunity to enhance our plan, and we're going to lay that out for you in the near future. Shawn, do you want to add to that? So that is also a part of the review. I mean, we have reviewed what it looks like for the whole company. If you look at the private equity market there with some of the large infrastructure funds. And we're trying to understand what that looks like as compared to our stand-alone plan. So that is also part of the review that we are doing. That is it. I mean I'm a firm believer, and I mean our job 1 is to run the business you have as best you can. And then you want to compare that to other opportunities, whether you sell an LDC or selling the whole company, your obligation when you walk in the door is to run the business every day as best you can, safer, better, faster and for lower costs. Look at our plan to do that and how it compares to these other opportunities and do the best you can for your shareholders.  So that's the fundamental base of running the business to me, and that will continue to always have that conviction. I feel very good about them. So I feel very good about it. Thank you. Thank you for your questions. And let me close by reiterating a few key takeaways. One, we are reaffirming our 2022 guidance of $1.42 to $1.48 diluted non-GAAP NOEPS, and we are reaffirming our forecast for 7% to 9% on compound annual growth rate from 2021 through 2024, including near-term annual growth of 5% to 7% through 2023.  Second, our renewable generation projects remain on track to meet the revised in-service dates that we shared with you last quarter. We continue to make strong progress in our regulatory agenda with a settlement approved in NIPSCO gas rate case and constructive settlement talks in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia.  And finally, we intend to present NiSource's long-term growth plan at an Investor Day in November. We look forward to seeing you all there. We appreciate you joining us this morning, and please stay safe. Thank you."

            "name": "Donald Brown",
            "content": "Thanks, Shawn, and good morning, everyone. As Lloyd mentioned, we've narrowed the timing of our planned Investor Day to November and we're making progress towards sharing a definitive long-term plan for NiSource beyond 2024. As you might imagine, the results of our strategic review, timing of planned solar projects and the RFP, Shawn just mentioned, are significant factors in our planning. I hope all of you will be able to join us as we discuss our path forward.  Turning to our second quarter 2022 results on Slide 4. We had non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $53.9 million or $0.12 per diluted share compared to non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $52.6 million or $0.13 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2021. We have reaffirmed our 2022 guidance of $1.42 to $1.48 and all of our long-term diluted non-GAAP net operating earnings per share growth rates.  Taking a closer look at our second quarter segment non-GAAP results on Slide 5, gas distribution operating earnings were about $81 million for Q2 of 2022, representing an increase of approximately $15 million versus the same quarter last year. Operating revenues, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were higher by approximately $36 million, mainly due to new rates resulting from base rate cases and regulatory capital programs. Operating expenses, again, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were higher by approximately $21 million due primarily to higher employee and depreciation expenses.  In our electric segment, non-GAAP operating earnings for the second quarter were about $73 million, which is about $11 million lower than in the same quarter last year. Second quarter operating revenues, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were higher by approximately $8 million in 2022. This is primarily due to the joint venture revenues offset in expense. This quarter also saw increased capital investment recoveries and customer growth. Operating expenses, once again, excluding the cost of energy and tracked expenses, were approximately $19 million higher than 2021 due primarily to increase joint venture depreciation and amortization as well as joint venture-related operating expenses, both of which are partially offset in revenues.  Now turning to Slide 6, I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of June 30, 2022, was about $10.1 billion, of which about $9.6 billion was long-term debt with a weighted average maturity of approximately 14 years and a weighted average interest rate of approximately 3.7%. At the end of the second quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of over $1.6 billion consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization programs. We continue our commitment to retaining our current investment-grade credit ratings.  Late last week, Moody's reaffirmed our ratings and outlook, which now has all 3 agencies reaffirming NiSource's ratings in 2022. Our debt and credit profile continued to represent a solid financial foundation to support our long-term safety and infrastructure investments.  As you can see on Slide 7 and 8, we are continuing the process of making some adjustments to our financial plan to reflect the expected delays in solar generation projects. These potential adjustments will help mitigate the earnings impact of project delays and enable us to maintain our 2024 EPS growth commitment. The long-term visibility of our capital plan and the flexibility in our regulatory mechanisms illustrate the resiliency and strength of our business to maintain all of our commitments, including EPS growth.  Taking a quick look at Slide 9, which highlights our financing plan. There's no change to the overall financing plan, and I'm excited to highlight that on June 10, we successfully executed our first green bond issuance, which was a 30-year bond at 5%. The proceeds for this note are intended to be used for the purchase of our Rosewater and Crossroads wind projects next year. I would also highlight that this balanced financing plan continues to be consistent with all of our earnings growth and credit commitments.  Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. We're ready now to take your questions. Great. I can hit that in terms of earnings. So as we outlined in our -- as we outlined in our Q1 call, what we are doing to mitigate the impact of the solar delays is pulling forward capital into this year and next year to offset some of the impacts of that balanced with some interest savings because of delay in that remaining $0.5 billion of capital and some O&M savings. So we feel like we've got a good plan that mitigates those delays while we continue to negotiate with our developers to understand the timing of these projects. Shawn, any other? Yes. Thanks for the question. So as we look at the act, and obviously, it's early, we need to do some more analysis of what it means long-term. But I'd say there's no near-term material impact to our plan to look at the plan and the earnings thresholds. We don't meet the earnings thresholds here in the near-term. And so we still have NOLs through the first half of the decade. Second half of the decade is when we expected the NOLs to expire, we've become a cash taxpayer. That's about also the time that we meet that income threshold. So nothing -- no change to how we were thinking about the business and the tax payment of the business.  Long-term, we do need to really understand this legislation, how it's going to play out. In terms of renewables, long-term, energy efficiency and what potential opportunities that might exist for us in the business. Insoo, great to hear from you. Certainly, we are seeing some weakness on our industrial sales. As you know, a portion of our customers, our industrial customers in Indiana electric revenues are down because of the steel industry being down a little bit. I'd say that is offset by usage up on both residential and commercial as well as customer growth. So we might be having some short-term weakness on the industrial, but overall, seeing growth on the electric side.  The other item that I just want to make sure everyone understood was a few years ago in the last electric rate case, we did change the tariff to really minimize the impact of electric code on our overall earnings. And so despite the industrials being down somewhat, our overall earnings are not down or not being driven down the cost of the industrials. Yes, absolutely. We build contingencies into our plan, recognizing that there's going to be changes -- potential changes in interest rates and financing costs as well as timing of -- an amount from rate cases. And so absolutely confident in our plan to meet this year's guidance as well as our long-term guidance. Yes. So customers are seeing the higher commodity prices in their bills already. We look at kind of year-over-year customer bills are up about 19%, 20% because gas prices really started to increase last summer. Once we look at our fuel adjustment clauses across our jurisdictions, we're typically adjusting -- we can't adjust quarterly, in some cases, and we're trying to balance out our payment of those commodities with adjusting those prices over a 12- or 18-month period. And so we've got some flexibility. But at the same time, we want to make sure that we're managing cash flow appropriately. So customers are seeing the impacts, and it's something that we're paying attention to. Long-term, I think the forecast still continues to show that natural gas prices will go back down to $4, $5 range. But obviously, we've got some higher prices and more volatility in the period."

After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Chris Turnure, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.\nChris Turnure: Good morning, and welcome to the NiSource First Quarter 2022 Investor Call. Joining me today are Lloyd Yates, our Chief Executive Officer; Donald Brown, our Chief Financial Officer; Shawn Anderson, our Chief Strategy and Risk Officer; Pablo Vegas, our Chief Operating Officer; and Randy Hulen, our VP of Investor Relations and Treasurer. The purpose of this presentation is to review NiSource's financial performance for the first quarter of 2022 as well as provide an update on our operations and growth drivers. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call to your questions. Slides for today's call are available on nisource.com.

With all of that out of the way, I would like to turn the call over to Lloyd.\nLloyd Yates: Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Hopefully, you have all had a chance to read our first quarter earnings release, which we issued earlier today. NiSource's first quarter showed continued strong execution on our plans for growth and sustainability while providing reliable service to our customers. The resiliency and flexibility of our business plan continues to support our commitment to deliver 7% to 9% compound annual growth in NOEPS, non-GAAP, from 2021 through 2024. First of all, I want to thank the employees and contractors of NiSource for their continued commitment to safely serving our customers. Now let's turn to Slide 3 and take a closer look at our key takeaways. While we are committed to completing our generation transition from coal by 2028, we expect delays in most of the solar and storage projects intended for completion in 2022 and 2023. These are due to the uncertainty hanging over the solar panel market as a result of the Commerce Department investigation. As a result of the projected delays, we now expect to retire the remaining two coal units at SchahferGeneratinon-GAAP Station by the end of 2025. Despite those delays, we are confident in reaffirming our 2022 guidance of $1.42 to $1.48 diluted non-GAAP EPS. And we are reaffirming our forecast for the 7% to 9% compound annual growth rate from 2021 through 2024, including near-term annual growth of 5% to 7% through 2023. We will exercise flexibility in our business plan by pulling forward modernization projects in our gas and electric business and employ O&M expense agility to support our plan. NiSource will host an Investor Day in the fall, where we expect to have more clarity on our business review and solar project completions. We intend to provide you with a definitive long-term plan beyond 2024. We continue to make strong progress in our regulatory agenda with a settlement in NIPSCO gas rate case and new cases filed in Pennsylvania and Virginia. And NiSource posted non-GAAP diluted net operating earnings per share or NOEPS of $0.75 in the first quarter versus $0.77 last year. We have a lot to discuss this morning - few months here at NiSource. I've had the opportunity to meet with employees, leaders, customers, regulators, policymakers and many others. I see some real strength and I also see opportunities for improvement. Here are some areas we will be focusing on: First and foremost, we will continue to focus on enhancing safely. This allows us to provide the best possible service to our customers. We are intent on maintaining our regulatory excellence. We have completed several rate cases in the past year. We have a number of cases pending. Together, they will provide additional visibility underpinning our rate case - rate base growth forecast. We will relentlessly pursue operational excellence across the businesses to ensure safety, reliability and enhanced customer experience and organizational productivity and efficiency. Our focus on these areas will help us build on the core strengths of our business, our investment-driven growth plan and the opportunities we see in the NiSource footprint. Now we want to update you on how the government's solar panel investigation is affecting our renewable generation plan. I would like to turn it over to Shawn Anderson. Shawn.\nShawn Anderson: Thank you, Lloyd, and good morning, everyone. As most of you are aware, the investigation by the U.S. Commerce Department related to the import of solar components from certain countries has brought uncertainty and delays to the solar panel market. We, along with others in the industry, continue to advocate for an expeditious resolution to this investigation. The uncertainty that this investigation has introduced underscores the need for continued development of the domestic clean energy supply chain, which NiSource is very much supportive of. The NiSource team has been in constant contact with our diverse renewable generation developers. We have worked hard to gain a better understanding the potential project delays might have on our plans and are generating portfolio. Our renewable generation plans include 10 solar projects, which are intended to replace the retiring capacity at Schahfer Generating Station, including two projects currently under construction. Indiana Crossroads Solar and Dunns Bridge I broke ground in fourth quarter 2021, we are shifting the anticipated in-service date from the end of 2022 to reflect a mid-2023 targeted date reflective of an anticipated delay associated with the department's investigation. These projects and most of our other solar projects at various stages of the development process are expected to be delayed by approximately six to 18 months from the originally targeted completion across 2022 and 2023. It is important to note that this is a broad time frame given the uncertainty. But ultimately, each project will be impacted differently. And we are working with our developer partners to refine our assessments on the expected impact. Given these delays, we now expect to retire Schahfer's remaining two coal units by the end of 2025. However, we continue to expect Michigan City Generating Station to retire on schedule, between 2026 and 2028. These retirements project NiSource to eliminate all coal-fired generation by 2028 and continue to track toward our targeted 90% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. It is important to underscore the potential unintended consequences for our customers. As we demonstrated in our 2018 and 2021 IRP, the renewable resources we are adding to the portfolio drive significant cost savings to our customers and help insulate them against high commodity and energy prices. Our focus has been to accelerate savings for our customers to benefit from the renewable transition. And delays resulting from this investigation may ultimately delay the timing of when our customers could begin receiving these benefits, especially in the current energy cost inflationary environment. As the investigation relates to our capital investment plan, we believe the primary impact is timing and continue to expect renewable investments to total approximately $2 billion primarily between 2022 and 2024, with any remainder expected in 2025. At the beginning of our discussion today, Lloyd mentioned the flexibility in NiSource's financial plan. And this is where the diversification of our operating companies can support our long-term commitments. We expect to adjust our modernization investments to account for the timing changes in renewable energy project investments, to remain on track to make capital investments totaling approximately $10 billion during the 2021 and 2024 period. These capital investments are expected to drive compound annual base rate growth of 10% to 12% for each of the company's businesses through 2024. Now I would like to turn the call over to Donald, who will discuss our Investor Day and financial performance in more detail.\nDonald Brown: Thanks, Shawn, and good morning, everyone. I would like to start with that we have moved the timing to hold an Investor Day event to this fall. We believe shifting the timing of our Investor Day will allow us to gain a clearer line of sight into the solar project timing and provide more details around the business review so that we can provide a definitive long-term plan beyond 2024. During this fall event, we intend to provide an extension to our capital investment and growth plan, a detailed update on our generation transition and ESG profile as well as give you an opportunity to hear from the leaders of our businesses. Now turning to our first quarter 2022 results on Slide 4. We had non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $329 million or $0.75 per diluted share compared to non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $305 million or $0.77 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2021. These first quarter 2022 results represent a solid start to the year. And as Lloyd mentioned a few minutes ago, we have reaffirmed our 2022 guidance of $1.42 to $1.48 and all of our long-term diluted non-GAAP net operating earnings per share growth rates. Taking a closer look at our segment non-GAAP results on Slide 5. Gas Distribution operating earnings were about $405 million for Q1 of 2022, representing an increase of approximately $31 million versus the same quarter last year. Operating revenues, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses, were higher by approximately $66 million mainly due to new rates resulting from base rate cases and regulatory capital programs. Operating expenses, again, net of cost of energy and track expenses were higher by approximately $35 million. In our electric segment, non-GAAP operating earnings for the first quarter were about $99 million, which was about $8 million higher than 2021. Operating revenues, net of the cost of energy and track expenses, increased by approximately $9 million due largely to revenue from regulated investments and other operating expenses were essentially flat to 2021 levels. Now turning to Slide 6. I would like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of March 31 was about $9.8 billion, of which $9.2 billion with long-term debt with a weighted average maturity of approximately 14 years and a weighted average interest rate of approximately 3.7%. At the end of the first quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.9 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization programs. We also continue our commitment to retaining our current investment-grade credit ratings. And I would note that Fitch has completed their 2022 annual credit review with no change to our rating or outlook. Our debt and credit profile continue to represent a solid financial foundation to support our long-term safety and infrastructure investments. As you can see on Slide 7 and 8, we are in the process of making some adjustments to our financial plan to reflect expected delays in solar generation projects that will help mitigate the earnings impact of these delays and enable us to maintain our 2024 EPS growth commitment. Both the long-term visibility of our capital plan and the flexibility in our regulatory mechanisms illustrates the resiliency and strength of our business and provides us confidence to maintain all of our commitments, including EPS growth. Taking a quick look at Slide 9, which highlights our financing plan. The only slight change to our financing plan is to extend the potential timing related to the debt financing of the renewable generation investments, which, as we indicated on Slide 8, provides incremental interest savings to mitigate the renewable project delays. Again, this balanced financing plan is consistent with all of our earnings growth and credit commitments. Now I will turn it over to Lloyd, who will discuss our utilities highlights.\nLloyd Yates: Thanks, Donald. Let's look at the NiSource gas distribution highlights for the first quarter, starting on Slide 10. Columbia Gas of Virginia filed a rate case on April 29 to continue with safety and modernization investments. The case seeks an increase in annual revenues of approximately $58 million. Columbia Gas of Ohio is preparing its response to the report from the staff of the Public Utilities Commission - discussion. Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania filed a rate case on March 18. It focuses on upgrading and replacing gas lines for the long-term safety of customers and communities. The case request additional revenues of about $82 million. It also seeks to provide additional energy efficiency options while balancing costs. NIPSCO has filed a proposed settlement in its gas rate case. The agreement will provide a revenue increase of approximately $72 million annually. In addition to infrastructure modernization, the proposal would enable NIPSCO to continue to serve customers with a safe, reliable supply of natural gas while remaining in compliance with state and federal safety requirements. NIPSCO also filed a petition on April 1, seeking approval of federally mandated pipeline safety costs, including nearly $229 million of capital cost and about $34 million of operating and maintenance programs. In addition, I would like to mention that NiSource has joined the Coalition for Renewable Natural Gas. We believe natural gas infrastructure will play an important role in America's energy future, potentially carrying renewable natural gas as well as other low carbon fuels such as hydrogen. As NiSource explores opportunities to further decarbonize its natural gas system, its local distribution companies are pursuing programs that will allow customers to reduce the carbon intensity of their natural gas usage due to renewable natural gas and carbon offsets. Regulatory filings seeking approval of these programs are underway in Pennsylvania and Virginia, similar to NIPSCO Green Power rate program that has been in place for several years. Let's turn now to our electric operations on Slide 11. Analysis continues on new generation investments resulting from the 2021 Integrated Resource Plan. NIPSCO filed a petition with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission seeking approval of NIPSCO's federally mandated cost for remediation of the coal combustion residual ash pond at Michigan City Generating Station. We will be removing coal combustion residuals and replacing them with clean fill. The federally mandated costs include a total estimate $40 million of retirement costs. Before we take your questions, I would like to highlight our safety progress. Safety continues to be the foundation of everything we do at NiSource. To give stakeholders a view of our strategy and achievements, we have published our inaugural annual sales report. Highlights include our risk management and continuous improvement activities, continued safety investments and technology integration to enhance safety. The report is available on the NiSource website, and I will encourage everyone to take a look. One very significant item in the report is the launch of the natural gas safety management system collaboratives, an effort among safety-focused energy companies. Its aim is to drive progress and maturity of safety management systems at member companies. NiSource will benefit from sharing information and learning from the experiences of others. I want to thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest and support of NiSource. We are now ready to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nicholas Campanella from Credit Suisse.\nNicholas Campanella: Lots of good detail in the deck. I guess just to kick it off, on the $1 billion of renewable investments in service by 2023, I know you talked about the six month to 13-month window. Can you just kind of give us a little bit more detail on what's giving you confidence in being able to get these projects done in the 2023 window? I guess just the risk would be that the $1 billion will slip to $24 billion. And are these 2023 projects just on that six month side of the window - of the six to 13-month window or just - what can you kind of tell us there?\nLloyd Yates: [indiscernible] that, Shawn.\nShawn Anderson: Thanks, Lloyd. Appreciate that. Nick, I appreciate the question. So first off, I think you said six to 13. I just want to make sure it is clear. We have - are projecting a 6- to 18-month delay at this time for all projects. It will vary by project. And to your point, the reasons that we might see a different duration of delay for the projects that are currently under construction are because we began the construction process for those projects in 2021. And they're simply further along in the process to have a better understanding of the timing to complete despite the disruption that we have witnessed more recently. So for these projects, we are comfortable advancing them to completion given the compelling economics. And they provide great line of sight to what it would take to complete at this point. The team is very active in that process. For the 2023 projects or the other projects, we simply haven't started the construction process yet, which gives us the ability to assess the impacts of the tariffs and the timing associated with the investigation to better inform what the time lines might be. And to your other point, with the $1 billion, we have got approximately $400 million of that already constructed and operational. Those are operating assets today. Likewise, we see low risk in the transmission-related projects, which is another $150 million of high confidence projects.  So the projects that are limited in scope here to the DOC investigated risks are just those two projects that amount for the balance of the $1 billion, so that $440 million on the two projects currently under construction. I would also note as well, we do have wind projects that wouldn't be subject to the same DOC-related risk. Some operational, of course, also included without a delay in 2023.\nNicholas Campanella: So it is really just - to clarify, it is really just the $400 million to $500 million that is in this 6- to 18-month delay window in terms of 2023 capital?\nShawn Anderson: No. It is $440 million associated with the two existing projects that are going to continue construction during the conclusion of this investigation. The delays could also apply to the balance of projects, meaning most of our projects could experience a delay of six to 18 months. We would need clarity from the investigation to better inform the duration of delay associated with all of the other projects.\nNicholas Campanella: Okay. That is helpful. I appreciate that. And then I guess just a question for Lloyd on strategy. You have been in the seat for a few months now. Last call, you kind of talked about being open to buying and selling assets. Just how has your kind of thinking evolved at all here? If you could just update us, please?\nLloyd Yates: So we are still in the midst of our strategic business review. We have a group of senior executives in the company and Board members. And we are walking down a specific process to do those evaluations. We haven't outlined in terms - in a time line we are operating on. And I expect to reveal that information in the fall when we do our Investor Day.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners.\nShar Pourreza: Lloyd, let me just fine-tune the prior question. Just as far as strategy and the Analyst Day, curious since it was pushed off from, obviously, the [indiscernible] this month until the fall. Are you going to be in a position to actually announce some strategic moves of the utilities, meaning transactions with defined closing dates or would you just sort of highlight which utilities could be under a strategic review and that you'll continue to update us as time goes on? So maybe taking the playbook from one of your Texas peers.\nLloyd Yates: I've not - up along in the process to determine that right now, Shar, of specifically what I'm going to announce. I think that - I think the question you are getting at, will we have answers in the fall? And the answer to that will be yes. I'm not going to foreshadow announcing any kind of transactions or anything on this phone call. Now what I want to foreshadow is we will have answers in the fall. And we expect definitive announcements in terms of where we are taking the business.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. That is helpful. And then just one more on the prior question is just on sort of the DOC investigations. I mean hopefully, we will get a proposed decision in August. But then there is going to be a 150-day common period. So I mean you can actually have some pricing uncertainty that will carry beyond sort of what you guys are thinking. So what's the level of confidence that when you guys have the Analyst Day, are you going to have enough information to be able to provide a longer-term CapEx number? And we don't see incremental projects kind of being shifted out?\nLloyd Yates: I will start it, and I will turn it over to Shawn. I think by the time we get to Investor Day, we are running different scenarios and alternatives in our integrated resource plan. And those scenarios and alternatives do include further delay on this commerce investigation. Now we have, I will say, a diverse set of utilities with significant modernization projects and other capital opportunities that we believe we can pull forward and continue to execute our plan until this investigation is done. But Shawn, do you want to weigh on anything else there?\nShawn Anderson: Thanks, Lloyed. Appreciate it. Shar, thanks for the question. I think that at a minimum, I would expect we would have a range or an idea of where the projects could potentially grow, if you will. Although I would say that anything that DOC can do to help refine and narrow the scope would be helpful for us to understand how it could possibly apply to our specific projects. What seems to be unique about this investigation is that it can be very component specific and how it is applied and thus how it impacts your specific supply chain. So it is hard to look at a headline, so to speak, and then apply it directly to your situation. You really have to look at things on a project-by-project basis, how it is financed - you are in the queue on some of these projects, like Dunns 1 and Indiana Crossroads, So I think our focus for the next few months is going to be understanding from our developer partners the range of outcomes that could grow and also look to the Department of Commerce to hopefully refine the scope of the investigation to help us better inform the very answer to your question.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. Got it. And then just real quick, lastly for me is Slide 8, you guys show sort of the impacts of the delayed renewable investment and how you are able to pull forward, track CapEx and sort of other investments in 2022 and 2023 to help offset the impact in 2024, right? But you also do kind of highlight that sort of that annual CapEx timing and amounts can shift. So if we are sort of thinking about your 7% to 9% CAGR, are you now kind of more back-end loaded? So we should be modeling maybe bottom end in the near term? I guess how do we think about the shaping in light of the CapEx shuffling? The delays seem a little bit more impactful versus what you can track forward.\nLloyd Yates: No, I wouldn't do any shaping of that. You think about our capital programs and the tracker mechanisms we have got in place. It really does allow us to get earnings and cash flows on average about 12 months after we make those investments. We will start that in 2022 and go into 2023. And so it really does support our annual guidance as well as our long-term CAGR.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Sunderland from JPMorgan.\nRichard Sunderland: Maybe turning to the Schahfer update. Do you need any approvals, whether MISO or Indiana, on the extension there? Are there any EPA implications with the change in the retirement?\nLloyd Yates: I will turn it to Shawn for specifics. But we do not need any specific EPA approvals to move that retirement day on Schahfer.\nShawn Anderson: Yes. That is right, Lloyd. And we have begun discussions with key stakeholders, including MISO, the IURC and - as well as our team there to understand the ramifications with that.\nRichard Sunderland: Understood. And then you have talked about timing around the renewables CapEx. But just curious on the cost side if you are seeing any potential ramifications here. I know you reiterated the $2 billion, but just thinking about the risk maybe as you move further out. Any considerations or thoughts there?\nLloyd Yates: I think, yes. The answer is that we do - I mean - especially around labor costs on some of these projects. I mean just like the rest of the world, I mean everybody is seeing inflation everywhere. So just like the labor cost on these projects are going up. I mean still price or our commodity, natural gas, and the overall price of energy. So I think when you think about investing, and we are continuing to invest in renewable projects, I think you have to look at it holistically and understand how that compares with the price increases on other forms of energy and decide which ones you want to continue to invest in to provide reliable service to customers.\nDonald Brown: I would say as a follow-up. It is too early as we are in the process. We are working with our developers for us to update any estimates on the individual projects. As we get more clarity and negotiate and work with those developers, we will update the amounts as appropriate - appropriate.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Travis Miller from Morningstar.\nTravis Miller: Just wanted to be crystal clear here. These are anticipated or potential delays on those projects, right? Or have you actually heard from suppliers that they won't be able to deliver on those projects? Just want to be sure I understand that.\nLloyd Yates: That is the question are you asking - these are about projects that we have started that Shawn mentioned, that started in 2021 or the projects that have not started at all? [indiscernible] that question.\nTravis Miller: Yes, the ones that haven't. That is the $440 million that you are referring to, right?\nLloyd Yates: That is correct.\nShawn Anderson: Yes. The projects that have not begun the construction process, to your point, are projected delays of six to 18 months. And that is the updated in-service date that we are estimating on the slide in the supplemental materials. The projects currently under construction is our best line of sight to what it would take to conclude construction and have those become COD. So those would be a little bit more definitive in the terms of how the delay would impact an in-service date in contrast to the ones that haven't begun the construction process and are still just estimated.\nTravis Miller: Okay. So something were to resolve quickly around just any of this uncertainty, it is possible that you'd still be on track for the CapEx budget that you have laid out before.\nShawn Anderson: Yes.\nTravis Miller: Okay. Great. I just want to clarify that. And second, just thinking about where gas prices have gone and your cadence of rate increases and rate filings. Any thoughts on how customer bill might impact - I know you have got the two rate cases going here. But any future - either later this year or next year [indiscernible].\nLloyd Yates: Thanks for asking that question. And we are always thinking about customer rate impact customer bill. I think part of this is we try and put CapEx in the system to drive value for customers. We are also trying to drive productivity and efficiency to offset some of those customer increases. But I mean, in answer to your question, we are thinking about customer bill impact and continuously having a conversation with the regulators about what that means.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Lee from Goldman Sachs.\nInsoo Kim: Can you guys hear me okay?\nLloyd Yates: Yes, Brian.\nInsoo Kim: Apologies. This is Insoo. I don't know why my colleagues -- on the call, but it is Insoo here. My first question is on your commentary on how the solar installs in the shape for retirement fit at one on the original time line would have helped meaningfully lower customer bills. Now that it is delayed and with the plan that you have laid out in place to replace some of that CapEx with other items as well as O&M., just how confident are you that the customer bill impact from this revised plan won't face potential regulatory hurdles? I know part of that is supported by tracker-related CapEx. But just wanted to see your confidence - color and confidence that the 2024 earnings power should remain unchanged?\nLloyd Yates: Pablo, why don't you take that?\nPablo Vegas: Yes. Insoo, great question. And I would say that - I would point to the kind of the diverse portfolio across the companies that we are going to be leveraging. So it wouldn't necessarily fall fully in the Indiana jurisdiction, where we would be making investments to help pull forward some of those capital opportunities. So we would be spreading that to the extent that we can across our companies where we have those investment needs and we have got the capacity to do that. So that would help to moderate the impact on any one customer group. And then of course, we will continue to look for opportunities to refine efficiencies and productivity savings across all the jurisdictions to help offset that as well.\nInsoo Kim: Okay. Got it. That is helpful. My second question, just looking at the quarterly results, unless I missed something, it seems like on the gas O&M side, there was a meaningful - a decent amount of increase there. And I think you have laid out on the supplemental forms the labor materials inflation. I don't know if that was more directed towards gasoline, and I didn't see it really on electric. But is there anything on the gas side that was having more of an inflationary impact? And just related to that, how - just commentary on how you think you'll be able to manage that and be at the - at least the middle of that 22% guidance range for the year?\nLloyd Yates: Yes. So I will start that and Pablo or Donald can weigh in. When we look at our gas business, especially this winter, we had a very challenging winter. And when you do gas work, you are doing a lot of digging in the ground and you are dealing with weather incidents. Your productivity levels are typically not where you need them to be. The ground is harder, a lot harder to get to some of our lakes. Over time, as the weather clears up, we expect to get those productivity gains back. So I think it is more of a weather issue that we can turn around here in the near term. Pablo?\nPablo Vegas: Yes. I agree with that. It is been kind of - it is been extremely wet start to the season, which delays some of our construction work, which then puts folks working on other types of compliance and operations work that shifts that capital on that mix a bit. So we saw that shift happen in the first quarter. expect to see that shift back and have the ability with the work out there to make up that difference as we look at the balance of 2022.\nShawn Anderson: And then a follow-up on inflation. We are seeing higher inflation in materials and fleet and some outside services. We are seeing ranges of 6% to 10% this year. We are actively managing that and looking to lock in some multiyear contracts so that we can limit those increases, at least have predictability around those increases. However, I will go back to all of this is included in our guidance for this year and our long-term plan. So we are comfortable with our guidance. We are uncomfortable with the expenses we are seeing. But we are also actively managing going back to thinking about long-term customer affordability of our programs.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: So maybe just to kick things off a little bit here. Going back to that last question on the 6% to 10% cost inflation. What metric were you quoting there on that 6% to 10%? But more germane, if I can, the real question I wanted to throw on there was, can you touch on your cost reduction measures specifically in NiSource? What are the costs that are being pulled out against the backdrop of that inflationary environment? And maybe to be more specific, are these sustainable cost-cutting measures on the $0.03 to $0.04? Or are they more onetime-ish in nature? And what is - what kind of latitude are you seeing given this inflationary environment to potentially lean in and find more than $0.03 to $0.04 of opportunity here as we look at the business to more than offset some of these impacts.\nLloyd Yates: Yes. So you have got a couple of parts to your question. So the first question was around inflation, what we are seeing. So we are tracking each, I would say, category of spend across the business, electric and gas, looking at year-over-year impacts, looking at contracts and - to really understand what we are seeing and how to best manage those. So that is where we are seeing kind of the six to 10 across certain categories. In some places, it is flat because we have got multiyear contracts already in place but certainly seeing some inflation there. Other question, I think, you were referring to the $0.04 to $0.05 in 2024. We have got line of sight to that. And we think about both from a, I would say, NiSource Next, to your point. Those would be costs that would go out over time and to get back to - and Pablo's point around productivity. NiSource Next really is designed to increase productivity across our business, especially in the field. And so that is the long-term savings. But certainly, we have got levers on a year-over-year basis to ensure that we are hitting our targets. So it is really all of the above.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Just to clarify that, $0.03 to $0.04 from the slides here on the O&M, and that is an ongoing savings opportunity. But we still got to wait for what you guys have to say in the fall here for more?\nDonald Brown: That is right. Yes. That is right.\nLloyd Yates: So part of this is we are developing, I will say, an O&M agility methodology. As we build our O&M budgets every year, we will have a plus or minus 2% agility in there that we can flex. And then the other part, as Donald talked about, with NiSource Next and gaining productivity is more structural, focused on continuously building more productivity and efficiency into the business as we go along. And we will have more detail and follow on that on both of those.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. All right. Excellent. And then just super quick, if I can, on Ohio. I know that that is in flight here. But can you discuss a little bit more specifically the delta between your ask and SaaS rec? Obviously, there is some obvious ones. But as a percent of ASC as well, can you reconcile that a little bit more - even more critically? Not looking to front run of the rebuttal here, but what is the opportunity to potentially address some of these discrepancies here more formally?\nPablo Vegas: Julien, this is Pablo. So I will say, first off, we have had and expect to continue to have constructive regulatory outcomes in Ohio over the last many years between our capital expenditure program and our IRP programs. And so we are working constructively on this issue as well. So certainly, the staff report and the delta between our application and their recommendation is meaningful. We are taking the opportunity since we have seen that report to help clarify some of the elements inside of ours. And so some of the specific elements are certainly O&M assumptions. There are some plant in-service assumptions that are - drive some differences. And there are some liabilities and items along those lines on environmental and such that we are working on. So we are working to clarify where we think some of the differences have been. We think that will, in our response to their staff reporting our rebuttal, which we are going to file this week still. We will have an opportunity to do that. And then we are going to file supplemental testimony by Friday of next week. And during that time, we are going to also work to initiate settlement discussions. So we still fully expect that a settlement as possible. We will be working towards that. We think that there is a reasonable settlement out there that is going to benefit all of the stakeholders in this. And we are going to be tracking towards that, Julien.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research.\nSteven Fleishman: Thanks for the details that you provided this morning on the solar issue and offsets and such. So one question following up on the cost, if there are cost increases for the projects, can you give more clarity of how the relationship is between your developer partners and yourself in terms of who's kind of on the hook for cost increases? Is it - yes.\nShawn Anderson: Yes. Steve, this is Shawn. So the cost of the project itself on the build transfer agreement is fully contracted for at a known price. The cost increases themselves are on the side of the developer to construct those projects. To the extent that tariffs are applied, we'd have to evaluate what the application of those tariffs are to understand that cost pressure and risk and where that lives.\nSteven Fleishman: Okay. So it is not clear where the tariffs - if it is tariff-related, who's kind of got to deal with that issue?\nShawn Anderson: That is correct. Okay.\nSteven Fleishman: And is it - are the contracts consistent? Or do they vary on that topic?\nShawn Anderson: Each contract is unique, Steve. But certainly, there are some components that are consistent. That particular element has - the entire construct itself and how it is financed can vary and would come into consideration. So I would describe it as each project - each contract is unique. But the application of that itself, we'd have to evaluate as the project steps closer.\nSteven Fleishman: Okay. And I know you just announced this today, but the idea that you - an investigation is causing delays in solar projects, forcing you to extend the life of a coal plant. It seems like kind of a meaningful policy issue for the same administration that is actually doing this investigation? I know it seems like it is been so far a very technical process. But just what kind of - there is obviously a political aspect to this. I'm just curious kind of if you are getting any sense whether that is resonating at all or not.\nShawn Anderson: Yes. Steve, I mean I would highlight, as I did in my comments that we are disappointed that a disruption in the solar chain is going to constitute potential delays for customers to realize benefits and some cost certainty related to fuel price volatility. That is the premise by which these projects really were born. And it is disappointing that, that might occur. That said, we are optimistic the Department of Commerce can work expeditiously to provide some refinements in its investigation that can enable these projects to move through as quickly as possible. At the core of what we do, it is about reliability for our customers and the communities we serve. And that is a critical component that we are focused on, which is part of what Schahfer can deliver and has delivered for many years, which is part of the decision that we have laid out here today. But we are optimistic that even with recent refinements the DOC has provided, it can give us enough information to get clarity through the conversations with our developers to advance our specific projects as expeditiously as practical to get to, I think, what you alluded to, which is really a lower cost energy solution with more price certainty for customers.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Levine from Citigroup.\nRyan Levine: If there are any cost overruns for solar that NiSource is responsible for, can you speak to the recovery mechanisms for these cost overruns? And if the delays trigger any legal rights for the company with these counterparties on these projects? And then somewhat related, given the announced delay expectations, how are you looking at these delays impacting financing plans as it relates to the ATM and other sources of funds? I think you had a footnote in your side on that front.\nShawn Anderson: I think the first part of your question, I think it is too early to speculate on if the tariffs would be applied, how it would be, what the circumstances would be. By nature, the CPCNs give us the regulatory approval to move forward with these projects. We'd address that a cost variance from the projects that would be different than the existing CPCNs through the regulatory process with the IURC. So I think the question on that front end is addressed through the regulatory process itself with the IURC against the existing CPCNs to move forward.\nRyan Levine: But let me ask a clarifying question. When you talk about cost overruns, you mean the cost is - general cost overruns on the project or cost overruns just with respect to the tariffs? Which question are you asking?\nRyan Levine: We are the first, but it is both - play.\nLloyd Yates: So I think when you talk about general cost overruns, I think those are covered in the contract with the developer. With respect to the tariffs, I don't think - those were contemplated in the contracts. Therefore, we have to work with the developer and/or the regulator to decide who bears that risk.\nDonald Brown: P And with regards to the financing plan, certainly, we expect that if there is delays it is going to impact - it is going to delay the - any debt financing that we do on the projects. That is where we expect we'd see some savings from deferring some of that debt issuance. As regards to - with regard to ATM, no changes to our financing plan now. You see the ranges that we have got outlined here. Certainly, no ATM in 2023 is possible. And that is certainly taking into account the - both our overall business as well as those renewable projects.\nRyan Levine: And then one unrelated question for Lloyd with the business review process. Are there certain areas of the review that has been decided to evaluate more comprehensively? And is that part of the reason for the delay in timing of the Analyst Day? Any color you could share that would be appreciated.\nLloyd Yates: Allow me to be clear, I was never - the delay in the Investor Day is primarily focused on the delay in the solar project. I was never - I didn't believe I would be finished to review by May or spring Investor Day. I think the level of review that we are taking, looking hard at just each of the utilities, how they contribute to the overall business, where our corporate services are, what productivity looks like in the organization, how we benchmark, all of that is ongoing. And it just so happens, I believe, in that targeted making sure that we are finished in the fall in conjunction with these projects so that we can give what I will call a comprehensive review of strategy of NiSource in terms of how we will grow after 2024.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Lloyd Yates, our CEO, I will turn the call back over to you for some closing remarks.\nLloyd Yates: So first of all, thank you for your questions. I would like to close by reiterating a few key takeaways. One, NiSource expects the Commerce Department solar panel investigation to delay solar projects. We are developing and implementing a mitigation plan to maintain our 2024 growth commitments. We are reaffirming our 2022 guidance of $1.42 to $1.48 diluted non-GAAP in EPS. We are reaffirming our forecast for 7% to 9% compound annual growth rate from 2021 through 2024, including near-term annual growth of 5% to 7% through 2023. We continue to make strong progress in our regulatory agenda with a settlement in NIPSCO gas rate case and new cases filed in Pennsylvania and Virginia. And NiSource will host the Investor Day in the fall. We intend to provide you with a definitive long-term plan beyond 2024. Thank you. We appreciate you joining us this morning.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Lloyd, and good morning, everyone. As most of you are aware, the investigation by the U.S. Commerce Department related to the import of solar components from certain countries has brought uncertainty and delays to the solar panel market. We, along with others in the industry, continue to advocate for an expeditious resolution to this investigation. The uncertainty that this investigation has introduced underscores the need for continued development of the domestic clean energy supply chain, which NiSource is very much supportive of. The NiSource team has been in constant contact with our diverse renewable generation developers. We have worked hard to gain a better understanding the potential project delays might have on our plans and are generating portfolio. Our renewable generation plans include 10 solar projects, which are intended to replace the retiring capacity at Schahfer Generating Station, including two projects currently under construction. Indiana Crossroads Solar and Dunns Bridge I broke ground in fourth quarter 2021, we are shifting the anticipated in-service date from the end of 2022 to reflect a mid-2023 targeted date reflective of an anticipated delay associated with the department's investigation. These projects and most of our other solar projects at various stages of the development process are expected to be delayed by approximately six to 18 months from the originally targeted completion across 2022 and 2023. It is important to note that this is a broad time frame given the uncertainty. But ultimately, each project will be impacted differently. And we are working with our developer partners to refine our assessments on the expected impact. Given these delays, we now expect to retire Schahfer's remaining two coal units by the end of 2025. However, we continue to expect Michigan City Generating Station to retire on schedule, between 2026 and 2028. These retirements project NiSource to eliminate all coal-fired generation by 2028 and continue to track toward our targeted 90% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. It is important to underscore the potential unintended consequences for our customers. As we demonstrated in our 2018 and 2021 IRP, the renewable resources we are adding to the portfolio drive significant cost savings to our customers and help insulate them against high commodity and energy prices. Our focus has been to accelerate savings for our customers to benefit from the renewable transition. And delays resulting from this investigation may ultimately delay the timing of when our customers could begin receiving these benefits, especially in the current energy cost inflationary environment. As the investigation relates to our capital investment plan, we believe the primary impact is timing and continue to expect renewable investments to total approximately $2 billion primarily between 2022 and 2024, with any remainder expected in 2025. At the beginning of our discussion today, Lloyd mentioned the flexibility in NiSource's financial plan. And this is where the diversification of our operating companies can support our long-term commitments. We expect to adjust our modernization investments to account for the timing changes in renewable energy project investments, to remain on track to make capital investments totaling approximately $10 billion during the 2021 and 2024 period. These capital investments are expected to drive compound annual base rate growth of 10% to 12% for each of the company's businesses through 2024. Now I would like to turn the call over to Donald, who will discuss our Investor Day and financial performance in more detail. Thanks, Lloyd. Appreciate that. Nick, I appreciate the question. So first off, I think you said six to 13. I just want to make sure it is clear. We have - are projecting a 6- to 18-month delay at this time for all projects. It will vary by project. And to your point, the reasons that we might see a different duration of delay for the projects that are currently under construction are because we began the construction process for those projects in 2021. And they're simply further along in the process to have a better understanding of the timing to complete despite the disruption that we have witnessed more recently. So for these projects, we are comfortable advancing them to completion given the compelling economics. And they provide great line of sight to what it would take to complete at this point. The team is very active in that process. For the 2023 projects or the other projects, we simply haven't started the construction process yet, which gives us the ability to assess the impacts of the tariffs and the timing associated with the investigation to better inform what the time lines might be. And to your other point, with the $1 billion, we have got approximately $400 million of that already constructed and operational. Those are operating assets today. Likewise, we see low risk in the transmission-related projects, which is another $150 million of high confidence projects.  So the projects that are limited in scope here to the DOC investigated risks are just those two projects that amount for the balance of the $1 billion, so that $440 million on the two projects currently under construction. I would also note as well, we do have wind projects that wouldn't be subject to the same DOC-related risk. Some operational, of course, also included without a delay in 2023. No. It is $440 million associated with the two existing projects that are going to continue construction during the conclusion of this investigation. The delays could also apply to the balance of projects, meaning most of our projects could experience a delay of six to 18 months. We would need clarity from the investigation to better inform the duration of delay associated with all of the other projects. Thanks, Lloyed. Appreciate it. Shar, thanks for the question. I think that at a minimum, I would expect we would have a range or an idea of where the projects could potentially grow, if you will. Although I would say that anything that DOC can do to help refine and narrow the scope would be helpful for us to understand how it could possibly apply to our specific projects. What seems to be unique about this investigation is that it can be very component specific and how it is applied and thus how it impacts your specific supply chain. So it is hard to look at a headline, so to speak, and then apply it directly to your situation. You really have to look at things on a project-by-project basis, how it is financed - you are in the queue on some of these projects, like Dunns 1 and Indiana Crossroads, So I think our focus for the next few months is going to be understanding from our developer partners the range of outcomes that could grow and also look to the Department of Commerce to hopefully refine the scope of the investigation to help us better inform the very answer to your question. Yes. That is right, Lloyd. And we have begun discussions with key stakeholders, including MISO, the IURC and - as well as our team there to understand the ramifications with that. Yes. The projects that have not begun the construction process, to your point, are projected delays of six to 18 months. And that is the updated in-service date that we are estimating on the slide in the supplemental materials. The projects currently under construction is our best line of sight to what it would take to conclude construction and have those become COD. So those would be a little bit more definitive in the terms of how the delay would impact an in-service date in contrast to the ones that haven't begun the construction process and are still just estimated. Yes. And then a follow-up on inflation. We are seeing higher inflation in materials and fleet and some outside services. We are seeing ranges of 6% to 10% this year. We are actively managing that and looking to lock in some multiyear contracts so that we can limit those increases, at least have predictability around those increases. However, I will go back to all of this is included in our guidance for this year and our long-term plan. So we are comfortable with our guidance. We are uncomfortable with the expenses we are seeing. But we are also actively managing going back to thinking about long-term customer affordability of our programs. Yes. Steve, this is Shawn. So the cost of the project itself on the build transfer agreement is fully contracted for at a known price. The cost increases themselves are on the side of the developer to construct those projects. To the extent that tariffs are applied, we'd have to evaluate what the application of those tariffs are to understand that cost pressure and risk and where that lives. That is correct. Okay. Each contract is unique, Steve. But certainly, there are some components that are consistent. That particular element has - the entire construct itself and how it is financed can vary and would come into consideration. So I would describe it as each project - each contract is unique. But the application of that itself, we'd have to evaluate as the project steps closer. Yes. Steve, I mean I would highlight, as I did in my comments that we are disappointed that a disruption in the solar chain is going to constitute potential delays for customers to realize benefits and some cost certainty related to fuel price volatility. That is the premise by which these projects really were born. And it is disappointing that, that might occur. That said, we are optimistic the Department of Commerce can work expeditiously to provide some refinements in its investigation that can enable these projects to move through as quickly as possible. At the core of what we do, it is about reliability for our customers and the communities we serve. And that is a critical component that we are focused on, which is part of what Schahfer can deliver and has delivered for many years, which is part of the decision that we have laid out here today. But we are optimistic that even with recent refinements the DOC has provided, it can give us enough information to get clarity through the conversations with our developers to advance our specific projects as expeditiously as practical to get to, I think, what you alluded to, which is really a lower cost energy solution with more price certainty for customers. I think the first part of your question, I think it is too early to speculate on if the tariffs would be applied, how it would be, what the circumstances would be. By nature, the CPCNs give us the regulatory approval to move forward with these projects. We'd address that a cost variance from the projects that would be different than the existing CPCNs through the regulatory process with the IURC. So I think the question on that front end is addressed through the regulatory process itself with the IURC against the existing CPCNs to move forward."

            "name": "Pablo Vegas",
            "content": "Yes. Insoo, great question. And I would say that - I would point to the kind of the diverse portfolio across the companies that we are going to be leveraging. So it wouldn't necessarily fall fully in the Indiana jurisdiction, where we would be making investments to help pull forward some of those capital opportunities. So we would be spreading that to the extent that we can across our companies where we have those investment needs and we have got the capacity to do that. So that would help to moderate the impact on any one customer group. And then of course, we will continue to look for opportunities to refine efficiencies and productivity savings across all the jurisdictions to help offset that as well. Yes. I agree with that. It is been kind of - it is been extremely wet start to the season, which delays some of our construction work, which then puts folks working on other types of compliance and operations work that shifts that capital on that mix a bit. So we saw that shift happen in the first quarter. expect to see that shift back and have the ability with the work out there to make up that difference as we look at the balance of 2022. Julien, this is Pablo. So I will say, first off, we have had and expect to continue to have constructive regulatory outcomes in Ohio over the last many years between our capital expenditure program and our IRP programs. And so we are working constructively on this issue as well. So certainly, the staff report and the delta between our application and their recommendation is meaningful. We are taking the opportunity since we have seen that report to help clarify some of the elements inside of ours. And so some of the specific elements are certainly O&M assumptions. There are some plant in-service assumptions that are - drive some differences. And there are some liabilities and items along those lines on environmental and such that we are working on. So we are working to clarify where we think some of the differences have been. We think that will, in our response to their staff reporting our rebuttal, which we are going to file this week still. We will have an opportunity to do that. And then we are going to file supplemental testimony by Friday of next week. And during that time, we are going to also work to initiate settlement discussions. So we still fully expect that a settlement as possible. We will be working towards that. We think that there is a reasonable settlement out there that is going to benefit all of the stakeholders in this. And we are going to be tracking towards that, Julien."

            "name": "Lloyd Yates",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Hopefully, you have all had a chance to read our first quarter earnings release, which we issued earlier today. NiSource's first quarter showed continued strong execution on our plans for growth and sustainability while providing reliable service to our customers. The resiliency and flexibility of our business plan continues to support our commitment to deliver 7% to 9% compound annual growth in NOEPS, non-GAAP, from 2021 through 2024. First of all, I want to thank the employees and contractors of NiSource for their continued commitment to safely serving our customers. Now let's turn to Slide 3 and take a closer look at our key takeaways. While we are committed to completing our generation transition from coal by 2028, we expect delays in most of the solar and storage projects intended for completion in 2022 and 2023. These are due to the uncertainty hanging over the solar panel market as a result of the Commerce Department investigation. As a result of the projected delays, we now expect to retire the remaining two coal units at SchahferGeneratinon-GAAP Station by the end of 2025. Despite those delays, we are confident in reaffirming our 2022 guidance of $1.42 to $1.48 diluted non-GAAP EPS. And we are reaffirming our forecast for the 7% to 9% compound annual growth rate from 2021 through 2024, including near-term annual growth of 5% to 7% through 2023. We will exercise flexibility in our business plan by pulling forward modernization projects in our gas and electric business and employ O&M expense agility to support our plan. NiSource will host an Investor Day in the fall, where we expect to have more clarity on our business review and solar project completions. We intend to provide you with a definitive long-term plan beyond 2024. We continue to make strong progress in our regulatory agenda with a settlement in NIPSCO gas rate case and new cases filed in Pennsylvania and Virginia. And NiSource posted non-GAAP diluted net operating earnings per share or NOEPS of $0.75 in the first quarter versus $0.77 last year. We have a lot to discuss this morning - few months here at NiSource. I've had the opportunity to meet with employees, leaders, customers, regulators, policymakers and many others. I see some real strength and I also see opportunities for improvement. Here are some areas we will be focusing on: First and foremost, we will continue to focus on enhancing safely. This allows us to provide the best possible service to our customers. We are intent on maintaining our regulatory excellence. We have completed several rate cases in the past year. We have a number of cases pending. Together, they will provide additional visibility underpinning our rate case - rate base growth forecast. We will relentlessly pursue operational excellence across the businesses to ensure safety, reliability and enhanced customer experience and organizational productivity and efficiency. Our focus on these areas will help us build on the core strengths of our business, our investment-driven growth plan and the opportunities we see in the NiSource footprint. Now we want to update you on how the government's solar panel investigation is affecting our renewable generation plan. I would like to turn it over to Shawn Anderson. Shawn. Thanks, Donald. Let's look at the NiSource gas distribution highlights for the first quarter, starting on Slide 10. Columbia Gas of Virginia filed a rate case on April 29 to continue with safety and modernization investments. The case seeks an increase in annual revenues of approximately $58 million. Columbia Gas of Ohio is preparing its response to the report from the staff of the Public Utilities Commission - discussion. Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania filed a rate case on March 18. It focuses on upgrading and replacing gas lines for the long-term safety of customers and communities. The case request additional revenues of about $82 million. It also seeks to provide additional energy efficiency options while balancing costs. NIPSCO has filed a proposed settlement in its gas rate case. The agreement will provide a revenue increase of approximately $72 million annually. In addition to infrastructure modernization, the proposal would enable NIPSCO to continue to serve customers with a safe, reliable supply of natural gas while remaining in compliance with state and federal safety requirements. NIPSCO also filed a petition on April 1, seeking approval of federally mandated pipeline safety costs, including nearly $229 million of capital cost and about $34 million of operating and maintenance programs. In addition, I would like to mention that NiSource has joined the Coalition for Renewable Natural Gas. We believe natural gas infrastructure will play an important role in America's energy future, potentially carrying renewable natural gas as well as other low carbon fuels such as hydrogen. As NiSource explores opportunities to further decarbonize its natural gas system, its local distribution companies are pursuing programs that will allow customers to reduce the carbon intensity of their natural gas usage due to renewable natural gas and carbon offsets. Regulatory filings seeking approval of these programs are underway in Pennsylvania and Virginia, similar to NIPSCO Green Power rate program that has been in place for several years. Let's turn now to our electric operations on Slide 11. Analysis continues on new generation investments resulting from the 2021 Integrated Resource Plan. NIPSCO filed a petition with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission seeking approval of NIPSCO's federally mandated cost for remediation of the coal combustion residual ash pond at Michigan City Generating Station. We will be removing coal combustion residuals and replacing them with clean fill. The federally mandated costs include a total estimate $40 million of retirement costs. Before we take your questions, I would like to highlight our safety progress. Safety continues to be the foundation of everything we do at NiSource. To give stakeholders a view of our strategy and achievements, we have published our inaugural annual sales report. Highlights include our risk management and continuous improvement activities, continued safety investments and technology integration to enhance safety. The report is available on the NiSource website, and I will encourage everyone to take a look. One very significant item in the report is the launch of the natural gas safety management system collaboratives, an effort among safety-focused energy companies. Its aim is to drive progress and maturity of safety management systems at member companies. NiSource will benefit from sharing information and learning from the experiences of others. I want to thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest and support of NiSource. We are now ready to take your questions. [indiscernible] that, Shawn. So we are still in the midst of our strategic business review. We have a group of senior executives in the company and Board members. And we are walking down a specific process to do those evaluations. We haven't outlined in terms - in a time line we are operating on. And I expect to reveal that information in the fall when we do our Investor Day. I've not - up along in the process to determine that right now, Shar, of specifically what I'm going to announce. I think that - I think the question you are getting at, will we have answers in the fall? And the answer to that will be yes. I'm not going to foreshadow announcing any kind of transactions or anything on this phone call. Now what I want to foreshadow is we will have answers in the fall. And we expect definitive announcements in terms of where we are taking the business. I will start it, and I will turn it over to Shawn. I think by the time we get to Investor Day, we are running different scenarios and alternatives in our integrated resource plan. And those scenarios and alternatives do include further delay on this commerce investigation. Now we have, I will say, a diverse set of utilities with significant modernization projects and other capital opportunities that we believe we can pull forward and continue to execute our plan until this investigation is done. But Shawn, do you want to weigh on anything else there? No, I wouldn't do any shaping of that. You think about our capital programs and the tracker mechanisms we have got in place. It really does allow us to get earnings and cash flows on average about 12 months after we make those investments. We will start that in 2022 and go into 2023. And so it really does support our annual guidance as well as our long-term CAGR. I will turn it to Shawn for specifics. But we do not need any specific EPA approvals to move that retirement day on Schahfer. I think, yes. The answer is that we do - I mean - especially around labor costs on some of these projects. I mean just like the rest of the world, I mean everybody is seeing inflation everywhere. So just like the labor cost on these projects are going up. I mean still price or our commodity, natural gas, and the overall price of energy. So I think when you think about investing, and we are continuing to invest in renewable projects, I think you have to look at it holistically and understand how that compares with the price increases on other forms of energy and decide which ones you want to continue to invest in to provide reliable service to customers. That is the question are you asking - these are about projects that we have started that Shawn mentioned, that started in 2021 or the projects that have not started at all? [indiscernible] that question. That is correct. Thanks for asking that question. And we are always thinking about customer rate impact customer bill. I think part of this is we try and put CapEx in the system to drive value for customers. We are also trying to drive productivity and efficiency to offset some of those customer increases. But I mean, in answer to your question, we are thinking about customer bill impact and continuously having a conversation with the regulators about what that means. Yes, Brian. Pablo, why don't you take that? Yes. So I will start that and Pablo or Donald can weigh in. When we look at our gas business, especially this winter, we had a very challenging winter. And when you do gas work, you are doing a lot of digging in the ground and you are dealing with weather incidents. Your productivity levels are typically not where you need them to be. The ground is harder, a lot harder to get to some of our lakes. Over time, as the weather clears up, we expect to get those productivity gains back. So I think it is more of a weather issue that we can turn around here in the near term. Pablo? Yes. So you have got a couple of parts to your question. So the first question was around inflation, what we are seeing. So we are tracking each, I would say, category of spend across the business, electric and gas, looking at year-over-year impacts, looking at contracts and - to really understand what we are seeing and how to best manage those. So that is where we are seeing kind of the six to 10 across certain categories. In some places, it is flat because we have got multiyear contracts already in place but certainly seeing some inflation there. Other question, I think, you were referring to the $0.04 to $0.05 in 2024. We have got line of sight to that. And we think about both from a, I would say, NiSource Next, to your point. Those would be costs that would go out over time and to get back to - and Pablo's point around productivity. NiSource Next really is designed to increase productivity across our business, especially in the field. And so that is the long-term savings. But certainly, we have got levers on a year-over-year basis to ensure that we are hitting our targets. So it is really all of the above. So part of this is we are developing, I will say, an O&M agility methodology. As we build our O&M budgets every year, we will have a plus or minus 2% agility in there that we can flex. And then the other part, as Donald talked about, with NiSource Next and gaining productivity is more structural, focused on continuously building more productivity and efficiency into the business as we go along. And we will have more detail and follow on that on both of those. So I think when you talk about general cost overruns, I think those are covered in the contract with the developer. With respect to the tariffs, I don't think - those were contemplated in the contracts. Therefore, we have to work with the developer and/or the regulator to decide who bears that risk. Allow me to be clear, I was never - the delay in the Investor Day is primarily focused on the delay in the solar project. I was never - I didn't believe I would be finished to review by May or spring Investor Day. I think the level of review that we are taking, looking hard at just each of the utilities, how they contribute to the overall business, where our corporate services are, what productivity looks like in the organization, how we benchmark, all of that is ongoing. And it just so happens, I believe, in that targeted making sure that we are finished in the fall in conjunction with these projects so that we can give what I will call a comprehensive review of strategy of NiSource in terms of how we will grow after 2024. So first of all, thank you for your questions. I would like to close by reiterating a few key takeaways. One, NiSource expects the Commerce Department solar panel investigation to delay solar projects. We are developing and implementing a mitigation plan to maintain our 2024 growth commitments. We are reaffirming our 2022 guidance of $1.42 to $1.48 diluted non-GAAP in EPS. We are reaffirming our forecast for 7% to 9% compound annual growth rate from 2021 through 2024, including near-term annual growth of 5% to 7% through 2023. We continue to make strong progress in our regulatory agenda with a settlement in NIPSCO gas rate case and new cases filed in Pennsylvania and Virginia. And NiSource will host the Investor Day in the fall. We intend to provide you with a definitive long-term plan beyond 2024. Thank you. We appreciate you joining us this morning."

            "name": "Donald Brown",
            "content": "Thanks, Shawn, and good morning, everyone. I would like to start with that we have moved the timing to hold an Investor Day event to this fall. We believe shifting the timing of our Investor Day will allow us to gain a clearer line of sight into the solar project timing and provide more details around the business review so that we can provide a definitive long-term plan beyond 2024. During this fall event, we intend to provide an extension to our capital investment and growth plan, a detailed update on our generation transition and ESG profile as well as give you an opportunity to hear from the leaders of our businesses. Now turning to our first quarter 2022 results on Slide 4. We had non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $329 million or $0.75 per diluted share compared to non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $305 million or $0.77 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2021. These first quarter 2022 results represent a solid start to the year. And as Lloyd mentioned a few minutes ago, we have reaffirmed our 2022 guidance of $1.42 to $1.48 and all of our long-term diluted non-GAAP net operating earnings per share growth rates. Taking a closer look at our segment non-GAAP results on Slide 5. Gas Distribution operating earnings were about $405 million for Q1 of 2022, representing an increase of approximately $31 million versus the same quarter last year. Operating revenues, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses, were higher by approximately $66 million mainly due to new rates resulting from base rate cases and regulatory capital programs. Operating expenses, again, net of cost of energy and track expenses were higher by approximately $35 million. In our electric segment, non-GAAP operating earnings for the first quarter were about $99 million, which was about $8 million higher than 2021. Operating revenues, net of the cost of energy and track expenses, increased by approximately $9 million due largely to revenue from regulated investments and other operating expenses were essentially flat to 2021 levels. Now turning to Slide 6. I would like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of March 31 was about $9.8 billion, of which $9.2 billion with long-term debt with a weighted average maturity of approximately 14 years and a weighted average interest rate of approximately 3.7%. At the end of the first quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.9 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization programs. We also continue our commitment to retaining our current investment-grade credit ratings. And I would note that Fitch has completed their 2022 annual credit review with no change to our rating or outlook. Our debt and credit profile continue to represent a solid financial foundation to support our long-term safety and infrastructure investments. As you can see on Slide 7 and 8, we are in the process of making some adjustments to our financial plan to reflect expected delays in solar generation projects that will help mitigate the earnings impact of these delays and enable us to maintain our 2024 EPS growth commitment. Both the long-term visibility of our capital plan and the flexibility in our regulatory mechanisms illustrates the resiliency and strength of our business and provides us confidence to maintain all of our commitments, including EPS growth. Taking a quick look at Slide 9, which highlights our financing plan. The only slight change to our financing plan is to extend the potential timing related to the debt financing of the renewable generation investments, which, as we indicated on Slide 8, provides incremental interest savings to mitigate the renewable project delays. Again, this balanced financing plan is consistent with all of our earnings growth and credit commitments. Now I will turn it over to Lloyd, who will discuss our utilities highlights. I would say as a follow-up. It is too early as we are in the process. We are working with our developers for us to update any estimates on the individual projects. As we get more clarity and negotiate and work with those developers, we will update the amounts as appropriate - appropriate. That is right. Yes. That is right. P And with regards to the financing plan, certainly, we expect that if there is delays it is going to impact - it is going to delay the - any debt financing that we do on the projects. That is where we expect we'd see some savings from deferring some of that debt issuance. As regards to - with regard to ATM, no changes to our financing plan now. You see the ranges that we have got outlined here. Certainly, no ATM in 2023 is possible. And that is certainly taking into account the - both our overall business as well as those renewable projects."

Please note that today\u2019s call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I\u2019d now like to introduce to the call Chris Turnure, Head of Investor Relations. You may now proceed. Thank you.\nChris Turnure: Good morning, and welcome to the NiSource Fourth Quarter 2023 Investor Call. Joining me today are President and Chief Executive Officer, Lloyd Yates; Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Shawn Anderson; Executive Vice President of Strategy and Risk and Chief Commercial Officer, Michael Luhrs; and Executive Vice President and Group President, NiSource Utilities, Melody Birmingham. The purpose of this presentation is to review NiSource\u2019s financial performance for the fourth quarter of 2023 as well as provide an update on our operations and growth drivers. Following prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open the call to your questions. Slides for today\u2019s call are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. We would like to remind you that some of the statements made during this presentation will be forward-looking. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. Information concerning such risks and uncertainties is included in the risk factors and MD&A sections of our periodic SEC filings. Additionally, some of the statements made on this call relate to non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the supplemental slides, segment information and full financial schedules for information on the most directly comparable GAAP measure and a reconciliation of these measures. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Lloyd.\nLloyd Yates: Thanks, Chris. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I\u2019m excited to be with you this morning to share outstanding financial results and to discuss the advancement of key business initiatives, which are devoted and talented workforce delivered to support our customers, communities and our shareholders across all of 2023. We began the year with a premium business plan represented by the value proposition you see on Slide 3. The bottom line is the NiSource team delivered. You\u2019ll notice successful execution of these key initiatives across the Board. Let me provide a few highlights, which fuel our resilient and sustaining business across all years of our plan. We executed our highest CapEx investment in 2023, exceeding our rate based investment goals. As of the year-end 2023, we had $18.8 billion of rate base. We continue to forecast $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion of capital expenditures in 2024 and $16 billion over our five-year financial plan through 2028. Year-over-year, NOEPS growth achieved 9% increase and achieved the highest end of our guidance range. We are acutely focused on smart capital deployment and maximizing risk adjusted returns and responsible rate-based investing through strong recovery mechanisms across our businesses. Project Apollo achieved this goal of over $50 million of cost savings initiatives. Perhaps more important than the amount of savings is the energy and support demonstrated by our people to build a continuous improvement mindset and enhance productivity by doing things safer, better, more efficiently and with less cost. These initiatives contributed greatly to a total shareholder return, which exceeded mid cap and large cap U.S. utility peers in 2023. For the three-year period, total shareholder return was 10.1% compound annual growth rate versus 5% per peers, which is reflective of our strong earnings per share execution and future growth prospects. We are confident our commitments are resilient to rapidly changing business conditions such as those seen by the utility industry over the last two years and which our financial results have delivered over this period. We continue building a track record of growth and execution, and our commitment to investors, customers, employees is central to everything we do. On Slide 4, you\u2019ll see our key priorities. First, as you observed in our release, we delivered 2023 non-GAAP EP \u2013 NOEPS of $1.60 versus the upper half of $1.54 to $1.60 revised guidance range. This underscores our execution of resilient financial commitments and a business plan which anticipated the broader headwinds our customers and our sector are facing today. This result was achieved despite a $128 million increase in interest expense and without sacrificing our FFO to debt commitment. Built on the strength of our infrastructure investment programs, we are raising 2024 guidance to $1.70 to $1.74 from $1.68 to $.72, which we initiated in November. We continue to expect a 2023 through 2028 annual EPS growth rate of 6% to 8%, supported by 8% to 10% annual rate-based growth. The 2024 guidance range is refreshed reflective of the annual growth expected up our strong year-end 2023 financial results. Second, our superior regulatory and stakeholder foundation differentiates us from peers. NIPSCO received IURC approval of renewable CPCN amendment for several of our investments in January. Intervener testimony was also received last month for our NIPSCO gas rate case filed in October 2023. Third, our balance sheet flexibility allows us to optimize cost of capital for customers and ultimate return on capital for shareholders. A key focus for 2023 was the NIPSCO minority interest transaction with Blackstone Infrastructure Partners, which successfully closed in December. This transaction diversified capital fundraising for NiSource from public capital markets and creates a long-term partnership for years to come. Fourth, our company is experiencing a record investment cycle driven by safety, reliability, regulation, decarbonization and modernization. Slide 5 details our annual capital expenditures across our six state service territory. Our $16 billion five-year plan was introduced in November 2023, built on and extended our prior November 2022, $15 billion plan. It incorporates electric generation, transmission, gas modernization and economic development investments through 2028. The nature of our capital plan diversifies project risk, including our generation project investments, which lack the large project execution risk on the scale seen elsewhere in the industry in recent years. We intend to layer in projects from our $2 billion upside capital program as they meet our threshold for base plan execution. Key rate case and capital rider activity is shown on Slide 6. Our leading regulatory and stakeholder execution advances as we continue to work with stakeholders through rate case and tracker cycles to efficiently deploy capital investments and recover cost associated with these investments to drive value for customers, our communities and our shareholders. The strength of our company continues to be working constructively with stakeholders and communities to safely and reliably deliver the energy they deserve and to be there for our customers when they need energy most. Since our last update, our Virginia SAVE Rider was approved and implemented and our Kentucky SMRP Rider went into effect subject to refund, together covering over $100 million of capital investment made for our customers. Slide 7 shows how our operational excellence model is incorporated into decision making in all areas of the company. Last year, we significantly improved safety performance by delivering a 14% reduction in Days Away Restricted or Transferred or DART, and are on a path to achieving a goal of top decile performance. Additionally, we recorded a 16% reduction in Preventable Vehicle Collisions, or PVC. As I already mentioned, Project Apollo is generating enhanced productivity by doing things safer, better, more efficiently and with less costs. The improvements in our work plans and cost profiles are expected to continue and sustain this year after an implementation that exceeded expectations in 2023. I have provided you with specific examples of project initiatives in recent quarters, but want to highlight the underlying cultural change occurring throughout the company. The team continues to find new ways to improve every day and this will generate value for all our stakeholders for decades. I am impressed with the continuous improvement mindset fueling our organization and I am excited for our teams as we continue this journey. Before we advance the call, I want to close this section with the following. I couldn\u2019t be more proud of our entire team and their devotion each and every day to support our nearly 4 million customers. With extreme cold weather across much of January, we delivered critical energy to keep our customers safe and warm. 2023 was a banner year for NiSource as the first full year of execution across our strategy shared in November 2022 and we deliver on all marks across the Board. This sets the foundation for continued growth in safety and reliability for our customers and value for our shareholders, which we strongly believe in. Michael and Shawn will dive into greater details on why 2023 was a successful year for our stakeholders, and also why 2024 and beyond will be even better. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Michael.\nMichael Luhrs: Thank you, Lloyd. I\u2019ll begin on Slide 8. NIPSCO\u2019s generation transition remains on track, I believe support the retirement of two of the remaining three coal-fired generation units by the end of 2025 and the final unit by 2028. To this end, construction on our crossroads two wind PPA was completed at the end of 2023 and the facility is now producing sustainable zero fuel cost generation for NIPSCO\u2019s Northern Indiana customers. In fact, customers are seeing the benefit of this generation as part of our renewable portfolio already receiving $18 million in renewable energy credits sold into the marketplace in 2023, lowering customers overall cost of energy. In November of 2023, NIPSCO received approval on a CPCN amendment converting Gibson from a PPA to a build-transfer agreement. Also, progress continues on Cavalry and Dunns Bridge II Solar facilities, and we expect both to be completed as planned later this year. In January, NIPSCO received approval from the IURC to own 100% of these two projects in lieu of owning them through tax equity joint ventures. Fully owning these projects will benefit customers by leveraging the tax credit transferability provisions of the IRA, NIPSCO will be able to monetize tax credits associated with the projects more efficiently than under tax equity agreements, resulting in comparatively lower energy costs for customers. We continue to evaluate the customer benefits of utilizing similar approaches for the Fairbanks and Gibson projects, which are in development. Though we have made significant advancements in our generation portfolio, we are looking forward to how we advance the portfolio in reliability, resiliency, customer benefits, and towards our goal of net zero by 2040. An important component of our generation portfolio planning process is NIPSCO\u2019s Triennial Integrated Resource Plan, or IRP. The 2024 IRP will evaluate NIPSCO\u2019s long-term generating capacity requirements and inform generation investment decisions beyond NIPSCO\u2019s gas peaker project and the renewable projects already in development. The 2024 IRP will incorporate a number of scenarios and updates since the 2021 IRP, such as MISO seasonal construct and its proposed resource accreditation approach. The customer centric process will include a series of stakeholder meetings that will kick off in the spring and will culminate with the submissions of an integrated resource plan to the IURC in November. We look forward to working together with stakeholders to continue on our path to reliably serve and strengthen our communities. The IRP will build on our current generation portfolio, our build transfer agreements and PPA projects in development as outlined on Slide 8, and our 400 megawatt gas peaker project expected in service in 2027. As a reminder, the base capital plan released in November includes the gas peaker full ownership of Cavalry and Dunns Bridge II projects, and tax equity joint ventures for the Fairbanks and Gibson projects. On Slide 9, you\u2019ll see additional investment opportunities not included in our current base five-year capital plan. We continue to develop and grow in a disciplined and measured way a portfolio of opportunities that benefit customers and stakeholders. We continue to advance these opportunities and will layer them into the upside CapEx plan as appropriate. Relative to gas system investments, the PHMSA rulemaking process is now expected to take longer than originally anticipated. However, we still expect regulatory clarity in 2024. We do not believe the final rule will materially shift CapEx within our base plan. We will continue to evaluate how the rules apply to our systems and engage with stakeholders to deliver the system reliability and benefits expected under the rules. This engagement will inform how the implementation of rules may shape timing of investments in our upside CapEx plan. I would like to conclude my comments today with an update on our ESG performance. In addition to being on track to achieve our net zero and interim decarbonization goals, we achieved 19% diverse supplier spend in 2023, up from 16% in 2022 and 10% in 2021, and are well on our way to our goal of achieving 25% diverse supplier spend by 2025. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Shawn.\nShawn Anderson: Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m excited to share our 2023 financial results on Slide 10. Non-GAAP net operating earnings in the fourth quarter were $239 million or $0.53 per diluted share, up from $221 million or $0.50 per diluted share in the same period in 2022. This earnings increase is driven by regulatory mechanisms recovering capital investment, partly offset by a modest increase in non-tracked O&M and higher interest expense. For the full year, we reported $716 million of non-GAAP net operating earnings for $1.60 per diluted share, up from $648 million and $1.47 in 2022, respectively. Across this period, regulated revenue returns were partly offset by higher depreciation expense, interest expense, and lower other income. On Slide 11, you\u2019ll find segment detail and key drivers of our results. For the full year, non-GAAP operating income increased across each of the gas, electric and corporate segments, accounting for a $209 million increase to consolidated net operating earnings. Capital expenditures fueled regulated returns, and as Lloyd highlighted earlier, we deployed approximately $3.6 billion in infrastructure projects to enhance safety and reliability of our energy systems. This drove an increase of $335 million through regulatory activity, in rate cases and capital trackers across our jurisdictions. A growing customer base across our businesses also provided a lift in our 2023 financial results and supports customer affordability. Demand for our fuel continues to be very strong, with residential customer count growing over 80 basis points in our gas businesses and over 50 basis points in our electric business last year, both of which enhanced the scale of NiSource. Economic development continues to thrive in the Midwest, and there is no better example of how this collaboration can benefit customers, communities and investors than in Ohio. Our operations in the state serve 1.5 million customers, nearly 550,000 of which are supported by our Columbus operations center. Public private partnership has propelled Ohio\u2019s recent economic development success. In 2023 alone, 33 projects were brought to central Ohio, with over $10 billion in investment being committed. This momentum continues today as there are nearly 100 active opportunities being pursued for future development with the potential to create thousands of new jobs and invest billions of dollars more into central Ohio communities. The majority of these projects are focused in manufacturing industries, representing a diverse range of sectors, including electric vehicles, energy storage, logistics, life sciences, semiconductors, advanced computing facilities and many more. Additionally, Ohio will continue to see new corporate investment driven by downstream supplier activity from megaprojects currently under construction, such as a joint venture with Honda and LG Energy and the Intel chip manufacturing facility. This development can enhance value for NiSource and create an upside to our plan from residential housing demand, which grows as these secondary businesses develop. Central Ohio\u2019s metro population grew an average of 1.8% annually over the last 30 years, and the population is expected to grow an additional 30% by 2050, boosted by strong economic development prospects. Broad stakeholder and policy support is critical to onshoring and manufacturing success and will fuel healthy and growing Midwest economies. Our communities benefit from numerous constructive regulatory mechanisms that encourage energy infrastructure investment across to our states, including economic development programs to spur investments in our region, which create jobs and enhance local tax base. Switching to Slide 13, I\u2019d like to highlight several key value drivers which represent the foundation of our long-term financial commitments. We have increased our non-GAAP net operating earnings per share guidance range for 2024 by $0.02 at the midpoint compared to the range introduced in November. This midpoint now represents a 7.5% year-over-year growth rate from 2023 actual results. The revised guidance is driven primarily by revenues from regulatory activity and enhanced customer demand and lower financing costs relative to our prior year forecast. These growth drivers, along with the strength of our infrastructure investment programs, underpin our expectation to continue to deliver annual non-GAAP NOEPS growth of 6% to 8% and annual rate based growth of 8% to 10% over the 2023 to 2028 period. This is driven by $16 billion of capital expenditures, and it is expected to approximate residential customer bill growth to below 4% on average across the plan horizon. Finally, inconsistent with our last update, our base capital plan includes full ownership of Cavalry and Dunns Bridge II solar projects expected in service in 2024. Fairbanks and Gibson continue to be expected in service in 2025, using a tax equity financing structure. Our upside plan includes incremental CapEx associated with full ownership of these projects, as well as electric and gas investments which Michael detailed earlier. Our financing plan is outlined on Slide 14, which remains unchanged from our mid-November update. As we outlined in that update, we continue to expect to issue up to $600 million in ATM equity in 2024 and $200 million to $300 million of maintenance ATM equity annually in the 2025 to 2028 period to support our base capital plan. Within the operation of our at-the-market program, we retain the flexibility to include small, bilateral discrete transactions should they be efficient to execute. We also continue to reaffirm our commitment to an FFO to debt ratio of 14% to 16% through 2028. In January, our board of directors authorized a 6% increase to our dividend, which is consistent with the annual increase authorized last year. This projects our annual dividend at the bottom half of our stated range for targeted dividend payout ratio of 60% to 70%. We will continue to be thoughtful about capital allocation in the high cost of capital environment. The final two slides will conclude our presentation and focus on execution of our stakeholder commitments. First, our multiyear track record of execution and growth continued in 2023. Lloyd touched on the premium business plan we shared with each of you in November of 2022, and this represents the full year of execution of this plan. We continue to prioritize safety while optimizing our long-term cost profile. We built on our superior regulatory and stakeholder foundation through the execution of four general rate cases and numerous CPCN amendments and capital tracker approvals. During the year, we invested over $3.6 billion to support our customers and keep our communities and our employees safe, all while enhancing the balance sheet afforded through the minority interest sale. We are proud of the execution delivered by the entire NiSource team, including achieving a 9% year-over-year growth rate and landing at the high end of our guidance range. All of these investments and the long-term visibility of our results fuel our confidence to execute each and every year as we move forward. As we share on Slide 16, each of the last three years, we\u2019ve executed strong financial growth, achieving the upper half of our guidance range in each year. This is important. Each year we\u2019ve done this, we\u2019ve rebased future NOEPS guidance upwards off those actual results. We\u2019ve accomplished this in 2021, 2022 and now 2023. And we expect to keep doing this, as we move forward, exemplified by our upgraded guidance range with an implied midpoint of 7.5% over 2023\u2019s already strong results. And this is differentiated in our sector, which has delivered an average 5% non-GAAP NOEPS CAGR since 2021 compared to the 8% achieved by NiSource. The underlying business plan supported by strong regulatory construct in NiSource jurisdictions coupled with responsible investments in identifiable regulatory programs, enable a reasonable return of investment over our plan. The confidence in these investments enables the rebasing of annual growth rate which supports this higher NOEPS range as we execute the plan, which in turn enhances the future earnings potential of our business in each forward year of our plan. We are excited about the future prospects of our business and to continue building a track record of execution and growth. We remain confident. Our commitments are resilient to rapidly changing business conditions, as which was seen across the utility industry over the last two years. Despite this, the NiSource plan is stronger than ever. Thank you for your time this morning and your interest in NiSource. And with that, I\u2019d like to open the call to your questions.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we are now opening the floor for question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Barclays Capital. Your line is now open.\nNick Campanella: Hey, thanks. Good morning. This is Nick Campanella on.\nLloyd Yates: Good morning, Nick.\nNick Campanella: Appreciate all the disclosures today. Good morning. So I guess, just to start, the renewables investment and ownership upside that you kind of highlighted on slides here, just how are you kind of thinking about the timing of layering that into the plan? And then I guess, Shawn, can you still sequence those cash flows from those projects to kind of do this without additional equity financing or just how are you kind of thinking about that? Thanks.\nMichael Luhrs: Yes, thank you. So this is Michael. We\u2019re continuing to work through this in a discipline and methodical way, just as we have been all through the last year. Just maybe to walk through a little bit of history associated with it. So if you look at the Gibson and Fairbanks projects, which are part of the billion dollar upside, when we look at a $2 billion upside, when we look at the CapEx plan. We filed for in July, a change for the Gibson from a PPA to a bill transfer agreement that was received in November. We also in 2023 filed for full ownership of Cavalry and Dunns Bridge. We received that in January of 2024. During this period, we\u2019ve been evaluating our analysis on Fairbanks and Gibson, and we expect to be able to work through those final details at our analysis now and give a more fulsome update in Q2. But we would plan to have that update and roll that through as we complete that analysis.\nShawn Anderson: Yes. Then, Nick, this is Shawn to the second part of your question. I think the way we\u2019ve described the future financing plan associated with any of the upside CapEx is that we would need to evaluate the cash flow profile of the projects, in this case, the two renewables projects that Michael\u2019s described that you asked about would have some assistance from PTC monetization over the plan horizon. It also would come with a higher depreciation rate relative to some of the alternative investments. Those have the ability to help the cash flow profile of the business. That said, construction timelines, regulatory recovery, and obviously the approval from the IURC would all play into the fact of how we would finance those projects, which is why we\u2019ve described a potential modest increase associated with the ATM to maintain the capital structure when we access the upside CapEx plan.\nNick Campanella: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then I guess, just maybe sticking with financing. You\u2019re clear in slides that it\u2019s an ATM strategy for 2024, but it does seem in the prepared remarks that you\u2019re open to doing something more kind of bilateral. Can you just kind of explain the thought there and where you stand.\nShawn Anderson: Yes, sure. We\u2019ve studied our available trading days for the remainder of the year, and we\u2019re confident the equity need is highlighted. It\u2019s very executable under the ATM without placing any undue pressure on daily volumes. We\u2019ve got strong sales agents set up to support the execution, and we\u2019ll be highly engaged in this on a daily basis to ensure successful execution. And that our stock can realize the valuation uplift that we expect with our continued strong performance. That said, what we like about the ATM is it\u2019s very low cost. It has low friction costs and transaction fees associated with it. It also allows us to dollar cost average, the access of equity to the timing by which that we would deploy the CapEx and line those cash flows up, which creates more efficiency throughout the year as opposed to a scenario where you might need to over finance or bring in more dollars than you need at any one point to deploy. So those are the things we like about the ATM. There are still ways inside the ATM to be able to line those fundamentals up. And we\u2019re open to those options if it makes sense. But bottom line, we need to be very, very efficient from a cost basis standpoint and very much lined up with the timing of cash flows that we need to deploy to support our CapEx.\nNick Campanella: All right, thanks so much. Have a great day.\nShawn Anderson: Thanks, Nick.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Your light is now open.\nShar Pourreza: Hey, good morning, Lloyd and Shawn. How are you guys doing?\nLloyd Yates: Good morning, Shar.\nShawn Anderson: Hey, good morning, Shar.\nShar Pourreza: Good morning. So, obviously, you rebased higher again today, and you have the $2 billion of upside CapEx that you\u2019ve identified. But obviously that\u2019s not reflected in your plan. It\u2019s obviously, the messaging is pretty straightforward, right. You guys have confidence in the 6% to 8% growth. Are you comfortable guiding kind of where you are within the range you sit, the numbers seem to point closer to the top end. But as we\u2019re thinking about the incremental opportunities, I guess, were you within the 6% to 8%? Thanks.\nShawn Anderson: So, Shar, we did a detail assessment. We did raise guidance. We said it in the past, we\u2019re going to raise guidance. Our guidance for 2024 was based off of our strong performance in 2023. So if you think about the $1.60, the $1.70 to $1.74implies a 7.5% target for 2024. And we\u2019re very comfortable with those guidance ranges. So we\u2019re not necessarily guiding between the 6% and 8% at this point.\nLloyd Yates: Yes, just to reinforce that. Shar, it\u2019s a great question, when we see signs from the business that will lead us to a different outcome. We\u2019ve built a track record to flow those updates through this call. We\u2019ve done so at various points. So we won\u2019t wait to give you greater insight once we have a higher degree of confidence of exactly where we\u2019re going to land within the range if we need to send that signal. But right now, 6% to 8% off of a strong 2023 year end is the plan.\nShar Pourreza: Okay, perfect. That\u2019s helpful. And then just on the next \u2013 just any status on the next NIPSCO case? Just trying to get a sense on how much renewable spending will likely be captured since the last case. Thanks.\nLloyd Yates: So, Melody, you want to talk about NIPSCO Gas case? Are you talking about \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, Shar, NIPSCO \u2013 are you talking about the NIPSCO, current NIPSCO gas case or future electric?\nShar Pourreza: The future electric.\nMelody Birmingham: Well, we have not filed an electric case, so there isn\u2019t an electric case currently that has been shared. But we have in fact filed our gas case October of last year. And we are currently working with our interveners as we\u2019re discussing what we see as a successful outcome through those negotiations, what we\u2019re expecting and working towards with those interveners.\nLloyd Yates: The way to think about the next electric case, Shar, is what we like to do is file that case, pretty much align with when we finish those renewable projects. And if you think about the last case, those renewable projects went in right before that case was executed. So I think we try to keep that gap really small. So that was to be dependent upon finishing those renewable projects. And right now they\u2019re on time and on schedule. We have more information about that. We\u2019ll file the electric case and we\u2019ll let you guys know that as soon as possible.\nShar Pourreza: Okay, Lloyd. Yes. That was the impetus of the question. It\u2019s just how do we think about the timing of the next electric? I think you answered it. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey, good morning team. Thanks for giving me time. Hey, Shawn, just housekeeping for us, the $600 million, have you done any equity so far, year-to-date? And then can you clarify, you mentioned, you might be doing some, I think you said some private placements, some small private placements, if I heard that correctly. So what did you intend to say there?\nShawn Anderson: Yes, absolutely, Durgesh. We have not executed anything under the 600 \u2013 up to $600 million ATM program anticipated for 2024. In fact, we had an ATM equity program expire at the end of 2023 and we\u2019ll need to file a new ATM equity program to access the current guidance of up to $600 million. And we plan to do that very soon, which would give us the balance of year for us to be able to execute that equity plan. We described a potential bilateral or discrete agreement inside the context of the ATM. It wouldn\u2019t be a private placement necessarily. However, some investors can solicit interest from sales agents directly and transact at greater than one share, for example, and that transaction would then be placed under the ATM. And certainly, we would be interested if investors are interested at an efficient pricing.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. And so perfect, that\u2019s very helpful, Shawn. And you\u2019ll update us on the quarterly calls as you execute on this program, or how will we know over time what portion of the $600 million you have executed?\nShawn Anderson: Yes, that\u2019s exactly correct. We\u2019ll keep score along the way and we\u2019ll certainly let folks know what we expect for the balance of the year and/or if any of the other aspects of the financing plan change, we\u2019ll be sure to update the slide that you see in the disclosure doc deck today.\nDurgesh Chopra: Perfect. Thank you. And then just one big picture question, perhaps for Lloyd, CenterPoint announced gas LDC sales earlier, just thinking about the opportunities you have within your current portfolio. Are there opportunities to optimize assets to fund that growth? Or how are you thinking about that?\nLloyd Yates: So let me talk about it this way. I don\u2019t necessarily comment on any kind of specific M&A, but what I will say is, when you think about NiSource, we are always very diligently reviewing options to enhance shareholder value in our plan. But we\u2019re currently focused on our organic plan, investing $16 billion at one times rate base with another potential upside to invest another $2 billion. If you go back to 2022, we did a lot of work here in terms of our business review and we see a couple of things that we like, and that is the scale at NiSource has tremendous value and we like the diversification of our six operating companies. You also saw us last year raise capital via \u2013 but you all raise capital via the NIPSCO transaction, what we thought was a very efficient process with respect \u2013 very efficient tax process with respect to taxes. So with all that being said, what I\u2019ll say to you is, we are always looking to enhance shareholder value. And if we find an opportunity to raise capital more efficiently to improve our enterprise value, we plan to take advantage of it. But right now, we\u2019re focused on our organic plan.\nDurgesh Chopra: Super. Very clear. Thanks guys. Congrats on a solid quarter here.\nShawn Anderson: Thanks, Durgesh.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Travis Miller from Morningstar. Your line is now open.\nTravis Miller: Good morning, everyone. Thank you.\nShawn Anderson: Hey, good morning, Travis.\nTravis Miller: Question on this CapEx plan, I know it\u2019s difficult to parse out things here, but especially on the gas side of that five-year plan and whatever incremental part would be associated with the gas, how much would you attribute to base spending, safety spending, core spending on the system, and then how much would you attribute to the new expansion opportunities you\u2019ve talked about manufacturing and other new build opportunities on the industrial side.\nShawn Anderson: Yes. Thanks, Travis. This is Shawn. I think that what we would attribute the planned CapEx for gas is almost all planned for safety, reliability, and compliance work supporting our regulatory requirements from PHMSA and from the local PUCs that we support. So as we think about the gas CapEx, that\u2019s the vast majority of the CapEx. We actually don\u2019t plan for significant amount of future expansion costs into the CapEx guidance itself because we often see that those CapEx amounts can be supported by incoming revenues to support the cost of basis itself. So as we have incremental projects like we had in Ohio for Intel to help support a larger economic development project. We\u2019ll work with local stakeholders, local mechanisms, and move those into the capital plan as necessary. Some of those are signaled on the slides that Michael shared from the upside plan itself. But the way I would think about it is nearly all of the CapEx that we spend from a gas standpoint, absent a small amount is driven for safety, compliance, reliability upgrades across our system.\nTravis Miller: Okay. That makes sense. And then similar question of that, how much do you expect to flow through some of the mechanisms you have that are non-base rate case related?\nShawn Anderson: Yes. We do have mechanisms in different jurisdictions that enable recovery of whether you\u2019re calling economic development type projects. We have legislation that\u2019s supported in Ohio have had for a number of years to support economic development expansion as well as in Indiana. But some of the forward-look test years, such as that in Pennsylvania can enable us to project these types of projects, if we have line of sight to where economic development is going to come into place. And we can work through the regulatory mechanisms themselves or the rate cases themselves to ensure that we can get quick recovery or prompt recovery of those. So we haven\u2019t seen economic development or business expansion be a drag on our earnings power across any of our businesses. And in fact, it often is one of the components that leads us to an upside within our range.\nTravis Miller: Okay. That\u2019s great. Thanks so much.\nShawn Anderson: Thanks, Travis.\nOperator: We have our next question from Barclays. Your line is now open.\nNick Campanella: Hey, it\u2019s Nick Campanella again. I just had a quick follow-up, if you don\u2019t mind. Just I\u2019m looking through your regulatory kind of outlook slides here, and I just wanted to know if you\u2019re still planning to file a rate case in Pennsylvania this year.\nLloyd Yates: Melody, you want to handle that one?\nMelody Birmingham: Hi there, Nick. We did file a notice of intent for Pennsylvania. And so we are working through the details of when we file for this year.\nOperator: Right. We don\u2019t have any raised hands as of the moment. I\u2019d now like to hand back over to the management for their final remarks.\nLloyd Yates: So before I close, I want to take a minute here to thank Donald Brown. Donald is our EVP and Chief Innovation Officer, our former CFO. And after nearly a decade with NiSource, Donald informed us that he\u2019ll be leaving the company to pursue other professional opportunities. I would say we\u2019re extremely grateful to Donald for his service to NiSource and for helping us build a strong financial foundation and to help us evolve and execute our transformation strategy. And we wish him well in his future endeavors. I want to thank all of you for great questions and your support of NiSource and look forward to continue to update you on future business activities. Thank you very much.\nOperator: For attending today\u2019s call, we hope you have a wonderful day. Goodbye.",

            "name": "Shawn Anderson",
            "content": "Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to share our 2023 financial results on Slide 10. Non-GAAP net operating earnings in the fourth quarter were $239 million or $0.53 per diluted share, up from $221 million or $0.50 per diluted share in the same period in 2022. This earnings increase is driven by regulatory mechanisms recovering capital investment, partly offset by a modest increase in non-tracked O&M and higher interest expense. For the full year, we reported $716 million of non-GAAP net operating earnings for $1.60 per diluted share, up from $648 million and $1.47 in 2022, respectively. Across this period, regulated revenue returns were partly offset by higher depreciation expense, interest expense, and lower other income. On Slide 11, you'll find segment detail and key drivers of our results. For the full year, non-GAAP operating income increased across each of the gas, electric and corporate segments, accounting for a $209 million increase to consolidated net operating earnings. Capital expenditures fueled regulated returns, and as Lloyd highlighted earlier, we deployed approximately $3.6 billion in infrastructure projects to enhance safety and reliability of our energy systems. This drove an increase of $335 million through regulatory activity, in rate cases and capital trackers across our jurisdictions. A growing customer base across our businesses also provided a lift in our 2023 financial results and supports customer affordability. Demand for our fuel continues to be very strong, with residential customer count growing over 80 basis points in our gas businesses and over 50 basis points in our electric business last year, both of which enhanced the scale of NiSource. Economic development continues to thrive in the Midwest, and there is no better example of how this collaboration can benefit customers, communities and investors than in Ohio. Our operations in the state serve 1.5 million customers, nearly 550,000 of which are supported by our Columbus operations center. Public private partnership has propelled Ohio's recent economic development success. In 2023 alone, 33 projects were brought to central Ohio, with over $10 billion in investment being committed. This momentum continues today as there are nearly 100 active opportunities being pursued for future development with the potential to create thousands of new jobs and invest billions of dollars more into central Ohio communities. The majority of these projects are focused in manufacturing industries, representing a diverse range of sectors, including electric vehicles, energy storage, logistics, life sciences, semiconductors, advanced computing facilities and many more. Additionally, Ohio will continue to see new corporate investment driven by downstream supplier activity from megaprojects currently under construction, such as a joint venture with Honda and LG Energy and the Intel chip manufacturing facility. This development can enhance value for NiSource and create an upside to our plan from residential housing demand, which grows as these secondary businesses develop. Central Ohio's metro population grew an average of 1.8% annually over the last 30 years, and the population is expected to grow an additional 30% by 2050, boosted by strong economic development prospects. Broad stakeholder and policy support is critical to onshoring and manufacturing success and will fuel healthy and growing Midwest economies. Our communities benefit from numerous constructive regulatory mechanisms that encourage energy infrastructure investment across to our states, including economic development programs to spur investments in our region, which create jobs and enhance local tax base. Switching to Slide 13, I'd like to highlight several key value drivers which represent the foundation of our long-term financial commitments. We have increased our non-GAAP net operating earnings per share guidance range for 2024 by $0.02 at the midpoint compared to the range introduced in November. This midpoint now represents a 7.5% year-over-year growth rate from 2023 actual results. The revised guidance is driven primarily by revenues from regulatory activity and enhanced customer demand and lower financing costs relative to our prior year forecast. These growth drivers, along with the strength of our infrastructure investment programs, underpin our expectation to continue to deliver annual non-GAAP NOEPS growth of 6% to 8% and annual rate based growth of 8% to 10% over the 2023 to 2028 period. This is driven by $16 billion of capital expenditures, and it is expected to approximate residential customer bill growth to below 4% on average across the plan horizon. Finally, inconsistent with our last update, our base capital plan includes full ownership of Cavalry and Dunns Bridge II solar projects expected in service in 2024. Fairbanks and Gibson continue to be expected in service in 2025, using a tax equity financing structure. Our upside plan includes incremental CapEx associated with full ownership of these projects, as well as electric and gas investments which Michael detailed earlier. Our financing plan is outlined on Slide 14, which remains unchanged from our mid-November update. As we outlined in that update, we continue to expect to issue up to $600 million in ATM equity in 2024 and $200 million to $300 million of maintenance ATM equity annually in the 2025 to 2028 period to support our base capital plan. Within the operation of our at-the-market program, we retain the flexibility to include small, bilateral discrete transactions should they be efficient to execute. We also continue to reaffirm our commitment to an FFO to debt ratio of 14% to 16% through 2028. In January, our board of directors authorized a 6% increase to our dividend, which is consistent with the annual increase authorized last year. This projects our annual dividend at the bottom half of our stated range for targeted dividend payout ratio of 60% to 70%. We will continue to be thoughtful about capital allocation in the high cost of capital environment. The final two slides will conclude our presentation and focus on execution of our stakeholder commitments. First, our multiyear track record of execution and growth continued in 2023. Lloyd touched on the premium business plan we shared with each of you in November of 2022, and this represents the full year of execution of this plan. We continue to prioritize safety while optimizing our long-term cost profile. We built on our superior regulatory and stakeholder foundation through the execution of four general rate cases and numerous CPCN amendments and capital tracker approvals. During the year, we invested over $3.6 billion to support our customers and keep our communities and our employees safe, all while enhancing the balance sheet afforded through the minority interest sale. We are proud of the execution delivered by the entire NiSource team, including achieving a 9% year-over-year growth rate and landing at the high end of our guidance range. All of these investments and the long-term visibility of our results fuel our confidence to execute each and every year as we move forward. As we share on Slide 16, each of the last three years, we've executed strong financial growth, achieving the upper half of our guidance range in each year. This is important. Each year we've done this, we've rebased future NOEPS guidance upwards off those actual results. We've accomplished this in 2021, 2022 and now 2023. And we expect to keep doing this, as we move forward, exemplified by our upgraded guidance range with an implied midpoint of 7.5% over 2023's already strong results. And this is differentiated in our sector, which has delivered an average 5% non-GAAP NOEPS CAGR since 2021 compared to the 8% achieved by NiSource. The underlying business plan supported by strong regulatory construct in NiSource jurisdictions coupled with responsible investments in identifiable regulatory programs, enable a reasonable return of investment over our plan. The confidence in these investments enables the rebasing of annual growth rate which supports this higher NOEPS range as we execute the plan, which in turn enhances the future earnings potential of our business in each forward year of our plan. We are excited about the future prospects of our business and to continue building a track record of execution and growth. We remain confident. Our commitments are resilient to rapidly changing business conditions, as which was seen across the utility industry over the last two years. Despite this, the NiSource plan is stronger than ever. Thank you for your time this morning and your interest in NiSource. And with that, I'd like to open the call to your questions. Yes. Then, Nick, this is Shawn to the second part of your question. I think the way we've described the future financing plan associated with any of the upside CapEx is that we would need to evaluate the cash flow profile of the projects, in this case, the two renewables projects that Michael's described that you asked about would have some assistance from PTC monetization over the plan horizon. It also would come with a higher depreciation rate relative to some of the alternative investments. Those have the ability to help the cash flow profile of the business. That said, construction timelines, regulatory recovery, and obviously the approval from the IURC would all play into the fact of how we would finance those projects, which is why we've described a potential modest increase associated with the ATM to maintain the capital structure when we access the upside CapEx plan. Yes, sure. We've studied our available trading days for the remainder of the year, and we're confident the equity need is highlighted. It's very executable under the ATM without placing any undue pressure on daily volumes. We've got strong sales agents set up to support the execution, and we'll be highly engaged in this on a daily basis to ensure successful execution. And that our stock can realize the valuation uplift that we expect with our continued strong performance. That said, what we like about the ATM is it's very low cost. It has low friction costs and transaction fees associated with it. It also allows us to dollar cost average, the access of equity to the timing by which that we would deploy the CapEx and line those cash flows up, which creates more efficiency throughout the year as opposed to a scenario where you might need to over finance or bring in more dollars than you need at any one point to deploy. So those are the things we like about the ATM. There are still ways inside the ATM to be able to line those fundamentals up. And we're open to those options if it makes sense. But bottom line, we need to be very, very efficient from a cost basis standpoint and very much lined up with the timing of cash flows that we need to deploy to support our CapEx. Thanks, Nick. Hey, good morning, Shar. So, Shar, we did a detail assessment. We did raise guidance. We said it in the past, we're going to raise guidance. Our guidance for 2024 was based off of our strong performance in 2023. So if you think about the $1.60, the $1.70 to $1.74implies a 7.5% target for 2024. And we're very comfortable with those guidance ranges. So we're not necessarily guiding between the 6% and 8% at this point. Yes, absolutely, Durgesh. We have not executed anything under the 600 \u2013 up to $600 million ATM program anticipated for 2024. In fact, we had an ATM equity program expire at the end of 2023 and we'll need to file a new ATM equity program to access the current guidance of up to $600 million. And we plan to do that very soon, which would give us the balance of year for us to be able to execute that equity plan. We described a potential bilateral or discrete agreement inside the context of the ATM. It wouldn't be a private placement necessarily. However, some investors can solicit interest from sales agents directly and transact at greater than one share, for example, and that transaction would then be placed under the ATM. And certainly, we would be interested if investors are interested at an efficient pricing. Yes, that's exactly correct. We'll keep score along the way and we'll certainly let folks know what we expect for the balance of the year and/or if any of the other aspects of the financing plan change, we'll be sure to update the slide that you see in the disclosure doc deck today. Thanks, Durgesh. Hey, good morning, Travis. Yes. Thanks, Travis. This is Shawn. I think that what we would attribute the planned CapEx for gas is almost all planned for safety, reliability, and compliance work supporting our regulatory requirements from PHMSA and from the local PUCs that we support. So as we think about the gas CapEx, that's the vast majority of the CapEx.

So we haven't seen economic development or business expansion be a drag on our earnings power across any of our businesses. And in fact, it often is one of the components that leads us to an upside within our range. Thanks, Travis."

            "name": "Michael Luhrs",
            "content": "Thank you, Lloyd. I'll begin on Slide 8. NIPSCO's generation transition remains on track, I believe support the retirement of two of the remaining three coal-fired generation units by the end of 2025 and the final unit by 2028. To this end, construction on our crossroads two wind PPA was completed at the end of 2023 and the facility is now producing sustainable zero fuel cost generation for NIPSCO's Northern Indiana customers. In fact, customers are seeing the benefit of this generation as part of our renewable portfolio already receiving $18 million in renewable energy credits sold into the marketplace in 2023, lowering customers overall cost of energy. In November of 2023, NIPSCO received approval on a CPCN amendment converting Gibson from a PPA to a build-transfer agreement. Also, progress continues on Cavalry and Dunns Bridge II Solar facilities, and we expect both to be completed as planned later this year. In January, NIPSCO received approval from the IURC to own 100% of these two projects in lieu of owning them through tax equity joint ventures. Fully owning these projects will benefit customers by leveraging the tax credit transferability provisions of the IRA, NIPSCO will be able to monetize tax credits associated with the projects more efficiently than under tax equity agreements, resulting in comparatively lower energy costs for customers. We continue to evaluate the customer benefits of utilizing similar approaches for the Fairbanks and Gibson projects, which are in development. Though we have made significant advancements in our generation portfolio, we are looking forward to how we advance the portfolio in reliability, resiliency, customer benefits, and towards our goal of net zero by 2040. An important component of our generation portfolio planning process is NIPSCO's Triennial Integrated Resource Plan, or IRP. The 2024 IRP will evaluate NIPSCO's long-term generating capacity requirements and inform generation investment decisions beyond NIPSCO's gas peaker project and the renewable projects already in development. The 2024 IRP will incorporate a number of scenarios and updates since the 2021 IRP, such as MISO seasonal construct and its proposed resource accreditation approach. The customer centric process will include a series of stakeholder meetings that will kick off in the spring and will culminate with the submissions of an integrated resource plan to the IURC in November. We look forward to working together with stakeholders to continue on our path to reliably serve and strengthen our communities. The IRP will build on our current generation portfolio, our build transfer agreements and PPA projects in development as outlined on Slide 8, and our 400 megawatt gas peaker project expected in service in 2027. As a reminder, the base capital plan released in November includes the gas peaker full ownership of Cavalry and Dunns Bridge II projects, and tax equity joint ventures for the Fairbanks and Gibson projects. On Slide 9, you'll see additional investment opportunities not included in our current base five-year capital plan. We continue to develop and grow in a disciplined and measured way a portfolio of opportunities that benefit customers and stakeholders. We continue to advance these opportunities and will layer them into the upside CapEx plan as appropriate. Relative to gas system investments, the PHMSA rulemaking process is now expected to take longer than originally anticipated. However, we still expect regulatory clarity in 2024. We do not believe the final rule will materially shift CapEx within our base plan. We will continue to evaluate how the rules apply to our systems and engage with stakeholders to deliver the system reliability and benefits expected under the rules. This engagement will inform how the implementation of rules may shape timing of investments in our upside CapEx plan. I would like to conclude my comments today with an update on our ESG performance. In addition to being on track to achieve our net zero and interim decarbonization goals, we achieved 19% diverse supplier spend in 2023, up from 16% in 2022 and 10% in 2021, and are well on our way to our goal of achieving 25% diverse supplier spend by 2025. I'll now turn the call over to Shawn. Yes, thank you. So this is Michael. We're continuing to work through this in a discipline and methodical way, just as we have been all through the last year. Just maybe to walk through a little bit of history associated with it. So if you look at the Gibson and Fairbanks projects, which are part of the billion dollar upside, when we look at a $2 billion upside, when we look at the CapEx plan. We filed for in July, a change for the Gibson from a PPA to a bill transfer agreement that was received in November. We also in 2023 filed for full ownership of Cavalry and Dunns Bridge. We received that in January of 2024. During this period, we've been evaluating our analysis on Fairbanks and Gibson, and we expect to be able to work through those final details at our analysis now and give a more fulsome update in Q2. But we would plan to have that update and roll that through as we complete that analysis."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Lloyd Yates",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm excited to be with you this morning to share outstanding financial results and to discuss the advancement of key business initiatives, which are devoted and talented workforce delivered to support our customers, communities and our shareholders across all of 2023. We began the year with a premium business plan represented by the value proposition you see on Slide 3. The bottom line is the NiSource team delivered. You'll notice successful execution of these key initiatives across the Board. Let me provide a few highlights, which fuel our resilient and sustaining business across all years of our plan. We executed our highest CapEx investment in 2023, exceeding our rate based investment goals. As of the year-end 2023, we had $18.8 billion of rate base. We continue to forecast $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion of capital expenditures in 2024 and $16 billion over our five-year financial plan through 2028. Year-over-year, NOEPS growth achieved 9% increase and achieved the highest end of our guidance range. We are acutely focused on smart capital deployment and maximizing risk adjusted returns and responsible rate-based investing through strong recovery mechanisms across our businesses. Project Apollo achieved this goal of over $50 million of cost savings initiatives. Perhaps more important than the amount of savings is the energy and support demonstrated by our people to build a continuous improvement mindset and enhance productivity by doing things safer, better, more efficiently and with less cost. These initiatives contributed greatly to a total shareholder return, which exceeded mid cap and large cap U.S. utility peers in 2023. For the three-year period, total shareholder return was 10.1% compound annual growth rate versus 5% per peers, which is reflective of our strong earnings per share execution and future growth prospects. We are confident our commitments are resilient to rapidly changing business conditions such as those seen by the utility industry over the last two years and which our financial results have delivered over this period. We continue building a track record of growth and execution, and our commitment to investors, customers, employees is central to everything we do. On Slide 4, you'll see our key priorities. First, as you observed in our release, we delivered 2023 non-GAAP EP \u2013 NOEPS of $1.60 versus the upper half of $1.54 to $1.60 revised guidance range. This underscores our execution of resilient financial commitments and a business plan which anticipated the broader headwinds our customers and our sector are facing today. This result was achieved despite a $128 million increase in interest expense and without sacrificing our FFO to debt commitment. Built on the strength of our infrastructure investment programs, we are raising 2024 guidance to $1.70 to $1.74 from $1.68 to $.72, which we initiated in November. We continue to expect a 2023 through 2028 annual EPS growth rate of 6% to 8%, supported by 8% to 10% annual rate-based growth. The 2024 guidance range is refreshed reflective of the annual growth expected up our strong year-end 2023 financial results. Second, our superior regulatory and stakeholder foundation differentiates us from peers. NIPSCO received IURC approval of renewable CPCN amendment for several of our investments in January. Intervener testimony was also received last month for our NIPSCO gas rate case filed in October 2023. Third, our balance sheet flexibility allows us to optimize cost of capital for customers and ultimate return on capital for shareholders. A key focus for 2023 was the NIPSCO minority interest transaction with Blackstone Infrastructure Partners, which successfully closed in December. This transaction diversified capital fundraising for NiSource from public capital markets and creates a long-term partnership for years to come. Fourth, our company is experiencing a record investment cycle driven by safety, reliability, regulation, decarbonization and modernization. Slide 5 details our annual capital expenditures across our six state service territory. Our $16 billion five-year plan was introduced in November 2023, built on and extended our prior November 2022, $15 billion plan. It incorporates electric generation, transmission, gas modernization and economic development investments through 2028. The nature of our capital plan diversifies project risk, including our generation project investments, which lack the large project execution risk on the scale seen elsewhere in the industry in recent years. We intend to layer in projects from our $2 billion upside capital program as they meet our threshold for base plan execution. Key rate case and capital rider activity is shown on Slide 6. Our leading regulatory and stakeholder execution advances as we continue to work with stakeholders through rate case and tracker cycles to efficiently deploy capital investments and recover cost associated with these investments to drive value for customers, our communities and our shareholders. The strength of our company continues to be working constructively with stakeholders and communities to safely and reliably deliver the energy they deserve and to be there for our customers when they need energy most. Since our last update, our Virginia SAVE Rider was approved and implemented and our Kentucky SMRP Rider went into effect subject to refund, together covering over $100 million of capital investment made for our customers. Slide 7 shows how our operational excellence model is incorporated into decision making in all areas of the company. Last year, we significantly improved safety performance by delivering a 14% reduction in Days Away Restricted or Transferred or DART, and are on a path to achieving a goal of top decile performance. Additionally, we recorded a 16% reduction in Preventable Vehicle Collisions, or PVC. As I already mentioned, Project Apollo is generating enhanced productivity by doing things safer, better, more efficiently and with less costs. The improvements in our work plans and cost profiles are expected to continue and sustain this year after an implementation that exceeded expectations in 2023. I have provided you with specific examples of project initiatives in recent quarters, but want to highlight the underlying cultural change occurring throughout the company. The team continues to find new ways to improve every day and this will generate value for all our stakeholders for decades. I am impressed with the continuous improvement mindset fueling our organization and I am excited for our teams as we continue this journey. Before we advance the call, I want to close this section with the following. I couldn't be more proud of our entire team and their devotion each and every day to support our nearly 4 million customers. With extreme cold weather across much of January, we delivered critical energy to keep our customers safe and warm. 2023 was a banner year for NiSource as the first full year of execution across our strategy shared in November 2022 and we deliver on all marks across the Board. This sets the foundation for continued growth in safety and reliability for our customers and value for our shareholders, which we strongly believe in. Michael and Shawn will dive into greater details on why 2023 was a successful year for our stakeholders, and also why 2024 and beyond will be even better. Now, I'll turn the call over to Michael. Good morning, Nick. Good morning, Shar. Yes, just to reinforce that. Shar, it's a great question, when we see signs from the business that will lead us to a different outcome. We've built a track record to flow those updates through this call. We've done so at various points. So we won't wait to give you greater insight once we have a higher degree of confidence of exactly where we're going to land within the range if we need to send that signal. But right now, 6% to 8% off of a strong 2023 year end is the plan. So, Melody, you want to talk about NIPSCO Gas case? Are you talking about \u2013 I'm sorry, Shar, NIPSCO \u2013 are you talking about the NIPSCO, current NIPSCO gas case or future electric? The way to think about the next electric case, Shar, is what we like to do is file that case, pretty much align with when we finish those renewable projects. And if you think about the last case, those renewable projects went in right before that case was executed. So I think we try to keep that gap really small. So that was to be dependent upon finishing those renewable projects. And right now they're on time and on schedule. We have more information about that. We'll file the electric case and we'll let you guys know that as soon as possible. So let me talk about it this way. I don't necessarily comment on any kind of specific M&A, but what I will say is, when you think about NiSource, we are always very diligently reviewing options to enhance shareholder value in our plan. But we're currently focused on our organic plan, investing $16 billion at one times rate base with another potential upside to invest another $2 billion. If you go back to 2022, we did a lot of work here in terms of our business review and we see a couple of things that we like, and that is the scale at NiSource has tremendous value and we like the diversification of our six operating companies. You also saw us last year raise capital via \u2013 but you all raise capital via the NIPSCO transaction, what we thought was a very efficient process with respect \u2013 very efficient tax process with respect to taxes. So with all that being said, what I'll say to you is, we are always looking to enhance shareholder value. And if we find an opportunity to raise capital more efficiently to improve our enterprise value, we plan to take advantage of it. But right now, we're focused on our organic plan. Melody, you want to handle that one? So before I close, I want to take a minute here to thank Donald Brown. Donald is our EVP and Chief Innovation Officer, our former CFO. And after nearly a decade with NiSource, Donald informed us that he'll be leaving the company to pursue other professional opportunities. I would say we're extremely grateful to Donald for his service to NiSource and for helping us build a strong financial foundation and to help us evolve and execute our transformation strategy. And we wish him well in his future endeavors. I want to thank all of you for great questions and your support of NiSource and look forward to continue to update you on future business activities. Thank you very much."

Joining me today are President and Chief Executive Officer, Lloyd Yates; Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Shawn Anderson; Executive Vice President of Strategy and Risk and Chief Commercial Officer; Michael Luhrs, Executive Vice President and Group President, NiSource Utilities, Melody Birmingham; and Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Randy Hulen. The purpose of this presentation is to review NiSource's financial performance for the third quarter of 2023 as well as provide an update on our operations and growth drivers. Following our prepared remarks, we'll open the call to your questions. Slides for today's call are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. We would like to remind you that some of the statements made during this presentation will be forward-looking. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. Information concerning such risks and uncertainties is included in the risk factors and MD&A sections of our periodic SEC filings. Additionally, some of the statements made on this call relate to non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the supplemental slides, segment information and full financial schedules for information on the most directly comparable GAAP measure and a reconciliation of these measures. I'd now like to turn the call over to Lloyd.\nLloyd Yates: Thanks, Chris. Good morning and thank you for joining us. I'll start with an overview of our value proposition on slide three. At year-end 2022, we had $16.6 billion of rate base deployed for our customers, and today are outlining a refreshed base plan to invest another nearly $16 billion of capital over the next five years. We plan to execute on our resilient financial commitments supported by a superior regulatory and stakeholder foundation and balance sheet flexibility. Assuming a constant PE ratio, our plan can deliver a total shareholder return of 10% to 12%. Slide four shows our four key priorities. First, today we are reiterating our expectation of achieving the upper half of our $1.54 to $1.60 EPS range this year. We are introducing 2024 EPS guidance of $1.68 to $1.72, over 8% growth midpoint to midpoint versus our current 2023 range. We are extending our 6% to 8% long-term EPS growth guidance to the 2023 to 28 period. This is supported by a five-year base capital plan of $16 billion and an 8% to 10% annual 2023 to 28 rate-based growth. We are confident our commitments are resilient to periods of rapidly changing business conditions such as those seen by the utility industry over the last 12 months. We continue building a track record of execution and growth, and our commitment to investors, employees, and customers is central to everything we do. Second, our superior regulatory and stakeholder foundation differentiates us from peers. In early August, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission approved NIPSCO's electric rate case settlement. This case represented the culmination of years of investment and stakeholder engagement, beginning with our 2018 integrated resource plan. In October, the public utility law judge of Maryland's recommendation to approve Columbia Gas of Maryland's rate case settlement became a final order. Last week, we filed a new gas general rate case in Indiana seeking recovery of $1.1 billion estimated cumulative investment to be completed through the end of 2024. Third, our balance sheet flexibility allows us to both optimize cost of capital for customers and ultimate return on capital for our shareholders. The transaction announced in June with Blackstone Infrastructure Partners is an example of the diverse funding sources embedded in our plan, raised at an attractive relative value while preserving the scale of our business. Fourth, our company is experiencing a record investment cycle driven by safety, reliability, regulatory mandates, decarbonization, and modernization. Investment is constrained primarily by normal operational constraints and our desire to manage the impact on customer bills. The surplus of investment opportunity puts us in a favorable position to prioritize the deployment of capital in the investments in jurisdictions generating the highest risk adjusted returns. Slide five details our annual capital expenditures across our six state service territory. In the five-year period through 2028, we plan to invest $16 billion. Every single one of these dollars is a real investment in our communities. For example, at Columbia Gas of Virginia, we replaced over 8,000 feet of main and over 10,000 feet of service line infrastructure as part of a $4 million investment in our system in the town of Culpeper. As part of this project, Columbia Gas updated several multimeter set and 130 individual customer connections, improving the quality and reliability of service to our customers within Culpeper County. Slide six shows key rate case and select capital rider activity since 2021. Our leading regulatory execution continues with no less than 10 cases filed in seven jurisdictions across six states during this period. Our state regulatory teams are in a constant cycle of communication and engagement with key interveners regulators and customer groups. In addition to general rate cases, regular capital tracker filings allow timely recovery on and of our investments. A dialogue with our Pennsylvania stakeholders starting late last year is an example of this. An approved long-term infrastructure improvement plan and the state is a prerequisite to recovering investments through a distractor. Columbia Gas, Pennsylvania sought the authority to replace infrastructure based on risks rather than a prior focus on bare steel and with a granted approval this spring. This change enables inclusion of an additional first generation assets such as first-generation plastic pipe for expedited replacement, enhancing the safety and reliability of our system. All of this activity is built on a foundation of robust economic activity for our states. Customer count across our territories has been growing on average by 0.5% to 1% annually for years, including 2023 to date. Favorable demographic trends have driven inbound migration, thanks to a stable and growing manufacturing base, robust utility and nonutility infrastructure and low tax rates in the states we serve. In Southwestern Pennsylvania, one of the largest titanium melting companies in the world have advanced plans for a planned expansion in our service territory. Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania engaged the business in the Department of Community and Economic Development to enable the extension of a gas infrastructure and support job creation and economic development in the region. Moreover, this extension will present greater access to low-cost natural gas throughout the surrounding community while enhancing energy diversification and energy resilience. Slide seven shows how our operational excellence model is incorporated into decision-making in all areas of the company. Project Apollo is on track, generating efficiencies by doing things safer, better, more efficiently and with less cost. This will keep non-tracked O&M flat through the duration of our 5-year plan. NiSource has continued to invest in technology that will drive risk reduction across gas and electric assets and increased customer value by ensuring reliable service, advanced mobile leak inspection is one example. Our historical practice of addressing leaks one by one is transforming into a process of clustering large-volume leaks into small replacement projects. This project brings visibility to large volume leaks and prioritization repair, reduces methane emissions and improve efficiency. We are focused on affordability for our customers every day. All of this is expected to contribute to keeping total customer bills in line with inflation over the 5-year financial plan. These achievements would not be possible with our dedicated employees and their commitment to our customers, communities and all ISO stakeholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Michael.\nMichael Luhrs: Thank you, Lloyd. I'll begin on Slide eight. NIPSCO's generation transition continues to advance as we optimize the new portfolio to benefit customers and retire all coal-fired generation by the end of 2028. Our first four renewable projects and the associated electric transmission are in service and represent approximately $1 billion of investment in economic, sustainable, zero fuel cost new generation for NIPSCO's Northern Indiana customers. Also, our Indiana Crossroads II wind PPA is advancing and is expected in service late this year. Construction on Calvary Solar and Storage and Dunns Bridge II Solar and Storage continues and both projects have expected in-service dates in 2024. The Fairbank Solar project is expected to be in service in 2025 and is in the early stages of construction. The Gibson project is also expected to be in service in 2025 and construction is anticipated to begin in early 2024. Our plans have included these four owned renewable projects under tax equity structures. However, based on our evaluation of the Inflation Reduction Act and the benefits to customers with tax credit monetization, we have filed a modification with the IURC for approval of full ownership of Calvary Solar and Storage and Dunns Bridge II Solar and Storage. Full ownership of these projects provide a lower cost to customers than tax equity supporting affordability and enhances our base plan. We continue to assume tax equity structures in our plan for the other two projects, Fairbanks and Gibson. However, we are actively evaluating the potential benefits to customers of inflation reduction act provisions related to these projects. NIPSCO has several generation-related filings under review at the IURC, a CPCN for conversion of the Gibson project into a BTA, a bill transfer agreement modification for Calvary and Dunns Bridge II filed in August, which includes the aforementioned customer beneficial proposal of switching to NIPSCO's full ownership of the projects instead of tax equity financing and a CPCN for our planned gas peaker project. In addition, NIPSCO has recently received orders approving several PPA projects, Apple Seed Solar, Templeton Wind and Carpenter Wind. For the gas peaker, in September, we filed a CPCN for an approximately 400-megawatt brownfield gas peaker project on our Schahfer site in Indiana. The project utilizes a combination of technologies, including aero derivatives for quick start capability and is a key enabler of our generation transition system performance and the full retirement of coal-fired generation by 2028. Our in-service renewable projects are performing in line with expectations and are reducing fuel costs for our customers. Since our first project went commercial in late 2020, we have been passing back both excess generation and renewable energy credits revenues to customers from this and subsequent projects. In the third quarter alone, this amount totaled $5.3 million for a year-to-date total of $19.9 million. As we look forward, Slide nine shows additional CapEx opportunities not included in our base financial plan through 2028. These include potential items such as continued employment of the IRA to benefit customers and reduce tax equity financing, long-term incremental generation investment opportunities, PHMSA gas infrastructure spending and multiple additional opportunities. The 2020 federal pipe back will require incremental investment in our system for various leak reduction, safety and other operational requirements. These requirements would build on the investments we have been making on our advanced leak detection and repair program. We will continue to be active in this area to support the best outcome for customers in terms of safety, emissions and infrastructure investment. The pipeline of opportunities listed on this page and the approximately $2 billion 2024 to 2028 upside CapEx opportunities continue to be evaluated to determine the most beneficial actions to deliver safe, reliable and cost-effective energy for our communities. As we look beyond 2028, we think a regulated gas and electric integrated utilities, such as NiSource has the potential to access even more investment. This is particularly true as we think about the landscape of further decarbonization. As Nascent technology develops into practical applications, NiSource will look to work these investments into our capital expenditure plans in a customer beneficial manner. These potential and current investments across our electric and gas business support our clean energy transition, further our Scope 1 emissions reduction goals and enhance customer value in a balanced way. In early October, we announced the launch of a multiphase hydrogen blending project. It is one of the first in the United States use a blending skid in a controlled setting to mix hydrogen and natural gas at precise levels. Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania partnered with EN Engineering to construct a skid at our training facility allowing for the controlled blending of hydrogen into our isolated and controlled natural gas system to blend levels ranging from 2% to 20% hydrogen. Throughout the blending project, NiSource will continue to evaluate the viability of hydrogen natural gas plans for other applications such as factories and power plants. As we consider the benefits and potential uses of hydrogen in the future, this project is one step that helps NiSource to determine the most beneficial and viable opportunities. Finally, last month, we issued our first sustainability report. For years, we have published an integrated annual report incorporating both financial and sustainability metrics. This year marks our first stand-alone report of key sustainability topics. The report details the incorporation of E, S and G policies throughout the organization and how these actions support and align with our mission, vision and values. I'm proud of the company-wide efforts captured in this report that demonstrate how we strengthen and support our communities through our business activities. And I encourage everyone with an interest in sustainability to review the report. I'll now turn things over to Shawn.\nShawn Anderson: Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Slide 10 reviews our financial results from the third quarter. Non-GAAP net operating earnings were $84 million or $0.19 per share compared to $45 million or $0.10 per share in the third quarter of 2022. Year-to-date results continue to track in line with our plan. Visibility from constructive regulatory outcomes and execution on O&M initiatives support our continued guidance to the upper half of the $1.54 to $1.60 EPS guidance provided last quarter. Turning to Slide 11, you'll find segment details and key drivers of our results. Gas Distribution operating earnings were $53 million in the third quarter an increase of $21 million versus the same quarter last year. New rates and capital investment programs drove $42 million of incremental revenue including general rate case contributions in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Virginia and Maryland. Capital trackers in Ohio, Kentucky and Virginia provided additional return of capital investment for the segment as well. Offsetting these revenue increases we're spending activities in non-tracked gas O&M for the quarter of $8 million and depreciation from infrastructure programs, which increased $14 million on a year-over-year basis. Electric operating earnings were $184 million in the third quarter, an increase of $69 million versus the same quarter last year. New rates as well as improved weather-normalized commercial and residential customer usage increased revenue by $7.3 million. Non-tracked electric O&M decreased $4 million, and depreciation increased $6 million. Lastly, Corporate and Other contributed $5 million due primarily to lower overall costs across several activities. Now I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile on Slide 12. Our debt level, as of September 30 was $13.3 billion, $11 billion of which was long-term debt with a weighted average maturity of 12 years and a weighted average interest rate of 3.9%. At the end of the third quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of $1 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility our accounts receivable securitization programs. All three credit agencies have affirmed NiSource ratings and outlooks for the year. We remain committed to our current investment-grade credit ratings and remain on track to achieve our stated 14% to 16% FFO to debt range for this year upon closing of the minority interest sale transaction by the end of 2023. Slide 13 details our refreshed long-term financial commitments. We are extending our 6 to 8 long-term EPS growth guidance to the 2023 to 2028 period. This is supported by a 5-year base capital plan of $16 billion, which fuels 8% to 10% annual 2023 to 2028 rate base growth. The enhanced base capital expenditure plan builds on our 5-year plan by switching from tax equity to full ownership of our next two renewables project in 2024. It also assumes additional capital for PHMSA-related gas infrastructure requirements and electric transmission investments in 2027 and 2028. These investments support incremental $1 billion of CapEx we have now moved into our base capital forecast over the next 5-year horizon. Additionally, we are highlighting $2 billion of upside CapEx not included in the base plan. As Michael indicated, this includes investments to switch from tax equity to full ownership for our last two renewables projects in 2025, long-term incremental generation investment opportunities, electric and gas distribution enhancement opportunities and PHMSA driven investments. We'll be sharing more about these upside capital expenditure opportunities as we engage with stakeholders and develop better line of sight to make these investments for our customers and we'll continue to update and guide our annual capital expenditures plans to reflect the full scope of activities NiSource is engaging upon to deliver safe and reliable service for our customers. Next, I'd like to focus on our financing plan and make four key points on Slide 14. First, we intend to remarket our equity units later this month for proceeds of $863 million. Second, this continues to be the only equity required in our base plan in 2023 and 2024, and is consistent with our prior financing plan for these years. Third, we expect to issue $200 million to $300 million of annual maintenance equity in the 2025 to 2028 periods using an ATM to maintain our capital structure and our current base case capital expenditures plan. Due to the strengthening of our balance sheet in 2023, we believe further enhancements to the capital plan and access to our upside CapEx and can be funded constructively by growth in cash from operations and requires minimal incremental equity from this base financing plan. Fourth, all of these financing costs have been included in our guidance ranges and continue to be reflected fully in the growth rate of our business, which we have projected today. This plan supports both an annual 6% to 8% NOEPS growth rate and 14% to 16% FFO to debt annually for 2023 and the entire 2024 to 2028 period reflected in this planned refresh. As we sit here today, we've been able to increase our capital plan by $1 billion compared to the plan a year ago, while requiring limited incremental equity. This is due in part to higher expected deferred taxes driven by larger solar CapEx and the full ownership of select assets, generating more accelerated depreciation as well as modest amounts of tax transferability proceeds and some timing associated with monetization of credits. One final note on this slide. While the financing plan shared on Slide 14 is projected to support the $16 billion base capital plan. We expect minimal changes when we access capital investment opportunities within the upside plan. This is due in part to the strengthening of the balance sheet projected to be executed in 2023. These activities as well as improvements in cash from operations as a result of selecting those investments continue to support our commitment for all years of our plan to remain within the 14% to 16% FFO to debt which we are positioned to deliver upon once we close the minority sale transaction at NIPSCO this year. I also want to be clear that the NiSource team has been and will continue to be thoughtful about the risks of elevated leverage. One year ago, we recognized the value of financing flexibility and diversity of capital and announced our intention to proceed with an alternative source of financing via our NIPSCO minority transaction. Capital markets remain volatile and expensive versus historical levels for both utility equity and debt. Our base plan continues to carefully take these risks into consideration and builds in balance sheet flexibility, cushion and realistic financing assumptions accordingly. We've also updated our plan to reflect the current interest rate environment, which extends the higher short-term interest rate longer into our planned horizon than before and reflects the current outlook of the credit curve for our projected long-term debt issuances. I'll conclude on Slide 15. Today, we introduced a refreshed long-term financial plan that builds and enhances upon the prior 5-year plan introduced this time last year. Since our Investor Day in 2022 and in just one year, we have outperformed our 2022 NOEPS guidance range by exceeding our $1.44 to $1.46. And with actual NOEPS of $1.47. We've enhanced our 2023 NOEPS guidance range from $1.50 to $1.57. And up to the upper half of $1.54 to $1.60. We've received approval for an agreement to raise $2.15 billion of diversified capital while preserving the scale of our business for our customers' benefit. We've enhanced our projected capital expenditures outlook by $1 billion and we've identified $2 billion more of capital expenditures, we believe, are important to delivering safe and reliable energy for our communities. We continue building a track record of execution and growth, and our commitment to investors, employees and customers is central to everything we do. We'd now like to open up the line for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Shah Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.\nJamieson Ward: Good morning. It's Jamieson Ward on for Shah. Just building on your prepared remarks, as we think about the four remaining renewable projects at NIPSCO, the potential to replace tax equity with increased ownership, you obviously mentioned having filed the two and then day two you hadn't yet. As we think particularly about the amount, which is not already part of the base capital plan, could you remind us of how we should think about how much capital at a high level that could represent?\nLloyd Yates: Michael Luhrs will handle that question, Mike.\nMichael Luhrs: Yes. So thank you. So when we think about the remaining two projects, as you mentioned, the first two associated with Calvary and Dunns Bridge have been included, and we evaluated that and filed to that from the tax transferability. We continue to evaluate the second two. And if those are customer beneficial, then we'll look at how to move forward with those. But effectively, you would be looking in a neighborhood of about $400 million of incremental capital associated with those projects. If they were to be included under full ownership with tax transferability.\nJamieson Ward: Got it. Perfect. Thank you. And second question, to bring some concerns and rumblings out there among some -- we've been seeing some supply chain issues to do with renewables. Specifically, have you guys been seeing any issues in terms of getting panels from the two developers that you're working with?\nMichael Luhrs: So at this point in time, honestly, we feel very strong and confident in our dates and in-service dates with our projects, and we think that's evidenced by how we brought the recent projects into schedule. I think there were a lot of benefits to us in how we exercise the generation transition earlier and plan for that. And at this point, we do not see significant supply disruptions. We do pay attention to that. We are always wary of it. There continues to be the need for long lead time equipment with certain items, but we've addressed those.\nJamieson Ward: Perfect. That\u2019s all I have. Thank you very much. And looking forward to seeing you guys at the EI [Ph] in a couple of weeks.\nMichael Luhrs: Thank you. You too.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey good morning, team. Thanks for giving me time. Michael, just staying on the topic of those -- the tax equity versus rate base. Maybe can you just give us a little bit of color because I think there's an important point for the industry as a whole? What -- I mean you went ahead with the two projects, two projects you were kind of evaluate. Is there any difference project by project as we think about tax equity versus rate base ownership, is the tax equity market more tighter now? Just anything that you can share there because I think that's going to be really important as we move forward with IRA as companies choose rate basing versus tax equity.\nMichael Luhrs: So what I would say is, fundamentally, when you look at the benefits of the IRA and what we determined with the first two projects is that it produced significant additional benefits for customer costs. Both in the near term and in the long-term over the project. So we felt very comfortable, and we know that they provide a lot of benefit to customers, and that's why we filed for full ownership with them. There are always differences associated with projects relative to what the capacity factors of them are depending on the region. There's always differences associated with them. Some of our projects include storage versus not. That changes the different tax credits with those projects. What I would say is that we continue to evaluate those projects, the remaining two under the tax transferability provision. And provide that customer benefit opportunity, then we'll look at how to move forward with those. But we're going to go through it in a very methodical and disciplined fashion to make sure that we know it provides the best benefit to all stakeholders.\nDurgesh Chopra: That's helpful color. I appreciate it. And then maybe just -- I think this will be in Shawn's view of the house. But on the remarketing, Shawn, like what are you assuming in your 2024 EPS guidance, I know it\u2019s small, but are you assuming remarketing that's part one. And then the language includes 200 in your slide that includes $200 million to $300 million equity with or without the remarketing. So the question is if you're not going to remarket how you're placing that equity content.\nShawn Anderson: Yes. Thanks, Durgesh. Appreciate the question. So first and foremost, all of our guidance range for all years of the plan reflect the full cost of financing, which is inclusive of all of the equity that we've shared, I think, on Slide 14. And all of our financing plan has always contemplated a full marketing in the placement of the $863 million effectively raising those proceeds here in 2023. That continues to be our assumption as we move forward. That positions our balance sheet such that we are in the 14% to 16% range for all years of the plan. But more specifically, the minority sale process concluding and closing by the end of 2023 positions us in that range. So the second half of your question is related to what if the units are not remarketing. And we have a lot of flexibility then in that scenario, both in the timing of raising the equity as well as spending our capital expenditures plan. Therefore, we've got flexibility within the 14% to 16% range should that not actually execute.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. Thank you Shawn. I appreciate the time.\nShawn Anderson: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Richard Sunderland with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRichard Sunderland: Hi, good morning. Can you hear me?\nLloyd Yates: We can hear you fine, good morning.\nRichard Sunderland: Great, thank you. Close out the Fairbanks and Gibson discussion. Just what's the rough time line for a final decision on those projects in terms of ownership structure?\nLloyd Yates: So the IURC doesn't have an extended time line to make that decision. We believe and hope that we'll get a decision from them sometime early next year.\nUnidentified Company Representative: With Calvary and Dunns Bridge. For Fairbanks and Gibson upon that decision associated with Calvary and Dunns Bridge, we would expect to be done with the analysis on Fairbanks and Gibson roughly in that time frame. And then take the next steps forward associated with it.\nRichard Sunderland: Got it. Understood. One, I guess, additional points on the outlook update here in sort of the gas price assumptions? I know this is a point of emphasis last year in terms of that customer bill impact and keeping rates at a moderate level. How much of the year-over-year gas price help did you roll into this plan? Is there still cushion relative to assumptions a year ago that help on the kind of upside CapEx from ex this generation discussion?\nLloyd Yates: Let me -- when we built the plan and rolled out at Investor Day in 2022, when we use market curve on natural gas. We did not assume that gas would be $2 to $3 a million BTU. We are still assuming that same market curve in the plan that we have. So I don't characterize that as cushion. We manage that. We don't build. So we didn't build a plan piling in excess capital because we're assuming gas prices are going to stay at $2 to $3. Our land is built on gas prices, whatever the market curve I think its $4 to $5.\nShawn Anderson: Sustaining $4, that's right.\nLloyd Yates: $4 curve.\nRichard Sunderland: Got it. And so just to put a bow on kind of the incremental capital and how to think about layering that in -- is this an ongoing effort where over the next few quarters, we could see some of that come into the plan. Or is this more about annual refreshes and kind of the bucket that could be additive versus base CapEx as it stands today?\nLloyd Yates: I would say both as we look at incremental capital opportunities. Now when they come to fruition when we do the analysis and we understand them in terms of customer benefit, shareholder benefit, ability to execute accretion the plan for shareholders, then we'll layer those plans and whether that's on a quarter-by-quarter basis, we'll take advantage on the quarterly opportunity. And then we'll also refresh our capital plans annually to reflect those incremental opportunities.\nRichard Sunderland: Got it. Very helpful. Then sorry, one final quick one for me. The NIPSCO transaction with Blackstone, just some of the qualitative synergies there, if there's any upside potential that might come in Indiana territory as a result.\nLloyd Yates: Shawn, do you want to take that one?\nShawn Anderson: Yes, absolutely. We've found the partnership with Blackstone, even before we've closed here as very robust. They're very thoughtful, considerate, executors around capital as well as understanding infrastructure and just the global landscape. They brought ideas to the table that we've already partnered with Mike Cooper, our President in Indiana and the Indiana team more broadly to try and evaluate how we can benefit the state of Indiana, from this partnership. And that's mostly in the vein of economic development, on shoring, increasing manufacturing, potential for data centers, increasing NIPSCO's load. But more specifically, bringing jobs and broader tax base to the State of Indiana. And Blackstone has brought a lot of ideas to the table on that already, and we're looking forward to continuing to action those and bringing some of those into fruition.\nRichard Sunderland: Wonderful. Thanks for the time today.\nShawn Anderson: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont with Ladenburg. Please go ahead.\nPaul Fremont: Hi, thank you and congratulations on the additional capital spend. You mentioned $400 million for Fairbanks and Gibson, how much CapEx is associated with Calvary and Dunns Bridge?\nLloyd Yates: Michael?\nMichael Luhrs: So when you look at the incremental $1 billion that Shawn mentioned, approximately $500 million is associated with Calvary and Dunns Bridge for the tax transferability, and that's simply going to the full ownership of those projects.\nPaul Fremont: Right. So for the 24 through 27 period, it looks like your capital spend went up by about $1.150 billion. So I guess what makes up the additional spend?\nMichael Luhrs: Yes. So when you look at the elements between that, I mean, some of that, if you're looking specifically at the generation projects. I mean some of that, honestly, is just rounding associated with it. And then we did have some general modifications with the projects. But then when you look at the other capital opportunities on top of that, Shawn, I'll let you.\nShawn Anderson: Yes, sure. The incremental MISO transmission projects are a portion of this becoming part of the plan in the middle of the year -- middle of the decade really earlier than what we previously had shared and modeled those were part of the road for change in legislation that we saw come through in May of 2023 and part of Tranche 1 that MISO had handed down for execution. We also see incremental gas modernization in PHMSA work and a little bit more work necessary for us to ensure electric resiliency. Most of that is towards the back half of this decade.\nPaul Fremont: Great. And then it looks like there is some delay in -- on the gas side in terms of your spending, it's like less spending, I think, in 25, but a lot of that looks like it's moved out to 27.\nShawn Anderson: We're just moving capital projects associated with the regulatory time lines that our jurisdictions are supporting for their programmatic investment. But I don't think that's a significant shift nor an indication of change in investment thesis.\nLloyd Yates: Yes, and to add to that, I think that is also a shift in our development of workforce and aligning our contractors and employees to make sure we can execute that work effectively and efficiently.\nPaul Fremont: And then last question for me. When I think about any spend that's incremental to now what's in your base CapEx, can you give us a sense of the percent of that incremental investment that would be supported by equity.\nShawn Anderson: We've not disclosed the specific percentage associated with that, but we reiterate that we believe it would be a modest change to the Slide 14 that we laid out today. And the main reason for that really is the execution of the minority interest sale process in 2023 and really all financing in 2023, which has strengthened our balance sheet such that incremental capital expenditures can flow through more accretively than when we had otherwise not had a strengthened balance sheet. All of the incremental capital expenditures are 100% regulated investments. That means they will grow cash from operations. So on the left-hand side of that slide, you'll see cash from operations flow in that will help to support some of the financing costs otherwise. And then also a portion of these investments will hopefully continue to benefit from the provisions established in the IRA as we develop more solar assets and provide additional favorable tax treatment for NiSource and its customers.\nPaul Fremont: And for 2024, where within sort of the 14% to 16% FFO to debt, would you land without incremental sort of CapEx?\nShawn Anderson: Well, two quick points on that. First off, we don't see any material incremental CapEx in 2024 from the upside plan at this time, which also means that our 2024 financing plan is materially unchanged in all scenarios. Which again assumes no equity issued in 2024 after closing the NIPSCO minority sale transaction as well as the equity units for marketing transaction, both here and fourth quarter of 2023. Further from that, we've not indicated a point estimate. However, I'd say that all years of our plan are within the 14% to 16% FFO to debt range inclusive of 2023 at the conclusion of those transactions.\nPaul Fremont: Okay, great. That\u2019s it. Thank you very much.\nShawn Anderson: Thank you. Appreciate your questions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar. Please go ahead.\nTravis Miller: Thank you. Good morning.\nShawn Anderson: Good morning, Travis.\nTravis Miller: You just answered several of my questions on the CapEx, but I'll put one more out there that adding that 2028 at the same level as 2027. Does that still support the 8% to 10% when we get out to that year-over-year 2027, 2028? Or do you need some of that $2 billion to get to that 8% to 10% rate base? Growth in 2028.\nShawn Anderson: Yes, at this point, it does the base plan still supports the 8% to 10% annual rate base growth. And certainly, we'll continue to evaluate potential for more investment if it's out there.\nTravis Miller: Okay. So there's enough growth in that 2.9% to 3.2 to support there.\nShawn Anderson: That is -- correct.\nTravis Miller: Okay. As part of that financing plan, you have that 10% to 12% total shareholder return. What are your thoughts within that in terms of dividend growth? I know you haven't put it explicitly like you have before, but still at 6% to 7% that growth number?\nShawn Anderson: We'll continue to stay within the 60% to 70% payout ratio, and that's how I would mark the dividend within the 10% to 12% as well as we've assumed a flat PE in our plan just in terms of financing assumptions, we've basically marked our PE in the financing side of things here in October and kept it flat for the duration of the plan.\nTravis Miller: Okay. Okay. And then one more. In terms of the financing, we've seen a couple across the industry, a couple of sales, gas sales, utility sales comps here since you guys last were out in the market. What are your thoughts on the valuations there? It appears they might be more attractive than issuing your straight market equity? Is that something you'll consider as part of the financing plan?\nLloyd Yates: So right now, when we look at our financing plan, we look at our investment windows down the road. We don't think we need to exercise any sales with LDCs. We think we can stay within our 14% to 16% FFO to debt. We think we can grow the business 6% to 8% a year and pay a dividend at 67% payout ratio. So we don't see a knee to sell LDCs. We like the scale of the LDCs. We like our jurisdiction. We think they're really constructive, and we think we have a great organic growth plan.\nShawn Anderson: I'll just add to that real briefly that we still believe in this inflationary environment that stakeholders benefit from the scale of the NiSource assets as constructed today. When you look at robust capital visionary environments, we're able to hold O&M flat and take advantage of a lot of investment opportunity, translating that across the scale of our business. And by getting smaller, it does have an impact to customer affordability that we watch and are considerate of.\nTravis Miller: Okay, got it. And then one real quick one, is there storage opportunities at the other solar sites that you could add?\nLloyd Yates: So we are actually going through a refresh of the IRP in 2024 and we are evaluating, we know that the IRP indicates that storage would be beneficial to the system and are looking at that within the future plan. And yes, we will evaluate whether or not at the other solar site would be beneficial to ask from.\nTravis Miller: Okay, great. Thanks so much. Appreciate the answers.\nLloyd Yates: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Aditya Gandhi with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nAditya Gandhi: Hi, good morning, Lloyd, Shawn, Michael. Can you hear me?\nLloyd Yates: Good morning. Loud and clear.\nAditya Gandhi: Good morning. Shawn, just a question for you on the ATM. You mentioned that you're now expecting higher default taxes. Can you just remind us what assumptions you're making around your cash taxpayer status in the plan, please?\nShawn Anderson: Yes, great question. Relative to the prior plan, we've seen a flip in our taxpayer status from the beginning of 2025 to outside of our current plan horizon. This is driven by a host of assumptions associated with the IRA, but predominantly linked to higher ownership of solar assets. So while there's a number of assumptions that link to this, the net impact is less cash utilization for tax payments than previously projected, which enables more capital assets across our plan without incremental equity financing.\nAditya Gandhi: Got it. Got it. Thank you for clarifying that. And my second question is sort of more high level. So when you all came out with your 2022 analyst day plan last year, gas prices were much higher. Those have moved lower. Rates have moved higher since but not try higher. And you've now added $1billion of more CapEx to your plan. There's been good regulatory outcomes and execution on the O&M side as well. Just how do you feel about where you're tracking within your 6% to 8% long-term?\nShawn Anderson: Well, there's no change to the 6% to 8% long-term, we still believe strongly that an annual 6% to 8% OEPS growth range is feasible with this plan, most notably due to the programmatic nature of the investments themselves, how they flow through the regulatory mechanize and then the line of sight we have through trackers and otherwise to be able to recover those accordingly. This plan refresh does incorporate updated guidance around short and long-term interest rates. So it does flow in what we're seeing in the current marketplace. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, sustaining that longer at the plan horizon than previously. All of that's refreshed here as we sit here today. Commodity prices as well are effectively flat.\nLloyd Yates: And I think with those commodity prices and that 6% to 8% EPS growth plan we think we also can effectively manage customer affordability in that realm to the point where we can grow for the very long term as opposed to open the capital and increasing customer rates. We believe that there's a regulatory sensitivity here that we need to manage around customer affordability, and we're very focused on that.\nAditya Gandhi: Got it. Thank you. That\u2019s all I have. Thanks for taking my questions.\nLloyd Yates: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey good morning team. It's Julien Dumoulin-Smith. Not sure what happened there with our dial-in. But good morning, guys. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Look, we wanted to follow up on a couple of items here. First, just look, let's just talk about timing of these various incremental factors here. You talk about these upsides, can we lay out a little bit of the cadence through 2024 and when we could see some of those? I heard you say earlier, IURC on these two incremental projects for conversion to tax credit transferability that's in the first half of the year. Then as we layer in later in the year, you've got a few other pieces, I imagine. As best I understood your comments? And then could we get some updates on the IRP towards the end of the year? I just want to make sure I understand like how these individual data points filter out to getting visibility of that $2 billion. And then if I can, just a further detail on the FFO translation. To the extent that you do get that $400 million uplift here in spend through the pivot away from tax equity. How do you think about the corresponding FFO to debt impact just on tax transferability given the ability to monetize an FFO? Just to clarify that out a little bit, Shawn.\nLloyd Yates: So let's take those one at a time. Michael why don\u2019t you start with the IRP and some of the generation opportunities.\nMichael Luhrs: Yes. So with the generation opportunities in the IRP and even when we talk about potential upside associated with the plan, as I mentioned before, we're working through those in a very methodical and disciplined fashion. Later, I already mentioned with Calvary and Dunns Bridge that we expect something from an IURC in the first part of the year. By that point in time, we would expect to have our analysis associated with Fairbanks and Gibson to be complete and ensuring that it's beneficial to customers. So that's -- in that rough time frame, we wouldn't be expecting to see an update on that analysis. We are working through the IRP refresh in 2024, the IRP refresh wouldn't be towards the latter half of the year associated with it. That will include looking at what we need associated with the pipeline for what's already been mentioned around batteries, additional storage at other solar facilities, additional generation that may be needed relative to the plan from what we're seeing in either economic development or low growth in the areas but that would be more towards the latter part of the year.\nLloyd Yates: Okay. Shawn, do you want to talk about the FFO to debt impact?\nShawn Anderson: Yes. I think it's all incorporated Julien, the 14% to 16% annual guidance rate that we've provided around FFO to debt. So the net result of that is associated with higher deferred taxes, lower cash taxes paid and some slight timing around the monetization of these credits. Although we expect the credit to be passed back to customers in full. Therefore, that might be a timing issue more so than it is any one long sustaining benefit to the FFO to debt metric itself. One other change that occurs through the concept of full ownership and the concept of tax equity, we're able to retain the full tax attributes of a portion of those projects, particularly these two projects that we're moving forward with discussions with the IURC upon such that we retain all those tax attributes, our prior modeling, as you would have expected, would have had all those tax attributes delivered to a tax equity partner. So net-net, that provides us additional tax attributes that are beneficial for the plan.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Yes, absolutely. I appreciate it. Well, look. And then PHMSA, just what's the time line there, just to go back to the kind of the cadence of things very quickly. I mean, I know that you guys see these big financial updates, call it, once a year around this time. I just -- is that going to be -- you talked about still having some of this resolved, some of it's still ongoing. That's a next year this time kind of update as well? Just to clarify that last piece.\nLloyd Yates: Yes, I believe by time, we understand the full impact of the PHMSA rule, we'll roll that into next year's financial plan. It is a big role with a lot in terms of -- but I think the focus is making the gas distribution system safer, significant reduction in methane leakage and replacing some of the first-generation piping. So I think we'll understand that better later this year or early next year.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Alright, guys. Thank you very much. Have a great day.\nLloyd Yates: Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to the NiSource team for closing remarks.\nLloyd Yates: There's two things here. Well, let me close and turn it over to Shawn. And I just want to -- we have a really strong team. We have an organization now excited about a plan that we believe is executable significantly derisked. We have a long tail of investment with an organization focused on operational excellence, customer affordability and effective regulatory and legislative relationships along with great financial discipline. So we're excited about where we're going. And I appreciate your question, Shawn.\nShawn Anderson: Appreciate that. Before concluding our call, I just wanted to share some retirement news that we will release this afternoon. It's a distinct honor for me to announce the intention of Randy Hulen, our Head of Investor Relations and Treasury to retire from NiSource at year-end. As many of you know, Randy has been an integral part of NiSource for nearly three decades. His leadership has been invaluable to this company. It's transformed us from the companies we've been to the premium utility that we are today. And it's without question that he's left a positive mark on NiSource. And we're so fortunate to have had him at the helm and finance over the period of time we have. On a personal level, Randy has contributed tirelessly to the success of the NiSource franchise over his many years of service. And it's without question that NiSource is a stronger company as a result of his leadership in so many capacities I am grateful for all that Randy has done to help shape our organization, particularly in the eyes of our investors. While we will miss Randy's ongoing leadership at NiSource, we are excited to announce that Tchapo Napoe will be joining NiSource as VP of Treasury and Corporate Finance; and Chris Turnure will be elevated the Head of Investor Relations. Both Tchapo and Chris brings a significant amount of industry expertise and experience and will be solid leaders in NiSource going forward. With that, thank you all for joining us today, and have a safe rest of the day.\nOperator: I would like to thank our speakers for today's presentation, and thank you all for joining us. This now concludes today's call, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Shawn Anderson",
            "content": "Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Slide 10 reviews our financial results from the third quarter. Non-GAAP net operating earnings were $84 million or $0.19 per share compared to $45 million or $0.10 per share in the third quarter of 2022. Year-to-date results continue to track in line with our plan. Visibility from constructive regulatory outcomes and execution on O&M initiatives support our continued guidance to the upper half of the $1.54 to $1.60 EPS guidance provided last quarter. Turning to Slide 11, you'll find segment details and key drivers of our results. Gas Distribution operating earnings were $53 million in the third quarter an increase of $21 million versus the same quarter last year. New rates and capital investment programs drove $42 million of incremental revenue including general rate case contributions in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Virginia and Maryland. Capital trackers in Ohio, Kentucky and Virginia provided additional return of capital investment for the segment as well. Offsetting these revenue increases we're spending activities in non-tracked gas O&M for the quarter of $8 million and depreciation from infrastructure programs, which increased $14 million on a year-over-year basis. Electric operating earnings were $184 million in the third quarter, an increase of $69 million versus the same quarter last year. New rates as well as improved weather-normalized commercial and residential customer usage increased revenue by $7.3 million. Non-tracked electric O&M decreased $4 million, and depreciation increased $6 million. Lastly, Corporate and Other contributed $5 million due primarily to lower overall costs across several activities. Now I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile on Slide 12. Our debt level, as of September 30 was $13.3 billion, $11 billion of which was long-term debt with a weighted average maturity of 12 years and a weighted average interest rate of 3.9%. At the end of the third quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of $1 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility our accounts receivable securitization programs. All three credit agencies have affirmed NiSource ratings and outlooks for the year. We remain committed to our current investment-grade credit ratings and remain on track to achieve our stated 14% to 16% FFO to debt range for this year upon closing of the minority interest sale transaction by the end of 2023. Slide 13 details our refreshed long-term financial commitments. We are extending our 6 to 8 long-term EPS growth guidance to the 2023 to 2028 period. This is supported by a 5-year base capital plan of $16 billion, which fuels 8% to 10% annual 2023 to 2028 rate base growth. The enhanced base capital expenditure plan builds on our 5-year plan by switching from tax equity to full ownership of our next two renewables project in 2024. It also assumes additional capital for PHMSA-related gas infrastructure requirements and electric transmission investments in 2027 and 2028. These investments support incremental $1 billion of CapEx we have now moved into our base capital forecast over the next 5-year horizon. Additionally, we are highlighting $2 billion of upside CapEx not included in the base plan. As Michael indicated, this includes investments to switch from tax equity to full ownership for our last two renewables projects in 2025, long-term incremental generation investment opportunities, electric and gas distribution enhancement opportunities and PHMSA driven investments. We'll be sharing more about these upside capital expenditure opportunities as we engage with stakeholders and develop better line of sight to make these investments for our customers and we'll continue to update and guide our annual capital expenditures plans to reflect the full scope of activities NiSource is engaging upon to deliver safe and reliable service for our customers. Next, I'd like to focus on our financing plan and make four key points on Slide 14. First, we intend to remarket our equity units later this month for proceeds of $863 million. Second, this continues to be the only equity required in our base plan in 2023 and 2024, and is consistent with our prior financing plan for these years. Third, we expect to issue $200 million to $300 million of annual maintenance equity in the 2025 to 2028 periods using an ATM to maintain our capital structure and our current base case capital expenditures plan. Due to the strengthening of our balance sheet in 2023, we believe further enhancements to the capital plan and access to our upside CapEx and can be funded constructively by growth in cash from operations and requires minimal incremental equity from this base financing plan. Fourth, all of these financing costs have been included in our guidance ranges and continue to be reflected fully in the growth rate of our business, which we have projected today. This plan supports both an annual 6% to 8% NOEPS growth rate and 14% to 16% FFO to debt annually for 2023 and the entire 2024 to 2028 period reflected in this planned refresh. As we sit here today, we've been able to increase our capital plan by $1 billion compared to the plan a year ago, while requiring limited incremental equity. This is due in part to higher expected deferred taxes driven by larger solar CapEx and the full ownership of select assets, generating more accelerated depreciation as well as modest amounts of tax transferability proceeds and some timing associated with monetization of credits. One final note on this slide. While the financing plan shared on Slide 14 is projected to support the $16 billion base capital plan. We expect minimal changes when we access capital investment opportunities within the upside plan. This is due in part to the strengthening of the balance sheet projected to be executed in 2023. These activities as well as improvements in cash from operations as a result of selecting those investments continue to support our commitment for all years of our plan to remain within the 14% to 16% FFO to debt which we are positioned to deliver upon once we close the minority sale transaction at NIPSCO this year. I also want to be clear that the NiSource team has been and will continue to be thoughtful about the risks of elevated leverage. One year ago, we recognized the value of financing flexibility and diversity of capital and announced our intention to proceed with an alternative source of financing via our NIPSCO minority transaction. Capital markets remain volatile and expensive versus historical levels for both utility equity and debt. Our base plan continues to carefully take these risks into consideration and builds in balance sheet flexibility, cushion and realistic financing assumptions accordingly. We've also updated our plan to reflect the current interest rate environment, which extends the higher short-term interest rate longer into our planned horizon than before and reflects the current outlook of the credit curve for our projected long-term debt issuances. I'll conclude on Slide 15. Today, we introduced a refreshed long-term financial plan that builds and enhances upon the prior 5-year plan introduced this time last year. Since our Investor Day in 2022 and in just one year, we have outperformed our 2022 NOEPS guidance range by exceeding our $1.44 to $1.46. And with actual NOEPS of $1.47. We've enhanced our 2023 NOEPS guidance range from $1.50 to $1.57. And up to the upper half of $1.54 to $1.60. We've received approval for an agreement to raise $2.15 billion of diversified capital while preserving the scale of our business for our customers' benefit. We've enhanced our projected capital expenditures outlook by $1 billion and we've identified $2 billion more of capital expenditures, we believe, are important to delivering safe and reliable energy for our communities. We continue building a track record of execution and growth, and our commitment to investors, employees and customers is central to everything we do. We'd now like to open up the line for your questions. Yes. Thanks, Durgesh. Appreciate the question. So first and foremost, all of our guidance range for all years of the plan reflect the full cost of financing, which is inclusive of all of the equity that we've shared, I think, on Slide 14. And all of our financing plan has always contemplated a full marketing in the placement of the $863 million effectively raising those proceeds here in 2023. That continues to be our assumption as we move forward. That positions our balance sheet such that we are in the 14% to 16% range for all years of the plan. But more specifically, the minority sale process concluding and closing by the end of 2023 positions us in that range. So the second half of your question is related to what if the units are not remarketing. And we have a lot of flexibility then in that scenario, both in the timing of raising the equity as well as spending our capital expenditures plan. Therefore, we've got flexibility within the 14% to 16% range should that not actually execute. Thank you. Sustaining $4, that's right. Yes, absolutely. We've found the partnership with Blackstone, even before we've closed here as very robust. They're very thoughtful, considerate, executors around capital as well as understanding infrastructure and just the global landscape. They brought ideas to the table that we've already partnered with Mike Cooper, our President in Indiana and the Indiana team more broadly to try and evaluate how we can benefit the state of Indiana, from this partnership. And that's mostly in the vein of economic development, on shoring, increasing manufacturing, potential for data centers, increasing NIPSCO's load. But more specifically, bringing jobs and broader tax base to the State of Indiana. And Blackstone has brought a lot of ideas to the table on that already, and we're looking forward to continuing to action those and bringing some of those into fruition. Thank you. Yes, sure. The incremental MISO transmission projects are a portion of this becoming part of the plan in the middle of the year -- middle of the decade really earlier than what we previously had shared and modeled those were part of the road for change in legislation that we saw come through in May of 2023 and part of Tranche 1 that MISO had handed down for execution. We also see incremental gas modernization in PHMSA work and a little bit more work necessary for us to ensure electric resiliency. Most of that is towards the back half of this decade. We're just moving capital projects associated with the regulatory time lines that our jurisdictions are supporting for their programmatic investment. But I don't think that's a significant shift nor an indication of change in investment thesis. We've not disclosed the specific percentage associated with that, but we reiterate that we believe it would be a modest change to the Slide 14 that we laid out today. And the main reason for that really is the execution of the minority interest sale process in 2023 and really all financing in 2023, which has strengthened our balance sheet such that incremental capital expenditures can flow through more accretively than when we had otherwise not had a strengthened balance sheet. All of the incremental capital expenditures are 100% regulated investments. That means they will grow cash from operations. So on the left-hand side of that slide, you'll see cash from operations flow in that will help to support some of the financing costs otherwise. And then also a portion of these investments will hopefully continue to benefit from the provisions established in the IRA as we develop more solar assets and provide additional favorable tax treatment for NiSource and its customers. Well, two quick points on that. First off, we don't see any material incremental CapEx in 2024 from the upside plan at this time, which also means that our 2024 financing plan is materially unchanged in all scenarios. Which again assumes no equity issued in 2024 after closing the NIPSCO minority sale transaction as well as the equity units for marketing transaction, both here and fourth quarter of 2023. Further from that, we've not indicated a point estimate. However, I'd say that all years of our plan are within the 14% to 16% FFO to debt range inclusive of 2023 at the conclusion of those transactions. Thank you. Appreciate your questions. Good morning, Travis. Yes, at this point, it does the base plan still supports the 8% to 10% annual rate base growth. And certainly, we'll continue to evaluate potential for more investment if it's out there. That is -- correct. We'll continue to stay within the 60% to 70% payout ratio, and that's how I would mark the dividend within the 10% to 12% as well as we've assumed a flat PE in our plan just in terms of financing assumptions, we've basically marked our PE in the financing side of things here in October and kept it flat for the duration of the plan. I'll just add to that real briefly that we still believe in this inflationary environment that stakeholders benefit from the scale of the NiSource assets as constructed today. When you look at robust capital visionary environments, we're able to hold O&M flat and take advantage of a lot of investment opportunity, translating that across the scale of our business. And by getting smaller, it does have an impact to customer affordability that we watch and are considerate of. Yes, great question. Relative to the prior plan, we've seen a flip in our taxpayer status from the beginning of 2025 to outside of our current plan horizon. This is driven by a host of assumptions associated with the IRA, but predominantly linked to higher ownership of solar assets. So while there's a number of assumptions that link to this, the net impact is less cash utilization for tax payments than previously projected, which enables more capital assets across our plan without incremental equity financing. Well, there's no change to the 6% to 8% long-term, we still believe strongly that an annual 6% to 8% OEPS growth range is feasible with this plan, most notably due to the programmatic nature of the investments themselves, how they flow through the regulatory mechanize and then the line of sight we have through trackers and otherwise to be able to recover those accordingly. This plan refresh does incorporate updated guidance around short and long-term interest rates. So it does flow in what we're seeing in the current marketplace. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, sustaining that longer at the plan horizon than previously. All of that's refreshed here as we sit here today. Commodity prices as well are effectively flat. Yes. I think it's all incorporated Julien, the 14% to 16% annual guidance rate that we've provided around FFO to debt. So the net result of that is associated with higher deferred taxes, lower cash taxes paid and some slight timing around the monetization of these credits. Although we expect the credit to be passed back to customers in full. Therefore, that might be a timing issue more so than it is any one long sustaining benefit to the FFO to debt metric itself.

            "name": "Michael Luhrs",
            "content": "Thank you, Lloyd. I'll begin on Slide eight. NIPSCO's generation transition continues to advance as we optimize the new portfolio to benefit customers and retire all coal-fired generation by the end of 2028. Our first four renewable projects and the associated electric transmission are in service and represent approximately $1 billion of investment in economic, sustainable, zero fuel cost new generation for NIPSCO's Northern Indiana customers. Also, our Indiana Crossroads II wind PPA is advancing and is expected in service late this year. Construction on Calvary Solar and Storage and Dunns Bridge II Solar and Storage continues and both projects have expected in-service dates in 2024. The Fairbank Solar project is expected to be in service in 2025 and is in the early stages of construction. The Gibson project is also expected to be in service in 2025 and construction is anticipated to begin in early 2024. Our plans have included these four owned renewable projects under tax equity structures. However, based on our evaluation of the Inflation Reduction Act and the benefits to customers with tax credit monetization, we have filed a modification with the IURC for approval of full ownership of Calvary Solar and Storage and Dunns Bridge II Solar and Storage. Full ownership of these projects provide a lower cost to customers than tax equity supporting affordability and enhances our base plan. We continue to assume tax equity structures in our plan for the other two projects, Fairbanks and Gibson. However, we are actively evaluating the potential benefits to customers of inflation reduction act provisions related to these projects. NIPSCO has several generation-related filings under review at the IURC, a CPCN for conversion of the Gibson project into a BTA, a bill transfer agreement modification for Calvary and Dunns Bridge II filed in August, which includes the aforementioned customer beneficial proposal of switching to NIPSCO's full ownership of the projects instead of tax equity financing and a CPCN for our planned gas peaker project. In addition, NIPSCO has recently received orders approving several PPA projects, Apple Seed Solar, Templeton Wind and Carpenter Wind. For the gas peaker, in September, we filed a CPCN for an approximately 400-megawatt brownfield gas peaker project on our Schahfer site in Indiana. The project utilizes a combination of technologies, including aero derivatives for quick start capability and is a key enabler of our generation transition system performance and the full retirement of coal-fired generation by 2028. Our in-service renewable projects are performing in line with expectations and are reducing fuel costs for our customers. Since our first project went commercial in late 2020, we have been passing back both excess generation and renewable energy credits revenues to customers from this and subsequent projects. In the third quarter alone, this amount totaled $5.3 million for a year-to-date total of $19.9 million. As we look forward, Slide nine shows additional CapEx opportunities not included in our base financial plan through 2028. These include potential items such as continued employment of the IRA to benefit customers and reduce tax equity financing, long-term incremental generation investment opportunities, PHMSA gas infrastructure spending and multiple additional opportunities. The 2020 federal pipe back will require incremental investment in our system for various leak reduction, safety and other operational requirements. These requirements would build on the investments we have been making on our advanced leak detection and repair program. We will continue to be active in this area to support the best outcome for customers in terms of safety, emissions and infrastructure investment. The pipeline of opportunities listed on this page and the approximately $2 billion 2024 to 2028 upside CapEx opportunities continue to be evaluated to determine the most beneficial actions to deliver safe, reliable and cost-effective energy for our communities. As we look beyond 2028, we think a regulated gas and electric integrated utilities, such as NiSource has the potential to access even more investment. This is particularly true as we think about the landscape of further decarbonization. As Nascent technology develops into practical applications, NiSource will look to work these investments into our capital expenditure plans in a customer beneficial manner. These potential and current investments across our electric and gas business support our clean energy transition, further our Scope 1 emissions reduction goals and enhance customer value in a balanced way. In early October, we announced the launch of a multiphase hydrogen blending project. It is one of the first in the United States use a blending skid in a controlled setting to mix hydrogen and natural gas at precise levels. Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania partnered with EN Engineering to construct a skid at our training facility allowing for the controlled blending of hydrogen into our isolated and controlled natural gas system to blend levels ranging from 2% to 20% hydrogen. Throughout the blending project, NiSource will continue to evaluate the viability of hydrogen natural gas plans for other applications such as factories and power plants. As we consider the benefits and potential uses of hydrogen in the future, this project is one step that helps NiSource to determine the most beneficial and viable opportunities. Finally, last month, we issued our first sustainability report. For years, we have published an integrated annual report incorporating both financial and sustainability metrics. This year marks our first stand-alone report of key sustainability topics. The report details the incorporation of E, S and G policies throughout the organization and how these actions support and align with our mission, vision and values. I'm proud of the company-wide efforts captured in this report that demonstrate how we strengthen and support our communities through our business activities. And I encourage everyone with an interest in sustainability to review the report. I'll now turn things over to Shawn. Yes. So thank you. So when we think about the remaining two projects, as you mentioned, the first two associated with Calvary and Dunns Bridge have been included, and we evaluated that and filed to that from the tax transferability. We continue to evaluate the second two. And if those are customer beneficial, then we'll look at how to move forward with those. But effectively, you would be looking in a neighborhood of about $400 million of incremental capital associated with those projects. If they were to be included under full ownership with tax transferability. So at this point in time, honestly, we feel very strong and confident in our dates and in-service dates with our projects, and we think that's evidenced by how we brought the recent projects into schedule. I think there were a lot of benefits to us in how we exercise the generation transition earlier and plan for that. And at this point, we do not see significant supply disruptions. We do pay attention to that. We are always wary of it. There continues to be the need for long lead time equipment with certain items, but we've addressed those. Thank you. You too. So what I would say is, fundamentally, when you look at the benefits of the IRA and what we determined with the first two projects is that it produced significant additional benefits for customer costs. Both in the near term and in the long-term over the project. So we felt very comfortable, and we know that they provide a lot of benefit to customers, and that's why we filed for full ownership with them. There are always differences associated with projects relative to what the capacity factors of them are depending on the region. There's always differences associated with them. Some of our projects include storage versus not. That changes the different tax credits with those projects. What I would say is that we continue to evaluate those projects, the remaining two under the tax transferability provision. And provide that customer benefit opportunity, then we'll look at how to move forward with those. But we're going to go through it in a very methodical and disciplined fashion to make sure that we know it provides the best benefit to all stakeholders. So when you look at the incremental $1 billion that Shawn mentioned, approximately $500 million is associated with Calvary and Dunns Bridge for the tax transferability, and that's simply going to the full ownership of those projects. Yes. So when you look at the elements between that, I mean, some of that, if you're looking specifically at the generation projects. I mean some of that, honestly, is just rounding associated with it. And then we did have some general modifications with the projects. But then when you look at the other capital opportunities on top of that, Shawn, I'll let you. Yes. So with the generation opportunities in the IRP and even when we talk about potential upside associated with the plan, as I mentioned before, we're working through those in a very methodical and disciplined fashion. Later, I already mentioned with Calvary and Dunns Bridge that we expect something from an IURC in the first part of the year. By that point in time, we would expect to have our analysis associated with Fairbanks and Gibson to be complete and ensuring that it's beneficial to customers. So that's -- in that rough time frame, we wouldn't be expecting to see an update on that analysis. We are working through the IRP refresh in 2024, the IRP refresh wouldn't be towards the latter half of the year associated with it. That will include looking at what we need associated with the pipeline for what's already been mentioned around batteries, additional storage at other solar facilities, additional generation that may be needed relative to the plan from what we're seeing in either economic development or low growth in the areas but that would be more towards the latter part of the year."

            "name": "Lloyd Yates",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris. Good morning and thank you for joining us. I'll start with an overview of our value proposition on slide three. At year-end 2022, we had $16.6 billion of rate base deployed for our customers, and today are outlining a refreshed base plan to invest another nearly $16 billion of capital over the next five years. We plan to execute on our resilient financial commitments supported by a superior regulatory and stakeholder foundation and balance sheet flexibility. Assuming a constant PE ratio, our plan can deliver a total shareholder return of 10% to 12%. Slide four shows our four key priorities. First, today we are reiterating our expectation of achieving the upper half of our $1.54 to $1.60 EPS range this year. We are introducing 2024 EPS guidance of $1.68 to $1.72, over 8% growth midpoint to midpoint versus our current 2023 range. We are extending our 6% to 8% long-term EPS growth guidance to the 2023 to 28 period. This is supported by a five-year base capital plan of $16 billion and an 8% to 10% annual 2023 to 28 rate-based growth. We are confident our commitments are resilient to periods of rapidly changing business conditions such as those seen by the utility industry over the last 12 months. We continue building a track record of execution and growth, and our commitment to investors, employees, and customers is central to everything we do. Second, our superior regulatory and stakeholder foundation differentiates us from peers. In early August, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission approved NIPSCO's electric rate case settlement. This case represented the culmination of years of investment and stakeholder engagement, beginning with our 2018 integrated resource plan. In October, the public utility law judge of Maryland's recommendation to approve Columbia Gas of Maryland's rate case settlement became a final order. Last week, we filed a new gas general rate case in Indiana seeking recovery of $1.1 billion estimated cumulative investment to be completed through the end of 2024. Third, our balance sheet flexibility allows us to both optimize cost of capital for customers and ultimate return on capital for our shareholders. The transaction announced in June with Blackstone Infrastructure Partners is an example of the diverse funding sources embedded in our plan, raised at an attractive relative value while preserving the scale of our business. Fourth, our company is experiencing a record investment cycle driven by safety, reliability, regulatory mandates, decarbonization, and modernization. Investment is constrained primarily by normal operational constraints and our desire to manage the impact on customer bills. The surplus of investment opportunity puts us in a favorable position to prioritize the deployment of capital in the investments in jurisdictions generating the highest risk adjusted returns. Slide five details our annual capital expenditures across our six state service territory. In the five-year period through 2028, we plan to invest $16 billion. Every single one of these dollars is a real investment in our communities. For example, at Columbia Gas of Virginia, we replaced over 8,000 feet of main and over 10,000 feet of service line infrastructure as part of a $4 million investment in our system in the town of Culpeper. As part of this project, Columbia Gas updated several multimeter set and 130 individual customer connections, improving the quality and reliability of service to our customers within Culpeper County. Slide six shows key rate case and select capital rider activity since 2021. Our leading regulatory execution continues with no less than 10 cases filed in seven jurisdictions across six states during this period. Our state regulatory teams are in a constant cycle of communication and engagement with key interveners regulators and customer groups. In addition to general rate cases, regular capital tracker filings allow timely recovery on and of our investments. A dialogue with our Pennsylvania stakeholders starting late last year is an example of this. An approved long-term infrastructure improvement plan and the state is a prerequisite to recovering investments through a distractor. Columbia Gas, Pennsylvania sought the authority to replace infrastructure based on risks rather than a prior focus on bare steel and with a granted approval this spring. This change enables inclusion of an additional first generation assets such as first-generation plastic pipe for expedited replacement, enhancing the safety and reliability of our system. All of this activity is built on a foundation of robust economic activity for our states. Customer count across our territories has been growing on average by 0.5% to 1% annually for years, including 2023 to date. Favorable demographic trends have driven inbound migration, thanks to a stable and growing manufacturing base, robust utility and nonutility infrastructure and low tax rates in the states we serve. In Southwestern Pennsylvania, one of the largest titanium melting companies in the world have advanced plans for a planned expansion in our service territory. Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania engaged the business in the Department of Community and Economic Development to enable the extension of a gas infrastructure and support job creation and economic development in the region. Moreover, this extension will present greater access to low-cost natural gas throughout the surrounding community while enhancing energy diversification and energy resilience. Slide seven shows how our operational excellence model is incorporated into decision-making in all areas of the company. Project Apollo is on track, generating efficiencies by doing things safer, better, more efficiently and with less cost. This will keep non-tracked O&M flat through the duration of our 5-year plan. NiSource has continued to invest in technology that will drive risk reduction across gas and electric assets and increased customer value by ensuring reliable service, advanced mobile leak inspection is one example. Our historical practice of addressing leaks one by one is transforming into a process of clustering large-volume leaks into small replacement projects. This project brings visibility to large volume leaks and prioritization repair, reduces methane emissions and improve efficiency. We are focused on affordability for our customers every day. All of this is expected to contribute to keeping total customer bills in line with inflation over the 5-year financial plan. These achievements would not be possible with our dedicated employees and their commitment to our customers, communities and all ISO stakeholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Michael. Michael Luhrs will handle that question, Mike. We can hear you fine, good morning. So the IURC doesn't have an extended time line to make that decision. We believe and hope that we'll get a decision from them sometime early next year. Let me -- when we built the plan and rolled out at Investor Day in 2022, when we use market curve on natural gas. We did not assume that gas would be $2 to $3 a million BTU. We are still assuming that same market curve in the plan that we have. So I don't characterize that as cushion. We manage that. We don't build. So we didn't build a plan piling in excess capital because we're assuming gas prices are going to stay at $2 to $3. Our land is built on gas prices, whatever the market curve I think its $4 to $5. $4 curve. I would say both as we look at incremental capital opportunities. Now when they come to fruition when we do the analysis and we understand them in terms of customer benefit, shareholder benefit, ability to execute accretion the plan for shareholders, then we'll layer those plans and whether that's on a quarter-by-quarter basis, we'll take advantage on the quarterly opportunity. And then we'll also refresh our capital plans annually to reflect those incremental opportunities. Shawn, do you want to take that one? Michael? Yes, and to add to that, I think that is also a shift in our development of workforce and aligning our contractors and employees to make sure we can execute that work effectively and efficiently. So right now, when we look at our financing plan, we look at our investment windows down the road. We don't think we need to exercise any sales with LDCs. We think we can stay within our 14% to 16% FFO to debt. We think we can grow the business 6% to 8% a year and pay a dividend at 67% payout ratio. So we don't see a knee to sell LDCs. We like the scale of the LDCs. We like our jurisdiction. We think they're really constructive, and we think we have a great organic growth plan. So we are actually going through a refresh of the IRP in 2024 and we are evaluating, we know that the IRP indicates that storage would be beneficial to the system and are looking at that within the future plan. And yes, we will evaluate whether or not at the other solar site would be beneficial to ask from. Thank you. Good morning. Loud and clear. And I think with those commodity prices and that 6% to 8% EPS growth plan we think we also can effectively manage customer affordability in that realm to the point where we can grow for the very long term as opposed to open the capital and increasing customer rates. We believe that there's a regulatory sensitivity here that we need to manage around customer affordability, and we're very focused on that. Thank you. So let's take those one at a time. Michael why don't you start with the IRP and some of the generation opportunities. Okay. Shawn, do you want to talk about the FFO to debt impact? Yes, I believe by time, we understand the full impact of the PHMSA rule, we'll roll that into next year's financial plan. It is a big role with a lot in terms of -- but I think the focus is making the gas distribution system safer, significant reduction in methane leakage and replacing some of the first-generation piping. So I think we'll understand that better later this year or early next year. Thank you. There's two things here. Well, let me close and turn it over to Shawn. And I just want to -- we have a really strong team. We have an organization now excited about a plan that we believe is executable significantly derisked. We have a long tail of investment with an organization focused on operational excellence, customer affordability and effective regulatory and legislative relationships along with great financial discipline. So we're excited about where we're going. And I appreciate your question, Shawn."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter 2023 NiSource Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. It's now my pleasure to turn today's call over to Chris Turnure, Director of Investor Relations.\nChristopher Turnure: Good morning, and welcome to the NiSource Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Joining me today are President and Chief Executive Officer, Lloyd Yates; Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Shawn Anderson; Executive Vice President of Strategy and Risk and Chief Commercial Officer; Michael Luhrs, Executive Vice President and Group President, NiSource Utilities, Melody Birmingham; and Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Randy Hulen. The purpose of this presentation is to review NiSource's financial performance for the second quarter of 2023 as well as provide an update on our operations and growth drivers. Following our prepared remarks, we'll open the call to your questions. Slides for today's call are available in the Investor Relations section of our website.  We would like to remind you that some of the statements made during this presentation will be forward-looking. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. Information concerning such risks and uncertainties is included in the risk factors and MD&A sections of our periodic SEC filings. Additionally, some of the statements made on this call relate to non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the supplemental slides, segment information and full financial schedules for information on the most directly comparable GAAP measure and a reconciliation of these measures.  I'd now like to turn the call over to Lloyd.\nLloyd Yates: Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Hopefully, you've all had a chance to read our second quarter earnings release issued earlier today.  I'll begin on Slide 6 to provide you with an update on our 3 key priorities. First, we are raising our 2023 non-GAAP NOEPS guidance the upper half of $1.54 to $1.60. We are also reaffirming our annual non-GAAP NOEPS growth of 6% to 8% through 2027, an annual rate base growth of 8% to 10%. Meanwhile, our non-tracked O&M target is to remain flat in 2023 as well as throughout the duration of the plan.  We continue building a track record of execution and growth, and our commitment to investors, employees and customers is central to everything we do. Recall our original 2023 NOEPS discrete guidance of $1.50 to $1.57 was introduced at our Investor Day in November. In February, we raised and narrowed our estimate to $1.54 to $1.60, and today, we are again raising to the upper half of this range. In the approximately 9 months since November, our superior operations, regulatory and financing execution have enabled this increase in earnings expectations. For our customers, commodity market conditions have been improving. However, inflation and interest rate headwinds continue to persist. Despite this, we remain focused on delivering value to our customers and highly visible, derisked financial results for our investors.  Second, our leading regulatory execution continued this quarter in both the electric and gas businesses. May was a particularly busy month for our gas distribution business, as the Columbia Gas of Maryland filed a request with the Maryland Public Service Commission, seeking approval to adjust base rates. The request seeks to recover approximately $40 million of capital investment.  Additionally, the Virginia State Corporation Commission approved a settlement among Columbia Gas of Virginia and the parties in its base rate case originally filed in April 2022. The base rate adjustment approval authorizes recovery of approximately $390 million of capital investment. Columbia Gas of Ohio's infrastructure replacement program [indiscernible] rates went into effect in May, initiating the recovery of $360 million of capital investment.  At the electric business, the record is closed in the Northern Indiana Public Service company's electric rate case. We believe the settlement reached back in March represents a balanced outcome for stakeholders, as the company invests billions of dollars in our customers and communities in the state. A final order is anticipated today from the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission with rates anticipated to be effective in steps by September 2023 and March 2024.  At FERC, we received approval for incentives on 2 new MISO electric transmission projects last month, supporting our rate base investment and customer reliability beyond our current financial plan through 2027. Lastly, in June, we announced a definitive agreement to sell a minority stake in NIPSCO to Blackstone Infrastructure Partners.  The transaction strengthens our balance sheet and financial flexibility marks yet another example of NiSource's steadfast execution for stakeholders. More importantly, it enables us to support ongoing investments in Indiana and our 1.3 million electric and gas customers in the state.  Slide 7 details our annual capital expenditures across our 6-state service territory. In a 5-year period, through 2027, we plan to invest $15 billion in our customers and communities.  At Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania, we are currently replacing 21,000 feet of pipe in Fredericktown in Washington County. Nearly half of the small town's residents will have their service lines upgraded, with the remaining customers to be upgraded in the next 2 years. As part of this project, Columbia Gas is converting a low-income housing authority system from a master meter to individual meters, helping to lower the authorities' maintenance obligations. This $6 million project is part of the company's $110 million capital investment in Pennsylvania during the second quarter alone.  NIPSCO remains committed to the gas [indiscernible] plan to extend gas service into rural areas including , Allen and Lake Counties in Northern Indiana. Our major projects in local operating area teams have installed over 24 miles of rural gas main and installed 1,170 new services year-to-date through June as part of this plan.  On the other side of our footprint, crews at Columbia Gas of Maryland are installing new pipe in the city of Cumberland to improve safety by abandoning 3 low-pressure regulator stations, along with abandoning a significant amount of bare steel pipe. This is part of an investment of nearly $8 million of total capital in the state during the second quarter.  Turn to Slide 8. It shows key rate case in select capital rider activity since 2021. Our leading regulatory execution continues with no less than 9 cases filed in 7 jurisdictions across 6 states in the last 3 years. Our state regulatory teams are in a constant cycle of communication and engagement with key intervenors, regulators and customer groups. In addition to general rate cases, regular capital tracker filings allow timely recovery on and of our investments.  All of this activity is built on a foundation of robust economic activity in our states. For example, at NIPSCO, the Northern Indiana Transportation District provides vital transportation links to Chicago and Cook County, Illinois, and is constructing the double-track Northwest Indiana project. The project is anticipated to expand service, improve mobility and accessibility and stimulate job creation for Southern Lake County, and we are in the process of constructing substations to support this major transportation investment in the region. In Ohio, the new Intel chip factory has been under construction since mid-2022 in County on the outskirts of Columbus. It is estimated to be a $20 billion investment in the state, and Intel will be a new Columbia Gas of Ohio customer.  In Virginia, the Norfolk naval shipyard is the Navy's primary East Coast repair, overhaul and modernization facility, and 1 of the 4 public shipyards that play a critical role in maintaining America's fleet. The shipyard is installing a combined heat and power plant expected to be complete later this year that will significantly improve energy security and efficiency, with expected consumption of 1.7 million decatherms annually for Columbia Gas of Virginia.  Customer count across our territories has been growing on average by 0.5% to 1% annually for years, including 2023 to date. Favorable demographic trends have driven inbound migration thanks to a stable and growing manufacturing base, robust utility and nonutility infrastructure and low tax rates in the states we serve.  Turning to another foundational element of value for our 4 million customers, our internal teams continue to advance on all aspects of our operational excellence initiatives. Project Apollo has tracked, generating efficiencies by doing things safer, better, more efficiently and for less cost. One recent example is establishing standard buffer zones around our underground infrastructure to indicate areas where digging can safely occur, especially for third-party excavators. Before instituting a zone, [indiscernible] of being called out to excavation sites to locate underground facilities when it wasn't needed. We've eliminated more than 10,000 unnecessary trips in the last 3 months, allowing more time to be spent on value-added work.  Technology investments are also key to our operational excellence initiative. This year, we began our 5-year, approximately $1 billion transformation, with an initial $300 million investment in SAP and Salesforce technology platform implementation that will standardize work practices and drive efficiencies for our employees to improve service to our customers. All of this is expected to contribute to keeping total customer bill levels and live with inflation over the 5-year financial plan. These achievements would not be possible without our dedicated employees and their commitment to our customers, communities and all NiSource's stakeholders.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Michael Luhrs.\nMichael Luhrs: Thank you, Lloyd. I'll begin on Slide 9. NIPSCO's generation transition is continuing to advance as we optimize the new portfolio to benefit customers and retire all coal-fired generation by the end of 2028. Crossroads and Dunns Bridge I solar project advanced to their and are serving customers over the peak summer season. NIPSCO has now placed 4 utility-owned renewable investments into service from the 2018 integrated resource plan process. In total, these 4 projects represent approximately $800 million investment in 870 megawatts of economic, sustainable, 0 fuel cost, new generation for NIPSCO's Northern Indiana customers.  Construction on Calgary Solar Plus Storage and Dunns Bridge II Solar Plus Storage continues. Both projects have expected in service dates in 2024, and we are in the very early stages of construction of the Fairbanks Solar project, which has been expected in service date of mid-2025. Additionally, our work on Indiana Crossroads 2 Wind PPA is advancing and is expected in service late this year.  Today, we are announcing several adjustments to our remaining portfolio of projects address, development challenges and better align the portfolio with recent changes to MISO rules surrounding seasonal capacity constructs.  The first is the conversion of the Gibson PPA project to a build transfer agreement. We have filed a CPCN seeking approval from the IURC, and if approved, this project will replace the Elliott project in our portfolio. Second, we have sought regulatory approval for several recently executed PPAs: Appleseed Solar, Templeton Wind. Finally, the agreement for the Elliott PPA and the Brickyard and Greensboro PPAs have been mutually terminated by NIPSCO and the developers of these projects.  Four key points related to these projects. First, these economical and zero fuel cost resources continue to support customer affordability. Second, these changes support our current coal retirement schedule of all coal retired by the end of 2028. Third, the renewable generation in service by the end of 2025 will continue to consist of 8 build transfer agreements and 6 PPAs. And fourth, the revised portfolio progress is consistent with our current 5-year CapEx rate base financing and other prior commitments to the investment community.  Beyond these projects, our 2021 IRP and 2022 RFP processes laid the groundwork for the balance of projects needed to replace the Michigan City generating station by 2028. NIPSCO is implementing an upgrade at the Sugar Creek gas generating station this year, and we are finalizing our analysis of gas alternatives identified in our 2022 RFP, which we expect to result in a request for a new brownfield project at our Schahfer site. NIPSCO will continue to evaluate further generation portfolio needs, and we will be conducting the triannual integrated resource planning process with stakeholders in 2024. Fuel cost resources reduced customer build volatility and create substantial value for our customers, especially as they experience elevated economy-wide inflation. Since our first project went commercial in late 2020, we have been passing back both excess generation and renewable energy credits revenue to customers from this and subsequent projects. In the second quarter alone, that amount totaled $8.4 million or over $2 per residential customer, for a year-to-date total of $14.6 million.  As we look forward, Slide 10 shows additional CapEx opportunities not included in our financial plan through 2027. Multiple items on this list, both near term and longer term, are progressing well in their evaluation work streams. Prior to the Inflation Reduction Act, we beneficially employed tax equity financing on the 4 owned renewable projects in service to date, and our financial guidance incorporates tax equity financing for the remaining 4 projects in 2024 and 2025. However, given the new pathways for utilizing tax credits included in the IRA, we are evaluating the benefits of direct ownership for each of the remaining 4 build transfer projects, potentially adding incremental CapEx to the plan while enhancing the value for customers as well as portfolio and project flexibility.  We are also working through our long-term investment plans stemming from the proposed rules around the 2020 Federal Act, which will require incremental investment in our system for various leak reduction, safety and other operational requirements. These requirements would build on the investments we have been making on our advanced leak detection and repair program. We will continue to be active in this area to support the best outcome for customers in terms of safety, emissions and infrastructure investment.  These potential and current investments across our electric and gas businesses support our clean energy transition, furthering our Scope 1 emission reduction goals and enhancing customer value in a balanced way. At year-end 2022, NiSource achieved a 67% reduction in Scope 1 GHG emissions from 2005 baseline levels, and we remain on track to achieve an industry-leading 90% reduction in Scope 1 GHG emissions by 2030, and are advancing our goal of net 0 Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2040. At NiSource, we're very proud of our track record of decarbonization and focus on sustainability.  In addition to being named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, we are rated as AAA by MSCI for ESG and have been recognized as 1 of America's Most Responsible Companies for 2023 by Newsweek, and by Ford's Best Employers for Diversity in 2023. Our passion is to create value for our customers and communities through investment in and operation of our electric and gas systems that drive customer benefits in reliability, safety, sustainability and customer offering.  I'll now turn things over to Shawn.\nShawn Anderson: Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Slide 11 reviews our financial results from the second quarter of this year. Non-GAAP net operating earnings achieved $50.3 million or $0.11 per share compared to $53.9 million or $0.12 per share in the second quarter of 2022. Year-to-date results continue to track in line with our plan. Visibility from constructive regulatory outcomes, completion of financing transactions and execution on O&M initiatives have supported our raising our range to the upper half of the $1.54 to $1.60 range provided. As we indicated last quarter, key regulatory and O&M drivers will continue to build value into our financial results for 2023 as they layer into our actual results across the full year and drive greater impact in the second half of the fiscal year.  Turning to Slide 12, you'll find segment detail and key drivers of our 2Q results. Gas Distribution operating earnings were $120 million in the second quarter, an increase of $39 million versus the same quarter last year. New rates and capital investment programs drove $61 million of incremental revenue, including general rate case contributions in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Virginia and Maryland. Capital trackers in Ohio, Kentucky and Virginia positively impacted the segment as well. Non-tracked gas O&M was flat year-over-year.  In the Electric segment, operating earnings were $51 million in the second quarter, a decrease of $22 million versus the same quarter last year. Lower weather-normalized customer usage across all 3 customer classes attributes to this variance and is related to industrial outages and a return to more normal long-term demand in the commercial and residential segments. Higher nontracked O&M was also a headwind, primarily due to the timing of generation maintenance expenses and increased reliability spend related to vegetation management.  And finally, Corporate and Other was favorable by $14 million due primarily to lower benefit and insurance costs and reduced third-party expenditures.  Now I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile on Slide 13. Our debt level as of June 30, 2023 was $12.6 billion, of which $11 billion was long-term debt with a weighted average maturity of 12 years and a weighted average interest rate of 3.9%. At the end of the second quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of $1.8 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization programs.  We remain committed to our current investment-grade credit ratings. I'm happy to share all 3 agencies have reaffirmed NiSource ratings with stable outlooks following their annual reviews and the minority interest announcement.  Slide 14 addresses our financing strategy and credit commitments. In June, we issued $450 million of 10-year notes at 5.4% and an additional $300 million of our March 5-year, 5.25% notes. We plan to use a portion of these proceeds from the sale of the notes to fund our capital plan. As previously indicated, we also plan on completing the equity units transaction launched in 2021 by remarketing the units this fall.  We are reaffirming our long-term financing plan originally disclosed at Investor Day in November. This includes 0 discrete equity issuances through 2027 and 0 ATM equity in 2023 and 2024, and all financing costs are reflected in our earnings growth and credit commitments. This balanced financing plan is anticipated to help us deliver on our 14% to 16% annual FFO debt ratio anticipated for all years of the plan when considering the proceeds of the minority sale. This affords us adequate flexibility to execute on rate base investment opportunities as they arise in any given year.  Central to our financing plan is the sale of a minority stake in NIPSCO. The transaction enables billions of dollars of investment for our customers and communities planned in Indiana over the coming years. It also strengthens our balance sheet and enhances flexibility and diversification from traditional capital markets. Our transaction announcement in June followed a period of capital market headwinds for utilities. Interest rates are generally higher, and utility equity valuations are flat or down as a group since we originally stated our intention to sell the interest in November. We believe our decision to pursue this financing transaction optimized and derisked our cost of capital versus alternative paths.  We are very optimistic about the growing strength of our balance sheet and credit metrics as we look ahead. Supportive rate structures and regulatory activity, coupled with the proceeds coming in later this year from the minority sale and the remarketing of our equity units, position us strongly in the 14% to 16% FFO to debt range.  Later this year, we expect to provide an update and roll forward of our long-term financial commitments. This will enable us to complete our annual planning period and refresh of all of our capital expenditure and regulatory plans as we look forward to 2024 and the outer years of our financial forecast.  Both at NIPSCO and our Columbia Gas operating companies, our customers are core to everything we do. We remain sensitive to the overall inflationary pressures impacting many parts of consumer expenses, even as falling energy commodity prices have helped our customer bills in the first half of this year. Our fuel cost adjustment mechanisms update every quarter, and therefore, quickly begin to pass back savings as prices fall. These have been a critical tool to help our customers during the extreme swings in commodity prices seen over the last 2 years.  Second quarter gas fuel charges on residential customer bills declined $31 million versus the second quarter of 2022. This has translated into an average decline of $6.50 per month for the commodity portion of customer bills across our gas utility businesses. Weather normalization mechanisms also insulate both investors and customers across the [indiscernible] portion of our meters. Residential customers across our Columbia Gas companies benefit from constructs ranging from full straight fixed variable rate design in Ohio to a normalization band in Pennsylvania utilized during heating season, among other mechanisms.  The impact of weather is excluded from our adjusted EPS, however, it's worth noting the actual cash flow impact versus normal in 2Q and year-to-date was only $6 million and $38 million pretax, respectively, or 1% and 3% of our cash flow from operations for those periods.  Scale is another factor we believe can drive greater affordability for our customers. The scale of NiSource's 6 operating companies and its central services operating model supports approximately 4 million customers, and presents opportunities to flatten our operations and maintenance expenditures. And as we grow our customer base across all of our companies, those costs can be shared across the broader base. This also benefits our investors as scale and diversity enable traditional rate base investment flexibility across multiple jurisdictions and multiple energy systems.  Finally, I'd like to conclude where Lloyd started today. We are reiterating our long-term annual non-GAAP NOEPS growth commitment of 6% to 8% through 2027, driven by annual rate base growth of 8% to 10%. We are raising 2023 non-GAAP NOEPS guidance to the upper half of the $1.54 to $1.60 range. This follows our guidance range raising and narrowing in February from our original 2023 guidance range offered last November. This further demonstrates our growing track record of execution, including exceeding our $1.44 to $1.46 guidance range in 2022 with actual NOEPS of $1.47 and exceeding our $1.32 to $1.36 guidance range in 2021 while achieving $1.37.  We remain confident in our plan despite persistent inflationary supply chain and interest rate headwinds. We continue building a track record of execution and growth, and our commitment to our investors, employees and customers is central to everything we do.  Thank you for your support of NiSource. And with that, I'll turn things over to Lloyd for final comments.\nLloyd Yates: Thanks, Shawn. And before we take questions, I'd like to share some late-breaking news with the investor community. We just received an order from the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission for the NIPSCO electric rate case. And upon the initial review, it appears the settlement in the NIPSCO's case has been approved without modification. The team is reviewing the details of the order, and if we see anything different, we'll let you know as soon as possible. And just let me give you a couple of highlights. A revenue increase of $292 million, return on equity of 9.8% and an increase -- rate base increase of slightly over $1.8 billion.  I want to publicly thank the IURC for their diligence in review of this quarter, the team and all the stakeholders that contribute to what we believe is a very balanced solution.  And with that, we'll open the floor for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.\nShahriar Pourreza: Lloyd, it's good to see that you guys actually increased your guidance for the year when peers lowered, obviously, this morning. Could we get maybe just share a little bit of what's driving the level of confidence '23, especially with how the key part of the year is still in front of us? And whether there's anything to read into there as we're thinking about the 6% to 8% growth rate?\nLloyd Yates: So I'll let Shawn handle the details. But when you think about the second half of the year, I think the thing to contemplate is all of the great regulatory execution we had, including the from Indiana today, and continue to drive savings by Apollo.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Shawn for details of that comment. Shawn?\nShawn Anderson: Yes. Thanks, Lloyd. Appreciate the question. Just as Lloyd said, you may observe the track record of success on Slide 8, which demonstrates consistent execution of rate case and [indiscernible] filings across all of our businesses. Most notably, if you bring your attention to Q4 2022 and all of the 2023 outcomes, that specifically gives us enhanced line of sight to regulated revenue drivers across the balance of this year. That's somewhere in the neighborhood of $0.35 per share in total regulatory programs over the second half, which have already been approved or implemented and which will support growth revenues in the second half of the year.  Obviously, we've had some successful execution of financing transactions required to execute the robust capital expenditure program in 2023. Those really have concluded our long-term debt issuances for the year, thus we've got a good line of sight to the interest expense that we're going to be paying for the rest of this year to support capital programs.  Lloyd mentioned Project Apollo. We're definitely seeing some success as those programs are starting to launch here in the middle of this year. That will give us some tailwinds on the O&M front that we can use to enhance performance.  But the other piece I'd note, just simply, we remain confident in the 6% to 8% annual OEPS growth rate through 2027. And again, I'll just take this moment as an opportunity to remind folks, we project that growth rate off of year-end results for each year of the plan. So while we're now targeting the upper half of the current year guidance range, this flows through into the annual 68% NOEPS across the remainder of the plan period.\nShahriar Pourreza: Okay. Terrific. That's what I was trying to sort of get at. Okay, good. And then the near-term CapEx slide, I think it Slide 10, that could be incremental. I mean, can you just sort of help us size that for us? Even a range and the timing and how we should think about when that could actually hit the plan? Is EEI maybe the right podium to update? Is it year-end results? Like -- how do we think about when we can get additional disclosures there?\nShawn Anderson: Yes. Maybe I'll start, and then I'll pass things to Michael to touch on a couple of components that might be interesting in there.  But we plan to update all the long-term commitments, including growth rate, capital expenditures in that November time frame. So I think you hit the nail on the head. We'll look at all factors and provide as much visibility as we can into our business. As you know, we've got a backlog of identified and high-quality investment opportunities which support system reliability, sustainability, customer service, and our focus is really how can we efficiently access those investments at 1x rate base and convert that into NOEPS for our shareholders. The teams are studying that right now. We're going through that annual planning process. The results of that, we'll be able to share in the November time frame.  But Michael, do you want to hit any interesting ideas on that slide?\nMichael Luhrs: The only thing that I'll add to that, Shawn, is we continue to work through the different elements of it. They are progressing well in the work streams of those items, but also in more real terms. When we think about the '22 RFP and the work on that as we finalize it and as we mentioned before, that's going to come back relative to a potential brownfield associated with the site. We already mentioned the 2021 IRP relative to the potential for a new gas . And in addition to that, we continue to evaluate the remaining options in the portfolio that would allow us to meet the commitments that we set associated with the generation transition.\nShahriar Pourreza: Okay. Got it. And then just lastly for me, Lloyd, maybe just a strategic question, if I may. I mean obviously, you guys executed a fantastic transaction with NIPSCO, so that was good. But I know obviously, some of the local media and some of the banker regs are highlighting maybe NiSource's acquisitive nature as you're thinking about potential deals. Without obviously going into specifics, unless you want to go into specifics, I guess, can you just highlight what your appetite is to grow the business further especially in states that you already operate in?\nLloyd Yates: So that was really a good way to ask that question, Shar. Let me start there. And I don't want to comment on specific details. Of course, like most companies, our policies, we don't comment on market room, of course, specific details.  What I will comment on though is back in November on Investor Day, we laid out what I thought, and I think this team and our Board thinks, is a really, really good plan. We're going to grow our earnings 6% to 8% annually off end of year results, 8% to 10% rate base growth. We put forth a transaction, 19.9% of the NIPSCO utility to strengthen our balance sheet. And what I will tell you is as we did the business review last year, that was the only transaction we contemplated, and we are laser-focused on getting that done. So you mentioned we haven't finished that transaction yet. That transaction is to be finished by the end of this year. We're laser focused on that transaction, investing $15 billion of capital, making sure we operate in an excellent way and growing earnings, and that is where the whole NiSource team is zeroing down on.\nShahriar Pourreza: Okay. Great. I'm sure someone asked that question in a different way. Appreciate it, guys.\nLloyd Yates: Yours was good.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Sunderland with JPMorgan.\nRichard Sunderland: Am I coming through clearly?\nLloyd Yates: Yes, you are.\nRichard Sunderland: Great. Circling back to the renewables project changes outlined in 1 of the earlier slides there, could you give a little bit more color to the backdrop and process underpinning all of that? I mean, it seems like it worked out in a way effectively neutral to you on ownership versus PPA basis. But just curious if there's anything more you can highlight out of how those changes contemplated became about?\nMichael Luhrs: Sure. Happy to do so. Thank you. When we look at it, just to reinforce, I mean we will continue to consist of 8 build transfer agreements and 6 PPAs, and the revised portfolio project is consistent with our current 5-year CapEx rate base financing other prior commitments. But to get a little bit more into your question, we're consistently looking through the portfolio and making sure that we're eliminating risk associated with delivery and providing the best options for customer costs associated with those projects, so we're always looking to optimize them. So as we go through site development and different activities with it, we looked at how to best optimize that portfolio, and that's what you're seeing being done here.  So by doing these projects and the way we've set them up, it gives us a lot of confidence in being able to execute on those plans and deliver those commitments as well as being able to provide the customers the benefits and meet MISO changes as well in the [indiscernible].\nRichard Sunderland: Understood. Understood. Very helpful there. And sticking with renewables, but thinking about that Slide 10 with the additional investment opportunities, the ownership uplift asset is under evaluation. Is that an item we expect to have resolved or mapped out in time for the fall update? And anything else that you could point out from the list as a likely candidate for at least an update in that fall outlook provision?\nMichael Luhrs: So I would say as we go through the projects and as we continue to provide information with IRC and other parties, we will provide updates to those projects as we go through each stage, just like we did with Gibson and the filing associated with that.  But relative to the full ownership, we're finishing our evaluation of the IRA. And as mentioned before, there are significant benefits with the IRA both in tax policy and the ability to maintain the full ownership, which benefits project and portfolio optimization. This gives the capability to remove administrative burden, complexity as well as to optimize the asset, and we're finishing that analysis now and expect to be able to conclude that. But in doing so, if we look at that right now, our plan assumes tax equity for the remaining 4 projects. If we -- pending regulatory approval, if all 4 were included under full ownership, that would require up to $1 billion in additional CapEx.\nRichard Sunderland: Understood. So to be clear, that's $1 billion incremental to the current placeholder under a full ownership scenario. Is that what you're saying?\nMichael Luhrs: Yes. So when you look at the current plan, the current plan assumes tax equity if full ownership was done for all 4 projects. Pending any regulatory approvals, it would be up to $1 billion in additional CapEx.\nRichard Sunderland: Got it. Got it. And one final quick one for me. Just Project Apollo, as you get further along in the kind of the initial launch here, any new learnings relative to what you laid out in the spring around this initiative? Or anything to highlight in terms of what you're seeing for employees and other stakeholders as you roll this out?\nLloyd Yates: Yes, so thanks for asking that question. I think what we're seeing is employees getting excited and finding better and more ideas for cost savings. I think when you drill down into the organization, employees know what holds them up and getting more work done, and we're getting after it. I think this will be a continuous improvement mindset. We're driving it throughout the company to do things safer, better, faster and more efficiently. But again, this is an employee-driven ideas. It's process driven and we're finding significant savings, and I expect this to continue on for a really long time. In fact, I expect it to start accelerating in 2024 and beyond. But delivering the savings now, looking forward acceleration process next year for even more savings.\nRichard Sunderland: Great to hear, and thanks for the time today.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.\nSteven Fleishman: Just -- I apologize -- Yes, Lloyd. Just -- apologize to repeat this, but just could you maybe go through the changes in the renewables program from the prior program? Again, just kind of what has actually changed in terms of adjustments and cancellations?\nLloyd Yates: Michael?\nMichael Luhrs: Sure. Happy to do so. So when you look at it, was originally included as the that is being replaced by Gibson, assuming approved by the IURC that was filed. In addition to that, we terminated several PPAs and also added several PPAs, which have been filed with the IURC. So you look at Templeton Wind, Carpenter Wind, Appleseed Solar are all filed with IURC now, and those are really the fundamental changes.  So we had 8 BTAs before. We have 8 BTAs now, it's just Elliott to Gibson. And we have 6 PPAs before, we have 6 PPAs now. And it's Templeton and Carpenter Wind and Appleseed Solar in those versus like Brickyard and Greensboro and Gibson. Those were terminated.\nSteven Fleishman: And the three new PPA?\nShawn Anderson: Sorry. Just real quick. The only thing I'd add would be with those changes, the NIPSCO investment forecast of $2 billion to $2.2 billion is unchanged, yes.\nSteven Fleishman: Got it. And the new PPAs, have you announced who they're with?\nLloyd Yates: We've done the filings associated with them, and in those filings, I believe that we have said who they are with.\nSteven Fleishman: Okay. Do you have that just off top of your head, or?\nMichael Luhrs: We'll get back to you on that.\nLloyd Yates: Yes. will get back to you with those names.\nSteven Fleishman: Okay. Overall, the message is same CapEx program, same amount of PPAs, remixing everything. And then obviously, there's this upside opportunity if you're able to use -- not have to use tax equity in terms of [indiscernible]. Okay.\nMichael Luhrs: That's correct.\nSteven Fleishman: Okay. And then just the overall IURC support of the program remains strong, like the how much of these are the [indiscernible]? Yes.\nLloyd Yates: The IURC, I think the State of Indiana in general, there's very good support for this renewables program. And I think what drove it, the amount of stakeholder engagement that got done upfront, I think what we're seeing is the benefit of stakeholder engagement with the IURC, the industrial customers, the commercial customers, the legislators. And I think it's been settlement, rate case approval, filings.  So we believe and we continue -- not believe, we know we have very good support from the IURC in the state of Indiana, and we think that we're doing this transition in a way that really makes sense from a clean energy perspective and a reliability perspective.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Look, just wanted to follow up on a few of the last tidbits you guys put out there just on the generation upside you talked about a moment ago.  Just want to clarify this. First off, you've seen incremental load across your service territories. To what extent does that $1 billion upside contemplate that angle as well as any potential shift here in MISO capacity needs? And then in turn, just on the tax equity bit, can you clarify just the status with the credit rating agencies? I know there's been some conversation on that front amongst others out there. If you can update us on that front?\nShawn Anderson: Yes. The first piece of the question, Julien, and this is Shawn. The first piece of the question, the incremental load that you're alluding to is not captured in the $1 billion. Said differently, the 2021 IRP projected capacity requirements and the load necessary for us to serve our communities, and it provided that with the existing footprint of assets that we're currently engaged commercially to construct. Incremental load would be captured in the next IRP and factored into any future generation planning. That next IRP would be 2024, so we would capture that upside as we rerun the scenarios around load factors next year.  And then the second part of your question, we expect that for purposes of calculating FFO, the treatment of tax credit transfers would be consistent with GAAP accounting. That should result in tax credit transfers flowing through the tax line and increasing FFO, and we understand that our credit rating agencies are evaluating that. But that methodology consistent with GAAP accounting seems to track with us, and we'll continue to stay engaged with the credit rating agencies as they continue their evaluation.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Excellent. And then, Lloyd, just to come back and open that can again, if we can. Just on the strategic front here, I mean, obviously, the plan is very good as is. Any commentary as to thresholds that you would think to? I mean, obviously, you laid out a pretty stark 1 earlier. Any further commentary on that front? I mean, obviously, you've got a very nice running start here on the [indiscernible].\nLloyd Yates: Right. So we're -- I mean, we're investing $15 billion of capital at 1x rate base. Someone wants to sell us an asset that creates significant shareholder value at less than that, I think the probability of that is really low, but our focus is our plan.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Awesome. All right. Sorry, I'll leave that be. Good luck, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.\nDurgesh Chopra: I just wanted to go back and clarify the tax equity to the $1 billion CapEx upside. So if I follow this correctly, the 8 BATs that you have currently in the plan, there is tax equity in it. And there's a potential with the IRA that tax equity results in $1 billion more CapEx or upside of those -- within those 8 projects. Am I thinking about this correctly?\nMichael Luhrs: It would be for the remaining 4 projects of the 8. All 8 projects right now in the plan assume tax equity. So it would be for the remaining 4 projects, Cavalry Solar and Storage, Dunns Bridge II Solar and Storage, Fairbanks and Gibson, pending regulatory approval associated with those that if those projects were under full ownership, it would be up to an incremental $1 billion in CapEx.  And the only thing I'd want to add to that is when we look at them, obviously, from the customer side and the benefits, we're making sure that we do full due diligence on that. And to follow up on the previous question just to make sure I got the mix right, it is next era for Templeton and Appleseed, and Carpenter is EDPR.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. Okay. So remaining 4. That makes a lot of sense. And maybe just can you -- Shawn, maybe this is -- maybe you can answer this one, but just -- how should we think about financing of that incremental CapEx? I think at the Investor Day, right, what you laid out was ATM in 2025 and beyond which was 15% equity, 85% debt on growth opportunities. Is that a good rule of thumb still as we think about this incremental $1 billion CapEx? That's part 1 of the question.  And part 2, do you see like depending on the time frame of these projects or potential equity or ATM next year and before the 2025 time frame?\nShawn Anderson: Appreciate the question. So at this point, there's no change to the financing plan we shared at our Investor Day in November. So just to reiterate, this includes no new equity until 2025, no discrete equity issuances to the life of the plan, with ATM maintenance equity beginning towards the latter half of the planned horizon. As we complete the equity units for marketing transaction that we entered into 2021, we'll receive some additional proceeds there. As you know, we received proceeds when we close the transaction with Blackstone. That will provide us a credit cushion relative to the 14% to 16% FFO to debt. We'll be in the 14% to 16% FFO to debt range, but a credit cushion that we could use to apply towards CapEx in 2024 should we need to and should we identify incremental cap opportunities.  What we're currently doing right now is evaluating what those capital opportunities could look like, inclusive of tax equity and how that will create incremental cash flow as you'd expect coming out of our business, and then how that would impact our financing plan throughout the entire horizon. All of that, we expect to be able to step through in the November time frame so it's a bit too early to tell you exactly how that works. But the financing plan itself and the commitments we've made are still consistent with what we made in Investor Day.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Ryan Levine with Citi.\nRyan Levine: I appreciate all the details on solar, I guess a couple of follow-ups. What drove the changes for your project portfolio that you outlined? And why make these changes now?\nMichael Luhrs: Well, as we go through the projects and we work through just the normal process of developing the projects and develop -- negotiating the agreements, we're always looking as to how to make sure that we're eliminating risk and bringing in the benefits. So on these individual projects, you combine that with also how we're able to provide the best benefit to customers, and that's what fundamentally led to the changes associated with the projects. That had to do with subcomponents associated with whether it be development costs or certain costs associated with the each individual site, and we try to maintain a robust portfolio of development opportunities that enable us to have that flexibility associated with it. We know no plan goes exactly as planned, so therefore, we want to have flexibility in that plan. And really, it's just working through that normal process of project development, construction siting, et cetera.\nRyan Levine: And then what's the time line or milestones you're working on that have a better sense of the related transmission investment opportunity? And when do you think you'll have a better -- some numbers to point to around that uptake?\nMichael Luhrs: I'm sorry, can you repeat that? For which opportunity?\nRyan Levine: For the CapEx upside that you identified in your slide?\nMichael Luhrs: Yes. So we're continuing to do the analysis associated with the . We know that looking at it that there would be significant additional requirements. We have not laid out a specific timeline associated with those activities yet or what that would mean relative to our CapEx or financial plans. But the team is well engaged, well underway and working through those as well as we're engaged on how those rules are promulgated and what -- and how we can best benefit customers.\nRyan Levine: Think you'll be able to have a plan in next year? Or is this a this year decision point? Or any color you can share around timeline?\nLloyd Yates: I think we're working through that process in November. Whether it be an EEI or via our earnings call, we'll have those plans more formalized and laid out. We'll get them to you as soon as we have them.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your next question is from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar.\nTravis Miller: Just at a high level, if you go back to November and think about the outlook you gave for this year and then forward to today, what's been the biggest surprise? Now you mentioned a couple of different variables. But what's the big surprise that has come about this year that is leading to that higher earnings outlook?\nLloyd Yates: So I would say to you, as I sit in the seat, a little over 1.5 years, more confidence in our ability to execute on the regulatory front. I think that we have just really superior regulatory execution capabilities. As I spend more time on the operating side and look at the cost savings on here,and savings without taking additional risk but really becoming better operational excellence. I'm seeing a lot more momentum gains, so -- and I have confidence in this management team. And we've put this management team in place, we're really working well together. They're probably 1 of the best management teams in the industry, and it's working really well so it's given us more confidence to deliver our earnings to investors. I think we're doing better on the customer side and better in our communities, and our employees like working here better. So I think it's an overall confidence rising across all of NiSource.\nTravis Miller: Okay. That's great. And then on the renewable energy and coal retirements, with what you have in the pipeline right now regardless of whether it's PPA or ownership, how much more in your projections are you looking at to be able to execute that full coal retirement, whether it's renewables or some other type of capacity? How much more outside of what you've announced is necessary, do you think?\nMichael Luhrs: So we haven't completed the work associated with that. As we mentioned, there's additional CapEx included in the placeholder in the plan. We have significant work done from the 2022 RFP associated with that, which is concluding. But beyond that initial work, we will continue to look at opportunities around a diverse mix of assets that fill that $1 billion of CapEx, which is what we have targeted relative to the retirement of the 2028 [indiscernible].  So work is continuing. We'll have more updates as we go through the next Q, and we're continuing to work the '22 RFP associated with it to finalize that.\nTravis Miller: Okay. great. I appreciate it. That's all I had.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Shawn Anderson",
            "content": "Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Slide 11 reviews our financial results from the second quarter of this year. Non-GAAP net operating earnings achieved $50.3 million or $0.11 per share compared to $53.9 million or $0.12 per share in the second quarter of 2022. Year-to-date results continue to track in line with our plan. Visibility from constructive regulatory outcomes, completion of financing transactions and execution on O&M initiatives have supported our raising our range to the upper half of the $1.54 to $1.60 range provided. As we indicated last quarter, key regulatory and O&M drivers will continue to build value into our financial results for 2023 as they layer into our actual results across the full year and drive greater impact in the second half of the fiscal year.  Turning to Slide 12, you'll find segment detail and key drivers of our 2Q results. Gas Distribution operating earnings were $120 million in the second quarter, an increase of $39 million versus the same quarter last year. New rates and capital investment programs drove $61 million of incremental revenue, including general rate case contributions in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Virginia and Maryland. Capital trackers in Ohio, Kentucky and Virginia positively impacted the segment as well. Non-tracked gas O&M was flat year-over-year.  In the Electric segment, operating earnings were $51 million in the second quarter, a decrease of $22 million versus the same quarter last year. Lower weather-normalized customer usage across all 3 customer classes attributes to this variance and is related to industrial outages and a return to more normal long-term demand in the commercial and residential segments. Higher nontracked O&M was also a headwind, primarily due to the timing of generation maintenance expenses and increased reliability spend related to vegetation management.  And finally, Corporate and Other was favorable by $14 million due primarily to lower benefit and insurance costs and reduced third-party expenditures.  Now I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile on Slide 13. Our debt level as of June 30, 2023 was $12.6 billion, of which $11 billion was long-term debt with a weighted average maturity of 12 years and a weighted average interest rate of 3.9%. At the end of the second quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of $1.8 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization programs.  We remain committed to our current investment-grade credit ratings. I'm happy to share all 3 agencies have reaffirmed NiSource ratings with stable outlooks following their annual reviews and the minority interest announcement.  Slide 14 addresses our financing strategy and credit commitments. In June, we issued $450 million of 10-year notes at 5.4% and an additional $300 million of our March 5-year, 5.25% notes. We plan to use a portion of these proceeds from the sale of the notes to fund our capital plan. As previously indicated, we also plan on completing the equity units transaction launched in 2021 by remarketing the units this fall.  We are reaffirming our long-term financing plan originally disclosed at Investor Day in November. This includes 0 discrete equity issuances through 2027 and 0 ATM equity in 2023 and 2024, and all financing costs are reflected in our earnings growth and credit commitments. This balanced financing plan is anticipated to help us deliver on our 14% to 16% annual FFO debt ratio anticipated for all years of the plan when considering the proceeds of the minority sale. This affords us adequate flexibility to execute on rate base investment opportunities as they arise in any given year.  Central to our financing plan is the sale of a minority stake in NIPSCO. The transaction enables billions of dollars of investment for our customers and communities planned in Indiana over the coming years. It also strengthens our balance sheet and enhances flexibility and diversification from traditional capital markets. Our transaction announcement in June followed a period of capital market headwinds for utilities. Interest rates are generally higher, and utility equity valuations are flat or down as a group since we originally stated our intention to sell the interest in November. We believe our decision to pursue this financing transaction optimized and derisked our cost of capital versus alternative paths.  We are very optimistic about the growing strength of our balance sheet and credit metrics as we look ahead. Supportive rate structures and regulatory activity, coupled with the proceeds coming in later this year from the minority sale and the remarketing of our equity units, position us strongly in the 14% to 16% FFO to debt range.  Later this year, we expect to provide an update and roll forward of our long-term financial commitments. This will enable us to complete our annual planning period and refresh of all of our capital expenditure and regulatory plans as we look forward to 2024 and the outer years of our financial forecast.  Both at NIPSCO and our Columbia Gas operating companies, our customers are core to everything we do. We remain sensitive to the overall inflationary pressures impacting many parts of consumer expenses, even as falling energy commodity prices have helped our customer bills in the first half of this year. Our fuel cost adjustment mechanisms update every quarter, and therefore, quickly begin to pass back savings as prices fall. These have been a critical tool to help our customers during the extreme swings in commodity prices seen over the last 2 years.  Second quarter gas fuel charges on residential customer bills declined $31 million versus the second quarter of 2022. This has translated into an average decline of $6.50 per month for the commodity portion of customer bills across our gas utility businesses. Weather normalization mechanisms also insulate both investors and customers across the [indiscernible] portion of our meters. Residential customers across our Columbia Gas companies benefit from constructs ranging from full straight fixed variable rate design in Ohio to a normalization band in Pennsylvania utilized during heating season, among other mechanisms.  The impact of weather is excluded from our adjusted EPS, however, it's worth noting the actual cash flow impact versus normal in 2Q and year-to-date was only $6 million and $38 million pretax, respectively, or 1% and 3% of our cash flow from operations for those periods.  Scale is another factor we believe can drive greater affordability for our customers. The scale of NiSource's 6 operating companies and its central services operating model supports approximately 4 million customers, and presents opportunities to flatten our operations and maintenance expenditures. And as we grow our customer base across all of our companies, those costs can be shared across the broader base. This also benefits our investors as scale and diversity enable traditional rate base investment flexibility across multiple jurisdictions and multiple energy systems.  Finally, I'd like to conclude where Lloyd started today. We are reiterating our long-term annual non-GAAP NOEPS growth commitment of 6% to 8% through 2027, driven by annual rate base growth of 8% to 10%. We are raising 2023 non-GAAP NOEPS guidance to the upper half of the $1.54 to $1.60 range. This follows our guidance range raising and narrowing in February from our original 2023 guidance range offered last November. This further demonstrates our growing track record of execution, including exceeding our $1.44 to $1.46 guidance range in 2022 with actual NOEPS of $1.47 and exceeding our $1.32 to $1.36 guidance range in 2021 while achieving $1.37.  We remain confident in our plan despite persistent inflationary supply chain and interest rate headwinds. We continue building a track record of execution and growth, and our commitment to our investors, employees and customers is central to everything we do.  Thank you for your support of NiSource. And with that, I'll turn things over to Lloyd for final comments. Yes. Thanks, Lloyd. Appreciate the question. Just as Lloyd said, you may observe the track record of success on Slide 8, which demonstrates consistent execution of rate case and [indiscernible] filings across all of our businesses. Most notably, if you bring your attention to Q4 2022 and all of the 2023 outcomes, that specifically gives us enhanced line of sight to regulated revenue drivers across the balance of this year. That's somewhere in the neighborhood of $0.35 per share in total regulatory programs over the second half, which have already been approved or implemented and which will support growth revenues in the second half of the year.  Obviously, we've had some successful execution of financing transactions required to execute the robust capital expenditure program in 2023. Those really have concluded our long-term debt issuances for the year, thus we've got a good line of sight to the interest expense that we're going to be paying for the rest of this year to support capital programs.  Lloyd mentioned Project Apollo. We're definitely seeing some success as those programs are starting to launch here in the middle of this year. That will give us some tailwinds on the O&M front that we can use to enhance performance.  But the other piece I'd note, just simply, we remain confident in the 6% to 8% annual OEPS growth rate through 2027. And again, I'll just take this moment as an opportunity to remind folks, we project that growth rate off of year-end results for each year of the plan. So while we're now targeting the upper half of the current year guidance range, this flows through into the annual 68% NOEPS across the remainder of the plan period. Yes. Maybe I'll start, and then I'll pass things to Michael to touch on a couple of components that might be interesting in there.  But we plan to update all the long-term commitments, including growth rate, capital expenditures in that November time frame. So I think you hit the nail on the head. We'll look at all factors and provide as much visibility as we can into our business. As you know, we've got a backlog of identified and high-quality investment opportunities which support system reliability, sustainability, customer service, and our focus is really how can we efficiently access those investments at 1x rate base and convert that into NOEPS for our shareholders. The teams are studying that right now. We're going through that annual planning process. The results of that, we'll be able to share in the November time frame.  But Michael, do you want to hit any interesting ideas on that slide? Sorry. Just real quick. The only thing I'd add would be with those changes, the NIPSCO investment forecast of $2 billion to $2.2 billion is unchanged, yes. Yes. The first piece of the question, Julien, and this is Shawn. The first piece of the question, the incremental load that you're alluding to is not captured in the $1 billion. Said differently, the 2021 IRP projected capacity requirements and the load necessary for us to serve our communities, and it provided that with the existing footprint of assets that we're currently engaged commercially to construct. Incremental load would be captured in the next IRP and factored into any future generation planning. That next IRP would be 2024, so we would capture that upside as we rerun the scenarios around load factors next year.  And then the second part of your question, we expect that for purposes of calculating FFO, the treatment of tax credit transfers would be consistent with GAAP accounting. That should result in tax credit transfers flowing through the tax line and increasing FFO, and we understand that our credit rating agencies are evaluating that. But that methodology consistent with GAAP accounting seems to track with us, and we'll continue to stay engaged with the credit rating agencies as they continue their evaluation. Appreciate the question. So at this point, there's no change to the financing plan we shared at our Investor Day in November. So just to reiterate, this includes no new equity until 2025, no discrete equity issuances to the life of the plan, with ATM maintenance equity beginning towards the latter half of the planned horizon. As we complete the equity units for marketing transaction that we entered into 2021, we'll receive some additional proceeds there. As you know, we received proceeds when we close the transaction with Blackstone. That will provide us a credit cushion relative to the 14% to 16% FFO to debt. We'll be in the 14% to 16% FFO to debt range, but a credit cushion that we could use to apply towards CapEx in 2024 should we need to and should we identify incremental cap opportunities.  What we're currently doing right now is evaluating what those capital opportunities could look like, inclusive of tax equity and how that will create incremental cash flow as you'd expect coming out of our business, and then how that would impact our financing plan throughout the entire horizon. All of that, we expect to be able to step through in the November time frame so it's a bit too early to tell you exactly how that works. But the financing plan itself and the commitments we've made are still consistent with what we made in Investor Day."

            "content": "Thank you, Lloyd. I'll begin on Slide 9. NIPSCO's generation transition is continuing to advance as we optimize the new portfolio to benefit customers and retire all coal-fired generation by the end of 2028. Crossroads and Dunns Bridge I solar project advanced to their and are serving customers over the peak summer season. NIPSCO has now placed 4 utility-owned renewable investments into service from the 2018 integrated resource plan process. In total, these 4 projects represent approximately $800 million investment in 870 megawatts of economic, sustainable, 0 fuel cost, new generation for NIPSCO's Northern Indiana customers.  Construction on Calgary Solar Plus Storage and Dunns Bridge II Solar Plus Storage continues. Both projects have expected in service dates in 2024, and we are in the very early stages of construction of the Fairbanks Solar project, which has been expected in service date of mid-2025. Additionally, our work on Indiana Crossroads 2 Wind PPA is advancing and is expected in service late this year.  Today, we are announcing several adjustments to our remaining portfolio of projects address, development challenges and better align the portfolio with recent changes to MISO rules surrounding seasonal capacity constructs.  The first is the conversion of the Gibson PPA project to a build transfer agreement. We have filed a CPCN seeking approval from the IURC, and if approved, this project will replace the Elliott project in our portfolio. Second, we have sought regulatory approval for several recently executed PPAs: Appleseed Solar, Templeton Wind. Finally, the agreement for the Elliott PPA and the Brickyard and Greensboro PPAs have been mutually terminated by NIPSCO and the developers of these projects.  Four key points related to these projects. First, these economical and zero fuel cost resources continue to support customer affordability. Second, these changes support our current coal retirement schedule of all coal retired by the end of 2028. Third, the renewable generation in service by the end of 2025 will continue to consist of 8 build transfer agreements and 6 PPAs. And fourth, the revised portfolio progress is consistent with our current 5-year CapEx rate base financing and other prior commitments to the investment community.  Beyond these projects, our 2021 IRP and 2022 RFP processes laid the groundwork for the balance of projects needed to replace the Michigan City generating station by 2028. NIPSCO is implementing an upgrade at the Sugar Creek gas generating station this year, and we are finalizing our analysis of gas alternatives identified in our 2022 RFP, which we expect to result in a request for a new brownfield project at our Schahfer site. NIPSCO will continue to evaluate further generation portfolio needs, and we will be conducting the triannual integrated resource planning process with stakeholders in 2024. Fuel cost resources reduced customer build volatility and create substantial value for our customers, especially as they experience elevated economy-wide inflation. Since our first project went commercial in late 2020, we have been passing back both excess generation and renewable energy credits revenue to customers from this and subsequent projects. In the second quarter alone, that amount totaled $8.4 million or over $2 per residential customer, for a year-to-date total of $14.6 million.  As we look forward, Slide 10 shows additional CapEx opportunities not included in our financial plan through 2027. Multiple items on this list, both near term and longer term, are progressing well in their evaluation work streams. Prior to the Inflation Reduction Act, we beneficially employed tax equity financing on the 4 owned renewable projects in service to date, and our financial guidance incorporates tax equity financing for the remaining 4 projects in 2024 and 2025. However, given the new pathways for utilizing tax credits included in the IRA, we are evaluating the benefits of direct ownership for each of the remaining 4 build transfer projects, potentially adding incremental CapEx to the plan while enhancing the value for customers as well as portfolio and project flexibility.  We are also working through our long-term investment plans stemming from the proposed rules around the 2020 Federal Act, which will require incremental investment in our system for various leak reduction, safety and other operational requirements. These requirements would build on the investments we have been making on our advanced leak detection and repair program. We will continue to be active in this area to support the best outcome for customers in terms of safety, emissions and infrastructure investment.  These potential and current investments across our electric and gas businesses support our clean energy transition, furthering our Scope 1 emission reduction goals and enhancing customer value in a balanced way. At year-end 2022, NiSource achieved a 67% reduction in Scope 1 GHG emissions from 2005 baseline levels, and we remain on track to achieve an industry-leading 90% reduction in Scope 1 GHG emissions by 2030, and are advancing our goal of net 0 Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2040. At NiSource, we're very proud of our track record of decarbonization and focus on sustainability.  In addition to being named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, we are rated as AAA by MSCI for ESG and have been recognized as 1 of America's Most Responsible Companies for 2023 by Newsweek, and by Ford's Best Employers for Diversity in 2023. Our passion is to create value for our customers and communities through investment in and operation of our electric and gas systems that drive customer benefits in reliability, safety, sustainability and customer offering.  I'll now turn things over to Shawn. The only thing that I'll add to that, Shawn, is we continue to work through the different elements of it. They are progressing well in the work streams of those items, but also in more real terms. When we think about the '22 RFP and the work on that as we finalize it and as we mentioned before, that's going to come back relative to a potential brownfield associated with the site. We already mentioned the 2021 IRP relative to the potential for a new gas . And in addition to that, we continue to evaluate the remaining options in the portfolio that would allow us to meet the commitments that we set associated with the generation transition. Sure. Happy to do so. Thank you. When we look at it, just to reinforce, I mean we will continue to consist of 8 build transfer agreements and 6 PPAs, and the revised portfolio project is consistent with our current 5-year CapEx rate base financing other prior commitments. But to get a little bit more into your question, we're consistently looking through the portfolio and making sure that we're eliminating risk associated with delivery and providing the best options for customer costs associated with those projects, so we're always looking to optimize them. So as we go through site development and different activities with it, we looked at how to best optimize that portfolio, and that's what you're seeing being done here.  So by doing these projects and the way we've set them up, it gives us a lot of confidence in being able to execute on those plans and deliver those commitments as well as being able to provide the customers the benefits and meet MISO changes as well in the [indiscernible]. So I would say as we go through the projects and as we continue to provide information with IRC and other parties, we will provide updates to those projects as we go through each stage, just like we did with Gibson and the filing associated with that.  But relative to the full ownership, we're finishing our evaluation of the IRA. And as mentioned before, there are significant benefits with the IRA both in tax policy and the ability to maintain the full ownership, which benefits project and portfolio optimization. This gives the capability to remove administrative burden, complexity as well as to optimize the asset, and we're finishing that analysis now and expect to be able to conclude that. But in doing so, if we look at that right now, our plan assumes tax equity for the remaining 4 projects. If we -- pending regulatory approval, if all 4 were included under full ownership, that would require up to $1 billion in additional CapEx. Yes. So when you look at the current plan, the current plan assumes tax equity if full ownership was done for all 4 projects. Pending any regulatory approvals, it would be up to $1 billion in additional CapEx. Sure. Happy to do so. So when you look at it, was originally included as the that is being replaced by Gibson, assuming approved by the IURC that was filed. In addition to that, we terminated several PPAs and also added several PPAs, which have been filed with the IURC. So you look at Templeton Wind, Carpenter Wind, Appleseed Solar are all filed with IURC now, and those are really the fundamental changes.  So we had 8 BTAs before. We have 8 BTAs now, it's just Elliott to Gibson. And we have 6 PPAs before, we have 6 PPAs now. And it's Templeton and Carpenter Wind and Appleseed Solar in those versus like Brickyard and Greensboro and Gibson. Those were terminated. We'll get back to you on that. That's correct. It would be for the remaining 4 projects of the 8. All 8 projects right now in the plan assume tax equity. So it would be for the remaining 4 projects, Cavalry Solar and Storage, Dunns Bridge II Solar and Storage, Fairbanks and Gibson, pending regulatory approval associated with those that if those projects were under full ownership, it would be up to an incremental $1 billion in CapEx.  And the only thing I'd want to add to that is when we look at them, obviously, from the customer side and the benefits, we're making sure that we do full due diligence on that. And to follow up on the previous question just to make sure I got the mix right, it is next era for Templeton and Appleseed, and Carpenter is EDPR. Well, as we go through the projects and we work through just the normal process of developing the projects and develop -- negotiating the agreements, we're always looking as to how to make sure that we're eliminating risk and bringing in the benefits. So on these individual projects, you combine that with also how we're able to provide the best benefit to customers, and that's what fundamentally led to the changes associated with the projects. That had to do with subcomponents associated with whether it be development costs or certain costs associated with the each individual site, and we try to maintain a robust portfolio of development opportunities that enable us to have that flexibility associated with it. We know no plan goes exactly as planned, so therefore, we want to have flexibility in that plan. And really, it's just working through that normal process of project development, construction siting, et cetera. I'm sorry, can you repeat that? For which opportunity? Yes. So we're continuing to do the analysis associated with the . We know that looking at it that there would be significant additional requirements. We have not laid out a specific timeline associated with those activities yet or what that would mean relative to our CapEx or financial plans. But the team is well engaged, well underway and working through those as well as we're engaged on how those rules are promulgated and what -- and how we can best benefit customers. So we haven't completed the work associated with that. As we mentioned, there's additional CapEx included in the placeholder in the plan. We have significant work done from the 2022 RFP associated with that, which is concluding. But beyond that initial work, we will continue to look at opportunities around a diverse mix of assets that fill that $1 billion of CapEx, which is what we have targeted relative to the retirement of the 2028 [indiscernible].  So work is continuing. We'll have more updates as we go through the next Q, and we're continuing to work the '22 RFP associated with it to finalize that."

            "name": "Lloyd Yates",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Hopefully, you've all had a chance to read our second quarter earnings release issued earlier today.  I'll begin on Slide 6 to provide you with an update on our 3 key priorities. First, we are raising our 2023 non-GAAP NOEPS guidance the upper half of $1.54 to $1.60. We are also reaffirming our annual non-GAAP NOEPS growth of 6% to 8% through 2027, an annual rate base growth of 8% to 10%. Meanwhile, our non-tracked O&M target is to remain flat in 2023 as well as throughout the duration of the plan.  We continue building a track record of execution and growth, and our commitment to investors, employees and customers is central to everything we do. Recall our original 2023 NOEPS discrete guidance of $1.50 to $1.57 was introduced at our Investor Day in November. In February, we raised and narrowed our estimate to $1.54 to $1.60, and today, we are again raising to the upper half of this range. In the approximately 9 months since November, our superior operations, regulatory and financing execution have enabled this increase in earnings expectations. For our customers, commodity market conditions have been improving. However, inflation and interest rate headwinds continue to persist. Despite this, we remain focused on delivering value to our customers and highly visible, derisked financial results for our investors.  Second, our leading regulatory execution continued this quarter in both the electric and gas businesses. May was a particularly busy month for our gas distribution business, as the Columbia Gas of Maryland filed a request with the Maryland Public Service Commission, seeking approval to adjust base rates. The request seeks to recover approximately $40 million of capital investment.  Additionally, the Virginia State Corporation Commission approved a settlement among Columbia Gas of Virginia and the parties in its base rate case originally filed in April 2022. The base rate adjustment approval authorizes recovery of approximately $390 million of capital investment. Columbia Gas of Ohio's infrastructure replacement program [indiscernible] rates went into effect in May, initiating the recovery of $360 million of capital investment.  At the electric business, the record is closed in the Northern Indiana Public Service company's electric rate case. We believe the settlement reached back in March represents a balanced outcome for stakeholders, as the company invests billions of dollars in our customers and communities in the state. A final order is anticipated today from the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission with rates anticipated to be effective in steps by September 2023 and March 2024.  At FERC, we received approval for incentives on 2 new MISO electric transmission projects last month, supporting our rate base investment and customer reliability beyond our current financial plan through 2027. Lastly, in June, we announced a definitive agreement to sell a minority stake in NIPSCO to Blackstone Infrastructure Partners.  The transaction strengthens our balance sheet and financial flexibility marks yet another example of NiSource's steadfast execution for stakeholders. More importantly, it enables us to support ongoing investments in Indiana and our 1.3 million electric and gas customers in the state.  Slide 7 details our annual capital expenditures across our 6-state service territory. In a 5-year period, through 2027, we plan to invest $15 billion in our customers and communities.  At Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania, we are currently replacing 21,000 feet of pipe in Fredericktown in Washington County. Nearly half of the small town's residents will have their service lines upgraded, with the remaining customers to be upgraded in the next 2 years. As part of this project, Columbia Gas is converting a low-income housing authority system from a master meter to individual meters, helping to lower the authorities' maintenance obligations. This $6 million project is part of the company's $110 million capital investment in Pennsylvania during the second quarter alone.  NIPSCO remains committed to the gas [indiscernible] plan to extend gas service into rural areas including , Allen and Lake Counties in Northern Indiana. Our major projects in local operating area teams have installed over 24 miles of rural gas main and installed 1,170 new services year-to-date through June as part of this plan.  On the other side of our footprint, crews at Columbia Gas of Maryland are installing new pipe in the city of Cumberland to improve safety by abandoning 3 low-pressure regulator stations, along with abandoning a significant amount of bare steel pipe. This is part of an investment of nearly $8 million of total capital in the state during the second quarter.  Turn to Slide 8. It shows key rate case in select capital rider activity since 2021. Our leading regulatory execution continues with no less than 9 cases filed in 7 jurisdictions across 6 states in the last 3 years. Our state regulatory teams are in a constant cycle of communication and engagement with key intervenors, regulators and customer groups. In addition to general rate cases, regular capital tracker filings allow timely recovery on and of our investments.  All of this activity is built on a foundation of robust economic activity in our states. For example, at NIPSCO, the Northern Indiana Transportation District provides vital transportation links to Chicago and Cook County, Illinois, and is constructing the double-track Northwest Indiana project. The project is anticipated to expand service, improve mobility and accessibility and stimulate job creation for Southern Lake County, and we are in the process of constructing substations to support this major transportation investment in the region. In Ohio, the new Intel chip factory has been under construction since mid-2022 in County on the outskirts of Columbus. It is estimated to be a $20 billion investment in the state, and Intel will be a new Columbia Gas of Ohio customer.  In Virginia, the Norfolk naval shipyard is the Navy's primary East Coast repair, overhaul and modernization facility, and 1 of the 4 public shipyards that play a critical role in maintaining America's fleet. The shipyard is installing a combined heat and power plant expected to be complete later this year that will significantly improve energy security and efficiency, with expected consumption of 1.7 million decatherms annually for Columbia Gas of Virginia.  Customer count across our territories has been growing on average by 0.5% to 1% annually for years, including 2023 to date. Favorable demographic trends have driven inbound migration thanks to a stable and growing manufacturing base, robust utility and nonutility infrastructure and low tax rates in the states we serve.  Turning to another foundational element of value for our 4 million customers, our internal teams continue to advance on all aspects of our operational excellence initiatives. Project Apollo has tracked, generating efficiencies by doing things safer, better, more efficiently and for less cost. One recent example is establishing standard buffer zones around our underground infrastructure to indicate areas where digging can safely occur, especially for third-party excavators. Before instituting a zone, [indiscernible] of being called out to excavation sites to locate underground facilities when it wasn't needed. We've eliminated more than 10,000 unnecessary trips in the last 3 months, allowing more time to be spent on value-added work.  Technology investments are also key to our operational excellence initiative. This year, we began our 5-year, approximately $1 billion transformation, with an initial $300 million investment in SAP and Salesforce technology platform implementation that will standardize work practices and drive efficiencies for our employees to improve service to our customers. All of this is expected to contribute to keeping total customer bill levels and live with inflation over the 5-year financial plan. These achievements would not be possible without our dedicated employees and their commitment to our customers, communities and all NiSource's stakeholders.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Michael Luhrs. Thanks, Shawn. And before we take questions, I'd like to share some late-breaking news with the investor community. We just received an order from the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission for the NIPSCO electric rate case. And upon the initial review, it appears the settlement in the NIPSCO's case has been approved without modification. The team is reviewing the details of the order, and if we see anything different, we'll let you know as soon as possible. And just let me give you a couple of highlights. A revenue increase of $292 million, return on equity of 9.8% and an increase -- rate base increase of slightly over $1.8 billion.  I want to publicly thank the IURC for their diligence in review of this quarter, the team and all the stakeholders that contribute to what we believe is a very balanced solution.  And with that, we'll open the floor for questions. Thank you. So I'll let Shawn handle the details. But when you think about the second half of the year, I think the thing to contemplate is all of the great regulatory execution we had, including the from Indiana today, and continue to drive savings by Apollo.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Shawn for details of that comment. Shawn? So that was really a good way to ask that question, Shar. Let me start there. And I don't want to comment on specific details. Of course, like most companies, our policies, we don't comment on market room, of course, specific details.  What I will comment on though is back in November on Investor Day, we laid out what I thought, and I think this team and our Board thinks, is a really, really good plan. We're going to grow our earnings 6% to 8% annually off end of year results, 8% to 10% rate base growth. We put forth a transaction, 19.9% of the NIPSCO utility to strengthen our balance sheet. And what I will tell you is as we did the business review last year, that was the only transaction we contemplated, and we are laser-focused on getting that done. So you mentioned we haven't finished that transaction yet. That transaction is to be finished by the end of this year. We're laser focused on that transaction, investing $15 billion of capital, making sure we operate in an excellent way and growing earnings, and that is where the whole NiSource team is zeroing down on. Yours was good. Yes, you are. Yes, so thanks for asking that question. I think what we're seeing is employees getting excited and finding better and more ideas for cost savings. I think when you drill down into the organization, employees know what holds them up and getting more work done, and we're getting after it. I think this will be a continuous improvement mindset. We're driving it throughout the company to do things safer, better, faster and more efficiently. But again, this is an employee-driven ideas. It's process driven and we're finding significant savings, and I expect this to continue on for a really long time. In fact, I expect it to start accelerating in 2024 and beyond. But delivering the savings now, looking forward acceleration process next year for even more savings. Michael? We've done the filings associated with them, and in those filings, I believe that we have said who they are with. Yes. will get back to you with those names. The IURC, I think the State of Indiana in general, there's very good support for this renewables program. And I think what drove it, the amount of stakeholder engagement that got done upfront, I think what we're seeing is the benefit of stakeholder engagement with the IURC, the industrial customers, the commercial customers, the legislators. And I think it's been settlement, rate case approval, filings.  So we believe and we continue -- not believe, we know we have very good support from the IURC in the state of Indiana, and we think that we're doing this transition in a way that really makes sense from a clean energy perspective and a reliability perspective. Right. So we're -- I mean, we're investing $15 billion of capital at 1x rate base. Someone wants to sell us an asset that creates significant shareholder value at less than that, I think the probability of that is really low, but our focus is our plan. I think we're working through that process in November. Whether it be an EEI or via our earnings call, we'll have those plans more formalized and laid out. We'll get them to you as soon as we have them. So I would say to you, as I sit in the seat, a little over 1.5 years, more confidence in our ability to execute on the regulatory front. I think that we have just really superior regulatory execution capabilities. As I spend more time on the operating side and look at the cost savings on here,and savings without taking additional risk but really becoming better operational excellence. I'm seeing a lot more momentum gains, so -- and I have confidence in this management team. And we've put this management team in place, we're really working well together. They're probably 1 of the best management teams in the industry, and it's working really well so it's given us more confidence to deliver our earnings to investors. I think we're doing better on the customer side and better in our communities, and our employees like working here better. So I think it's an overall confidence rising across all of NiSource."

Please refer to the supplemental slides, segment information and full financial schedules for information on the most directly comparable GAAP measure and a reconciliation of these measures. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Lloyd.\nLloyd Yates: Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Hopefully, you\u2019ve all had a chance to read our first quarter earnings release issued earlier today. I\u2019ll begin on slide seven by reviewing our three key priorities for 2023. First, NiSource remains committed to delivering on our top-tier EPS growth plan. We are reaffirming non-GAAP NOEPS guidance of $1.54 to $1.60 in 2023 and growth of 6% to 8% annually through 2027. Annual rate base growth of 8% to 10% is projected, driven by $15 billion of capital expenditures during the 2023 to 2027 period. Meanwhile, our O&M target is to remain flat in 2023, as well as throughout the duration of the plan. Second, strong regulatory execution continued in the first quarter, advancing balanced outcomes for all our stakeholders. In March, a settlement agreement was filed in Northern Indiana Public Service Company\u2019s electric rate case. The proposed settlement incorporates $1.8 billion of incremental capital investments made on behalf of the customers since 2019, including renewable generation projects, grid modernization and other customer-centric improvements to enhance safety, service and reliability. The settlement represents a $292 million revenue increase. A final order is anticipated in August with rates effective in 2023 and 2024. We Additionally, Gas Distribution and regulatory execution has also advanced with the Columbia Gas of Ohio rate case settlement approval and implementation during the first quarter. The company\u2019s tracked infrastructure replacement programs are executing on plan for 2023 as highlighted by Ohio\u2019s recently approved Infrastructure Replacement Program, authorized a recovery of $36 million of capital investment targeting safety enhancements in our gas system. Lastly, the sale of the NIPSCO minority interest remains on track for 2023. As previously indicated, the proceeds generated from this financing transaction will immediately strengthen our balance sheet and will enable NiSource to draw upon the portfolio of capital investment opportunities to enhance shareholder value while enhancing safety and reliability for our customers. This includes continuing commitments in Indiana, supporting major generation projects, new customer connections and capital enhancements to existing electric and gas infrastructure to add resiliency to our system. We look forward to continuing to serve the State of Indiana in all of our operating service territories for many years to come. Shifting to our generation transition. NiSource has been a leader among U.S. utilities in the speed of our energy transition, advancing one of the largest projected carbon intensity reductions by the end of this decade. NiSource remains focused and committed to an orderly conversation when the energy transition by leveraging energy delivery solutions across diversified systems. Our team continues to work on developing new generation capacity and a collaborative process started in 2018, involving stakeholder groups, including our customers, communities, regulators and policymakers. Michael will touch upon the commercialization process for energy solutions, replacing our core retirements in a moment. The established regulatory constructs that utilize tracked capital investment programs and forward test year rate cases allow our investors a consistent and predictable return on billions of dollars of funding for investment in these critical energy facilities. Indiana\u2019s supportive and constructive regulatory mechanisms have enabled NIPSCO to time the construction of these facilities alongside regulatory plans as contemplated in our proposed rate case settlement, which has enabled NiSource to minimize unnecessary financing expense for our customers and reduce regulatory lag. We continue to be encouraged by the active dialogue on electric reliability, affordability and sustainability in our region. Throughout the last two years of global inflationary pressure, supply chain constraints, policy uncertainty and commodity volatility, we have remained confident in the value of these investments for our customers. These new projects are projected to provide savings consistent with original expectations, while delivering the reliable energy our customers deserve. I\u2019d also like to give you an update on our progress on operational excellence, which continues to prioritize safety, while optimizing our long-term growth profile. We have formally launched Project Apollo, one part of our enterprise-wide transformation effort. Project Apollo contains several initiatives we anticipate driving an annual savings range of $40 million to $60 million beginning in 2023. We expect to share more on the progress of the portfolio of initiatives inside Project Apollo as they advance to drive greater value for stakeholders. Project Apollo fits within our broader focus on operational excellence, safety, O&M management and unlocking efficiencies across our operations, enabling us to streamline work and improve logistics company-wide. Complementary to Project Apollo is our previously announced long-term plan to invest almost $1 billion in proven technologies to change how we plan, schedule and execute work in the field, and how we engage and provide service to our customers. These investments will improve both the customer and employee experience, but are also intended to reduce our overall cost profile. Taken together, these investments and process changes will be critical components of our overall transformation efforts to allow us to maintain flat O&M and be safer and more efficient in everything we do. More importantly, this helps sustain customer affordability with expected total annual rate increases that are in line with inflation. I\u2019d like to recognize our dedicated employees and contractors who worked tirelessly to ensure our communities receive safe and reliable energy during the quarter. In late February, went a storm outlive bought freezing rain and significant ice to Northeast Indiana, impacting distribution switches, lines and tree limbs. Nearly all customers had power restored the next day and work was completed without compromising our safety standards. Now for updates on our electric operations and renewable projects, I\u2019m excited to welcome Michael Luhrs to the NiSource team as Executive Vice President of Strategy and Risk and Chief Commercial Officer. Michael, who has more than 25 years in the utility industry as another level of depth and expertise to our already strong management team. Now, Michael, over to you.\nMichael Luhrs: Thank you, Lloyd, and good morning, everyone. On slides nine through 11, you will find some supporting information about our gas and electric operations. As the newly named strategy Risk and Chief Commercial Officer, one of my primary focuses is to optimize and enhance the current growth plan with additional opportunities found on slide eight. Going forward, you\u2019ll hear more from me on these and other investment opportunities, which are enabled by our capabilities in gas and electric. These opportunities support our clean energy transition, as well as improving safety, reliability, furthering our Scope 1 emission reduction goals and enhancing customer value in a balanced way. At year-end 2022, NiSource achieved a 67% reduction in Scope 1 GHG emissions from 2005 baseline levels. And we remain on track to achieve an industry-leading 90% reduction in Scope 1 GHG emissions by 2030 and our goal of net zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2040. NIPSCO\u2019s generation transition is continuing to advance as we optimize the new portfolio to benefit customers and retire all coal-fired generation by the end of 2028. All of the renewable generation projects remain on target with previously revised in-service dates. As a few examples, our first two solar projects, Dunns Bridge 1 and Indiana Crossroads Solar are expected to be in service by the end of the second quarter. Construction on Cavalry Solar Plus Storage and Dunns Bridge 2 Solar Plus Storage has kicked off in earnest with expected in-service dates in 2024. Construction of our Indiana Crossroads 2 Wind PPA is advancing and is expected in service late this year. Additionally, we are finalizing our due diligence on the results of our targeted RFP event that sought bids for the construction of a gas peaking capacity at our Schahfer site, consistent with our 2021 Integrated Resource Plan. We are evaluating the provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act and its applicability to projects in our generation portfolio, including the potential application of tax transferability. We believe the legislation has enabled opportunities to drive greater value to both customers and shareholders. NIPSCO\u2019s generation transition is already providing benefits to customers in multiple ways, including reduced fuel cost volatility and monetizing off-system sales and REC sales. For example, during the run-up in market prices in November and December of last year as a result of winter storms, our wind renewable assets generated nearly 529,000 megawatt hours of low-cost energy, saving customers an estimated $11 million compared to what NIPSCO would have otherwise purchased in the market. In addition, over 2022 and through the first quarter of 2023, NIPSCO\u2019s renewable projects contributed a total of more than $35 million of combined off-system sales and renewable energy credit sales that are being passed back to customers through NIPSCO\u2019s Fuel Adjustment Clause and Regional Transmission Organization Adjustment Tracker filings. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Shawn, who will discuss our financial performance in more detail.\nShawn Anderson: Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Reviewing our first quarter 2023 results on slide 12. First quarter non-GAAP net operating earnings were $343 million or $0.77 per share, compared to $329 million or $0.75 per share in the first quarter of 2022. This solid start to the year gives me even greater confidence in meeting all of our financial commitments, including our existing earnings guidance range of $1.54 to $1.60 for 2023, which reflects the increase in range shared in February. Slide 13 shows segment detail and key drivers of our results. Gas Distribution operating earnings were $478 million in the first quarter, an increase of $73 million versus the same quarter last year. New rates and capital investment programs drove approximately $83 million of incremental revenue, including general rate case contributions in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Virginia and Maryland. Capital trackers in Ohio, Kentucky and Virginia positively impacted the segment as well. These infrastructure trackers help us recover a return from over $1 billion of capital investments made in 2022, which improves safety and reliability across our portfolio and drove nearly 30% of the revenue growth in the Gas Distribution segment. This is tangible evidence of how these mechanisms enable investments in our communities and drive returns for our shareholders. On the expense side, higher outside service and uncollectible accounts were an approximately $4 million headwind. Electric operating earnings were $83 million in the first quarter, a decrease of $16 million versus the same quarter last year. Lower customer usage more than offset the increased revenue from new rates and higher generation-related outside service costs, drive increased O&M expense versus last year. Corporate and other operating earnings increased $12 million, driven partially by lower outside services costs. I would also highlight that on a consolidated basis, the first quarter results reflect lower non-tracked O&M expenses that represent some early progress towards achieving our focus on flat O&M this year. Now I\u2019d like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of March 31, 2023, was $11.6 billion, of which $10.3 billion was long-term debt, with a weighted average maturity of 13 years and a weighted average interest rate of 3.8%. At the end of the first quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of $2.3 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization programs. And as stated in the past, we remain committed to our current investment-grade credit ratings. Slide 14 addresses our financing strategy and credit commitments. We issued a $750 million five-year note at 5.25% in March and we\u2019ll use the proceeds to fund our capital plan. It is likely we will execute another debt issuance later this year to fund our renewables projects. Our financing plan remains unchanged from Investor Day in November, with zero discrete equity issuances through 2027, zero ATM equity usage in 2023 and 2024, and the financing plan is reflected in all our earnings growth and credit commitments. Stepping back to another key area of focus we discussed in November, customer affordability remains a primary consideration for NiSource as we serve our customers. The geographical benefits of the location of our NiSource operating companies have helped stabilize customer bills greatly in the first quarter of 2023, specifically as we observe natural gas prices decline across the broader country and in specific in our operating companies, given their close proximity to robust shale formations in the Midwest. Gas prices have fallen significantly throughout the operating region in the first quarter, averaging $2.65 per MMBtu at NYMEX, far lower than the $5.57 per MMBtu observed in the fourth quarter of 2022. In 2022, commodity costs represent approximately 45% of an average residential customer total bill across our gas business. The nearly 50% reduction in commodity costs across nearly half of an average customer bill will translate into lower bills. Fuel pass-through mechanisms throughout our jurisdictions enable these falling natural gas prices to drive a near-term positive impact on customers. On average, these mechanisms update every 90 days, enabling customers to participate early in these reductions. The rate design leverage by the majority of our gas operating companies also emphasizes non-volumetric charges, which helps reduce bill volatility. We have witnessed this being realized in both an unseasonably warm first quarter of 2023 and a colder than normal 2022. In addition to the benefit this has to enhance build visibility for our customers, it stabilizes NiSource\u2019s working capital needs and its associated interest expense to minimize non-beneficial financial carrying charges. The combination of safe and reliable customer service, strong regulatory execution and diligent financial management, continued to propel a premium business plan for the NiSource operating companies. We\u2019re excited about the progress our teams have made in just the last quarter and the experience and strength of our teams will enhance value creation for all stakeholders as we execute a best-in-class business plan. In both 2021 and 2022, we exceeded our EPS guidance ranges. Last fall, we established our premium 6% to 8% long-term growth plan, while incorporating challenging commodity interest rates and supply chain environments into our plans. Despite this, in February, we raised 2023 EPS guidance and have had a great start to this year in executing our regulatory, operational and financing plans as we just highlighted. All of this gives me greater confidence we can deliver on all of our financial commitments, including the 2023 guidance of $1.54 to $1.60. Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. We\u2019re now ready to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open.\nShahriar Pourreza: Hey, guys.\nLloyd Yates: Hey. Good morning.\nShawn Anderson: Good morning, Shahriar.\nShahriar Pourreza: Good morning. Good morning. Just first on NIPSCO. I mean, obviously, Indiana doesn\u2019t require a long approval process, but obviously, sometimes going to be needed between an announcement and transaction closing. Has any -- I guess, has any of your sort of transaction expectations change? There\u2019s a lot of assets for sale, capital market conditions have somewhat changed. Just want to get a sense there and how we should think about the timing and pace of any disclosures between now and year-end? Thanks.\nLloyd Yates: What I\u2019ll say, and I\u2019ll let Shawn is leading the NIPSCO process. But with respect to initial minority sale, I mean, we\u2019re right on target as we laid out at an Investor Day. Shawn, anything -- any more detail?\nShawn Anderson: We remain confident in the process and the minority interest sale process itself is on track for 2023, as Lloyd highlighted. Shahriar, just a quick point. We don\u2019t anticipate a requirement for the transaction approval from the IURC, although we plan to engage the IURC as we already have to discuss the transaction and file an informational update with the IURC once we reach an agreement.\nShahriar Pourreza: Got it. And then just maybe the opposite side, Lloyd, there\u2019s a lot of gas LDCs heading the market, which I think seems to be all at the same time, is there sort of an interest there?\nLloyd Yates: Well, I\u2019ll say, as a standard course, we don\u2019t comment on, I\u2019ll say, potential for M&A or market rumors. But as I\u2019ve always said, if something shows up, that\u2019s going to create opportunity will create shareholder value. I mean NiSource will be diligent in taking a look at that. You\u2019ve all heard me say in the past, if someone wants to sell a great jurisdiction at one-time rate base gave us a call. But all that being said, what I\u2019ll say to you is, we\u2019re focused on our plan and we\u2019re laser-focused on a minority sale of NIPSCO and our growth plan that we laid, which includes growing rate base 8% to 10% by investing $15 billion through 2027 and that\u2019s really where our current focus is.\nShahriar Pourreza: Got it. Perfect. And then just super, lastly for me is, what is we\u2019re kind of thinking about that 6% to 8% annual growth rate through 2027. Can you just maybe remind us what you guys assume even on a percentage basis, what renewable projects are going to be owned versus PPA? And I guess I\u2019m more curious how that calculus could change post IRA. Could we see some more accretive opportunities versus plan? Thanks.\nMichael Luhrs: So when we\u2019re looking at -- this is Michael Lower. So when we\u2019re looking at those different projects, I mean, we are on track relative to our revised 2022 plan. We have two in service, two nearing completion and four that are in the late-stage of development and early construction. And I would say post-IRA, as I mentioned earlier, we see potential benefits associated with that. We continue to evaluate it relative to the tax transferability and our NiSource tax appetite, but it does appear to have customer benefits, as well as shareholder benefits.\nLloyd Yates: But we don\u2019t have that into our financial plan yet.\nShahriar Pourreza: Okay. Perfect. That\u2019s what I was trying to get at. Thank you so much. Well, I appreciate it guys.\nLloyd Yates: All right.\nOperator: The next question is from Richard Sunderland with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nRichard Sunderland: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for the time today.\nLloyd Yates: Good morning.\nRichard Sunderland: Starting with this\u2026\nShawn Anderson: Good morning, Richard.\nRichard Sunderland: Thanks. Starting with this Indiana ROFR legislation, how do you see this impacting your transmission opportunities. Any way to quantify the magnitude of impact here or what you\u2019re focused on now on the back of this? \nLloyd Yates: One, let me start with, we\u2019re really excited about the ROFR legislation. It got signed by the Governor yesterday in Indiana and we see that as an opportunity for the NIPSCO utility in Indiana, along with the other utilities. But I\u2019ll let Melody, who is President of our Regulated Utilities answer any more detail.\nMelody Birmingham: Hi, there. Thanks, Lloyd. This is Melody. Yes. We are excited about the signage of the ROFR legislation. We see this as a great opportunity for our company, as well as our customers, because this legislation will allow us to build, own and operate those transmission assets on our system. So we\u2019re looking forward to being able to engage in doing so as this is something that helps -- this bill helps provide clarity for us to be able to build on and operate transmission.\nLloyd Yates: So, again, upside to our capital plan, you saw on our page -- what\u2019s that page\u2026\nMelody Birmingham: Eight.\nLloyd Yates: \u2026on page - on slide eight, some of the potential upside to our capital plan that was transmission build. This will solidify our opportunity to build those, but continue to work with MISO to quantify the magnitude of those opportunities. So that\u2019s upcoming in the future.\nRichard Sunderland: Understood. Very clear. And then just one small cleanup question for me. Lloyd, it sounds like the O&M focus and the outlook there is unchanged. Just wanted to briefly address the language on slide four in the slides. It looks like that has changed a little bit, though, around flat O&M in the last slide versus the new language in the 1Q deck. Is that indicative of anything or any change in the backdrop, just wanted to be clear there?\nLloyd Yates: No. I think our focus hasn\u2019t changed at all. We laid out at Investor Day flat O&M through 2027. We\u2019re continuing to focus on that. We instituted a Project Apollo, assembling a team of people. We have a set of initiatives that we\u2019ve established to drive that cost out of the business and we\u2019re on track to accomplish that. So flat through 2027.\nRichard Sunderland: Got it. Very clear. Thank you for the time today.\nLloyd Yates: You are welcome.\nOperator: The next question is from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey. Good morning, team. Thanks for taking my question. Hey. Just\u2026\nLloyd Yates: Good morning.\nDurgesh Chopra: Good morning, Lloyd. Just a finer point on the NIPSCO process. Maybe can you just, at a high level, talk about the interest in those assets and has that changed since you sort of announced that process or at least announced the sale at the Analyst Day last year?\nLloyd Yates: Shawn?\nShawn Anderson: Hey, Durgesh. How are you? Good morning. We\u2019ve observed a broad range of qualified buyers, all of which are positioned to help NIPSCO and NiSource realize its strategic goals. We remain confident this is the right audience to help evaluate a partnership with NiSource just as we laid out in November. But we\u2019re also confident this is the process that we\u2019ve launched to a successful outcome this year. So the summary, I think, to your question, Durgesh, is no change.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. Thank you. That\u2019s very clear. And then maybe if I can just ask you, Shawn, just in terms of we\u2019ve seen a lot of accretive convert being issued in the market. I know you have a small amount of equity potential equity in the plan 2025 plus any thoughts on that front? Would that be a financing opportunity that you could explore?\nShawn Anderson: Well, first and foremost, just to reiterate, there\u2019s no change to the financing plan, which we shared at our Investor Day in November. And to your point, we don\u2019t see the need for any equity in the plan until no earlier than 2025. Obviously, we\u2019ll evaluate the marketplace between now and then and evaluate what opportunities we have to maximize the greatest value for our shareholders, both minimizing the need for equity and/or minimizing the need for any ancillary interest expense that we would otherwise have as drag. And as I\u2019d say, in the context of evaluating things, we\u2019re considering that 14% to 16% FFO-to-debt range and the opportunities we have to create organic cash flow inside our business can also be an augmentation to drive greater FFO. That\u2019s an area of focus for us, which will also help us minimize financing. So the fundamental point, no change to anything that we\u2019ve laid out since November, but we\u2019ll be active in minimizing financing costs across our business and all avenues.\nDurgesh Chopra: Understood. Thanks, guys, and congrats on all the leadership announcement and Shawn to you on your first call as CFO.\nLloyd Yates: Thank you, Durgesh. Appreciate it very much. Appreciate your support.\nOperator: The next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nLloyd Yates: Good morning, Julien.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hi. Good morning, team. Hey. Thank you for the time.\nLloyd Yates: Hi. Good morning.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Appreciate it. Hey. Look, let me just actually recap a prior question quickly. Just with respect to the M&A commentary earlier, Lloyd, I know you were trying to be a little bit more casual. But geographically, is there an interest in any particular region or any kind of type of asset? I mean, when you think of -- you open up that kind of worms. So I\u2019m just curious if you have any thoughts on what direction or regionally?\nLloyd Yates: I don\u2019t believe I opened up that can of worms. What I believe I said whether we don\u2019t comment on market rumors or M&A and that we are really focused on executing the plan that we laid out on Investor Day, growing rate base 8% to 10% and invested $15 billion in capital across NiSource. On the other hand, what I did say, if someone wants to sell something to us at one-time rate base, give us a call.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay. All right. Fair enough. I wanted to put a cap on it. All right. Excellent.\nLloyd Yates: Yeah.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Thank you. And then speaking of other issues discussed, you addressed ROFR, you alluded to the transmission opportunity in the slide. But then if I can pivot back here and talk a little bit more specifically, can you comment about your thought process on other legislation, right? There are a few other things out there as best I can tell that, that could potentially add to your investment and/or risk or derisk your profile in the legislature.\nLloyd Yates: Any specific state you\u2019re interested in talking about in general?\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Sorry, Indiana. Sorry. I apologize. I was thinking Indiana. I should have said that, right? I know we addressed the ROFR. There\u2019s a few other things spending. Any thoughts on that?\nLloyd Yates: Melody?\nMelody Birmingham: Hi, there, Julien. When it comes to mind is House Bill 1421 and that\u2019s the Natural Gas Generation Bill, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s one you\u2019re referring to. But prior to this bill, this was signed by the Governor. And so prior to the bill, CPCNs for our natural gas projects had no maximum time for the IRC to issue an order. However, now the order must be issued no later than 240 days after the filing for a CPCN. So that is positive. It provides us, again, more clarity and assurance to receive a bill as we\u2019re trying to move forward with generation. So that\u2019s a positive. But from what I\u2019ve seen, Julien, we have such a healthy regulatory environment in Indiana and we\u2019ve worked with our commission, public staff, as well as stakeholders to make sure we\u2019re doing what\u2019s fast for the utility of our customers in the state. So there may be more to come. But at this time, ROFR is a great bill, a great outcome that will allow us to continue to invest in our transmission system.\nLloyd Yates: And to add on to what Melody said, I think that the legislative environment in Indiana is also really healthy\u2026\nMelody Birmingham: It is.\nLloyd Yates: \u2026 with respect to utilities, balancing reliability, affordability, clean energy and customer needs. And we like doing business there, we are intimately involved with talking to all of these stakeholders and we think it\u2019s a great place to live and do business.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. All right. I will leave it there. Thank you, guys. We\u2019ll follow up off-line.\nLloyd Yates: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question is from Travis Miller with Morningstar. Your line is open.\nTravis Miller: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nLloyd Yates: Good morning.\nShawn Anderson: Good morning, Travis.\nTravis Miller: I wonder if you could dig a little more into the weather impact for the quarter. It saw the $32 million. I am wondering if there was any additional and operating revenues and then related, I suppose, what the decoupling or recovery -- weather recovery mechanisms would be across the jurisdictions.\nLloyd Yates: Shawn, why don\u2019t you take that one?\nShawn Anderson: Sure. Sure. Thanks. Hey. Great question. As we experienced, we did experience a drop in heating grid days, which the sector is more broadly realized during the first quarter. And certainly, we watch these weather impacts as we understand how they translate into both bill volatility, up or down for our customers, as well as financing costs in terms of working capital. To your point, weather decoupling mechanisms across our service territories, in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky and Maryland helped provide some level of cash flow stabilization during these weather volatile moments such as fourth quarter 2022, but also, of course, what we just experienced here in this quarter. The highlight of these mechanisms, just to remind folks, I\u2019m sure you all know, but best-in-class mechanism in Ohio. It\u2019s a straight fixed variable rate design in Ohio, our largest LDC, nearly 1.5 million customers. It provides a complete mitigation on the margin impact for NiSource associated with weather and usage. So all of that is a strong visibility item for us around what revenues we can realize across our service territories when weather goes up or goes down. And again, it also provides better bill stabilization for our customers, particularly for a gas business in the first quarter when bills tend to be higher than usual, it helps to mitigate the overall cost to the customer and provide better line of sight with a higher fixed charge like Ohio has.\nTravis Miller: Okay. Is it fair then to say that Indiana weather impacts are in operating revenues, the way to interpret the accounting. Okay. Okay. And then unrelated to that, I am wondering on the settlement in Indiana on the electric side, is there anything in there that you think regulators might push back on that could delay the approval process?\nLloyd Yates: So the answer to that would be generally no. If you look at the history -- our history in Indiana, the Indiana Commission for the most part has approved the settlements that the parties have submitted and we don\u2019t expect to see anything different.\nTravis Miller: Okay. Great. I appreciate the time.\nOperator: We have no further questions. At this time, I\u2019ll turn it over to Lloyd Yates for any closing remarks.\nLloyd Yates: Appreciate it. Thanks for the questions. Thanks for supporting NiSource. Looking forward to seeing everyone at the AGA Financial Conference. Have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Slide 13 shows segment detail and key drivers of our results. Gas Distribution operating earnings were $478 million in the first quarter, an increase of $73 million versus the same quarter last year. New rates and capital investment programs drove approximately $83 million of incremental revenue, including general rate case contributions in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Virginia and Maryland. Capital trackers in Ohio, Kentucky and Virginia positively impacted the segment as well. These infrastructure trackers help us recover a return from over $1 billion of capital investments made in 2022, which improves safety and reliability across our portfolio and drove nearly 30% of the revenue growth in the Gas Distribution segment. This is tangible evidence of how these mechanisms enable investments in our communities and drive returns for our shareholders. On the expense side, higher outside service and uncollectible accounts were an approximately $4 million headwind. Electric operating earnings were $83 million in the first quarter, a decrease of $16 million versus the same quarter last year. Lower customer usage more than offset the increased revenue from new rates and higher generation-related outside service costs, drive increased O&M expense versus last year. Corporate and other operating earnings increased $12 million, driven partially by lower outside services costs. I would also highlight that on a consolidated basis, the first quarter results reflect lower non-tracked O&M expenses that represent some early progress towards achieving our focus on flat O&M this year. Now I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of March 31, 2023, was $11.6 billion, of which $10.3 billion was long-term debt, with a weighted average maturity of 13 years and a weighted average interest rate of 3.8%. At the end of the first quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of $2.3 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization programs. And as stated in the past, we remain committed to our current investment-grade credit ratings. Slide 14 addresses our financing strategy and credit commitments. We issued a $750 million five-year note at 5.25% in March and we'll use the proceeds to fund our capital plan. It is likely we will execute another debt issuance later this year to fund our renewables projects. Our financing plan remains unchanged from Investor Day in November, with zero discrete equity issuances through 2027, zero ATM equity usage in 2023 and 2024, and the financing plan is reflected in all our earnings growth and credit commitments. Stepping back to another key area of focus we discussed in November, customer affordability remains a primary consideration for NiSource as we serve our customers. The geographical benefits of the location of our NiSource operating companies have helped stabilize customer bills greatly in the first quarter of 2023, specifically as we observe natural gas prices decline across the broader country and in specific in our operating companies, given their close proximity to robust shale formations in the Midwest. Gas prices have fallen significantly throughout the operating region in the first quarter, averaging $2.65 per MMBtu at NYMEX, far lower than the $5.57 per MMBtu observed in the fourth quarter of 2022. In 2022, commodity costs represent approximately 45% of an average residential customer total bill across our gas business. The nearly 50% reduction in commodity costs across nearly half of an average customer bill will translate into lower bills. Fuel pass-through mechanisms throughout our jurisdictions enable these falling natural gas prices to drive a near-term positive impact on customers. On average, these mechanisms update every 90 days, enabling customers to participate early in these reductions. The rate design leverage by the majority of our gas operating companies also emphasizes non-volumetric charges, which helps reduce bill volatility. We have witnessed this being realized in both an unseasonably warm first quarter of 2023 and a colder than normal 2022. In addition to the benefit this has to enhance build visibility for our customers, it stabilizes NiSource's working capital needs and its associated interest expense to minimize non-beneficial financial carrying charges. The combination of safe and reliable customer service, strong regulatory execution and diligent financial management, continued to propel a premium business plan for the NiSource operating companies. We're excited about the progress our teams have made in just the last quarter and the experience and strength of our teams will enhance value creation for all stakeholders as we execute a best-in-class business plan. In both 2021 and 2022, we exceeded our EPS guidance ranges. Last fall, we established our premium 6% to 8% long-term growth plan, while incorporating challenging commodity interest rates and supply chain environments into our plans. Despite this, in February, we raised 2023 EPS guidance and have had a great start to this year in executing our regulatory, operational and financing plans as we just highlighted. All of this gives me greater confidence we can deliver on all of our financial commitments, including the 2023 guidance of $1.54 to $1.60. Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. We're now ready to take your questions. Good morning, Shahriar. We remain confident in the process and the minority interest sale process itself is on track for 2023, as Lloyd highlighted. Shahriar, just a quick point. We don't anticipate a requirement for the transaction approval from the IURC, although we plan to engage the IURC as we already have to discuss the transaction and file an informational update with the IURC once we reach an agreement. Good morning, Richard. Hey, Durgesh. How are you? Good morning. We've observed a broad range of qualified buyers, all of which are positioned to help NIPSCO and NiSource realize its strategic goals. We remain confident this is the right audience to help evaluate a partnership with NiSource just as we laid out in November. But we're also confident this is the process that we've launched to a successful outcome this year. So the summary, I think, to your question, Durgesh, is no change. Well, first and foremost, just to reiterate, there's no change to the financing plan, which we shared at our Investor Day in November. And to your point, we don't see the need for any equity in the plan until no earlier than 2025. Obviously, we'll evaluate the marketplace between now and then and evaluate what opportunities we have to maximize the greatest value for our shareholders, both minimizing the need for equity and/or minimizing the need for any ancillary interest expense that we would otherwise have as drag. And as I'd say, in the context of evaluating things, we're considering that 14% to 16% FFO-to-debt range and the opportunities we have to create organic cash flow inside our business can also be an augmentation to drive greater FFO. That's an area of focus for us, which will also help us minimize financing. So the fundamental point, no change to anything that we've laid out since November, but we'll be active in minimizing financing costs across our business and all avenues. Good morning, Travis. Sure. Sure. Thanks. Hey. Great question. As we experienced, we did experience a drop in heating grid days, which the sector is more broadly realized during the first quarter. And certainly, we watch these weather impacts as we understand how they translate into both bill volatility, up or down for our customers, as well as financing costs in terms of working capital. To your point, weather decoupling mechanisms across our service territories, in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky and Maryland helped provide some level of cash flow stabilization during these weather volatile moments such as fourth quarter 2022, but also, of course, what we just experienced here in this quarter. The highlight of these mechanisms, just to remind folks, I'm sure you all know, but best-in-class mechanism in Ohio. It's a straight fixed variable rate design in Ohio, our largest LDC, nearly 1.5 million customers. It provides a complete mitigation on the margin impact for NiSource associated with weather and usage. So all of that is a strong visibility item for us around what revenues we can realize across our service territories when weather goes up or goes down. And again, it also provides better bill stabilization for our customers, particularly for a gas business in the first quarter when bills tend to be higher than usual, it helps to mitigate the overall cost to the customer and provide better line of sight with a higher fixed charge like Ohio has."

            "name": "Michael Luhrs",
            "content": "Thank you, Lloyd, and good morning, everyone. On slides nine through 11, you will find some supporting information about our gas and electric operations. As the newly named strategy Risk and Chief Commercial Officer, one of my primary focuses is to optimize and enhance the current growth plan with additional opportunities found on slide eight. Going forward, you'll hear more from me on these and other investment opportunities, which are enabled by our capabilities in gas and electric. These opportunities support our clean energy transition, as well as improving safety, reliability, furthering our Scope 1 emission reduction goals and enhancing customer value in a balanced way. At year-end 2022, NiSource achieved a 67% reduction in Scope 1 GHG emissions from 2005 baseline levels. And we remain on track to achieve an industry-leading 90% reduction in Scope 1 GHG emissions by 2030 and our goal of net zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2040. NIPSCO's generation transition is continuing to advance as we optimize the new portfolio to benefit customers and retire all coal-fired generation by the end of 2028. All of the renewable generation projects remain on target with previously revised in-service dates. As a few examples, our first two solar projects, Dunns Bridge 1 and Indiana Crossroads Solar are expected to be in service by the end of the second quarter. Construction on Cavalry Solar Plus Storage and Dunns Bridge 2 Solar Plus Storage has kicked off in earnest with expected in-service dates in 2024. Construction of our Indiana Crossroads 2 Wind PPA is advancing and is expected in service late this year. Additionally, we are finalizing our due diligence on the results of our targeted RFP event that sought bids for the construction of a gas peaking capacity at our Schahfer site, consistent with our 2021 Integrated Resource Plan. We are evaluating the provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act and its applicability to projects in our generation portfolio, including the potential application of tax transferability. We believe the legislation has enabled opportunities to drive greater value to both customers and shareholders. NIPSCO's generation transition is already providing benefits to customers in multiple ways, including reduced fuel cost volatility and monetizing off-system sales and REC sales. For example, during the run-up in market prices in November and December of last year as a result of winter storms, our wind renewable assets generated nearly 529,000 megawatt hours of low-cost energy, saving customers an estimated $11 million compared to what NIPSCO would have otherwise purchased in the market. In addition, over 2022 and through the first quarter of 2023, NIPSCO's renewable projects contributed a total of more than $35 million of combined off-system sales and renewable energy credit sales that are being passed back to customers through NIPSCO's Fuel Adjustment Clause and Regional Transmission Organization Adjustment Tracker filings. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Shawn, who will discuss our financial performance in more detail. So when we're looking at -- this is Michael Lower. So when we're looking at those different projects, I mean, we are on track relative to our revised 2022 plan. We have two in service, two nearing completion and four that are in the late-stage of development and early construction. And I would say post-IRA, as I mentioned earlier, we see potential benefits associated with that. We continue to evaluate it relative to the tax transferability and our NiSource tax appetite, but it does appear to have customer benefits, as well as shareholder benefits."

            "name": "Lloyd Yates",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Hopefully, you've all had a chance to read our first quarter earnings release issued earlier today. I'll begin on slide seven by reviewing our three key priorities for 2023. First, NiSource remains committed to delivering on our top-tier EPS growth plan. We are reaffirming non-GAAP NOEPS guidance of $1.54 to $1.60 in 2023 and growth of 6% to 8% annually through 2027. Annual rate base growth of 8% to 10% is projected, driven by $15 billion of capital expenditures during the 2023 to 2027 period. Meanwhile, our O&M target is to remain flat in 2023, as well as throughout the duration of the plan. Second, strong regulatory execution continued in the first quarter, advancing balanced outcomes for all our stakeholders. In March, a settlement agreement was filed in Northern Indiana Public Service Company's electric rate case. The proposed settlement incorporates $1.8 billion of incremental capital investments made on behalf of the customers since 2019, including renewable generation projects, grid modernization and other customer-centric improvements to enhance safety, service and reliability. The settlement represents a $292 million revenue increase. A final order is anticipated in August with rates effective in 2023 and 2024. We Additionally, Gas Distribution and regulatory execution has also advanced with the Columbia Gas of Ohio rate case settlement approval and implementation during the first quarter. The company's tracked infrastructure replacement programs are executing on plan for 2023 as highlighted by Ohio's recently approved Infrastructure Replacement Program, authorized a recovery of $36 million of capital investment targeting safety enhancements in our gas system. Lastly, the sale of the NIPSCO minority interest remains on track for 2023. As previously indicated, the proceeds generated from this financing transaction will immediately strengthen our balance sheet and will enable NiSource to draw upon the portfolio of capital investment opportunities to enhance shareholder value while enhancing safety and reliability for our customers. This includes continuing commitments in Indiana, supporting major generation projects, new customer connections and capital enhancements to existing electric and gas infrastructure to add resiliency to our system. We look forward to continuing to serve the State of Indiana in all of our operating service territories for many years to come. Shifting to our generation transition. NiSource has been a leader among U.S. utilities in the speed of our energy transition, advancing one of the largest projected carbon intensity reductions by the end of this decade. NiSource remains focused and committed to an orderly conversation when the energy transition by leveraging energy delivery solutions across diversified systems. Our team continues to work on developing new generation capacity and a collaborative process started in 2018, involving stakeholder groups, including our customers, communities, regulators and policymakers. Michael will touch upon the commercialization process for energy solutions, replacing our core retirements in a moment. The established regulatory constructs that utilize tracked capital investment programs and forward test year rate cases allow our investors a consistent and predictable return on billions of dollars of funding for investment in these critical energy facilities. Indiana's supportive and constructive regulatory mechanisms have enabled NIPSCO to time the construction of these facilities alongside regulatory plans as contemplated in our proposed rate case settlement, which has enabled NiSource to minimize unnecessary financing expense for our customers and reduce regulatory lag. We continue to be encouraged by the active dialogue on electric reliability, affordability and sustainability in our region. Throughout the last two years of global inflationary pressure, supply chain constraints, policy uncertainty and commodity volatility, we have remained confident in the value of these investments for our customers. These new projects are projected to provide savings consistent with original expectations, while delivering the reliable energy our customers deserve. I'd also like to give you an update on our progress on operational excellence, which continues to prioritize safety, while optimizing our long-term growth profile. We have formally launched Project Apollo, one part of our enterprise-wide transformation effort. Project Apollo contains several initiatives we anticipate driving an annual savings range of $40 million to $60 million beginning in 2023. We expect to share more on the progress of the portfolio of initiatives inside Project Apollo as they advance to drive greater value for stakeholders. Project Apollo fits within our broader focus on operational excellence, safety, O&M management and unlocking efficiencies across our operations, enabling us to streamline work and improve logistics company-wide. Complementary to Project Apollo is our previously announced long-term plan to invest almost $1 billion in proven technologies to change how we plan, schedule and execute work in the field, and how we engage and provide service to our customers. These investments will improve both the customer and employee experience, but are also intended to reduce our overall cost profile. Taken together, these investments and process changes will be critical components of our overall transformation efforts to allow us to maintain flat O&M and be safer and more efficient in everything we do. More importantly, this helps sustain customer affordability with expected total annual rate increases that are in line with inflation. I'd like to recognize our dedicated employees and contractors who worked tirelessly to ensure our communities receive safe and reliable energy during the quarter. In late February, went a storm outlive bought freezing rain and significant ice to Northeast Indiana, impacting distribution switches, lines and tree limbs. Nearly all customers had power restored the next day and work was completed without compromising our safety standards. Now for updates on our electric operations and renewable projects, I'm excited to welcome Michael Luhrs to the NiSource team as Executive Vice President of Strategy and Risk and Chief Commercial Officer. Michael, who has more than 25 years in the utility industry as another level of depth and expertise to our already strong management team. Now, Michael, over to you. Hey. Good morning. What I'll say, and I'll let Shawn is leading the NIPSCO process. But with respect to initial minority sale, I mean, we're right on target as we laid out at an Investor Day. Shawn, anything -- any more detail? Well, I'll say, as a standard course, we don't comment on, I'll say, potential for M&A or market rumors. But as I've always said, if something shows up, that's going to create opportunity will create shareholder value. I mean NiSource will be diligent in taking a look at that. You've all heard me say in the past, if someone wants to sell a great jurisdiction at one-time rate base gave us a call. But all that being said, what I'll say to you is, we're focused on our plan and we're laser-focused on a minority sale of NIPSCO and our growth plan that we laid, which includes growing rate base 8% to 10% by investing $15 billion through 2027 and that's really where our current focus is. But we don't have that into our financial plan yet. All right. Good morning. One, let me start with, we're really excited about the ROFR legislation. It got signed by the Governor yesterday in Indiana and we see that as an opportunity for the NIPSCO utility in Indiana, along with the other utilities. But I'll let Melody, who is President of our Regulated Utilities answer any more detail. So, again, upside to our capital plan, you saw on our page -- what's that page... ...on page - on slide eight, some of the potential upside to our capital plan that was transmission build. This will solidify our opportunity to build those, but continue to work with MISO to quantify the magnitude of those opportunities. So that's upcoming in the future. No. I think our focus hasn't changed at all. We laid out at Investor Day flat O&M through 2027. We're continuing to focus on that. We instituted a Project Apollo, assembling a team of people. We have a set of initiatives that we've established to drive that cost out of the business and we're on track to accomplish that. So flat through 2027. You are welcome. Good morning. Shawn? Thank you, Durgesh. Appreciate it very much. Appreciate your support. Good morning, Julien. Hi. Good morning. I don't believe I opened up that can of worms. What I believe I said whether we don't comment on market rumors or M&A and that we are really focused on executing the plan that we laid out on Investor Day, growing rate base 8% to 10% and invested $15 billion in capital across NiSource. On the other hand, what I did say, if someone wants to sell something to us at one-time rate base, give us a call. Yeah. Any specific state you're interested in talking about in general? Melody? And to add on to what Melody said, I think that the legislative environment in Indiana is also really healthy... ... with respect to utilities, balancing reliability, affordability, clean energy and customer needs. And we like doing business there, we are intimately involved with talking to all of these stakeholders and we think it's a great place to live and do business. Thank you. Good morning. Shawn, why don't you take that one? So the answer to that would be generally no. If you look at the history -- our history in Indiana, the Indiana Commission for the most part has approved the settlements that the parties have submitted and we don't expect to see anything different. Appreciate it. Thanks for the questions. Thanks for supporting NiSource. Looking forward to seeing everyone at the AGA Financial Conference. Have a great day."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q3 2024 NiSource Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Chris Turnure, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nChris Turnure: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to the NiSource third quarter 2024 investor call. Joining me today are President and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Yates, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Shawn Anderson, Executive Vice President of Strategy and Risk and Chief Commercial Officer Michael Luhrs, and Executive Vice President and Group President NiSource Utilities, Melody Birmingham. The purpose of this presentation is to review NiSource's financial performance for the third quarter of 2024, as well as provide an update on our operations and growth drivers. Following our prepared remarks, we'll open the call to your questions. Slides for today's call are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. We would like to remind you that some of the statements made during this presentation could be forward-looking. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. Information concerning such risks and uncertainties is included in the Risk Factors and MD&A sections of our periodic SEC filings. Additionally, some of the statements made on this call relate to non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the supplemental slides, segment information and full financial schedules for information on the most directly comparable GAAP measure and a reconciliation of these measures. I now like to turn the call over to Lloyd.\nLloyd Yates: Thank you, Chris and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on slide three. The NiSource investment thesis is simple. We serve our customers by delivering safe and reliable energy at an affordable value. Affordable energy requires efficient capital deployment, safe asset operations and constructive regulatory recovery mechanisms. These fundamentals generate competitive returns while enhancing our balance sheet position. Importantly, these are the foundation to the NiSource business plan which continues to offer compelling value to stakeholders. Driven by regulated utility operations across six highly constructive jurisdictions, offering diversification across fuel type and regulatory location, strong execution from our team and these business fundamentals are what have driven a trailing twelve month 9.9% earned ROE at the NiSource level, demonstrating our focus on shareholder returns despite rapidly growing deployed capital and declining financial leverage. This is a GAAP number with an adjustment made only to normalized weather. All of this informs our long-term value proposition which our teams continue to advance each quarter. But before we focus on the long-term plan refresh, let's turn to Slide four and touch on the progress our teams have made on our regulatory activity. Being a trusted energy partner and enhancing NiSource's superior regulatory and stakeholder foundation is a priority and we believe differentiates us from peer regulated utilities. We remain active in rate case and tracker filings and build our credibility through our six-state footprint by utilizing a stakeholder focused mindset as we approach these processes. Last month an administrative law judge in Pennsylvania recommended the Commission approve our general rate case multiparty settlement as filed. In October we reached a settlement in our Kentucky General rate case. Approval of both these settlements is subject to final Commission approval. In Indiana, we received approvals for both our Solar CPCN amendments to add full ownership of solar facilities as well as a CPCN they construct a gas peaking facility, all of which helped NiSource retire its remaining coal generating stations by the end of 2028. We also received approval to advance our strategy of using technology to more efficiently serve our customers through an upgraded work and asset management system which utilizes data and analytics through AI to raise productivity and efficiency across the dispatch of our operations team. This includes deferral for one time and ongoing expenses and capital returns for the program which went live in July for our electric operations and will go live next summer for our gas operations. This new technology is also an example of making strategic investments to better inform our culture and enhance risk management across our systems to deliver operational excellence for our customers. Our relentless focus on operational excellence enhances our risk management posture and drives protection for our customers, communities and shareholders, through our capital allocation framework. We face many potential categories of risk which constantly evolve and risk management is central to our values. The utility industry continues to face potential challenges head on, whether it relates to natural disasters, the interest rate environment, inflationary pressures on cost structures or other items of uncertainty. Our teams are constantly implementing proactive solutions to add layers of protection into our plans and lead industry partners to understand and utilize best practices to de risk our execution and deliver our commitments. We have high confidence in our ability to achieve our financial commitments which we believe are highly executable. We are reaffirming 2024 adjusted EPS guidance of $1.70 to $1.74 and we continue to expect to achieve the upper half of this range. We are initiating 2025 adjusted EPS guidance of $1.84 to $1.88 consistent with maintaining our existing 6% to 8% annual growth commitment. Today we are also announcing a refresh of our outlook across our five-year planning horizon and extend this commitment and our overall financial guidelines to 2029. Key elements of that plan included an updated five-year capital plan which is $19.3 billion or equivalent to 89% of our total current rate base. This is slightly larger than our prior plan's 87% of year-end 2023 rate base. This drives 8% to 10% rate base growth over to 2025 to 2029 period, which fuels our ability to increase our adjusted earnings per share growth rate by 6% to 8% annually. Our investments in strengthening the balance sheet support our commitment to target FFO to debt of 14% to 16% in all years of the plan. Our work does not stop at the base capital plan. We are fortunate to have a robust portfolio of valuable customer investments include and extend far beyond our five-year plan horizon, which Shawn will detail later. Our teams remain active in developing this portfolio of projects to meet our standards necessary to be included in our base plan. One example of work by our teams is the development of our strategy to serve the robust interest by data centre customers for power to be served by NIPSCO. The fundamentals of the Northwest Indiana region are compelling to potential data center customers, access to critical infrastructure, including a robust transmission system and proximity to critical fiber connections. Predictable climate and weather with low natural catastrophe risk and a constructive business climate, including favorable tax structures, low-cost land and a supportive state government are all favorable factors in advancing development of data centres in the region. Our teams are working to evaluate this buildout, which could provide benefits to our existing system customers, enhance our communities and local tax space and provide compelling investment opportunities for our shareholders. Northwest Indiana is a premier location for data centres to locate. Simply put, there's potential for substantial value creation for all stakeholders and checking all of these boxes is important to NiSource. Now let's focus on the core execution our teams continue to deliver upon with our regulatory engagement over the last three years detailed on Slide five. During the trailing 12-month period ending last month, our average residential gas bill declined 16% on a total bill basis. Affordability remains a key priority for both NIPSCO and the Columbia family of companies, and we continue to be thoughtful about this as we advance the critical safety, compliance and reliability work necessary to deliver safe and reliable energy to our customers. In September, NIPSCO filed its first electric general rate case in two years, driven by nearly $2.5 billion of incremental investment for our customers and communities in Northern Indiana. The case incorporates the planned 2025 retirement of units 17 and 18 at the Shafer Generating Station as well as four new solar and storage projects now reflecting NIPSCO's full ownership Major investments such as these are examples of our continued partnership with state policymakers, regulators and customers. Switching to Pennsylvania, we expect a final commission order and a new rate implementation in December. In Ohio, $285 million of investment was approved in August for our capital expenditure program rider and we expect to submit for two major capital riders in the state again early next year. In Virginia, intervenor testimony was filed in October for our general rate case and a final order is expected early next year. Before I turn the call over, I want to thank all of our employees and contractors for their dedication to NiSource values, doing things safer, better, more efficient and for less calls. Our customers and shareholders are like allowing you every day. I'll now turn things over to Michael.\nMichael Luhrs: Thank you, Lloyd. Good morning. We continue our disciplined and methodical approach to developing and effectuating a robust pipeline of investments to benefit stakeholders. I'll begin on Slide six with an update on our generation investments. As Lloyd mentioned, there has been substantial progress made related to generation investments that will benefit all stakeholders. With Gibson and Fairbanks having received regulatory approval for full ownership in August, we have now converted four projects to full ownership, which will materially lower cost to customers. In addition, we have progressed well in bringing our renewable assets into service. The 200-megawatt Cavalry Solar project with 45 megawatts of storage was placed in service in May, and we expect the 435-megawatt Dunns Bridge II solar project with 56 megawatts of storage to come online very early next year. Fairbanks and Gibson are expected to be in service later in 2025 with no changes to time lines since our last update. 100% of modules for Fairbanks are already on site and Gibson is expected to have all modules delivered by early Q1 2025. In continuing the work of maximizing the benefits of our assets for customers, NIPSCO filed a notification earlier this week with the IURC that an application will be filed requesting to convert the 200-megawatt Templeton Wind Energy Center in Benton County, Indiana, which was approved by the IURC of the PPA to a build transfer agreement in which NIPSCO will own the asset upon completion. If approved, it will reduce customer costs versus the PPA structure at a valuable wind property to our generation portfolio and increase shareholder investment. It is a great example of the NiSource team at work creating a win for all stakeholders. The projects on Slide six are the result of the 2018 and 2021 NIPSCO Integrated Resource Plan and corresponding RFP processes. These projects represent billions of dollars of economically driven investment in the state of Indiana, the majority of which are already delivering zero commodity cost solar and wind, driving down fuel related charges to customers. Please turn to Slide seven. On Monday, the NIPSCO team held the fifth and last stakeholder meeting in the 2024 IRP process. potential incremental generation needs for the planning horizon are driven by three key factors: New EPA fossil fuel regulations, MISO reliability rules and data center demand. As most of you are aware, the EPA greenhouse gas scanners and fossil fuel fired power plant guidelines finalized earlier this year, may limit capacity factors, require carbon sequestration investments or hydrogen utilization for gas generation capacity. Additionally, MISO's four-season capacity construct and the reduction in capacity accreditation under the direct loss of load market design, will have a substantial impact on generation requirements in the MISO footprint. These changes, combined with the significant and growing interest in data centres and NIPSCO supports our IRP reference case, which includes these rule updates and 2,600 megawatts of data center demand. We intend to file the final IRP at the IURC in December. As we work through the major changes to electric demand, we are evaluating the most customer beneficial glide path and our 2030 interim commitment as we move towards our 2040 net zero goal. Environmental objectives remain an important component of our overall company priorities, and we have made significant progress with more than a 70% reduction relative to our 2005 CO2 baseline, and we will continue to balance customer cost reliability and pace of these investments to meet these goals. On Slide eight, you'll find an overview of capital opportunities not included in our base or upside financial plans. These items are under development by NiSource strategy and commercial teams to build the business cases to advance these opportunities for stakeholders. To highlight the breadth of opportunities we have and are developing, I will highlight two disparate examples, data and analytics employing AI and data center work. As Lloyd mentioned, we have made real progress in the strong and effective deployment of technology upgrades, but we have also been building data and analytics capabilities utilizing AI. We have built, tested and are now deploying work management utilizing AI with our gas operations, and we have already seen significant improvements, enabling operational goals, lowering cost, increasing CapEx deployment efficiency and derisking our operations. At the other end of the spectrum, our data center deal team is meeting with qualified counterparties to understand their business models and needs as we develop structures for NIPSCO to support data center generation and transmission needs while ensuring reliability for the region and protecting existing customers. We are actively working to enable access to the speed consistent with the data center demand profile. Fortunately, NIPSCO has a very strong infrastructure network in sites, which have sound technical fundamentals for generation and transmission buildout within the time frames beneficial to data center development. So, though we have not included any data center activity within our plans or upside, we continue to focus on developing and vetting potential opportunities that would be beneficial to existing customers shareholders, data centres and our communities. As mentioned, when we started, we will develop these opportunities in a methodical and disciplined manner just as we've done with the Templeton wind project. Shawn will touch on more of that next. Shawn?\nShawn Anderson: Thank you, Michael. Let's start on Slide nine. Third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.20 per share, an increase of $0.01 versus the same period one year ago. Higher rate base investments drove $61 million in incremental revenue and net financing benefits of approximately $26 million were also realized on a year-over-year basis. Customer count and usage also added $2.6 million across our electric and gas businesses versus last year and have grown over $28 million total for the year. Moving to Slide 10. Let's break down our CapEx plan through 2029. As Lloyd mentioned earlier, we've refreshed our 5-year plan outlook, which starts with a base capital plan of $19.3 billion. The enhanced base plan is $2.9 billion larger than our prior base plan, which is driven by a number of factors, including increased generation investments, gas compliance and system hardening projects, and investments to modernize our information technology systems. As Michael shared, the base plan now reflects the inclusion of the Templeton project, which shifted from our upside plan into our base plan after our teams reached commercial agreement on the ownership of the project. We have enhanced our disclosure on the new base plan to detail the investment themes we are seeing as necessary to deliver safe and reliable service to our customers. All of these investments have met our threshold to be included in the base plan, mainly based on socialization with stakeholders, compliance and safety requirements and commercial structures at an affordable value. We've also spent time refreshing the portfolio of projects in the upside plan, those that our teams are actively working on flowing into the base plan. The revised upside plan now sits at $1.8 billion, and we've included an estimation of when those projects may become viable in our CapEx charts, despite not yet being included in any of our base capital guidance or plans. The $1.8 billion upside category is slightly larger than our previous upside figure. It now consists of electric modernization, PHMSA compliance and legacy plastic and gas systems work as well as additional costs for MISO Tranche 1 projects. We continue to see increased demand for investment in our systems to deliver the growth and system capacity our stakeholders require while in alignment with the necessary operating standards. Once these projects meet our threshold to be included in the base plan, we will flow these through our full plan and provide updates along the way. I'd note here that the base and upside capital expenditures plans do not include any data center investment activity, which Lloyd and Michael highlighted earlier. We believe strongly that the data center strategy represents a compelling opportunity for NiSource. However, additional development of the strategy is required to meet our threshold to include in either the base or upside capital plans. With that said, the company is strongly positioned to advance this strategy. Continued execution on our financial commitments has strengthened the financial profile of the company, including its balance sheet positioning, which enables NiSource to be opportunistic in capital allocation decisions. The constructive regulatory backdrop in Indiana supports a utility-centric regulatory compact and the vertical integration of the business model minimizes complexity for customers and regulators, while providing flexibility around cash flow recovery. NiSource has deep access to capital markets and maintains flexibility to efficiently finance data center opportunities. NiSource also has a long-standing history of supporting large load customers in the steel industry and has experience working with large customers to deliver value for all stakeholders. Let's move to Slide 11. We are pleased to report that we have priced $600 million in common equity through our forward ATM structure, completing our stated guidance for 2024. Along with the junior subordinated notes issued this year, we've continued to strengthen the balance sheet positioning of the company. Despite the increase in capital expenditures included in our revised base capital plan, we do not expect changes to our financing plan and continue to target 14% to 16% FFO to debt in all years of our plan using a balanced mix of cash from operations new long-term debt and $200 million to $300 million of annual maintenance equity to maintain our capital structure through the use of our at-the-market program. Limiting regulatory lag and sequencing our capital expenditures through efficient capital recovery mechanisms, including capital trackers and forward-looking rate mechanisms helped NiSource minimize delays in recovery of capital deployed. Approximately 81% of our new base capital is expected to begin recovery inside 12 months, which fuels reasonable returns of capital and minimizes the need for new equity. This is the same strategy, which has enabled NiSource to achieve the 9.9% trailing 12-month enterprise ROE, which Lloyd highlighted, and which helps us use cash flow returns from the business to fund growth in the CapEx plans. Of note, we will continue to be opportunistic in the junior subordinated debt marketplace to strengthen the position of our FFO to debt as needed throughout our planned horizon. On Slide 12, you'll see our updated long-term financial commitments. The new base plan drives 8% to 10% rate base growth over the five-year period and continues our guidance of achieving annual adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 8% across each year of the plan, reflecting out through the 2029 period. The value of this is notable. As you know, we rebase long-term EPS growth guidance off of actual results and outperformance will flow through the full plan and compound when incorporating our growth rate. For example, as we initiate 2025 guidance of $1.84 to $1.88, the midpoint of this range is $0.10 per share higher than was estimated in our 2022 Investor Day driven by outperforming the midpoint in all years of our plan. And this midpoint is 9.4% above the original midpoint when we initiated guidance for 2024. We are reaffirming our guidance of $1.70 to $1.74 for 2024 and again, expect to achieve results in the upper half of this range. Additionally, we remain committed to 14% to 16% FFO to debt in all years of the plan. As was the case with our prior plan, the upside CapEx category is not required to drive any of the financial commitments shown in the upper center box, and we will flow through any impacts associated with increases to our base case capital plan from the upside plan when those projects meet our standards to be included. I'd note, we remain focused on minimizing the financial impact, better safety, reliability and compliance work has across our customer base. efficient projects like the Templeton Wind Energy Center enable an increase in CapEx plans while reducing the planned cost to customer and eliminate fuel costs for this portion of generation. Our revised plan projects less than 5% average annual bill increases across NiSource. I'll conclude with highlights of our growing track record on Slide 13. Our financial commitments are on track for 2024. We have established guidance for 2025 and remain confident in our near-term and long-term guidance remains resilient to market and forces outside our control and are based on realistic and executable assumptions. Settlements in our Pennsylvania and Kentucky rate cases and approvals for numerous Indiana generation and technology investments underscore our execution of recovery for critical investments to ensure safety and reliability of our systems. Year-to-date financing activity has been completed and the diversification utilized and the junior subordinated debt marketplace demonstrates our balance sheet flexibility and continues to fortify our balance sheet positioning. Lastly, our base and upside CapEx plans demonstrate both programmatic investment plans and accelerated investment opportunities for customers and investors to reiterate our rate base and adjusted EPS guidance include neither the upside CapEx nor any data center load or investment and are built upon the known and socialized regulatory programs, which have contributed to the 8.1% adjusted EPS growth rate we've executed since 2021. The value proposition NiSource continues to offer investors is diversified and regulated utility assets with the opportunity to invest in both programmatic gas infrastructure and the long-term energy transition story of a fully integrated electric business. These elements have been core to our story for some time, but the emerging opportunity to support economic development, onshoring and new data center development truly differentiate our value proposition relative to many alternatives in the market today. I'd now like to turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you, the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Nick Campanella with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nNicholas Campanella: Hey, good morning. Good to see everything playing out from the Analyst Day here. So, congrats on that. So, in your prepared remarks, you kind of talked about you're having discussions continuing with data centres. And I understand that the recent increase in CapEx was largely just on the gas side, it seems. So just can you kind of talk about what the catalysts that we should be watching for, for you to kind of layer in those opportunities. Is it getting through an NIPSCO rate case? Is it finishing those discussions on what the tariff looks like? And what would the timing of that be?\nLloyd Yates: So I'll start, and I'll let Michael Luhrs provide more detail NiSource sees the data center opportunity is just a really good incremental investment opportunity. But I think for the company and where we are now, it's primarily a 2025 activity. I think as we progress in discussions with some of the counterparties, who want to kind of get down to the detail and make sure that we do this in a disciplined and methodical way, and that's just going to take time. And if you think about what we just with Templeton Wind project. I mean our ability to do things in a disciplined, methodical way has been probably one of the keys to why we've been executing so well. So, Mike, anything to add to that?\nMichael Luhrs: No, you hit it, Lloyd, we were going to work through these opportunities in a manner, as you said, disciplined and methodically, make sure we're providing the benefits to existing customers, that it's accretive for shareholders. And then as we come through those opportunities at which point they are accretive or we know that they're beneficial, we will bring them forward just as we do with the Templeton Wind project today.\nNicholas Campanella: Okay. So, is it the right take that these are truly incremental to the plan that the balance sheet can absorb it and that the customer rates can absorb it? And maybe you can kind of just clarify on if you raise CapEx from here, does that require additional equity financing? Thanks.\nShawn Anderson : Yes. Just to be clear, the $19.3 billion capital plan is fully financed through all the systems that we've shared with you today. The $1.8 billion of potential upside CapEx may require modest amounts of equity based on the cash flow profiles of those projects, when they get sequenced and how it would work through the regulatory mechanisms themselves. The incremental investment opportunities are not captured in any of those systems that I just highlighted. That's where data center investments would theoretically live. Therefore, we would have to reevaluate everything to incorporate incremental investment opportunities through our systems. But we don't need a full planned refresh to do that, we'll flow those through our systems, and you'll know those when we know those through this mechanism.\nNicholas Campanella: All right, have a great day. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning, team. Very well done, truly impressive. Those are not your average LDCs, I got to say. In fact, to that end, just understand the staggering of different data points here. I mean just impressive CapEx update here, the $1.8 billion upside here. I mean, you're going to get a number of these data points over the next year, that's not something we should be looking to with 4Q. That's going to be a year out. The AI data center-related data points here, given the December IRP, that's a 4Q update presumably, correct?\nShawn Anderson : Yes. Let me just step through it real quick. So, the $1.8 billion of upside CapEx, you can actually see it in the capital allocation side that we shared. But to your point, we don't see much upside CapEx in 2025, but we do see some start to emerge in 2026, 2027. And you can kind of see it layered in. We'll continue to move those around on those bars based on the profile and the development of those projects. As we know more, we'll update that CapEx allocation on where those upside opportunities might land. And then in terms of updates, the IRP, it seems we're clearly working through the preferred portfolio and what it takes to action those. Likewise, with data centres well underway and under development. I imagine both are pretty significant strategies for the company. Therefore, I imagine we'll discuss those on the 4Q call, but I don't know yet what the outlook will be and how those will be incorporated. Again, we'll need to do the commercial development and understand the value creation for all stakeholders. Once we understand that and roll that through the systems, we'll post it here on the call.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Excellent, guys. And if I may, can I open up -- can I get around the details of this -- the data center proposal here, right? You've got the various different iterations here. But the base 2.6 gigawatts here, as you talk about, I mean, is there any kind of thought process that you'd walk though? I mean, I know you can put basic dollar per kilowatt assumptions, maybe some baselines on what you historically owned. Anything that you'd offer up as initial observations to start to translate this kind of a number here, if you will, in a little more detail.\nLloyd Yates: Michael, do you want to take that?\nMichael Luhrs: Yes. Thank you. The only thing I'll add to that associated with it is if you look at the IRP detail, you can see what we posted on Monday. What the 2,600 megawatts imputes relative to generation assets and what those assets would entail associated with it. And the investments associated that would be required in storage and CCGTs and other mechanisms. But at this point in time, we don't have additional detail out to that, just as Shawn said, that would be more of a 2025 activity. As Lloyd commented, I will comment that we have multiple scenarios in the IRP process, covering a range of outcomes and opportunities, including an upside case associated with 6,000 megawatts, but again, you can see from the materials, sort of what that could potentially entail associated with assets.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes. Got it. But at this time, no specific views on percent palatable to own?\nLloyd Yates: No, not at this time.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. All right, guys, thank you very much. We'll see you soon. Nicely done.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Sunderland with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRichard Sunderland: Hey, good morning and thank you for the time today. Maybe I'll just pick up on what Julien was asking on just now again, the 2.6 gigawatts in the load scenarios and the IRP, I think that's really clear. But as you've showed with Templeton, you've also done a lot of work on generation that's outside of this kind of data center load opportunity that we're all focused on. I'm curious what type of generation you might need in the IRP regardless of said data center load shows up or not? And maybe just the sort of generation needs overall, given you've done a lot of this work to convert PPA projects into company-owned projects? Kind of how do you think about that bucket broadly going forward?\nMichael Luhrs: Yes. I'd be happy to talk about that more. So, when you look at what we've done, just hitting on one of the points you made. We have done a lot of work associated with the generation assets, which are very beneficial relative to customers and all stakeholders and shareholders associated with it. We will continue to do work like that to make sure we're maximizing the opportunities and the benefits to all parties. And so, we're excited about the opportunity associated with Templeton should it be approved by the commission. When you look at the IRP and the elements going forward, in pretty much all cases especially given the DLOL rules for MISO, you need storage and you need between 500 megawatts and a gigawatt of storage associated with it. And that's to help address those different accreditation methodology for MISO and the impacts of them. At the same time, to statable resources, we've all known that statable resources will be necessary, batteries help with that. But at the same time, you also are going to need additional spinning assets such as gas turbines or peakers. You see that when you look at those scenarios, regardless of data centres, you need more dispatchable resources, that will show up in most likely the form of cash generation. I will emphasize with that. We are still focused on our 2014 goal and we continue to work through those, even though we make sure that we're doing our interim goals associated with it in the most customer beneficial way. But you can just see from those what those potential assets look like in the near term, even though I will say -- as you look at that, most of those assets would be in the sort of as you're looking beyond the 2029 kind of time frame associated with it. So not as much in the next couple of years, as Shawn highlighted. And then obviously, the resource plan goes significantly further out, which then there's significantly more resource potential additions as you move through time with the EPA rules.\nRichard Sunderland: Great. Thank you for that color there. And then again, kind of zooming out here on the data center opportunity, I realize there's a lot more work and you've been clear on some of the commercial efforts. But going back to the summer with that big Microsoft project announcement, curious if you could say anything more on that front? Is that -- given that's out there, is it something closer along to getting firmed up and added to either your base or your upside plan. And anything else you could say there about kind of the work going forward on that?\nLloyd Yates: The point is, I think all of the data center, the activity and the associated work with the counterparty is primarily the 2025 activity. And Microsoft did announce that last year, but I think the timetable we're on is 2025.\nRichard Sunderland: Got it clear enough. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey team, good morning. Thanks for giving me time. Just first quick clarification is Templeton Wind. I just want to be clear on this. That's in the base plan. Is that correct?\nLloyd Yates: Yes. We just moved that -- the upside to the base plan.\nDurgesh Chopra: Okay. Perfect. And then maybe, Shawn, I know you kind of talked to the equity staying the same, but it's a substantial increase in the capital plan versus five years like close to 20%. And you talked about 81%, I believe, was the number that you called out, getting recovery in the zero to six months. Is it just that with this -- even with this capital increase, you don't have to issue any more equity? Or is this more regulatory filings, perhaps an improvement in ROE, maybe just a little bit more color around that front would be helpful.\nShawn Anderson : Yes, sure. Appreciate it, Durgesh. More efficient capital allocation, which minimizes regulatory lag. That's really the key, and it supports a higher cash flow from operations, which we're seeing across our systems, maybe about 10% over the course of the plan horizon. That's helping to contribute to a more efficient financing structure. But again, I'd note we worked ahead here in 2024 on credit quality, both in terms of outperforming our financial projections in the current year and utilizing the junior sub marketplace for $1 billion of funding, which were not initially in the plan. So, we've already made some of this progress to date and we're capitalizing on some of that benefit also.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. So, I mean you have some breathing room to start with. Okay. Final question, just on flat O&M. You've had this guidance for a few years now. So maybe just how you're thinking through that? I understand, obviously, there's a large increase in the capital program. With that comes higher operating expenses, well, I would assume, but generally, growth in the business, inflation has come down, but it's still there. Just how are you thinking? What's the confidence level in sort of extending that flat O&M as we go to sort of latter years of your financial plans?\nLloyd Yates: So Durgesh, I mentioned in the value safer, better, faster and more efficient and to lower cost. And I think there's a lot more opportunity at NiSource to drive those values through the organization. We talked about our work in asset management process and using AI to improve our schedule and efficiencies. So, our hands on time and our workforce has gone up and we're just getting more done with the people we have. And I think when you look at the foreseeable future, I do see -- continue to see flat O&M Project Apollo is in its second year, and there's just a whole lot more opportunity. So, we see being flat for the foreseeable future by being more effective and more efficient.\nDurgesh Chopra: That's very clear. Congrats, guys. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ross Fowler with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nRoss Fowler: Morning, Lloyd. Morning, Michael. Morning, Shawn, how are you? So, you mentioned sort of MISO capacity in the prepared remarks. So, I just wanted to dig into that a little bit. Clearly, they've adopted some of the constructs for the next auction that PJM also has. And so, we saw what happened in PJM with higher capacity prices we saw sort of what the feedback there has been. I guess a couple of questions related to that. Do you feel like the IRP and the rate case and sort of the vertically integrated model in Indiana allow you to get that conversation going with the regulator get in front of what we might see for an auction result next spring. And then in the context of the IRP, you talked about data centres and sort of the demand being a 2025 kind of thing. How do you think about the risk of timing related to the demand coming in over time, right? Because it still takes time to build the data center and the ability to sort of build disbatchable generation, which we're hearing takes sort of four, five, six years by the time you get the permitting and the turbine and that sort of thing. So maybe contextualize.\nLloyd Yates: Yes. Let me start that Mike can weigh in. You think about NIPSCO, where we serve electricity, even though we're part of MISO, we continue to be a vertically integrated utility, responsible for generation transmission and distribution. I think the MISO model gives us a competitive advantage in terms of speed to market to facilitate some of these data center load. I think with respect to the speed, the data center grows or below demand, I think that's part of the conversation of the activity for 2025. At what pace can we build it? And can we build to match the demand of those data center loads as part of the conversations that we're having that will go into 2025. Mike, anything to add to that?\nMichael Luhrs: The only thing I would add is when we go through the IRP process, it includes stakeholders across it. So those conversations relative to MISO accreditation the scenarios around it, the EPA requirements, which may require carbon sequestration and storage have already been gone. So, we've been having those conversations with stakeholders now and introducing that, what the impact of that would be and also what that means some potential portfolios. The only thing I would highlight relative to data centres in addition is that we are working through those activities, and I would just say we are well aware of the demand requirements of the entities associated with what they would want to do. So, as we work through it in a methodical and disciplined fashion. I would also say we're working through what it takes to meet that demand in a methodical and disciplined fashion to satisfy our customer needs.\nRoss Fowler: Okay. And then I guess on the capacity auction, if you do get a high capacity clear, which you've already kind of seen in Missouri and ISO I know you're a different zone, but given the rules they've adopted with the VR curve sector. Do you worry about that in conjunction with your regulators? And does that eat into a little bit of a headroom? Or how should I think about that? Should we be going the same capacity price direction in MISO that we've seen in PJM?\nMichael Luhrs: My comment to that would be, and then others can jump in associated with it. My comment to that would be that's one of the reasons the vertically integrated model has so been official associated with it. because we have requirements and whatever is brought to bear that we have to provide for the reserve margin on top of that as well as what's associated with the accreditation reduction. So, I would say, fundamentally, supply/demand, we're helping to keep that supply-demand in balance associated by what we're doing and what we're looking at would be required in resource additions, which is also why we included the case -- the reference case with 2,600 megawatts of potential large low like data centres and the scenario upside. So, though we are always cognizant of that and focus on what that impact the customers in, I would also say that vertically integrated model helps mitigate a lot of that risk.\nRoss Fowler: Thank you for that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar. Please go ahead.\nTravis Miller: Hello everyone. Thank you. Good figure, another data center question, and perhaps this is just a clarification and the clarification of all the clarifications you've given. But do you technically need to build anything, put infrastructure in the ground to allow power to flow to that Microsoft center initially and then maybe one or two others. That's more of a technical question, right? Do you actually need to build anything in the short term to get these first couple of data centres online?\nLloyd Yates: Yes, we would need to build to facilitate the kind of low demand we're talking about, whether it's Microsoft or any other counterparty.\nTravis Miller: And is that more generation or transmission for the first for the Microsoft Center and maybe one or two others.\nLloyd Yates: Most of these investments would require both generation and transmission.\nMichael Luhrs: The only thing I would add associated with that, though, is as mentioned before, we do have a very beneficial territory associated with that from what we have in transmission capability capacity as well as we have great sites associated with that generation. But when you look at the demand associated with all these entities, you are going to have to add additional resources and additional infrastructure in order to meet the high load factor and high reliability demand of those entities.\nTravis Miller: Okay. So literally, the Microsoft Center that was announced can't come online until you build new generation or new transmission, however, that works out.\nMichael Luhrs: I wouldn't infer that from it. I would just infer that when you're talking about adding significant scale associated with the system, you have to make sure that you're meeting the reserve margins and reliability requirements, saying that they can't come online without any of that in place, I would say, would be sort of going a step too far associated with it.\nTravis Miller: Okay. Got it. And then on the different topic gas demand. What are you seeing right now in terms of gas demand? And how much gas demand growth is in your new and extended CapEx plan assumption?\nShawn Anderson : Yes, we're still seeing a fair amount of growth across our service territories, most notably, Virginia, Central Ohio continue to grow and continue to extend the system. We're still seeing customers close to 1% on a net customer basis, the total number of additions we have minus attrition is ending at about net 1% for the gas businesses. We continue to see demand from an economic development standpoint for onshoring and for gas pipelines to support electric vehicle battery manufacturers and a few other examples that we have across the service territory. We tend to be a little bit bearish in our forecast as it relates to total customer additions. Economic development and customer growth can be hard to predict. Therefore, we tend to mute what the forecast looks across the horizon for total customer count growth, but we're continuing to see close to that 1% on a trailing 12-month basis.\nTravis Miller: Okay, great. I appreciate all the thoughts.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gabe Moreen with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.\nGabriel Moreen: Hey, good morning, everyone. Just following up on the last question around gas. Can you just maybe give a little more color on the step change within Columbia CapEx? Are you accelerating work here? Is it costing more? Are there any discrete projects at various jurisdictions you point to. And then sort of as a second part to that, can you just talk about to what extent any changes in the gas forward curve, which has come down since the last five-year plan may or may not have played into the CapEx increase as well as the ability to keep customer bills 5% or lower? Thanks.\nShawn Anderson : Yes. You bet, Gabe. I appreciate the question. So the gas system hardening work that we're seeing. I don't know if I'd necessarily call it a step change so much as a glide into what the requirements will be for the completion of the Bersteel replacement programs. Some new first-generation plastic replacement programs are starting to pop up as well. We do have some gas AMI investment, which we've been focused on, and we would like to continue. We think that drives great efficiency and better service for our customers. So, there is some of that included as well. But IOI in-line inspection work continues as well as some transmission compliance. We expect that some PHMSA of rulemaking as well in the new year could give better indications on time lines associated with the compliance requirements for linked detection rules. So, there's a whole host of things for us to do to help harden the gas system, and that's what you're seeing in the capital allocation itself. And then in terms of the forward-look gas curve, the average cost for gas right now across our service territory is about $2.20, we've used the NYMEX curve in this forecast, which increases that by 43% next year, an additional 12% in the subsequent year. So, it already reflects a pretty healthy step up in gas costs that's included inside that fuel that we've projected across the horizon.\nGabriel Moreen: Great, thanks Shawn.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Levine with Citi. Please go ahead.\nRyan Levine: Good morning. Are there any steps that have been taken for NiSource or NIPSCO to enter a Q for critical gas generation infrastructure that could help accelerate the time to market for your customers?\nMichael Luhrs: Yes. I wouldn't get into those specific details associated with what we've done on those activities based as we're going through the commercial discussions. I will just say that we have been appropriately planning associated with what's needed just as the previous question was asking relative to there's any infrastructure required. All these facilities require some level of infrastructure, whether it be substation, transmission, generation, et cetera. But we have been -- we're appropriately aware and have been calibrated to that and have been positioning ourselves effectively.\nLloyd Yates: One of the advantages of NIPSCO is our proximity to the gas supplies to the Utica and Marcellus shales. So, I think as you look at these opportunities, I mean we mentioned earlier, approximately a robust transmission -- electric transmission system in proximity to gas supply are just critical advantages for the company.\nMichael Luhrs: And I will add one more thing to that. We are seeing that gas benefit and that gas benefit across territories in more than just Indiana. We see it in other of our territories because it's very beneficial relative to not only the onshoring, but also for data center activities. And other areas as a look of how to address potential power shortfalls in other areas.\nRyan Levine: And maybe a follow-up, given maybe increased demand for this type of infrastructure, how much of your new CapEx guidance change is associated with items previously in the plan costing more versus additional items being added to the CapEx plan?\nShawn Anderson : Ryan, I don't think we have that exact calc on what's an inflationary increase versus a change in compliance requirements, regulation requirement or what's necessary for us to deliver reliability for our customers. So wouldn't be able to parse it down. But I think the thematic answer is that additional work not the cost of the same work is what's driving the cost -- the direction it's headed. And we just continue to see the cost of compliance and regulation to increase, whether that's coming from EPA, whether that's coming from MISO and FERC whether that continues to come from PHMSA is really the driver of the capital allocation increase.\nRyan Levine: Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes our Q&A session. I will now turn the conference back over to Lloyd Yates, CEO, for closing remarks.\nLloyd Yates: Thank you for your interest, and thanks for your questions today. Thank you for your interest in NiSource. And we look forward to seeing all of you at the EEI financial conference in a couple of weeks.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Shawn Anderson",
            "content": "Thank you, Michael. Let's start on Slide nine. Third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.20 per share, an increase of $0.01 versus the same period one year ago. Higher rate base investments drove $61 million in incremental revenue and net financing benefits of approximately $26 million were also realized on a year-over-year basis. Customer count and usage also added $2.6 million across our electric and gas businesses versus last year and have grown over $28 million total for the year. Moving to Slide 10. Let's break down our CapEx plan through 2029. As Lloyd mentioned earlier, we've refreshed our 5-year plan outlook, which starts with a base capital plan of $19.3 billion. The enhanced base plan is $2.9 billion larger than our prior base plan, which is driven by a number of factors, including increased generation investments, gas compliance and system hardening projects, and investments to modernize our information technology systems. As Michael shared, the base plan now reflects the inclusion of the Templeton project, which shifted from our upside plan into our base plan after our teams reached commercial agreement on the ownership of the project. We have enhanced our disclosure on the new base plan to detail the investment themes we are seeing as necessary to deliver safe and reliable service to our customers. All of these investments have met our threshold to be included in the base plan, mainly based on socialization with stakeholders, compliance and safety requirements and commercial structures at an affordable value. We've also spent time refreshing the portfolio of projects in the upside plan, those that our teams are actively working on flowing into the base plan. The revised upside plan now sits at $1.8 billion, and we've included an estimation of when those projects may become viable in our CapEx charts, despite not yet being included in any of our base capital guidance or plans. The $1.8 billion upside category is slightly larger than our previous upside figure. It now consists of electric modernization, PHMSA compliance and legacy plastic and gas systems work as well as additional costs for MISO Tranche 1 projects. We continue to see increased demand for investment in our systems to deliver the growth and system capacity our stakeholders require while in alignment with the necessary operating standards. Once these projects meet our threshold to be included in the base plan, we will flow these through our full plan and provide updates along the way. I'd note here that the base and upside capital expenditures plans do not include any data center investment activity, which Lloyd and Michael highlighted earlier. We believe strongly that the data center strategy represents a compelling opportunity for NiSource. However, additional development of the strategy is required to meet our threshold to include in either the base or upside capital plans. With that said, the company is strongly positioned to advance this strategy. Continued execution on our financial commitments has strengthened the financial profile of the company, including its balance sheet positioning, which enables NiSource to be opportunistic in capital allocation decisions. The constructive regulatory backdrop in Indiana supports a utility-centric regulatory compact and the vertical integration of the business model minimizes complexity for customers and regulators, while providing flexibility around cash flow recovery. NiSource has deep access to capital markets and maintains flexibility to efficiently finance data center opportunities. NiSource also has a long-standing history of supporting large load customers in the steel industry and has experience working with large customers to deliver value for all stakeholders. Let's move to Slide 11. We are pleased to report that we have priced $600 million in common equity through our forward ATM structure, completing our stated guidance for 2024. Along with the junior subordinated notes issued this year, we've continued to strengthen the balance sheet positioning of the company. Despite the increase in capital expenditures included in our revised base capital plan, we do not expect changes to our financing plan and continue to target 14% to 16% FFO to debt in all years of our plan using a balanced mix of cash from operations new long-term debt and $200 million to $300 million of annual maintenance equity to maintain our capital structure through the use of our at-the-market program. Limiting regulatory lag and sequencing our capital expenditures through efficient capital recovery mechanisms, including capital trackers and forward-looking rate mechanisms helped NiSource minimize delays in recovery of capital deployed. Approximately 81% of our new base capital is expected to begin recovery inside 12 months, which fuels reasonable returns of capital and minimizes the need for new equity. This is the same strategy, which has enabled NiSource to achieve the 9.9% trailing 12-month enterprise ROE, which Lloyd highlighted, and which helps us use cash flow returns from the business to fund growth in the CapEx plans. Of note, we will continue to be opportunistic in the junior subordinated debt marketplace to strengthen the position of our FFO to debt as needed throughout our planned horizon. On Slide 12, you'll see our updated long-term financial commitments. The new base plan drives 8% to 10% rate base growth over the five-year period and continues our guidance of achieving annual adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 8% across each year of the plan, reflecting out through the 2029 period. The value of this is notable. As you know, we rebase long-term EPS growth guidance off of actual results and outperformance will flow through the full plan and compound when incorporating our growth rate. For example, as we initiate 2025 guidance of $1.84 to $1.88, the midpoint of this range is $0.10 per share higher than was estimated in our 2022 Investor Day driven by outperforming the midpoint in all years of our plan. And this midpoint is 9.4% above the original midpoint when we initiated guidance for 2024. We are reaffirming our guidance of $1.70 to $1.74 for 2024 and again, expect to achieve results in the upper half of this range. Additionally, we remain committed to 14% to 16% FFO to debt in all years of the plan. As was the case with our prior plan, the upside CapEx category is not required to drive any of the financial commitments shown in the upper center box, and we will flow through any impacts associated with increases to our base case capital plan from the upside plan when those projects meet our standards to be included. I'd note, we remain focused on minimizing the financial impact, better safety, reliability and compliance work has across our customer base. efficient projects like the Templeton Wind Energy Center enable an increase in CapEx plans while reducing the planned cost to customer and eliminate fuel costs for this portion of generation. Our revised plan projects less than 5% average annual bill increases across NiSource. I'll conclude with highlights of our growing track record on Slide 13. Our financial commitments are on track for 2024. We have established guidance for 2025 and remain confident in our near-term and long-term guidance remains resilient to market and forces outside our control and are based on realistic and executable assumptions. Settlements in our Pennsylvania and Kentucky rate cases and approvals for numerous Indiana generation and technology investments underscore our execution of recovery for critical investments to ensure safety and reliability of our systems. Year-to-date financing activity has been completed and the diversification utilized and the junior subordinated debt marketplace demonstrates our balance sheet flexibility and continues to fortify our balance sheet positioning. Lastly, our base and upside CapEx plans demonstrate both programmatic investment plans and accelerated investment opportunities for customers and investors to reiterate our rate base and adjusted EPS guidance include neither the upside CapEx nor any data center load or investment and are built upon the known and socialized regulatory programs, which have contributed to the 8.1% adjusted EPS growth rate we've executed since 2021. The value proposition NiSource continues to offer investors is diversified and regulated utility assets with the opportunity to invest in both programmatic gas infrastructure and the long-term energy transition story of a fully integrated electric business. These elements have been core to our story for some time, but the emerging opportunity to support economic development, onshoring and new data center development truly differentiate our value proposition relative to many alternatives in the market today. I'd now like to turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Yes. Just to be clear, the $19.3 billion capital plan is fully financed through all the systems that we've shared with you today. The $1.8 billion of potential upside CapEx may require modest amounts of equity based on the cash flow profiles of those projects, when they get sequenced and how it would work through the regulatory mechanisms themselves. The incremental investment opportunities are not captured in any of those systems that I just highlighted. That's where data center investments would theoretically live. Therefore, we would have to reevaluate everything to incorporate incremental investment opportunities through our systems. But we don't need a full planned refresh to do that, we'll flow those through our systems, and you'll know those when we know those through this mechanism. Yes. Let me just step through it real quick. So, the $1.8 billion of upside CapEx, you can actually see it in the capital allocation side that we shared. But to your point, we don't see much upside CapEx in 2025, but we do see some start to emerge in 2026, 2027. And you can kind of see it layered in. We'll continue to move those around on those bars based on the profile and the development of those projects. As we know more, we'll update that CapEx allocation on where those upside opportunities might land. And then in terms of updates, the IRP, it seems we're clearly working through the preferred portfolio and what it takes to action those. Likewise, with data centres well underway and under development. I imagine both are pretty significant strategies for the company. Therefore, I imagine we'll discuss those on the 4Q call, but I don't know yet what the outlook will be and how those will be incorporated. Again, we'll need to do the commercial development and understand the value creation for all stakeholders. Once we understand that and roll that through the systems, we'll post it here on the call. Yes, sure. Appreciate it, Durgesh. More efficient capital allocation, which minimizes regulatory lag. That's really the key, and it supports a higher cash flow from operations, which we're seeing across our systems, maybe about 10% over the course of the plan horizon. That's helping to contribute to a more efficient financing structure. But again, I'd note we worked ahead here in 2024 on credit quality, both in terms of outperforming our financial projections in the current year and utilizing the junior sub marketplace for $1 billion of funding, which were not initially in the plan. So, we've already made some of this progress to date and we're capitalizing on some of that benefit also. Yes, we're still seeing a fair amount of growth across our service territories, most notably, Virginia, Central Ohio continue to grow and continue to extend the system. We're still seeing customers close to 1% on a net customer basis, the total number of additions we have minus attrition is ending at about net 1% for the gas businesses. We continue to see demand from an economic development standpoint for onshoring and for gas pipelines to support electric vehicle battery manufacturers and a few other examples that we have across the service territory. We tend to be a little bit bearish in our forecast as it relates to total customer additions. Economic development and customer growth can be hard to predict. Therefore, we tend to mute what the forecast looks across the horizon for total customer count growth, but we're continuing to see close to that 1% on a trailing 12-month basis. Yes. You bet, Gabe. I appreciate the question. So the gas system hardening work that we're seeing. I don't know if I'd necessarily call it a step change so much as a glide into what the requirements will be for the completion of the Bersteel replacement programs. Some new first-generation plastic replacement programs are starting to pop up as well. We do have some gas AMI investment, which we've been focused on, and we would like to continue. We think that drives great efficiency and better service for our customers. So, there is some of that included as well. But IOI in-line inspection work continues as well as some transmission compliance. We expect that some PHMSA of rulemaking as well in the new year could give better indications on time lines associated with the compliance requirements for linked detection rules. So, there's a whole host of things for us to do to help harden the gas system, and that's what you're seeing in the capital allocation itself. And then in terms of the forward-look gas curve, the average cost for gas right now across our service territory is about $2.20, we've used the NYMEX curve in this forecast, which increases that by 43% next year, an additional 12% in the subsequent year. So, it already reflects a pretty healthy step up in gas costs that's included inside that fuel that we've projected across the horizon. Ryan, I don't think we have that exact calc on what's an inflationary increase versus a change in compliance requirements, regulation requirement or what's necessary for us to deliver reliability for our customers. So wouldn't be able to parse it down. But I think the thematic answer is that additional work not the cost of the same work is what's driving the cost -- the direction it's headed. And we just continue to see the cost of compliance and regulation to increase, whether that's coming from EPA, whether that's coming from MISO and FERC whether that continues to come from PHMSA is really the driver of the capital allocation increase."

            "name": "Michael Luhrs",
            "content": "Thank you, Lloyd. Good morning. We continue our disciplined and methodical approach to developing and effectuating a robust pipeline of investments to benefit stakeholders. I'll begin on Slide six with an update on our generation investments. As Lloyd mentioned, there has been substantial progress made related to generation investments that will benefit all stakeholders. With Gibson and Fairbanks having received regulatory approval for full ownership in August, we have now converted four projects to full ownership, which will materially lower cost to customers. In addition, we have progressed well in bringing our renewable assets into service. The 200-megawatt Cavalry Solar project with 45 megawatts of storage was placed in service in May, and we expect the 435-megawatt Dunns Bridge II solar project with 56 megawatts of storage to come online very early next year. Fairbanks and Gibson are expected to be in service later in 2025 with no changes to time lines since our last update. 100% of modules for Fairbanks are already on site and Gibson is expected to have all modules delivered by early Q1 2025. In continuing the work of maximizing the benefits of our assets for customers, NIPSCO filed a notification earlier this week with the IURC that an application will be filed requesting to convert the 200-megawatt Templeton Wind Energy Center in Benton County, Indiana, which was approved by the IURC of the PPA to a build transfer agreement in which NIPSCO will own the asset upon completion. If approved, it will reduce customer costs versus the PPA structure at a valuable wind property to our generation portfolio and increase shareholder investment. It is a great example of the NiSource team at work creating a win for all stakeholders. The projects on Slide six are the result of the 2018 and 2021 NIPSCO Integrated Resource Plan and corresponding RFP processes. These projects represent billions of dollars of economically driven investment in the state of Indiana, the majority of which are already delivering zero commodity cost solar and wind, driving down fuel related charges to customers. Please turn to Slide seven. On Monday, the NIPSCO team held the fifth and last stakeholder meeting in the 2024 IRP process. potential incremental generation needs for the planning horizon are driven by three key factors: New EPA fossil fuel regulations, MISO reliability rules and data center demand. As most of you are aware, the EPA greenhouse gas scanners and fossil fuel fired power plant guidelines finalized earlier this year, may limit capacity factors, require carbon sequestration investments or hydrogen utilization for gas generation capacity. Additionally, MISO's four-season capacity construct and the reduction in capacity accreditation under the direct loss of load market design, will have a substantial impact on generation requirements in the MISO footprint. These changes, combined with the significant and growing interest in data centres and NIPSCO supports our IRP reference case, which includes these rule updates and 2,600 megawatts of data center demand. We intend to file the final IRP at the IURC in December. As we work through the major changes to electric demand, we are evaluating the most customer beneficial glide path and our 2030 interim commitment as we move towards our 2040 net zero goal. Environmental objectives remain an important component of our overall company priorities, and we have made significant progress with more than a 70% reduction relative to our 2005 CO2 baseline, and we will continue to balance customer cost reliability and pace of these investments to meet these goals. On Slide eight, you'll find an overview of capital opportunities not included in our base or upside financial plans. These items are under development by NiSource strategy and commercial teams to build the business cases to advance these opportunities for stakeholders. To highlight the breadth of opportunities we have and are developing, I will highlight two disparate examples, data and analytics employing AI and data center work. As Lloyd mentioned, we have made real progress in the strong and effective deployment of technology upgrades, but we have also been building data and analytics capabilities utilizing AI. We have built, tested and are now deploying work management utilizing AI with our gas operations, and we have already seen significant improvements, enabling operational goals, lowering cost, increasing CapEx deployment efficiency and derisking our operations. At the other end of the spectrum, our data center deal team is meeting with qualified counterparties to understand their business models and needs as we develop structures for NIPSCO to support data center generation and transmission needs while ensuring reliability for the region and protecting existing customers. We are actively working to enable access to the speed consistent with the data center demand profile. Fortunately, NIPSCO has a very strong infrastructure network in sites, which have sound technical fundamentals for generation and transmission buildout within the time frames beneficial to data center development. So, though we have not included any data center activity within our plans or upside, we continue to focus on developing and vetting potential opportunities that would be beneficial to existing customers shareholders, data centres and our communities. As mentioned, when we started, we will develop these opportunities in a methodical and disciplined manner just as we've done with the Templeton wind project. Shawn will touch on more of that next. Shawn? No, you hit it, Lloyd, we were going to work through these opportunities in a manner, as you said, disciplined and methodically, make sure we're providing the benefits to existing customers, that it's accretive for shareholders. And then as we come through those opportunities at which point they are accretive or we know that they're beneficial, we will bring them forward just as we do with the Templeton Wind project today. Yes. Thank you. The only thing I'll add to that associated with it is if you look at the IRP detail, you can see what we posted on Monday. What the 2,600 megawatts imputes relative to generation assets and what those assets would entail associated with it. And the investments associated that would be required in storage and CCGTs and other mechanisms. But at this point in time, we don't have additional detail out to that, just as Shawn said, that would be more of a 2025 activity. As Lloyd commented, I will comment that we have multiple scenarios in the IRP process, covering a range of outcomes and opportunities, including an upside case associated with 6,000 megawatts, but again, you can see from the materials, sort of what that could potentially entail associated with assets. Yes. I'd be happy to talk about that more. So, when you look at what we've done, just hitting on one of the points you made. We have done a lot of work associated with the generation assets, which are very beneficial relative to customers and all stakeholders and shareholders associated with it. We will continue to do work like that to make sure we're maximizing the opportunities and the benefits to all parties. And so, we're excited about the opportunity associated with Templeton should it be approved by the commission. When you look at the IRP and the elements going forward, in pretty much all cases especially given the DLOL rules for MISO, you need storage and you need between 500 megawatts and a gigawatt of storage associated with it. And that's to help address those different accreditation methodology for MISO and the impacts of them. At the same time, to statable resources, we've all known that statable resources will be necessary, batteries help with that. But at the same time, you also are going to need additional spinning assets such as gas turbines or peakers. You see that when you look at those scenarios, regardless of data centres, you need more dispatchable resources, that will show up in most likely the form of cash generation. I will emphasize with that. We are still focused on our 2014 goal and we continue to work through those, even though we make sure that we're doing our interim goals associated with it in the most customer beneficial way. But you can just see from those what those potential assets look like in the near term, even though I will say -- as you look at that, most of those assets would be in the sort of as you're looking beyond the 2029 kind of time frame associated with it. So not as much in the next couple of years, as Shawn highlighted. And then obviously, the resource plan goes significantly further out, which then there's significantly more resource potential additions as you move through time with the EPA rules. The only thing I would add is when we go through the IRP process, it includes stakeholders across it. So those conversations relative to MISO accreditation the scenarios around it, the EPA requirements, which may require carbon sequestration and storage have already been gone. So, we've been having those conversations with stakeholders now and introducing that, what the impact of that would be and also what that means some potential portfolios. The only thing I would highlight relative to data centres in addition is that we are working through those activities, and I would just say we are well aware of the demand requirements of the entities associated with what they would want to do. So, as we work through it in a methodical and disciplined fashion. I would also say we're working through what it takes to meet that demand in a methodical and disciplined fashion to satisfy our customer needs. My comment to that would be, and then others can jump in associated with it. My comment to that would be that's one of the reasons the vertically integrated model has so been official associated with it. because we have requirements and whatever is brought to bear that we have to provide for the reserve margin on top of that as well as what's associated with the accreditation reduction. So, I would say, fundamentally, supply/demand, we're helping to keep that supply-demand in balance associated by what we're doing and what we're looking at would be required in resource additions, which is also why we included the case -- the reference case with 2,600 megawatts of potential large low like data centres and the scenario upside. So, though we are always cognizant of that and focus on what that impact the customers in, I would also say that vertically integrated model helps mitigate a lot of that risk. The only thing I would add associated with that, though, is as mentioned before, we do have a very beneficial territory associated with that from what we have in transmission capability capacity as well as we have great sites associated with that generation. But when you look at the demand associated with all these entities, you are going to have to add additional resources and additional infrastructure in order to meet the high load factor and high reliability demand of those entities. I wouldn't infer that from it. I would just infer that when you're talking about adding significant scale associated with the system, you have to make sure that you're meeting the reserve margins and reliability requirements, saying that they can't come online without any of that in place, I would say, would be sort of going a step too far associated with it. Yes. I wouldn't get into those specific details associated with what we've done on those activities based as we're going through the commercial discussions. I will just say that we have been appropriately planning associated with what's needed just as the previous question was asking relative to there's any infrastructure required. All these facilities require some level of infrastructure, whether it be substation, transmission, generation, et cetera. But we have been -- we're appropriately aware and have been calibrated to that and have been positioning ourselves effectively. And I will add one more thing to that. We are seeing that gas benefit and that gas benefit across territories in more than just Indiana. We see it in other of our territories because it's very beneficial relative to not only the onshoring, but also for data center activities. And other areas as a look of how to address potential power shortfalls in other areas."

            "name": "Lloyd Yates",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on slide three. The NiSource investment thesis is simple. We serve our customers by delivering safe and reliable energy at an affordable value. Affordable energy requires efficient capital deployment, safe asset operations and constructive regulatory recovery mechanisms. These fundamentals generate competitive returns while enhancing our balance sheet position. Importantly, these are the foundation to the NiSource business plan which continues to offer compelling value to stakeholders. Driven by regulated utility operations across six highly constructive jurisdictions, offering diversification across fuel type and regulatory location, strong execution from our team and these business fundamentals are what have driven a trailing twelve month 9.9% earned ROE at the NiSource level, demonstrating our focus on shareholder returns despite rapidly growing deployed capital and declining financial leverage. This is a GAAP number with an adjustment made only to normalized weather. All of this informs our long-term value proposition which our teams continue to advance each quarter. But before we focus on the long-term plan refresh, let's turn to Slide four and touch on the progress our teams have made on our regulatory activity. Being a trusted energy partner and enhancing NiSource's superior regulatory and stakeholder foundation is a priority and we believe differentiates us from peer regulated utilities. We remain active in rate case and tracker filings and build our credibility through our six-state footprint by utilizing a stakeholder focused mindset as we approach these processes. Last month an administrative law judge in Pennsylvania recommended the Commission approve our general rate case multiparty settlement as filed. In October we reached a settlement in our Kentucky General rate case. Approval of both these settlements is subject to final Commission approval. In Indiana, we received approvals for both our Solar CPCN amendments to add full ownership of solar facilities as well as a CPCN they construct a gas peaking facility, all of which helped NiSource retire its remaining coal generating stations by the end of 2028. We also received approval to advance our strategy of using technology to more efficiently serve our customers through an upgraded work and asset management system which utilizes data and analytics through AI to raise productivity and efficiency across the dispatch of our operations team. This includes deferral for one time and ongoing expenses and capital returns for the program which went live in July for our electric operations and will go live next summer for our gas operations. This new technology is also an example of making strategic investments to better inform our culture and enhance risk management across our systems to deliver operational excellence for our customers. Our relentless focus on operational excellence enhances our risk management posture and drives protection for our customers, communities and shareholders, through our capital allocation framework. We face many potential categories of risk which constantly evolve and risk management is central to our values. The utility industry continues to face potential challenges head on, whether it relates to natural disasters, the interest rate environment, inflationary pressures on cost structures or other items of uncertainty. Our teams are constantly implementing proactive solutions to add layers of protection into our plans and lead industry partners to understand and utilize best practices to de risk our execution and deliver our commitments. We have high confidence in our ability to achieve our financial commitments which we believe are highly executable. We are reaffirming 2024 adjusted EPS guidance of $1.70 to $1.74 and we continue to expect to achieve the upper half of this range. We are initiating 2025 adjusted EPS guidance of $1.84 to $1.88 consistent with maintaining our existing 6% to 8% annual growth commitment. Today we are also announcing a refresh of our outlook across our five-year planning horizon and extend this commitment and our overall financial guidelines to 2029. Key elements of that plan included an updated five-year capital plan which is $19.3 billion or equivalent to 89% of our total current rate base. This is slightly larger than our prior plan's 87% of year-end 2023 rate base. This drives 8% to 10% rate base growth over to 2025 to 2029 period, which fuels our ability to increase our adjusted earnings per share growth rate by 6% to 8% annually. Our investments in strengthening the balance sheet support our commitment to target FFO to debt of 14% to 16% in all years of the plan. Our work does not stop at the base capital plan. We are fortunate to have a robust portfolio of valuable customer investments include and extend far beyond our five-year plan horizon, which Shawn will detail later. Our teams remain active in developing this portfolio of projects to meet our standards necessary to be included in our base plan. One example of work by our teams is the development of our strategy to serve the robust interest by data centre customers for power to be served by NIPSCO. The fundamentals of the Northwest Indiana region are compelling to potential data center customers, access to critical infrastructure, including a robust transmission system and proximity to critical fiber connections. Predictable climate and weather with low natural catastrophe risk and a constructive business climate, including favorable tax structures, low-cost land and a supportive state government are all favorable factors in advancing development of data centres in the region. Our teams are working to evaluate this buildout, which could provide benefits to our existing system customers, enhance our communities and local tax space and provide compelling investment opportunities for our shareholders. Northwest Indiana is a premier location for data centres to locate. Simply put, there's potential for substantial value creation for all stakeholders and checking all of these boxes is important to NiSource. Now let's focus on the core execution our teams continue to deliver upon with our regulatory engagement over the last three years detailed on Slide five. During the trailing 12-month period ending last month, our average residential gas bill declined 16% on a total bill basis. Affordability remains a key priority for both NIPSCO and the Columbia family of companies, and we continue to be thoughtful about this as we advance the critical safety, compliance and reliability work necessary to deliver safe and reliable energy to our customers. In September, NIPSCO filed its first electric general rate case in two years, driven by nearly $2.5 billion of incremental investment for our customers and communities in Northern Indiana. The case incorporates the planned 2025 retirement of units 17 and 18 at the Shafer Generating Station as well as four new solar and storage projects now reflecting NIPSCO's full ownership Major investments such as these are examples of our continued partnership with state policymakers, regulators and customers. Switching to Pennsylvania, we expect a final commission order and a new rate implementation in December. In Ohio, $285 million of investment was approved in August for our capital expenditure program rider and we expect to submit for two major capital riders in the state again early next year. In Virginia, intervenor testimony was filed in October for our general rate case and a final order is expected early next year. Before I turn the call over, I want to thank all of our employees and contractors for their dedication to NiSource values, doing things safer, better, more efficient and for less calls. Our customers and shareholders are like allowing you every day. I'll now turn things over to Michael. So I'll start, and I'll let Michael Luhrs provide more detail NiSource sees the data center opportunity is just a really good incremental investment opportunity. But I think for the company and where we are now, it's primarily a 2025 activity. I think as we progress in discussions with some of the counterparties, who want to kind of get down to the detail and make sure that we do this in a disciplined and methodical way, and that's just going to take time. And if you think about what we just with Templeton Wind project. I mean our ability to do things in a disciplined, methodical way has been probably one of the keys to why we've been executing so well. So, Mike, anything to add to that? Michael, do you want to take that? No, not at this time. The point is, I think all of the data center, the activity and the associated work with the counterparty is primarily the 2025 activity. And Microsoft did announce that last year, but I think the timetable we're on is 2025. Yes. We just moved that -- the upside to the base plan. So Durgesh, I mentioned in the value safer, better, faster and more efficient and to lower cost. And I think there's a lot more opportunity at NiSource to drive those values through the organization. We talked about our work in asset management process and using AI to improve our schedule and efficiencies. So, our hands on time and our workforce has gone up and we're just getting more done with the people we have. And I think when you look at the foreseeable future, I do see -- continue to see flat O&M Project Apollo is in its second year, and there's just a whole lot more opportunity. So, we see being flat for the foreseeable future by being more effective and more efficient. Yes. Let me start that Mike can weigh in. You think about NIPSCO, where we serve electricity, even though we're part of MISO, we continue to be a vertically integrated utility, responsible for generation transmission and distribution. I think the MISO model gives us a competitive advantage in terms of speed to market to facilitate some of these data center load. I think with respect to the speed, the data center grows or below demand, I think that's part of the conversation of the activity for 2025. At what pace can we build it? And can we build to match the demand of those data center loads as part of the conversations that we're having that will go into 2025. Mike, anything to add to that? Yes, we would need to build to facilitate the kind of low demand we're talking about, whether it's Microsoft or any other counterparty. Most of these investments would require both generation and transmission. One of the advantages of NIPSCO is our proximity to the gas supplies to the Utica and Marcellus shales. So, I think as you look at these opportunities, I mean we mentioned earlier, approximately a robust transmission -- electric transmission system in proximity to gas supply are just critical advantages for the company. Thank you for your interest, and thanks for your questions today. Thank you for your interest in NiSource. And we look forward to seeing all of you at the EEI financial conference in a couple of weeks."

I'd this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter NiSource Earnings Conference Call 2024. [Operator Instructions]. I'd now like to turn the call over to Chris Turnure, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nChris Turnure: Good morning, and welcome to the NiSource Second Quarter 2024 Investor Call. Joining me today are President and Chief Executive Officer, Lloyd Yates; Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Shawn Anderson; Executive Vice President of Strategy and Risk and Chief Commercial Officer, Michael Luhrs; and Executive Vice President and Group President, NiSource Utilities, Melody Birmingham. The purpose of this presentation is to review NiSource\u2019s financial performance for the second quarter of 2024 as well as provide an update on our operations and growth drivers. Following our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open the call to your questions. Slides for today\u2019s call are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. We would like to remind you that some of the statements made during this presentation will be forward-looking. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. Information concerning such risks and uncertainties is included in the risk factors and MD&A sections of our periodic SEC filings. Additionally, some of the statements made on this call relate to non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the supplemental slides, segment information and full financial schedules for information on the most directly comparable GAAP measure and a reconciliation of these measures. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Lloyd.\nLloyd Yates: Thank you, Chris. And good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 3. The NiSource investment thesis is simple. We serve our customers by delivering safe and reliable energy at an affordable price. Affordable energy requires efficient capital deployment, safe asset operations and constructive regulatory recovery mechanisms. These fundamentals generate competitive returns while enhancing our balance sheet position. Our trailing 12-month earned ROE at the NiSource level was 10.3%, demonstrating our focus on shareholder returns despite rapidly growing deployed capital. This is a GAAP number with an adjustment made only to normalize weather. Slide 4 shows our key priorities. Today, we reported second quarter 2024 adjusted EPS of $0.21 We are reaffirming 2024 adjusted EPS guidance of $1.70 to $1.74 and we now expect to achieve the upper half of this range. We are also reaffirming annual 2023 to 2028 guidance for adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 8% for all years of the plan and rate base growth of 8% to 10%. We continue to target FFO-to-debt of 14% to 16% in all years of the plan. Our superior regulatory and stakeholder foundation is differentiated. We have a long history of working collaboratively to deliver value across diverse constituencies. A huge effort is made to communicate proactively with stakeholders and demonstrate the value of our operations and investments on an ongoing basis, both during and between full rate cases, while also incorporating a balanced perspective from many of our participating stakeholders. Engaging with stakeholders enhances alignment, providing advanced notice of coming changes, often helping to pave the way for stakeholder support. Balance sheet flexibility remains on this page for a reason. Late last year, we raised over $2 billion in minority interest funding and projected up to $600 million of common equity issuance for 2024, to which we've made great progress. We have also been active in the hybrid security market last quarter. NiSource is prepared for unforeseen challenges and opportunities. We have regularly discussed our upside CapEx investment programs for the past several quarters. Recently, we have seen an acceleration of customer interest in our Northern Indiana service area. In June, governor Holcomb of Indiana announced plans for a significant new data center in a NIPSCO footprint, following granting of a state sales tax exemption. This is the fourth data center announcement statewide this year, and just one of the many indications of customer interest and stakeholder support for NIPSCO. Indiana offers many attractive features to data center developers. Access to infrastructure, including roads and water, land, predictable climate and weather, low cost of living, stable and low taxes, and supportive regulation in government are just a few. We believe data center development can enhance our local tax base, diversify the employment base across the State of Indiana, and provide greater value to existing customers and shareholders. We are also uniquely positioned to be the convener of key stakeholders in serving the broader public interest. This puts us at the precipice of discussions on data center advancement in a balanced and thoughtful manner. Vertically integrated utilities like NIPSCO are part of an interdependent group of communities and stakeholders, and we'll be thoughtful about our system safety, reliability, and cost allocation for all our customers. We'll move as quickly as possible while maintaining the integrity of our commercial planning, regulatory procurement, and operational execution processes. Please turn to slide 5. In July, several new IT applications went live at NIPSCO Electric Operations. These are the first stages of rollout across categories of technology investment and are the culmination of work beginning back in 2022. Major software programs such as these supports safer and more efficient work practices. The new systems were quickly put to the test during severe July weather and performed as designed. I am pleased to report on this successful launch and look forward to upcoming rollouts across different areas of the organization. This is only one piece of our operational excellence initiative. Project Apollo continues to find efficiencies throughout the organization after ramping up last year. Stable O&M over our plan horizon continues to be a part of achieving our financial commitments. Last month, a major windstorm impacted our Indiana service area, bringing tornadic activity, wind speeds up to 90 miles per hour, and heavy rainfall. Our electric operations team monitors evolving weather patterns and prepares resources in advance of storms, including engagement of contractors and mutual aid crews from neighboring utilities in Michigan and Wisconsin. Our preparation and around the clock response involve 400 line workers and 86 tree trimming crews enabled a successful restoration. I want to thank each and every employee and contractor for their tireless dedication to restoring service and safety across our communities. In summary, the NiSource business plan offers a differentiated opportunity to return value to all stakeholders. Our teams continue to deliver on our commitments, financially, operationally, and being a trusted business partner to customers and employees. Beyond keeping our plans on track, our teams are vigilantly seeking enhancements to an already premium plan in ways to enhance value as we move forward. I'd now like to turn the call over to Melody.\nMelody Birmingham: Alright. Thank you, Lloyd. I want to spend a few moments updating each of you on the important regulatory activity we have across our companies which is profiled on Slide 6. Our focus on operational excellence coupled with the soft in commodity pricing, has driven lower bills over the last 12 months across our gas businesses despite the critical investments our teams continue to make. During the 12 months, which ended June 30, our average residential gas customer bill declined over 16% from a year earlier on a total basis. In Indiana, last week, The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission approved the NIPSCO Gas Rate Case unanimous settlement, which was reached in March. The approval incorporated $1 billion of additional capital investment versus our last rate case, a new weather normalization adjustment and approval of NIPSCO's automated metering infrastructure or AMI project. In Kentucky, our general rate case was filed in May and we expect intervener testimony later this month with hearings in October. Also, wanted to note the Kentucky Public Service Commission Chair Kent Chandler recently vacated his post at the end of his three-year term, which ended on June 30th. Our work in Pennsylvania is a great demonstration of the value of our risk reduction strategy and alignment with our stakeholders. Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania met with the Pennsylvania Utility Commission in late 2022 and was the first gas utility to seek the commission's approval for the replacement of vintage plastic pipe in our long term infrastructure plan. The commission approved Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania's request early in 2023. Just recently, the chairman of the commission made a motion directing other natural gas companies to amend their infrastructure plans to prioritize the replacement of vintage plastic pipe on their systems as well. Meanwhile, our Pennsylvania rate case continues to progress on schedule after initial intervenor testimony was filed in June and hearings were held last month. We remain confident in achieving a constructive outcome to support our stakeholders and the value of our energy investments for Pennsylvanian customers and communities. In Virginia last month, the Commonwealth was named the top state in the country for business by CNBC for the third time in the last five-years. The survey considered factors ranging from education quality to the cost of doing business. Also recently, our Columbia Gas of Virginia team reached a preliminary settlement with a customer to build a gas pipeline to serve on-site generation for the customer's data center operations. This project has the potential to be one of the largest multi-tenant data center operations in the world. This is made possible by the highly reliable and on demand characteristics of natural gas, which will fuel the generation necessary to house this critical data. It's projects like these that can contribute to economic growth and lead to increased demand for energy and infrastructure services. In Ohio, our team was able to find a solution to help keep advanced manufacturer and extruder of aluminum, Pennex, as a valued customer and vital employer in the state. Both Columbia Gas of Ohio and Pennex will now invest millions of dollars into the local economy, supporting 100s of jobs and expanding manufacturing operations in an area that does not have many development opportunities. Projects such as this one is helping our communities and helping our communities thrive. These developments also create upside in our plans, growth on our system, and create more opportunities for residential expansion within the region. Early last month, NiSource released our 2024 Environmental, Social and Governance, or ESG, report. The report demonstrates progress on key initiatives designed to make a positive impact on the communities we serve while valuing our customers. Highlights include continued reduction in fugitive methane emissions from gas, main, and service lines, increased diverse supplier spending, and advancement towards our top decile safety performance. NiSource continues to achieve top quartile ESG performance when aggregated across five key ESG raters. In May, NiSource was awarded the top AAA ESG rating for the third consecutive year by MSCI ESG ratings. The AAA rating is reserved for the top 10% of utilities, and the company was assessed as an ESG leader in corporate governance, corporate behavior, human capital development and toxic emissions and waste. In July, we received our annual Financial Times Stock Exchange Index, or FTSE, ESG score and we now rank in the 89th percentile of global utility companies. Our FTSE ESG score increased two deciles since July of 2023, and last but not least, I would like to highlight the work our teams are doing to improve our overall customer satisfaction. In the J. D. Power Gas Residential Midyear 2024 customer satisfaction survey, Columbia Gas of Ohio, Columbia Gas of Kentucky, and Columbia Gas of Virginia outperformed the industry average within their respective segments and quite notably, Columbia Gas of Virginia was named number one the top gas utility brand in the country. I'll now turn things over to Shawn.\nShawn Anderson: Thanks, Melody. I'd like to begin by discussing the status of our generation assets under construction which are being developed to support the integrated resource plan preferred portfolio from the 2018 and 2021 IRPs. In May, we completed Cavalry Solar, which is our third solar project owned by NIPSCO. It will provide power to approximately 60,000 homes in White County and is expected to generate $25 million of tax revenue for the county over its life. Construction continues on our remaining three solar build transfer projects and 4 PPA projects. All of these projects under construction remain on track and on budget to support the energy transition NIPSCO has been executing since 2020 and which will retire our Shaffer Generating Station by the end of 2025 and Michigan City by the end of 2028. NIPSCO filed unopposed proposed orders for two of these projects, Fairbanks and Gibson, and CPCN amendment proceedings, and the records are now closed in both. We expect final orders later this month. The record is also closed in the gas peaker CPCN proceeding and a final order is expected in the fourth quarter. In total, these ongoing generation investments add $2.1 billion of capital expenditures to support our retiring coal plants and are fully represented in the $16.4 billion base capital plan and satisfy the preferred portfolio from the 2021 IRP. Turning our attention to the latest IRP process, in late June, the NIPSCO team held the second of five stakeholder meetings leading up to an anticipated filing in November. These discussions outlined scenarios which included an incremental need for generation by 2035 of 2.6 gigawatts for the reference case and 8.6 gigawatts in the emerging load sensitivity case. It is important to note that the potential load growth assumptions built into these scenarios are not the total or maximum range of new load growth, but rather a risk adjusted case using assumptions of how much of each project could be executed by each date. Note, the IRP process looks at a 20-year load forecast for our region and is not a direct forecast of future NiSource generation projects or investment. With that said, the interest demonstrated from new customers to develop in the Northwest Indiana region is significant and presents a tremendous opportunity for our customers and communities to enhance tax base, diversify employment opportunities, and participate in the technological innovation datacenters bring to our nation. Consistent with last quarter, this potential opportunity is not included in our base case or upside financial plans, and we will continue to advance commercial discussions to enhance visibility in the coming months. As we review our five-year base investment plan on Slide 8, it's important to note the diversified nature of these investments, which span across electric generation as well as gas and electric distribution modernization, system hardening, and customer growth. Our projects lack concentration risk by fuel type or by operating company and are highly executable given the skilled labor and partnerships we've developed. Let's move forward to slide 9. We also continue to work through the planning, design, regulatory, and timing considerations for projects not yet included in our $16.4 billion base capital plan. Automated meter reading or AMI investments commenced recently in Indiana. It is expected to drive operational efficiencies and enhance our customer experience. A portion of total AMI across the NiSource companies is included in our base capital plan with the potential to expand across the rest of our gas companies. We are developing MISO Long Range Transmission Planning or LRTP Tranche 1 projects expected to come online late this decade. The three projects are the Indiana portion of a major multi state line and are included in our base financial plan. Preliminary engineering has been conducted and point to higher costs which exceed original MISO estimates. Our base plan does not include the additional CapEx potentially necessary to complete these projects. LRTP Tranche 2 continues to be a longer term investment opportunity that would likely commence beyond the timeline of our current financial plan. These projects skew towards higher voltage transmission and would not begin operation until early next decade. We have right of first refusal on projects in our service territory and expect a final MISO plan late this year. Now I'll transition to our financial results. Second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.21 per share, a $0.10 per share increase versus the $0.11 per share reported in the same period last year. Net revenue increased 15% year-over-year, including $8 million of incremental normalized customer usage. Our regulatory weather normalization mechanisms continue to protect both customers and shareholders from volatility. In the second quarter, these constructs had an approximately $6 million revenue impact versus normal weather. Our states are growing, helping to reduce customer costs and support safety and reliability improvements to our system. Customer count and total weather normalized gas throughput for residential and commercial customers grew in the first half across our system. Virginia and Ohio were standouts with an average first half weather normalized throughput growth of 7.1% for residential and 5.7% for commercial customers across both states. While the load growth forecasts from the IRP demonstrate a massive long-term increase of 11% compounded annually from 2024 to 2035 in the reference case, normalized electric load grew 5% in the second quarter from our existing customers alone. Residential and commercial classes were particularly strong and further, existing data center customers have grown year-to-date uses by five times versus the same period last year and are projecting further growth through the remainder of this decade. Our long-term financial guidance commitments are shown on Slide 11. As Lloyd indicated, we are reaffirming 2024 EPS guidance of $1.70 to $1.74, but we now expect to achieve the upper half of this range. All of our five-year commitments are reaffirmed today as well. This includes the year-over-year adjusted EPS growth rate of 6% to 8% annually off of the achieved results in 2024. We remain confident in achieving our long term growth rate in all remaining years of the plan. In particular, year-to-date execution on the financing and regulatory fronts has increased visibility into 2024 and 2025 results. For example, approximately 97% of expected 2024 rate recovery is now finalized. Our forecasts incorporate continued use of long established capital trackers in nearly all of our jurisdictions and are based on what we believe are realistic regulatory outcomes and do not forecast material changes in the interest rate environment. More importantly, we are still able to deliver our $16.4 billion rate base investment to customers while keeping average annual residential total bill growth at or below 4% across the five-year period. As we look forward to November, we expect to continue with our annual cadence of updating our five-year financial plan, reflecting these updated assumptions as well as our capital allocation and investment portfolios. Slide 12 details our financing plan. We are reaffirming 14% to 16% FFO-to-debt in all years of the plan, as well as our guided annual equity needs in each year through 2028. Consistent with prior updates, the figures shown in this page support our base capital plan. In May, we issued 500 million of 30 year junior subordinated notes at a 6.95% coupon for the first five-year period. In June, we issued 600 million of five-year senior unsecured notes at a 5.2% coupon, and our equity financing is limited to the use of our At The Market ATM program in all years and consistent with previous indications, we prefer to utilize a forward ATM structure. Through June 30th, we are happy to report we have priced 500 million of our up to 600 million 2024 guided amount. We are capitalizing on favorable absolute and relative market dynamics within the capital structure to minimize the overall cost of capital. Our credit metrics are gradually moving higher, and we retain the flexibility we've built into our plan. I'll conclude with highlights of our growing track record on slide 13. Our financial commitments are on track for 2024, and we now expect to achieve the upper half of our $1.70 to $1.74 adjusted EPS range. Our near term and long term guidance remains resilient to market and other forces outside our control and are based on realistic and executable assumptions. Execution on numerous capital trackers, the conclusion of our Indiana gas rate case and progress on CPCNs underscore our execution of recovery for critical investments to ensure safety and reliability of our systems. Year-to-date financing activity, including pricing of the majority of our forward ATM plan for the year, and diversification utilized in the junior subordinated debt marketplace demonstrates our balance sheet flexibility. Lastly, our base and upside CapEx estimates demonstrate the programmatic investment plans alongside accelerated upside for customers and investors. To reiterate, our rate base and adjusted EPS guidance includes neither the upside CapEx nor any data center load or investment and is built upon the known and socialized regulatory programs which have contributed to the 8.1% adjusted EPS growth rate we've executed since 2021. The value proposition NiSource continues to offer investors is diversified and fully regulated utility assets with the opportunity to invest in both programmatic gas infrastructure and the long-term energy transition story of a fully integrated electric business. These elements have been core to our story for some time, but the emerging opportunity to support economic development, on shoring and new data center development truly differentiate our value proposition relative to many alternatives in the market today. I'd now like to turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.\nShar Pourreza: Hey, guys. Good morning. Look, I just want to drill a little bit further on sort of the MISO opportunities. Just on Tranche 2.1, can we get maybe a bit of a sense of how much of the $23 billion to $27 billion for the total tranche is relevant for you? And then $2.2 billion obviously it's coming in 2025. What are we looking at there from a spend perspective? Thanks.\nLloyd Yates:\n.:\nShawn Anderson: Hey, Shar, good morning. So, Tranche 1 projects, we began the process working with MISO and have estimated -- MISO's original estimate around $300 million of Tranche 1 for the portfolio of projects planned to be executed. We think that it will take a little bit more to be able to execute those projects safely and reliably the way MISO is expecting that energy to be able to be moved across the multistate region. So we're engagement right now with MISO, sharing those plans and identifying what that will look like. We plan to have more of an update as we step towards our next call in the November refresh of our capital plans. And then on Tranche 2, it's still early on those. We haven't really formally put those estimates out. We do expect to see something at the very end of this year with MISO and plan to be able to estimate those, thereafter once we've had a chance to really look at those plans, but reminder there, most of that is gonna be beyond the plan horizon as it's in service dates or early 2030s.\nShar Pourreza: Okay, perfect. And then Lloyd, just lastly maybe just for you is the messaging kind of around data center opportunities and those conversations hasn't really changed since you started to talk about it at start of this year. I guess at what point do you think you'll have some level of confidence where some of these discussions you're having can start to kind of be embedded in plans as we're thinking about either the growth perspective, the CapEx perspective because some of your peers have begun to quantify, you've seen load numbers tick higher, you've seen some numbers around CapEx opportunities depending on the size of the DC or the hyperscaler. I guess at what point could we get a little bit more confidence around putting this into the plan? Is EEI kind of the right podium? Are you thinking more like as we get to the back half of this year? Thanks.\nLloyd Yates: So, a little bit of a long winded answer here. Let me start by saying, we're really excited about the data center opportunity. We think it is a significant opportunity to grow the company. We also understand that Northern Indiana is just a very attractive location for data centers. So we we're getting a lot of interest that I talked about in my script, you know, great public policy. Indiana passed legislation for sales tax exemption for data centers in 2019. We have great infrastructure in terms of roads, access to energy, transmission. So people are very interested in, putting data centers and really big data centers in the state of Indiana. What we've been doing is meeting with various stakeholders, and I'm talking about the people from the governor's office, legislators, utility commissioners, and making sure that we understand in detail what their concerns are and what needs we need to meetn, and I would say probably three important things came up. 1 is I think data centers have to work for the current customer base. Meaning that the customers -- our current customer base can't absorb any excess risk or long term have any significant stranded investment as a result of this opportunity. Second thing is no compromise and reliability. I think that's really important to all of our constituents and stakeholders and then for NiSource, it has to work for our shareholders. I mean, this is a big initiative, but if we're going to take risk, there has to be the appropriate amount of reward on the other side of that. So you think about all those things you said -- and we talked earlier, we have a real strong plan. We're gonna grow 6% to 8%. We've actually executed that growth over the past three years. So we feel good about the plan we have with our data centers. So anything else we do, has to be upside to that plan. So with all that being said, Shar, now we are in conversations with the various counterparties. I think we are really aligned on all the things that we kinda need to accomplish as a result of those conversations, as a result of trying to get various transactions out about data centers. I think as you start to look for EEI or later in the year, we'll put out a lot more clarity about what that looks like.\nShar Pourreza: Okay. Perfect. Thanks, Lloyd. That that that last part was important. Appreciate it. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nicholas Campanella from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nNicholas Campanella: Hey, good morning. Thanks for all the updates. So, appreciate the comment on 2024 guidance tracking to the high-end of the range. Just acknowledging Shawn's comments about the visibility into fiscal 2025, the fact that load is already trending 5% in this quarter alone and then you have more capital coming into the plan. As we kind of extrapolate our models out to 25%, 26%, just what are the offsets that are keeping you at 7% growth like the midpoint of that year-over-year 6% to 8% range or could you be higher? Could you just kind of expand on how we should be thinking about this? Thanks.\nLloyd Yates: Why don't you take that one?\nShawn Anderson: Yes, sure, Nick. Thanks. Good morning. So obviously the headwinds that we always face, a volatile capital markets environment which we're all experiencing right now brings uncertainty around financing and the costs associated with financing. So always a concern for us. Obviously regulatory outcomes and making sure that we're pathing these investments in line with our stakeholders and keeping customer affordability in mind is always top of mind in terms of how we will be able to execute the sequencing of these programs. As you said, one of the things that de-risks the execution of this plan is growth in our customer count, volumes and helping to spread some of those costs across a larger base. So right now experiencing some tailwinds, but hopefully the economy continues on the path we're on. That's helping to enable that growth and we'd love to see that play forward. We don't project that growth to always continue, so it ends up providing a bit of a tailwind when it does continue to stick and move itself through the plan. Those are the major drivers of uncertainty. I would say we are still financing a lot of overall CapEx especially when we think about the full ownership opportunity of projects at NIPSCO and a lot of that financing will occur in 2025 and we'll need to be thoughtful about making sure we do that commensurate with the returns that would be required to get us into that 6% to 8% annual year over year growth rate.\nNicholas Campanella: Okay. Great. And then just, on bill growth specifically, because I know you're keeping affordability in mind here. The current plan targets, I think, 4% or less through 2028. When you factor in the NIPSCO load projections that of talked about the 11% and then the capital plan refresh, What's the outlook for bill growth?\nLloyd Yates: Well, we haven't actually run those analyses just yet as we haven't incorporated the load growth associated with data centers into any of the financial plans. We're still thinking thoughtfully about how that will be reflected in ramp on the customer side for these data centers will matter greatly into the timing of when we would need to incur CapEx or when the systems would come online in the first instance. So we haven't actually run that, but when we talk about that customer affordability, we're focused on the residential customer path and we're focused on keeping residential customer bills at or below that 4%. We think that data centers can provide a bit of an upside to the way that our current plan is built in that there'll be a sharing of system cost in some level for us to be able to support data centers as they come online, but we haven't quantified what that looks like.\nNicholas Campanella: Okay. No problem. And then I guess just one last one for me on the financing side. As we kind of think about wrapping an additional capital, is there a certain percentage of every dollar of CapEx that you would need additional equity? I know you mentioned modest ATM increases here, as you wrap an additional capital, but just wanted to check on that. Thank you.\nShawn Anderson: Yeah. Great question. No. There's no rule of thumb here simply because the cash flow profile for each project, really warrants how it would be financed, how much FFO can come off of any given project varies, especially when you think about when the opportunity could be something that has direct flow through at a higher rate than a regulated return just in the form of economic development compared to what we would have to put in to hook on those new customers. That's just an example of where you might be able to get a higher FFO relative to the way the rest of the base plan is financed. Another example would be the tax profile associated with solar, which has created some tailwinds for us. So we need to look at the projects before we can get to the financing and how it would impact equity. It also matters where we're at within the range in any given year of the 14% to 16%. So, our commitment is to be thoughtful about the financing and to focus on the lowest cost of capital we can achieve while maintaining our commitment to 14 to 16% of all years of the plan.\nNicholas Campanella: Alright. Have a great day. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey. Good morning, team. How you guys doing?\nLloyd Yates: Good morning, Julien. Welcome back.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Thank you so much. Appreciate it, guys. Good to chat. Maybe picking up where Nick left off. I mean, you guys, obviously, very keenly focused on bill affordability for your customers, rightly so. Can you talk a little bit about how you think about industrial tariffs for this emerging customer class? I think you guys have been pretty innovative in the past in tackling these kinds of issues with your industrial customer class in previous years. So could this be part of like a subsequent rate case coming up here? Or how would you think about trying to preserve the bill integrity and inflation trajectory for the core customers while enabling and ensuring that these new customers, pay their fair share, if you will. Just curious on when and how they'll, click this about.\nLloyd Yates: Michael?\nMichael Luhrs: Thank you, Julien. So yes, as Lloyd mentioned early on in his comments, the customer protection piece is a critical component associated with it. So we are working through the mechanisms associated with tariffs and other regulatory components that would enable that and be able to do that. To one, be able to provide the customer protections, be able to provide the appropriate allocation of the system associated with it, be able to help ensure the reliability due to the large loads that they that come in with data centers and the high load factors. We are looking at ways to help make sure that we're doing that in a timely and an effective manner to be able to help accomplish the timelines that data centers want associated with their activities. So we wanna be very customer centric on that, but at the same time, as you mentioned, we have found innovative ways to do that in the past, and we continue to look at those innovative ways moving forward and we will bring those support both in the current activities and in future regulatory filings.\nLloyd Yates: And just to add a little bit to that, we're not sure whether or not this is something that we do in a rate case through the regulatory process or through the legislature process. So we're still evaluating those things.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. And then related I mean, it goes back to what Nick was asking a little bit. Right? You've got this CapEx budget at NIPSCO roughly $2 billion, $2.5 billion here in the near term. The later years drop off a little bit. How do you think about the affordability question and the ability to raise CapEx? Said differently, to the extent to which that you see opportunities emerge, could there be some element of deferral through the years? I get that there is sort of a step function lower in 26% as presented, but still given the 4% is there sort of a need to defer some CapEx potentially within the NIPSCO construct here?\nShawn Anderson: Appreciate that question. Yeah. No. I see where you're going with that. I do think there's some offsets to that. Right? We do see some O&M tailwinds that can come back to help moderate the bill impact associated with the infrastructure investments. Most notably, there's much lower commodity prices as we move to a platform of 70%, if you will, renewables, which helps stabilize some aspect of the bill for customers. I think as we shut down our coal plants, we have two more units next year that will shut down. That that presents an opportunity for lower O&M to flow back to customers. Project Apollo also continues to progress for us, it is achieving great results, that's helping us stabilize overall O&M and while we target that flat O&M on an absolute basis, we have the potential to see higher O&M savings if you will and associated with something like the Shaffer shutdown. It could be more specific in Indiana to the electric company in those circumstances. So we're thoughtful about it. I think there's opportunities for us to look across the system to grow and the faster we can grow, obviously the more we can bring down the cost of that flat O&M on a per customer basis across the broader network, and that scale across NiSource is something that becomes attractive for all customers and specifically customers in Indiana, which then benefits from the growth that we're seeing in a state like Ohio or Virginia, which is growing on the gas side and bringing down the cost on a per customer basis in Indiana.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Thank you guys.s\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey, team. Good morning. Congrats on a solid quarter here. I just had one question and that is, related to the Pennsylvania rate case, Melody, thanks for all the color you shared upfront. Maybe just a lot of focus -- investor focus on the state, your peer water utility got a decision where ROE was substantially lower than their previous decision. Just wondering if you could share more color on how things are going there, potential for a settlement and then how does that timeline look like? Thank you.\nMelody Birmingham: Yes. Thank you for the question. We do monitor what is taking place within each of our states with the utilities and we understand some of the outcomes or the outcomes with the water utility. As far as our rate case, we are continuing to meet with the stakeholders, all of our interveners, and we are working towards settlement discussion. We don't know if there will be a settlement, but our teams always try to work towards the win-win outcomes for our customers as well as our stakeholders. So at this point, we continue in those discussions and we will determine if a settlement is possible.\nDurgesh Chopra: Okay. That's, really all I had. Thanks again.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Sunderland from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\nRichard Sunderland: Hi, good morning. Thinking about the large power opportunity through another lens, what type of load growth could you see through Blackstone investment given the partnership at NIPSCO?\nLloyd Yates: Michael, why don't you take that one?\nMichael Luhrs: So what I would say is we continue to look at economic development opportunities across our regions, and when we look at those investments and opportunities, obviously our partners are able to share that within the NIPSCO region associated with it, but really, it's the collaboration that we have with our communities, that we have associated with our states, with our governmental entities and bringing in that economic development that lead to that investment. Maybe the one thing I would point to relative to potential is as we're going through the current IRP process and working with the different stakeholders on that and walking that through, we have shown in our reference case an incremental 2,600 megawatts of potential as we look through to 2035 associated with that, and we are running through those scenarios and cases now, but that would represent basically 100% increase to our peak load of the system. So I think that gives a perspective relative to the potential with it. And in that potential is obviously the opportunity for our partners to be able to share in that upside.\nRichard Sunderland: Got it. Thanks. That's helpful commentary. And then similarly, given the Indiana data center tailwinds across the state and your commentary on reliability, do you see any potential for utilities to partner up on generation to upsize new plants? How do you think the state overall might think about ensuring supply to meet new load?\nLloyd Yates: This is Lloyd. We do see it as an opportunity. You know? We work with our peer utilities and also with MISO. We think there's a significant opportunity for efficiencies between the various utilities and I think what also make the interconnection agreements on transmission a little bit easier.\nRichard Sunderland: Great. That's all for me. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nSteve Fleishman: Yes. Hey, good morning. Just, you mentioned this agreement to supply gas to a data center. Could you give a little more color on that? Is that for backup power or is that actually the core power of the data center? Just maybe a little more color on that and whether there might be more of those?\nLloyd Yates: Digital Dallas. Melody, why don't you take that one?\nMelody Birmingham: Yes. For Digital Dallas in Virginia, that's to provide power to the center directly.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. So there so basically, it's being fueled by gas fire power, and are you seeing more of that happening for your gas business too?\nLloyd Yates: Yeah. So we don't we don't talk a lot about that, Steve, but one of the opportunities we have, especially in Ohio and Virginia, is the opportunity to build more gas infrastructure to support data centers. So more gas infrastructure going to generators, provide energy to data centers. You know, building a gas pipeline for us is another opportunity that doesn't show up on our CapEx plan right now. Like, Digital Dallas was not in our CapEx plan.\nSteve Fleishman: Got it. Okay. And maybe just a minute, I know you did this as part of the discussion at the commission, but remind us a little more of the color between the 2.6 gigawatts, the 8.6 gigawatts and I think it was a number of like 30 gigawatts and like how are you defining what these different cases are?\nLloyd Yates: Michael?\nMichael Luhrs: So when you look at the IRP, basically what you see is our peak load right now is roughly about 2300 megawatts associated with it. The 2600 megawatts that you're seeing was included in the reference case and the reason that was included in the reference case is because as we're working through with multiple counterparties associated with their interests within the state, we feel like that is a reasonable expectation relative to qualified counterparties and potential, which we wanna reflect in our scenarios. Above that, we also then have another 6 gigawatts above that that would be included in scenarios based on not only the potential for data centers that we've seen in interest within the areas, but also what we're seeing in additional economic development and growth just from baseload capabilities, what we're seeing being on shoring, what that continues to be developed within our system. So we will run through that reference case, we will run through that scenario case associated with it, and then we will do on top of that, honestly, additional scenarios that allow us to look at different potential outcomes, but the big chunks are that base, where we are today, 2300 megawatts, 2600 megawatts added to it, and then a 6000 on top.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. And just high level, do we think about I mean, I think about the territory there is just historically the very heavy industry have been there in the past and probably a lot of that shot over time. So is there like a lot of excess transmission and sites related to that, that just make it particularly you know, kind of good spot on top of the taxes and all the other stuff? Is that part of it?\nMichael Luhrs: So, Steve, this is Michael. I'll hit that one as well. When you look at that Indiana territory, Lloyd hit on many of the attributes, but, yes, I would say when you look at the combination of the, how it's near to large areas such as Chicago and others that have great fiber runs, you look at our transmission capacity and infrastructure through that part of the territory, it has very strong characteristics associated with it. We have multiple sites that have 345 kV lines running through them and multiple 345 kV lines, so there's good transmission capacity and opportunity. In addition, you add on top of that, there's accessibility of land as well as water, roads. All those are positive characteristics, but then I would say one of the most beneficial is how the state, the governmental, the economic development activities of those bodies is helping to facilitate the opportunities in the state as well relative to the diversification of tax base load, etc.\nSteve Fleishman: Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont from Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead.\nPaul Fremont: Thank you very much. When I look at the, $500 million junior subordinated debt that you issued in May, that that should have 50% equity credit. So that's roughly $250 million of equity. Is that included in the $600 million that you sort of identify as part of your ATM, or should we think of that as incremental to the 600?\nShawn Anderson: Thanks, Paul. This is Shawn. I would think about that as incremental to the 600 million. We're still expecting to issue up to $600 million of ATM equity in 2024 and continue to maintain that balance sheet with $200 million to $300 million of ATM equity for each year of the plan thereafter. The use of the junior subordinated notes for us is a diversifier that helps us raise credit quality, potentially giving us even more cushion relative to the downgrade threshold of 13%. It also helps us manage the overall maturity curve that we have long term on the debt profile of the business.\nPaul Fremont: So in in terms of upsizing then sort of the equity this year, is it just to sort of increase the level of cushion or was there something that changed sort of in the capital spending profile, that caused you to increase your amount of equity?\nShawn Anderson: Yeah. It's a great question. I think it's really more to enhance the cushion that we have in the current year. We've also seen other headwinds come through our plan such as weather, lower receipts, cash receipts coming from warmer than usual weather in the first quarter as an example and you still need to incorporate that into the overall FFO-to-debt that the rating agencies are asking us to maintain. So it gave us an opportunity to look across the curve and find a different way for us to source that equity content without having to go to a traditional equity marketplace.\nPaul Fremont: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And that does conclude the question and answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to mister Lloyd Yates, CEO and president, for closing remarks.\nLloyd Yates: So thank you for your questions. We're excited about the opportunity with NIPSCO. Thank you for your interest and look forward to seeing you guys next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. [Operator Closing Remarks].",

            "name": "Melody Birmingham",
            "content": "Alright. Thank you, Lloyd. I want to spend a few moments updating each of you on the important regulatory activity we have across our companies which is profiled on Slide 6. Our focus on operational excellence coupled with the soft in commodity pricing, has driven lower bills over the last 12 months across our gas businesses despite the critical investments our teams continue to make. During the 12 months, which ended June 30, our average residential gas customer bill declined over 16% from a year earlier on a total basis. In Indiana, last week, The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission approved the NIPSCO Gas Rate Case unanimous settlement, which was reached in March. The approval incorporated $1 billion of additional capital investment versus our last rate case, a new weather normalization adjustment and approval of NIPSCO's automated metering infrastructure or AMI project. In Kentucky, our general rate case was filed in May and we expect intervener testimony later this month with hearings in October. Also, wanted to note the Kentucky Public Service Commission Chair Kent Chandler recently vacated his post at the end of his three-year term, which ended on June 30th. Our work in Pennsylvania is a great demonstration of the value of our risk reduction strategy and alignment with our stakeholders. Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania met with the Pennsylvania Utility Commission in late 2022 and was the first gas utility to seek the commission's approval for the replacement of vintage plastic pipe in our long term infrastructure plan. The commission approved Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania's request early in 2023. Just recently, the chairman of the commission made a motion directing other natural gas companies to amend their infrastructure plans to prioritize the replacement of vintage plastic pipe on their systems as well. Meanwhile, our Pennsylvania rate case continues to progress on schedule after initial intervenor testimony was filed in June and hearings were held last month. We remain confident in achieving a constructive outcome to support our stakeholders and the value of our energy investments for Pennsylvanian customers and communities. In Virginia last month, the Commonwealth was named the top state in the country for business by CNBC for the third time in the last five-years. The survey considered factors ranging from education quality to the cost of doing business. Also recently, our Columbia Gas of Virginia team reached a preliminary settlement with a customer to build a gas pipeline to serve on-site generation for the customer's data center operations. This project has the potential to be one of the largest multi-tenant data center operations in the world. This is made possible by the highly reliable and on demand characteristics of natural gas, which will fuel the generation necessary to house this critical data. It's projects like these that can contribute to economic growth and lead to increased demand for energy and infrastructure services. In Ohio, our team was able to find a solution to help keep advanced manufacturer and extruder of aluminum, Pennex, as a valued customer and vital employer in the state. Both Columbia Gas of Ohio and Pennex will now invest millions of dollars into the local economy, supporting 100s of jobs and expanding manufacturing operations in an area that does not have many development opportunities. Projects such as this one is helping our communities and helping our communities thrive. These developments also create upside in our plans, growth on our system, and create more opportunities for residential expansion within the region. Early last month, NiSource released our 2024 Environmental, Social and Governance, or ESG, report. The report demonstrates progress on key initiatives designed to make a positive impact on the communities we serve while valuing our customers. Highlights include continued reduction in fugitive methane emissions from gas, main, and service lines, increased diverse supplier spending, and advancement towards our top decile safety performance. NiSource continues to achieve top quartile ESG performance when aggregated across five key ESG raters. In May, NiSource was awarded the top AAA ESG rating for the third consecutive year by MSCI ESG ratings. The AAA rating is reserved for the top 10% of utilities, and the company was assessed as an ESG leader in corporate governance, corporate behavior, human capital development and toxic emissions and waste. In July, we received our annual Financial Times Stock Exchange Index, or FTSE, ESG score and we now rank in the 89th percentile of global utility companies. Our FTSE ESG score increased two deciles since July of 2023, and last but not least, I would like to highlight the work our teams are doing to improve our overall customer satisfaction. In the J. D. Power Gas Residential Midyear 2024 customer satisfaction survey, Columbia Gas of Ohio, Columbia Gas of Kentucky, and Columbia Gas of Virginia outperformed the industry average within their respective segments and quite notably, Columbia Gas of Virginia was named number one the top gas utility brand in the country. I'll now turn things over to Shawn. Yes. Thank you for the question. We do monitor what is taking place within each of our states with the utilities and we understand some of the outcomes or the outcomes with the water utility. As far as our rate case, we are continuing to meet with the stakeholders, all of our interveners, and we are working towards settlement discussion. We don't know if there will be a settlement, but our teams always try to work towards the win-win outcomes for our customers as well as our stakeholders. So at this point, we continue in those discussions and we will determine if a settlement is possible. Yes. For Digital Dallas in Virginia, that's to provide power to the center directly."

            "name": "Shawn Anderson",
            "content": "Thanks, Melody. I'd like to begin by discussing the status of our generation assets under construction which are being developed to support the integrated resource plan preferred portfolio from the 2018 and 2021 IRPs. In May, we completed Cavalry Solar, which is our third solar project owned by NIPSCO. It will provide power to approximately 60,000 homes in White County and is expected to generate $25 million of tax revenue for the county over its life. Construction continues on our remaining three solar build transfer projects and 4 PPA projects. All of these projects under construction remain on track and on budget to support the energy transition NIPSCO has been executing since 2020 and which will retire our Shaffer Generating Station by the end of 2025 and Michigan City by the end of 2028. NIPSCO filed unopposed proposed orders for two of these projects, Fairbanks and Gibson, and CPCN amendment proceedings, and the records are now closed in both. We expect final orders later this month. The record is also closed in the gas peaker CPCN proceeding and a final order is expected in the fourth quarter. In total, these ongoing generation investments add $2.1 billion of capital expenditures to support our retiring coal plants and are fully represented in the $16.4 billion base capital plan and satisfy the preferred portfolio from the 2021 IRP. Turning our attention to the latest IRP process, in late June, the NIPSCO team held the second of five stakeholder meetings leading up to an anticipated filing in November. These discussions outlined scenarios which included an incremental need for generation by 2035 of 2.6 gigawatts for the reference case and 8.6 gigawatts in the emerging load sensitivity case. It is important to note that the potential load growth assumptions built into these scenarios are not the total or maximum range of new load growth, but rather a risk adjusted case using assumptions of how much of each project could be executed by each date. Note, the IRP process looks at a 20-year load forecast for our region and is not a direct forecast of future NiSource generation projects or investment. With that said, the interest demonstrated from new customers to develop in the Northwest Indiana region is significant and presents a tremendous opportunity for our customers and communities to enhance tax base, diversify employment opportunities, and participate in the technological innovation datacenters bring to our nation. Consistent with last quarter, this potential opportunity is not included in our base case or upside financial plans, and we will continue to advance commercial discussions to enhance visibility in the coming months. As we review our five-year base investment plan on Slide 8, it's important to note the diversified nature of these investments, which span across electric generation as well as gas and electric distribution modernization, system hardening, and customer growth. Our projects lack concentration risk by fuel type or by operating company and are highly executable given the skilled labor and partnerships we've developed. Let's move forward to slide 9. We also continue to work through the planning, design, regulatory, and timing considerations for projects not yet included in our $16.4 billion base capital plan. Automated meter reading or AMI investments commenced recently in Indiana. It is expected to drive operational efficiencies and enhance our customer experience. A portion of total AMI across the NiSource companies is included in our base capital plan with the potential to expand across the rest of our gas companies. We are developing MISO Long Range Transmission Planning or LRTP Tranche 1 projects expected to come online late this decade. The three projects are the Indiana portion of a major multi state line and are included in our base financial plan. Preliminary engineering has been conducted and point to higher costs which exceed original MISO estimates. Our base plan does not include the additional CapEx potentially necessary to complete these projects. LRTP Tranche 2 continues to be a longer term investment opportunity that would likely commence beyond the timeline of our current financial plan. These projects skew towards higher voltage transmission and would not begin operation until early next decade. We have right of first refusal on projects in our service territory and expect a final MISO plan late this year. Now I'll transition to our financial results. Second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.21 per share, a $0.10 per share increase versus the $0.11 per share reported in the same period last year. Net revenue increased 15% year-over-year, including $8 million of incremental normalized customer usage. Our regulatory weather normalization mechanisms continue to protect both customers and shareholders from volatility. In the second quarter, these constructs had an approximately $6 million revenue impact versus normal weather. Our states are growing, helping to reduce customer costs and support safety and reliability improvements to our system. Customer count and total weather normalized gas throughput for residential and commercial customers grew in the first half across our system. Virginia and Ohio were standouts with an average first half weather normalized throughput growth of 7.1% for residential and 5.7% for commercial customers across both states. While the load growth forecasts from the IRP demonstrate a massive long-term increase of 11% compounded annually from 2024 to 2035 in the reference case, normalized electric load grew 5% in the second quarter from our existing customers alone. Residential and commercial classes were particularly strong and further, existing data center customers have grown year-to-date uses by five times versus the same period last year and are projecting further growth through the remainder of this decade. Our long-term financial guidance commitments are shown on Slide 11. As Lloyd indicated, we are reaffirming 2024 EPS guidance of $1.70 to $1.74, but we now expect to achieve the upper half of this range. All of our five-year commitments are reaffirmed today as well. This includes the year-over-year adjusted EPS growth rate of 6% to 8% annually off of the achieved results in 2024. We remain confident in achieving our long term growth rate in all remaining years of the plan. In particular, year-to-date execution on the financing and regulatory fronts has increased visibility into 2024 and 2025 results. For example, approximately 97% of expected 2024 rate recovery is now finalized. Our forecasts incorporate continued use of long established capital trackers in nearly all of our jurisdictions and are based on what we believe are realistic regulatory outcomes and do not forecast material changes in the interest rate environment. More importantly, we are still able to deliver our $16.4 billion rate base investment to customers while keeping average annual residential total bill growth at or below 4% across the five-year period. As we look forward to November, we expect to continue with our annual cadence of updating our five-year financial plan, reflecting these updated assumptions as well as our capital allocation and investment portfolios. Slide 12 details our financing plan. We are reaffirming 14% to 16% FFO-to-debt in all years of the plan, as well as our guided annual equity needs in each year through 2028. Consistent with prior updates, the figures shown in this page support our base capital plan. In May, we issued 500 million of 30 year junior subordinated notes at a 6.95% coupon for the first five-year period. In June, we issued 600 million of five-year senior unsecured notes at a 5.2% coupon, and our equity financing is limited to the use of our At The Market ATM program in all years and consistent with previous indications, we prefer to utilize a forward ATM structure. Through June 30th, we are happy to report we have priced 500 million of our up to 600 million 2024 guided amount. We are capitalizing on favorable absolute and relative market dynamics within the capital structure to minimize the overall cost of capital. Our credit metrics are gradually moving higher, and we retain the flexibility we've built into our plan. I'll conclude with highlights of our growing track record on slide 13. Our financial commitments are on track for 2024, and we now expect to achieve the upper half of our $1.70 to $1.74 adjusted EPS range. Our near term and long term guidance remains resilient to market and other forces outside our control and are based on realistic and executable assumptions. Execution on numerous capital trackers, the conclusion of our Indiana gas rate case and progress on CPCNs underscore our execution of recovery for critical investments to ensure safety and reliability of our systems. Year-to-date financing activity, including pricing of the majority of our forward ATM plan for the year, and diversification utilized in the junior subordinated debt marketplace demonstrates our balance sheet flexibility. Lastly, our base and upside CapEx estimates demonstrate the programmatic investment plans alongside accelerated upside for customers and investors. To reiterate, our rate base and adjusted EPS guidance includes neither the upside CapEx nor any data center load or investment and is built upon the known and socialized regulatory programs which have contributed to the 8.1% adjusted EPS growth rate we've executed since 2021. The value proposition NiSource continues to offer investors is diversified and fully regulated utility assets with the opportunity to invest in both programmatic gas infrastructure and the long-term energy transition story of a fully integrated electric business. These elements have been core to our story for some time, but the emerging opportunity to support economic development, on shoring and new data center development truly differentiate our value proposition relative to many alternatives in the market today. I'd now like to turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Hey, Shar, good morning. So, Tranche 1 projects, we began the process working with MISO and have estimated -- MISO's original estimate around $300 million of Tranche 1 for the portfolio of projects planned to be executed. We think that it will take a little bit more to be able to execute those projects safely and reliably the way MISO is expecting that energy to be able to be moved across the multistate region. So we're engagement right now with MISO, sharing those plans and identifying what that will look like. We plan to have more of an update as we step towards our next call in the November refresh of our capital plans. And then on Tranche 2, it's still early on those. We haven't really formally put those estimates out. We do expect to see something at the very end of this year with MISO and plan to be able to estimate those, thereafter once we've had a chance to really look at those plans, but reminder there, most of that is gonna be beyond the plan horizon as it's in service dates or early 2030s. Yes, sure, Nick. Thanks. Good morning. So obviously the headwinds that we always face, a volatile capital markets environment which we're all experiencing right now brings uncertainty around financing and the costs associated with financing. So always a concern for us. Obviously regulatory outcomes and making sure that we're pathing these investments in line with our stakeholders and keeping customer affordability in mind is always top of mind in terms of how we will be able to execute the sequencing of these programs. As you said, one of the things that de-risks the execution of this plan is growth in our customer count, volumes and helping to spread some of those costs across a larger base. So right now experiencing some tailwinds, but hopefully the economy continues on the path we're on. That's helping to enable that growth and we'd love to see that play forward. We don't project that growth to always continue, so it ends up providing a bit of a tailwind when it does continue to stick and move itself through the plan. Those are the major drivers of uncertainty. I would say we are still financing a lot of overall CapEx especially when we think about the full ownership opportunity of projects at NIPSCO and a lot of that financing will occur in 2025 and we'll need to be thoughtful about making sure we do that commensurate with the returns that would be required to get us into that 6% to 8% annual year over year growth rate. Yeah. Great question. No. There's no rule of thumb here simply because the cash flow profile for each project, really warrants how it would be financed, how much FFO can come off of any given project varies, especially when you think about when the opportunity could be something that has direct flow through at a higher rate than a regulated return just in the form of economic development compared to what we would have to put in to hook on those new customers. That's just an example of where you might be able to get a higher FFO relative to the way the rest of the base plan is financed. Another example would be the tax profile associated with solar, which has created some tailwinds for us. So we need to look at the projects before we can get to the financing and how it would impact equity. It also matters where we're at within the range in any given year of the 14% to 16%. So, our commitment is to be thoughtful about the financing and to focus on the lowest cost of capital we can achieve while maintaining our commitment to 14 to 16% of all years of the plan. Appreciate that question. Yeah. No. I see where you're going with that. I do think there's some offsets to that. Right? We do see some O&M tailwinds that can come back to help moderate the bill impact associated with the infrastructure investments. Most notably, there's much lower commodity prices as we move to a platform of 70%, if you will, renewables, which helps stabilize some aspect of the bill for customers. I think as we shut down our coal plants, we have two more units next year that will shut down. That that presents an opportunity for lower O&M to flow back to customers. Project Apollo also continues to progress for us, it is achieving great results, that's helping us stabilize overall O&M and while we target that flat O&M on an absolute basis, we have the potential to see higher O&M savings if you will and associated with something like the Shaffer shutdown. It could be more specific in Indiana to the electric company in those circumstances. So we're thoughtful about it. I think there's opportunities for us to look across the system to grow and the faster we can grow, obviously the more we can bring down the cost of that flat O&M on a per customer basis across the broader network, and that scale across NiSource is something that becomes attractive for all customers and specifically customers in Indiana, which then benefits from the growth that we're seeing in a state like Ohio or Virginia, which is growing on the gas side and bringing down the cost on a per customer basis in Indiana. Thanks, Paul. This is Shawn. I would think about that as incremental to the 600 million. We're still expecting to issue up to $600 million of ATM equity in 2024 and continue to maintain that balance sheet with $200 million to $300 million of ATM equity for each year of the plan thereafter. The use of the junior subordinated notes for us is a diversifier that helps us raise credit quality, potentially giving us even more cushion relative to the downgrade threshold of 13%. It also helps us manage the overall maturity curve that we have long term on the debt profile of the business. Yeah. It's a great question. I think it's really more to enhance the cushion that we have in the current year. We've also seen other headwinds come through our plan such as weather, lower receipts, cash receipts coming from warmer than usual weather in the first quarter as an example and you still need to incorporate that into the overall FFO-to-debt that the rating agencies are asking us to maintain. So it gave us an opportunity to look across the curve and find a different way for us to source that equity content without having to go to a traditional equity marketplace."

            "name": "Michael Luhrs",
            "content": "Thank you, Julien. So yes, as Lloyd mentioned early on in his comments, the customer protection piece is a critical component associated with it. So we are working through the mechanisms associated with tariffs and other regulatory components that would enable that and be able to do that. To one, be able to provide the customer protections, be able to provide the appropriate allocation of the system associated with it, be able to help ensure the reliability due to the large loads that they that come in with data centers and the high load factors. We are looking at ways to help make sure that we're doing that in a timely and an effective manner to be able to help accomplish the timelines that data centers want associated with their activities. So we wanna be very customer centric on that, but at the same time, as you mentioned, we have found innovative ways to do that in the past, and we continue to look at those innovative ways moving forward and we will bring those support both in the current activities and in future regulatory filings. So what I would say is we continue to look at economic development opportunities across our regions, and when we look at those investments and opportunities, obviously our partners are able to share that within the NIPSCO region associated with it, but really, it's the collaboration that we have with our communities, that we have associated with our states, with our governmental entities and bringing in that economic development that lead to that investment. Maybe the one thing I would point to relative to potential is as we're going through the current IRP process and working with the different stakeholders on that and walking that through, we have shown in our reference case an incremental 2,600 megawatts of potential as we look through to 2035 associated with that, and we are running through those scenarios and cases now, but that would represent basically 100% increase to our peak load of the system. So I think that gives a perspective relative to the potential with it. And in that potential is obviously the opportunity for our partners to be able to share in that upside. So when you look at the IRP, basically what you see is our peak load right now is roughly about 2300 megawatts associated with it. The 2600 megawatts that you're seeing was included in the reference case and the reason that was included in the reference case is because as we're working through with multiple counterparties associated with their interests within the state, we feel like that is a reasonable expectation relative to qualified counterparties and potential, which we wanna reflect in our scenarios. Above that, we also then have another 6 gigawatts above that that would be included in scenarios based on not only the potential for data centers that we've seen in interest within the areas, but also what we're seeing in additional economic development and growth just from baseload capabilities, what we're seeing being on shoring, what that continues to be developed within our system. So we will run through that reference case, we will run through that scenario case associated with it, and then we will do on top of that, honestly, additional scenarios that allow us to look at different potential outcomes, but the big chunks are that base, where we are today, 2300 megawatts, 2600 megawatts added to it, and then a 6000 on top. So, Steve, this is Michael. I'll hit that one as well. When you look at that Indiana territory, Lloyd hit on many of the attributes, but, yes, I would say when you look at the combination of the, how it's near to large areas such as Chicago and others that have great fiber runs, you look at our transmission capacity and infrastructure through that part of the territory, it has very strong characteristics associated with it. We have multiple sites that have 345 kV lines running through them and multiple 345 kV lines, so there's good transmission capacity and opportunity. In addition, you add on top of that, there's accessibility of land as well as water, roads. All those are positive characteristics, but then I would say one of the most beneficial is how the state, the governmental, the economic development activities of those bodies is helping to facilitate the opportunities in the state as well relative to the diversification of tax base load, etc."

            "content": "Thank you, Chris. And good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 3. The NiSource investment thesis is simple. We serve our customers by delivering safe and reliable energy at an affordable price. Affordable energy requires efficient capital deployment, safe asset operations and constructive regulatory recovery mechanisms. These fundamentals generate competitive returns while enhancing our balance sheet position. Our trailing 12-month earned ROE at the NiSource level was 10.3%, demonstrating our focus on shareholder returns despite rapidly growing deployed capital. This is a GAAP number with an adjustment made only to normalize weather. Slide 4 shows our key priorities. Today, we reported second quarter 2024 adjusted EPS of $0.21 We are reaffirming 2024 adjusted EPS guidance of $1.70 to $1.74 and we now expect to achieve the upper half of this range. We are also reaffirming annual 2023 to 2028 guidance for adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 8% for all years of the plan and rate base growth of 8% to 10%. We continue to target FFO-to-debt of 14% to 16% in all years of the plan. Our superior regulatory and stakeholder foundation is differentiated. We have a long history of working collaboratively to deliver value across diverse constituencies. A huge effort is made to communicate proactively with stakeholders and demonstrate the value of our operations and investments on an ongoing basis, both during and between full rate cases, while also incorporating a balanced perspective from many of our participating stakeholders. Engaging with stakeholders enhances alignment, providing advanced notice of coming changes, often helping to pave the way for stakeholder support. Balance sheet flexibility remains on this page for a reason. Late last year, we raised over $2 billion in minority interest funding and projected up to $600 million of common equity issuance for 2024, to which we've made great progress. We have also been active in the hybrid security market last quarter. NiSource is prepared for unforeseen challenges and opportunities. We have regularly discussed our upside CapEx investment programs for the past several quarters. Recently, we have seen an acceleration of customer interest in our Northern Indiana service area. In June, governor Holcomb of Indiana announced plans for a significant new data center in a NIPSCO footprint, following granting of a state sales tax exemption. This is the fourth data center announcement statewide this year, and just one of the many indications of customer interest and stakeholder support for NIPSCO. Indiana offers many attractive features to data center developers. Access to infrastructure, including roads and water, land, predictable climate and weather, low cost of living, stable and low taxes, and supportive regulation in government are just a few. We believe data center development can enhance our local tax base, diversify the employment base across the State of Indiana, and provide greater value to existing customers and shareholders. We are also uniquely positioned to be the convener of key stakeholders in serving the broader public interest. This puts us at the precipice of discussions on data center advancement in a balanced and thoughtful manner. Vertically integrated utilities like NIPSCO are part of an interdependent group of communities and stakeholders, and we'll be thoughtful about our system safety, reliability, and cost allocation for all our customers. We'll move as quickly as possible while maintaining the integrity of our commercial planning, regulatory procurement, and operational execution processes. Please turn to slide 5. In July, several new IT applications went live at NIPSCO Electric Operations. These are the first stages of rollout across categories of technology investment and are the culmination of work beginning back in 2022. Major software programs such as these supports safer and more efficient work practices. The new systems were quickly put to the test during severe July weather and performed as designed. I am pleased to report on this successful launch and look forward to upcoming rollouts across different areas of the organization. This is only one piece of our operational excellence initiative. Project Apollo continues to find efficiencies throughout the organization after ramping up last year. Stable O&M over our plan horizon continues to be a part of achieving our financial commitments. Last month, a major windstorm impacted our Indiana service area, bringing tornadic activity, wind speeds up to 90 miles per hour, and heavy rainfall. Our electric operations team monitors evolving weather patterns and prepares resources in advance of storms, including engagement of contractors and mutual aid crews from neighboring utilities in Michigan and Wisconsin. Our preparation and around the clock response involve 400 line workers and 86 tree trimming crews enabled a successful restoration. I want to thank each and every employee and contractor for their tireless dedication to restoring service and safety across our communities. In summary, the NiSource business plan offers a differentiated opportunity to return value to all stakeholders. Our teams continue to deliver on our commitments, financially, operationally, and being a trusted business partner to customers and employees. Beyond keeping our plans on track, our teams are vigilantly seeking enhancements to an already premium plan in ways to enhance value as we move forward. I'd now like to turn the call over to Melody. .: So, a little bit of a long winded answer here. Let me start by saying, we're really excited about the data center opportunity. We think it is a significant opportunity to grow the company. We also understand that Northern Indiana is just a very attractive location for data centers. So we we're getting a lot of interest that I talked about in my script, you know, great public policy. Indiana passed legislation for sales tax exemption for data centers in 2019. We have great infrastructure in terms of roads, access to energy, transmission. So people are very interested in, putting data centers and really big data centers in the state of Indiana. What we've been doing is meeting with various stakeholders, and I'm talking about the people from the governor's office, legislators, utility commissioners, and making sure that we understand in detail what their concerns are and what needs we need to meetn, and I would say probably three important things came up. 1 is I think data centers have to work for the current customer base. Meaning that the customers -- our current customer base can't absorb any excess risk or long term have any significant stranded investment as a result of this opportunity. Second thing is no compromise and reliability. I think that's really important to all of our constituents and stakeholders and then for NiSource, it has to work for our shareholders. I mean, this is a big initiative, but if we're going to take risk, there has to be the appropriate amount of reward on the other side of that. So you think about all those things you said -- and we talked earlier, we have a real strong plan. We're gonna grow 6% to 8%. We've actually executed that growth over the past three years. So we feel good about the plan we have with our data centers. So anything else we do, has to be upside to that plan. So with all that being said, Shar, now we are in conversations with the various counterparties. I think we are really aligned on all the things that we kinda need to accomplish as a result of those conversations, as a result of trying to get various transactions out about data centers. I think as you start to look for EEI or later in the year, we'll put out a lot more clarity about what that looks like. Why don't you take that one? Well, we haven't actually run those analyses just yet as we haven't incorporated the load growth associated with data centers into any of the financial plans. We're still thinking thoughtfully about how that will be reflected in ramp on the customer side for these data centers will matter greatly into the timing of when we would need to incur CapEx or when the systems would come online in the first instance. So we haven't actually run that, but when we talk about that customer affordability, we're focused on the residential customer path and we're focused on keeping residential customer bills at or below that 4%. We think that data centers can provide a bit of an upside to the way that our current plan is built in that there'll be a sharing of system cost in some level for us to be able to support data centers as they come online, but we haven't quantified what that looks like. Good morning, Julien. Welcome back. Michael? And just to add a little bit to that, we're not sure whether or not this is something that we do in a rate case through the regulatory process or through the legislature process. So we're still evaluating those things. Michael, why don't you take that one? This is Lloyd. We do see it as an opportunity. You know? We work with our peer utilities and also with MISO. We think there's a significant opportunity for efficiencies between the various utilities and I think what also make the interconnection agreements on transmission a little bit easier. Digital Dallas. Melody, why don't you take that one? Yeah. So we don't we don't talk a lot about that, Steve, but one of the opportunities we have, especially in Ohio and Virginia, is the opportunity to build more gas infrastructure to support data centers. So more gas infrastructure going to generators, provide energy to data centers. You know, building a gas pipeline for us is another opportunity that doesn't show up on our CapEx plan right now. Like, Digital Dallas was not in our CapEx plan. Michael? So thank you for your questions. We're excited about the opportunity with NIPSCO. Thank you for your interest and look forward to seeing you guys next quarter."

        "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Q1 2024 NiSource Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] \n I'd now like to turn the call over to Chris Turnure, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nChristopher Turnure: Good morning, and welcome to the NiSource First Quarter 2024 Investor Call. Joining me today are President and Chief Executive Officer, Lloyd Yates; Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Shawn Anderson; Executive Vice President of Strategy and Risk and Chief Commercial Officer, Michael Luhrs; and Executive Vice President and Group President, NiSource Utilities, Melody Birmingham. \n The purpose of this presentation is to review NiSource's financial performance for the first quarter of 2024 as well as provide an update on our operations and growth drivers. Following our prepared remarks, we'll open the call to your questions. Slides for today's call are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. \n We would like to remind you that some of the statements made during this presentation will be forward-looking. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. Information concerning such risks and uncertainties is included in the Risk Factors and MD&A sections of our periodic SEC filings. \n Additionally, some of the statements made on this call relate to non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the supplemental slides, segment information and full financial schedules for information on the most directly comparable GAAP measure and reconciliation of these measures. \n I'd now like to turn the call over to Lloyd. \nLloyd Yates: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 3. The NiSource investment thesis is simple. We serve our customers by delivering safe and reliable energy at an affordable price. Affordable energy delivery requires deployment of capital and operating assets efficiently. It requires operating in jurisdictions which have constructive regulatory mechanisms. The byproduct of these fundamentals generates competitive regulated returns for our shareholders while maintaining and improving our balance sheet position. Capital deployment comes from a $16.4 billion base CapEx plan projected over the next 5 years, plus over $1.5 billion in upside projects as well as substantial opportunity for investment beyond 2028. \n The stable public policy and ratemaking in our states across multiple election and regulatory appointment cycles has been crucial to efficient capital allocation and recovery to support our communities. Our balance sheet is derisked and more flexible than ever before and enables industry-leading sustainable organic investment. As part of this flexibility, we are more disciplined and return-focused with our internal allocation decisions whenever. We recognize the competitive environment for capital and we do not take your investment for granted. \n Our total year-end 2023 rate base was $18.8 billion, consisting of $9 billion in Indiana, $4 billion in Ohio, $3 billion in Pennsylvania and over $1 billion in Virginia. Our nearly 4 million customers contribute to gross domestic product of over $3.8 trillion across our 6 states of operation or approximately 14% of U.S. GDP. We expect our system to see substantial low growth over the next 5 years due to data centers and reshoring of manufacturing. Northern Indiana offers constructive fundamentals for data center development through robust electric transmission, overall energy system capacity, plentiful land, limited physical disaster risk, tax incentives and a pro-business policy environment. During the last 5 years, NIPSCO and the Columbia gas family of companies have contributed over $1.4 billion in property taxes in their local communities. This funding goes to schools, parks, roads, emergency and other essential services and keeps our communities moving in the right direction. \n Each and every day of the year, we provide safe, reliable, sustainable and cost-effective service for our customers. Slide 4 shows our key priorities. Today, we reported first quarter 2024 adjusted EPS of $0.85, 10% above the $0.77 reported 1 year ago. We are reaffirming 2024 adjusted EPS guidance of $1.70 to $1.74. We are also reaffirming annual 2023 to 2028 guidance for adjusted EPS of 6% to 8% and rate base of 8% to 10%. We continue to target FFO to debt of 14% to 16% in all years of the client. Our superior regulatory and stakeholder foundation is differentiated. We have a long history of working collaboratively to deliver value across diverse constituencies. The most recent example is our NIPSCO Gas general rate case settlement announced in March. Late in the quarter, we also filed CPCN amendments for full ownership of the Fairbanks and Gibson Solar Projects. This follows CPCN amendment approvals from the IURC for Cavalry and Dunns Bridge II in January. \n Our intention has been to layer projects into our base plan during the course of the year. Consistent with our pending request at the IURC, today, I am pleased to announce we are adding full ownership of the Fairbanks and Gibson projects to our base capital plan. This incremental NiSource investment simplifies the project structure and reduces cost to customers when compared to the prior tax equity configuration. Reliability and efficiency remain core elements of our operational excellence culture as seen on Slide 5. In 2022, we began the process of upgrading outdated technology that, in some cases, predated the Columbia Gas merger in 2000.\n Our multiyear technology investment initiative is continuing to take shape with work and asset management programs addressing the scheduling dispatch and execution of work and the management of underlying assets, an upfront investment can drive decades of both reliability improvement and cost savings for customers. In March, NIPSCO requested a regulatory deferral mechanism for these investments, seeking to align ratemaking with long-term customer value realization. Amid increasing weather extremes and natural disaster frequency throughout the country, customers are benefiting from energy resiliency more than ever. NiSource delivered this through multiple channels with both major gas and electric systems.\n Our electric generation mix includes renewables and on-demand natural gas, balancing intermittency and fuel price volatility risk. Meanwhile, our gas system is insulated from harsh weather and can deliver dependable energy for our customers and even the most extreme conditions. I want to wrap up my comments by acknowledging each of our over 11,000 employees and contractors. Without their tireless effort on behalf of our customers, none of this work will be possible. \n I'll now turn things over to Melody. \nMelody Birmingham: *Thank you, Lloyd. I'd like to turn to Slide 6 to give you an overview of NiSource's safety journey since 2017. We often get asked by investors new to the company for a picture of specific risk mitigation metrics over time. I'll begin by saying that the magnitude of change at the company over the last 6 years cannot be overstated. Our centralized operations team has implemented both engineering design and process-based solutions to improve our gas system safety. \n Our system management system -- our safety management system was recently reconfirmed for American Petroleum Institute recommended Practice 1173, making NiSource one of only two utilities in the world to maintain this designation. We also completed a conformance assessment and are pursuing certification for standard 55001, an International Organization for Standardization, or ISO. This validates advancement in our asset management practice maturity and illustrates our commitment to optimizing value through a balance of risk, asset performance and costs.\n Our gas assets now have automatic shutoff valves and remote pressure monitoring on 100% of low-pressure systems. Isometric drawings provide 3D renderings of all our regulating stations. We have 36% fewer miles of pipe designated as priority compared to year ending 2017. 51% of our 55,000 mile system has been surveyed with advanced mobile leak detection vehicles. 98% of our gas service lines are mapped as of the year-end 2023, which is up from only 4% 6 years ago. These tangible verified metrics are only a part of our story. Leading-edge safety management is fueled by culture and it's critical to any safety work environment.  \n Every day, our NiSource team lives the Core 4 through employee certification and training, knowledge transfer, technology utilization and community engagement. Let's move to Slide 7, where you'll see a timeline of our regulatory activity. As we've said previously, our 5-year financial plan does not include extensive regulatory stay-out period. We've had the ability to employ capital trackers and/or forward-looking rate case test years on the majority of our capital expenditures. Columbia Gas of Ohio recently filed its annual infrastructure replacement program, or IRP tracker for $231 million of capital investment with a requested effective date this month. \n In March, NIPSCO's gas settlement was the result of the rigorous rate case process in Indiana and involved a highly engaged stakeholder group of intervenors working with our team and all parties, either signing or not opposing the agreement. A final order is expected in the third quarter of this year. We kicked off our triennial Integrated Resource Plan or IRP process in April with the first of five stakeholder meetings planned for this year. Throughout the process, all interested parties will provide extensive information on low requirements and generation planning for the report's 20-year time horizon.   \n These are just some examples of our commitment to proactive engagement with our stakeholders. We have a high degree of confidence in the value of our investments for our communities and we work regularly to ensure that there are no surprises during the regulatory cycle. Economic development continues to be a competitive advantage for our service territories. One in particular, a project Virginia-based Northrop Grumman broke ground earlier this year on a $200 million advanced electronics manufacturing and testing facility in the town of Waynesboro. This growing customer base here and throughout are NiSource service areas requires new gas infrastructure but also makes the entire system more economic for all of our customers. Across the NiSource footprint, we have invested more than $1.7 billion of capital expenditures over the 12-month period ending in March. During the same time period, residential gas customer bills actually decreased by 15%.  \n With that, let me turn it over now to Shawn to review our capital projects and financial results. \nShawn Anderson: Thanks, Melody. Let's begin on Slide 8. We are steadfast in our commitment to deliver safe and reliable energy to our customers at an affordable price. Growing our investment opportunity is a crucial element to this, and our base capital plan is now comprised of a portfolio of projects projected at $16.4 billion through 2028.  The plan is driven by programmatic and enduring investments necessary to maintain safe, reliable and sustainable energy infrastructure that our customers deserve.\n These investments are diversified across renewable electricity, gas and electric customer growth, distribution modernization and system hardening for both the electric and gas businesses. Importantly, there is limited large individual project execution risk in our plan. Moving ahead to Slide 9, I'd like to provide an update on our renewable development program. The table shows base plan amounts, and reflects incremental CapEx from the full ownership of the Fairbanks and Gibson solar projects, which Lloyd just highlighted. By displacing tax equity investor capital and removing the associated joint venture structure, we are able to reduce customer bills relative to our prior plan and be more resilient in our operations over the energy generated for our customers. \n In the aggregate, our billions of dollars of renewable generation investments negotiated since 2019 remains significantly cheaper and lower risk for our customers compared to the alternative status quo scenario across their useful life. NIPSCO's final coal retirements continue to project to conclude by 2028. And in each of the remaining 4 owned and 4 PPA renewable projects remain on schedule for in-service. On Slide 10, you'll see an overview of additional investment opportunities. \n We continue to identify capital investment opportunities to enhance service for our communities beyond the capital projected in the base plan. Generation investments, gas distribution and transmission system modernization, Advanced metering and renewable natural gas investments all represent potential upside investments compared to our current base plan. The long-term plan does not currently include any data center load growth assumptions or significant infrastructure investments and upgrades. \n However, we are receiving robust inquiries from potential customers looking to invest in our Northern Indiana electric service territory due to the attractive business climate we know and appreciate in Indiana. We are focused on developing accretive projects across all utility companies to support our stakeholders and we intend to move projects from the upside category into our base capital plan as they meet our threshold of stakeholder alignment and execution visibility just as we've done this quarter. As Melody highlighted, NIPSCO has commenced its triennial electric integrated resource planning process.\n The process will provide a point of view on generation and capacity required to serve customers beyond the retirement of our last existing coal units by 2028. It builds on generation already included in our 5-year base capital plan and will analyze energy demand projected across the next 2 decades associated with economic development including potential data center development, electrification, electric vehicle utilization as well as incorporating changing policy and resource adequacy requirements. The process will conclude with a filing at the IURC this fall. \n We'll focus next on Slide 11. And I'd like to point out 2 changes to our financial disclosures this quarter. First, with the completion of the NIPSCO minority interest transaction, we have realigned segments to reflect the new ownership structure; second, to simplify presentation and better align our performance metrics with peer companies, we are changing the name of our primary financial metric to adjusted EPS from net operating earnings per share, as previously referenced.  \n This refers to non-GAAP fully diluted earnings per share, and there are no changes to the underlying calculation of this metric. First quarter adjusted EPS was $0.85, a 10% increase over the $0.77 reported last year. Positive results from regulatory activity and other income were partly offset by higher O&M and depreciation. Normalized customer usage drove an $8 million and $4 million pretax benefit at the Columbia and NIPSCO segments, respectively.\n Interest expense and preferred interest netted to roughly no change following the NIPSCO minority interest transaction and the redemption of the last tranche of our preferred equity securities issued in 2018. For years, NiSource has adjusted GAAP net income and EPS to present a weather-adjusted figure for our investors to project comparable performance periods. While following the mild weather experienced this quarter, I also want to remind you of the underlying regulatory mechanisms insulating both shareholder cash flow and customer bill volatility.  \n All of our gas jurisdictions will have weather decoupling mechanisms should our gas settlement be approved later this year. The mechanisms apply to select customer classes and a range from a full decoupling to partial decoupling and provide more stable customer bills and cash receipts in volatile weather periods. Our long-term financial guidance commitments are shown on Slide 12. As Lloyd mentioned, we are reaffirming the current guidance of $1.70 to $1.74 in adjusted EPS for 2024. All of our 5-year commitments are reaffirmed today as well.  \n This includes the year-over-year adjusted EPS growth rate delivered at 6% to 8% annually off of the achieved results in 2024. We remain confident in achieving our 2024 guidance and our long-term growth rate in all remaining years of the plan. Increased visibility of the return of capital through highly constructive regulatory mechanisms, enhanced visibility into the financial results for 2025 and beyond. Our internal forecasts incorporate continued use of long-established capital trackers in nearly all our jurisdictions, and are based on what we believe are realistic regulatory outcomes.\n O&M discipline also remains a key assumption and a flexible part of achieving our 5-year commitments. Our cost of capital assumptions are resilient and reflect the rate environment from third quarter 2023. And most importantly, we're still able to deliver our $16.4 billion base investment plan to customers while keeping average annual residential total build growth at or below 4% during the 5-year period. \n Stable and low commodity prices available in our region support our unwavering focus on customer value, allowing us to maintain this commitment. Slide 13 details our financing plan. We are reaffirming our 14% to 16% FFO to debt in all years of the plan. In March, S&P completed their annual review with no change to our BBB+ rating and stable outlook. Our expected equity issuances for 2024 are on track to be completed by year-end through the use of our ATM with approximately 1/3 executed to date, and we continue to have the option to use a forward structure to align proceeds with our flow of work, a flexible financing plan such as utilizing our ATM, the NIPSCO minority interest transaction, potential use of hybrid securities and senior unsecured debt are examples of our plan's diverse funding sources and balance sheet flexibility, enabling us to navigate the balance between growth and credit quality. \n The figures shown on this page support our base capital plan, including the additions Lloyd mentioned earlier, the full ownership capital investments of the Fairbanks and Gibson projects substitutes in tax transferability from tax equity funding. Credit agency treatment of upfront cash supports FFO to debt compared to traditional capital expenditures. Despite the addition of $400 million of investment to our plan, our equity needs through this 5-year period remain unchanged due to the positive cash flow attributes of this substitute.\n I'd like to conclude by highlighting another quarter of meeting our commitments on Slide 14. Our financial commitments are resilient over the 5-year period through 2028, and our first quarter results keep us on track to meet our previously increased 2024 EPS guidance. The NIPSCO gas settlement and continued employment of capital trackers underscore our superior regulatory and stakeholder foundation, increasing investment in our base capital expenditure plan without modifying the need for external equity demonstrates our balance sheet flexibility.\n And finally, our revised base and upside CapEx figures demonstrate the programmatic and enduring nature of our plan. The value proposition NiSource continues to offer investors is a diversified and fully regulated utility with the opportunity to invest in both programmatic gas infrastructure and the long-term energy transition story for a fully integrated electric business. While this fundamental has previously been the case, the emerging opportunity to support unprecedented energy development and power demand resulting from robust economic development, onshoring as well as new data center development truly differentiates the value proposition relative to many alternatives in the marketplace today. \n And now I'd like to turn the call back to the operator for Q&A. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Constantine Lednev. \nShahriar Pourreza: It's Shahriar for Constantine. Let me just on the data center side. I mean, obviously, we've all seen kind of media reports of kind of maybe just sizable data centers coming to Indiana, including Amazon, right? I guess can you maybe talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of that potential demand and what it means to the overall plan. I guess, can you be a little bit more specific on when it can hit the plan?\n And when it obviously more important, this whole topic of rate design as you guys are attracting data centers or also trying to protect, I guess, that residential customer base. How are you thinking about rate design and maybe special tariffs for these hyperscalers? As you're in discussions, I mean, would you need to file updated proceedings in order to get the rates? \nLloyd Yates: So I think as I said in some of my remarks, I think Shawn also repeated it. When you think about the NIPSCO system in Northern Indiana, and we have a number of fundamentals, one, a very robust transmission system, plentiful land, a lot of farmland there, available energy capacity. Great energy policy, really enhance a really positive place to do business. I mean you start to realize a region is right for data center development. And because of that, we are in the midst and have been midst of discussions with several data center developers, and we're really optimistic about the opportunity to grow our load with respect to data centers.\n I think you said something really important and that is -- I think we're working hard on how we're evaluating ways to structure the opportunity so that it benefits all stakeholders. That includes our customers, our shareholders and the communities we serve. So I know I'm not directly answering your question because we don't have real specifics. We like to have detail and have quantifiable detail before we put them into our IRP and our load growth projections. And we're still working on those things, although we are very optimistic about our ability to develop data centers in the NIPSCO  service territory. \nShahriar Pourreza: Perfect. I appreciate that, Lloyd. And then just lastly here, I know you've mentioned before you ensure that you could ramp up the ATM to cover sort of any incremental equity needs from upside CapEx that's being shifted over to the plan, right? I guess for the remaining $1.6 billion of upside capital, what could sort of be -- what could be next in terms of projects that move into that base plan from there? And then just more importantly, how do we think about the funding source for that? \nLloyd Yates: So I'll ask Shawn handle that. Maybe Michael will help him. \nShawn Anderson: Yes. So Shar, first and foremost, I think your question on what are the types of projects, the upside CapEx plan. So still have some electric generation projects in our upside plan based on the results of the 2021 IRP. So we'll watch the 2024 IRP process to understand how these upside projects might fit in our investment timelines. I think gas infrastructure work around PHMSA requirements and some of the additional projects stand out to us are compelling, particularly based on compliance requirements, but we need to watch and see how that plays itself out from a rule-making standpoint.\n Likewise, electric T&D has several projects, which could create upside to the plan, both as we think about MISO Tranche 1 and maybe as we start to approach the next decade Tranche 2. But grid modernization and system hardening is still important work for us to deliver reliable service. And then to Lloyd's point, I mean, we added the economic development and data center and technology innovation support the energy infrastructure to deliver that to Slide 10 as we start to think about the formulation of our upside plan. We think there's a lot of work there, but economic development is challenging. It requires alignment for many different stakeholders, but it can make a big splash for our communities, just like the Intel project did in Central Ohio. \n So it's entirely possible that these -- the portfolio of these projects develop and could do so quickly. But we don't put those into the base plan as Lloyd said until we're highly certain that these are projects that can deliver value. And then in terms of financing for these projects, we'll evaluate this as it arises. Part of the criteria for investing in these upside projects is seeking accretive projects to help NiSource and our communities grow. We believe the portfolio of projects that we've identified will help us do just that. And in many cases, we think the financing required will be fairly efficient because of the profile of these projects. Fortunately, we operate in constructive regulatory jurisdictions with efficient regulatory mechanisms, which balance the value creation for customers and shareholders. But we're a fully regulated business and committed to balancing our capital structure to ensure the credit quality that we've been able to obtain here, and we'll be committed to do so. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of JPMorgan Chase. \nRichard Sunderland: Picking up the data center question again, just curious if you see the IRP, the '24 IRP to be specific, as the best look over the next, say, 12 months on how that might layer in incrementally to your current plan? Or do you see things still evolving, I guess, either faster or slower than that process? \nLloyd Yates: So I think it could be a combination of both, but things could definitely evolve faster than the IRP process in Indiana. I think just like all the other companies across the industry, the data center developers are talking to a lot of people. I think that they are looking for utilities or energy companies that can move quickly. We want to be one of those. And I think that process may develop or could or probably will develop faster than the IRP process. \nRichard Sunderland: Got it. Very helpful color there. And then just a few regulatory items, Pennsylvania rate case. Anything you can speak to on kind of stakeholder engagement there, how the process has been running so far and how you feel about kind of catalysts over the back half of the year with regards to those case milestones, maybe prospects for settlement? And then separately, the NIPSCO deferral, you referenced, kind of any timeline to think about on getting an approval there? And does that have any financial impacts to the plan that we should think about? \nLloyd Yates: I will pass it to Melody who heads up our regulatory utilities. \nMelody Birmingham: Yes. Can you hear me okay? \nRichard Sunderland: Yes, we hear you. \nMelody Birmingham: Okay. Very good. As far as the Pennsylvania rate case, which you -- that we filed March 15, it's coming along well, our team continues to engage with our stakeholders there in Pennsylvania. This is not the first time, just so you know, when we have a rate case that we began to have discussions with the stakeholders or to understand what intervenors are wanting or expecting from us. So it's an ongoing dialogue that the team and Pennsylvania has throughout the year up until the time that we file.  We -- with all cases, they're uncertain, but we do work to stay as aligned as possible with the stakeholders to mitigate any surprises. So I would say it's going as well as we expect at this point. And then your next question? \nRichard Sunderland: The NIPSCO deferral. Just overall timing to get an outcome there? And is that something that we should think about having a financial impact or rate case timing impact or anything else? \nLloyd Yates: So it should not have an impact on the rate case. We still expect to get an order on the NIPSCO gas rate case sometime this summer. And because of the deferral mechanism, it should not have a negative impact on our financials. \nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Miller Travis. \nTravis Miller: This is Travis Miller. On the $1.6 billion of upside, the slide there, some of those gas-related upside numbers. Can you talk about what jurisdictions have the most upside? And again, I realize there's a scale difference here, but just maybe on a percentage basis, which of those gas jurisdictions do you think could check a lot of the boxes here in terms of the upside? \nLloyd Yates: I mean I think the way to think about it is to think about the size of our jurisdictions, right? So you think about Ohio, Indiana and then Pennsylvania will have the broadest impact in terms of capital investment from those rules of that $1.6 billion. \nTravis Miller: On a scale basis, would -- are there other opportunities in the smaller one... \nLloyd Yates: There are. You asked the biggest impact. I think there are opportunities in all of those jurisdictions for capital investment as a result of the new rules. But again, it will be, I'd say, allocated to be a size of the jurisdiction is the way to think about that. Michael, do you want to add anything to that? \nMichael Luhrs: Yes. The only thing I would add to that is when we look across all of our territories, that's one of the benefits of having sort of the diversified territories and what we have in our current capabilities. And so you can take things such as in Virginia, there is very constructive legislation around biofuels that allow us to look at those opportunities. \n If you look at many of our others, we have multiple opportunities, whether that be through what's already been mentioned in the economic development side or AMI transitions associated with it or some of the opportunities when we're looking at what we're going to have to do associated with just hardening in the electric liability that Shawn mentioned earlier. Quite frankly, there's a pretty strong pipeline of opportunities for that $1.6 billion upside. And just as we've done previously,  as you've seen with some of the full ownership on the projects as we work through those methodically, we will bring those into the plan and make sure that we announce them once we have that level of confidence, as Lloyd mentioned. \nShawn Anderson: Yes. Maybe one last point here, this is Shawn. The stakeholder alignment is critical, and so the timing to implement the rules will matter as you think about our current CapEx plan, '23 to '28. So we'll need to pace that through. So what you'll see if it moves from the upside plan to the base plan will be actionable projects within the context of the timing of this CapEx plan. But those rules could extend the amount of work into the early 2030s. And so how we segment that along the actual jurisdictions that Michael just referenced will be dictated a lot by our stakeholder engagement and the pacing set forth by themselves. \nTravis Miller: Perfect. That's really helpful. And then one other, obviously, the hot topic of the data center. But if you think about your mix of business in terms of gas and electric, how much upside or available upside at least is manufacturing, which you mentioned versus data centers? \nLloyd Yates: Yes. So I'd say some -- I mean, I think you started thinking about the economic development in Ohio, in Indiana outside of data centers is really strong. You think about reshore and you think about the Intel project just here in Columbus, you think of some of the battery, Stellantis in Indiana. I mean, reshoring or onshoring; however, you want to characterize that is, again, a great opportunity for us. We are strengthening our economic development pipeline getting more focused on that because there are more people interested in that. I mean, I think we have -- I mean the -- one of the strengths of the company is we did -- the jurisdictions we operate in, most if it, not all of our states, provide huge economic development incentives and people are very motivated to create manufacturing jobs where possible. That's the one thing no matter what your politics or everybody agrees on job creation and economic development and we're positioned very well to take advantage of those. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from UBS Securities. \nWilliam Appicelli: It's Bill Appicelli from UBS. Just going back to the technology capital deferral mechanism. I guess how much capital could flow through that? And then just to clarify, that would be a deferral on D&A and O&M. \nShawn Anderson: Yes, this is Shawn. I'll take that. The existing project cost allocation is set forth to be about $250 million across NiSource, but that splits itself to the allocation across their jurisdiction. So think about it around $150 million of capital that will flow through NIPSCO, both on the electric side and the gas side. And then -- yes, it covers the onetime O&M component of it and then some depreciation and amortization. \nWilliam Appicelli: Okay. All right. Great. And then just going back to the PHMSA rules and maybe can you just share exactly what you need to see coming out of that final rule making to trigger some of the incremental capital opportunities? \nLloyd Yates: Yes. I mean we are actively involved with federal government and I'll say the PHMSA rulemaking. As you probably know, PHMSA is about really grading leaks and repair timelines and leak detection methodologies. We think those rules will be finalized by the end of this -- by the end of 2024, so far and as we start to develop plans for compliance to those rules, you'll start to see us have input to our capital plan or additions to our capital plan to facilitate those rules by some time in the middle of the plan. So if you develop a compliance plan within 18 months. And in 36 months, you kind of have to roll into your capital plan. So we expect to see capital upside from the PHMSA rule sometime in the middle of the plan. \nWilliam Appicelli: Okay. All right. And then lastly, and apologies if you said this earlier, but on the ATM issuance, can you just remind us how much you've done year-to-date? \nShawn Anderson: We did approximately 1/3 on the ATM to date. \nOperator: Thank you. And I will now turn the call back over to management for closing remarks. \nLloyd Yates: Again, thank you for participating in the phone call. We're optimistic about the NiSource plan. Appreciate the questions. Have a great day. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Melody Birmingham",
            "content": "*Thank you, Lloyd. I'd like to turn to Slide 6 to give you an overview of NiSource's safety journey since 2017. We often get asked by investors new to the company for a picture of specific risk mitigation metrics over time. I'll begin by saying that the magnitude of change at the company over the last 6 years cannot be overstated. Our centralized operations team has implemented both engineering design and process-based solutions to improve our gas system safety. \n Our system management system -- our safety management system was recently reconfirmed for American Petroleum Institute recommended Practice 1173, making NiSource one of only two utilities in the world to maintain this designation. We also completed a conformance assessment and are pursuing certification for standard 55001, an International Organization for Standardization, or ISO. This validates advancement in our asset management practice maturity and illustrates our commitment to optimizing value through a balance of risk, asset performance and costs.\n Our gas assets now have automatic shutoff valves and remote pressure monitoring on 100% of low-pressure systems. Isometric drawings provide 3D renderings of all our regulating stations. We have 36% fewer miles of pipe designated as priority compared to year ending 2017. 51% of our 55,000 mile system has been surveyed with advanced mobile leak detection vehicles. 98% of our gas service lines are mapped as of the year-end 2023, which is up from only 4% 6 years ago. These tangible verified metrics are only a part of our story. Leading-edge safety management is fueled by culture and it's critical to any safety work environment.  \n Every day, our NiSource team lives the Core 4 through employee certification and training, knowledge transfer, technology utilization and community engagement. Let's move to Slide 7, where you'll see a timeline of our regulatory activity. As we've said previously, our 5-year financial plan does not include extensive regulatory stay-out period. We've had the ability to employ capital trackers and/or forward-looking rate case test years on the majority of our capital expenditures. Columbia Gas of Ohio recently filed its annual infrastructure replacement program, or IRP tracker for $231 million of capital investment with a requested effective date this month. \n In March, NIPSCO's gas settlement was the result of the rigorous rate case process in Indiana and involved a highly engaged stakeholder group of intervenors working with our team and all parties, either signing or not opposing the agreement. A final order is expected in the third quarter of this year. We kicked off our triennial Integrated Resource Plan or IRP process in April with the first of five stakeholder meetings planned for this year. Throughout the process, all interested parties will provide extensive information on low requirements and generation planning for the report's 20-year time horizon.   \n These are just some examples of our commitment to proactive engagement with our stakeholders. We have a high degree of confidence in the value of our investments for our communities and we work regularly to ensure that there are no surprises during the regulatory cycle. Economic development continues to be a competitive advantage for our service territories. One in particular, a project Virginia-based Northrop Grumman broke ground earlier this year on a $200 million advanced electronics manufacturing and testing facility in the town of Waynesboro. This growing customer base here and throughout are NiSource service areas requires new gas infrastructure but also makes the entire system more economic for all of our customers. Across the NiSource footprint, we have invested more than $1.7 billion of capital expenditures over the 12-month period ending in March. During the same time period, residential gas customer bills actually decreased by 15%.  \n With that, let me turn it over now to Shawn to review our capital projects and financial results. Yes. Can you hear me okay? Okay. Very good. As far as the Pennsylvania rate case, which you -- that we filed March 15, it's coming along well, our team continues to engage with our stakeholders there in Pennsylvania. This is not the first time, just so you know, when we have a rate case that we began to have discussions with the stakeholders or to understand what intervenors are wanting or expecting from us. So it's an ongoing dialogue that the team and Pennsylvania has throughout the year up until the time that we file.  We -- with all cases, they're uncertain, but we do work to stay as aligned as possible with the stakeholders to mitigate any surprises. So I would say it's going as well as we expect at this point. And then your next question?"
        },
        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Shawn Anderson",
            "content": "Thanks, Melody. Let's begin on Slide 8. We are steadfast in our commitment to deliver safe and reliable energy to our customers at an affordable price. Growing our investment opportunity is a crucial element to this, and our base capital plan is now comprised of a portfolio of projects projected at $16.4 billion through 2028.  The plan is driven by programmatic and enduring investments necessary to maintain safe, reliable and sustainable energy infrastructure that our customers deserve.\n These investments are diversified across renewable electricity, gas and electric customer growth, distribution modernization and system hardening for both the electric and gas businesses. Importantly, there is limited large individual project execution risk in our plan. Moving ahead to Slide 9, I'd like to provide an update on our renewable development program. The table shows base plan amounts, and reflects incremental CapEx from the full ownership of the Fairbanks and Gibson solar projects, which Lloyd just highlighted. By displacing tax equity investor capital and removing the associated joint venture structure, we are able to reduce customer bills relative to our prior plan and be more resilient in our operations over the energy generated for our customers. \n In the aggregate, our billions of dollars of renewable generation investments negotiated since 2019 remains significantly cheaper and lower risk for our customers compared to the alternative status quo scenario across their useful life. NIPSCO's final coal retirements continue to project to conclude by 2028. And in each of the remaining 4 owned and 4 PPA renewable projects remain on schedule for in-service. On Slide 10, you'll see an overview of additional investment opportunities. \n We continue to identify capital investment opportunities to enhance service for our communities beyond the capital projected in the base plan. Generation investments, gas distribution and transmission system modernization, Advanced metering and renewable natural gas investments all represent potential upside investments compared to our current base plan. The long-term plan does not currently include any data center load growth assumptions or significant infrastructure investments and upgrades. \n However, we are receiving robust inquiries from potential customers looking to invest in our Northern Indiana electric service territory due to the attractive business climate we know and appreciate in Indiana. We are focused on developing accretive projects across all utility companies to support our stakeholders and we intend to move projects from the upside category into our base capital plan as they meet our threshold of stakeholder alignment and execution visibility just as we've done this quarter. As Melody highlighted, NIPSCO has commenced its triennial electric integrated resource planning process.\n The process will provide a point of view on generation and capacity required to serve customers beyond the retirement of our last existing coal units by 2028. It builds on generation already included in our 5-year base capital plan and will analyze energy demand projected across the next 2 decades associated with economic development including potential data center development, electrification, electric vehicle utilization as well as incorporating changing policy and resource adequacy requirements. The process will conclude with a filing at the IURC this fall. \n We'll focus next on Slide 11. And I'd like to point out 2 changes to our financial disclosures this quarter. First, with the completion of the NIPSCO minority interest transaction, we have realigned segments to reflect the new ownership structure; second, to simplify presentation and better align our performance metrics with peer companies, we are changing the name of our primary financial metric to adjusted EPS from net operating earnings per share, as previously referenced.  \n This refers to non-GAAP fully diluted earnings per share, and there are no changes to the underlying calculation of this metric. First quarter adjusted EPS was $0.85, a 10% increase over the $0.77 reported last year. Positive results from regulatory activity and other income were partly offset by higher O&M and depreciation. Normalized customer usage drove an $8 million and $4 million pretax benefit at the Columbia and NIPSCO segments, respectively.\n Interest expense and preferred interest netted to roughly no change following the NIPSCO minority interest transaction and the redemption of the last tranche of our preferred equity securities issued in 2018. For years, NiSource has adjusted GAAP net income and EPS to present a weather-adjusted figure for our investors to project comparable performance periods. While following the mild weather experienced this quarter, I also want to remind you of the underlying regulatory mechanisms insulating both shareholder cash flow and customer bill volatility.  \n All of our gas jurisdictions will have weather decoupling mechanisms should our gas settlement be approved later this year. The mechanisms apply to select customer classes and a range from a full decoupling to partial decoupling and provide more stable customer bills and cash receipts in volatile weather periods. Our long-term financial guidance commitments are shown on Slide 12. As Lloyd mentioned, we are reaffirming the current guidance of $1.70 to $1.74 in adjusted EPS for 2024. All of our 5-year commitments are reaffirmed today as well.  \n This includes the year-over-year adjusted EPS growth rate delivered at 6% to 8% annually off of the achieved results in 2024. We remain confident in achieving our 2024 guidance and our long-term growth rate in all remaining years of the plan. Increased visibility of the return of capital through highly constructive regulatory mechanisms, enhanced visibility into the financial results for 2025 and beyond. Our internal forecasts incorporate continued use of long-established capital trackers in nearly all our jurisdictions, and are based on what we believe are realistic regulatory outcomes.\n O&M discipline also remains a key assumption and a flexible part of achieving our 5-year commitments. Our cost of capital assumptions are resilient and reflect the rate environment from third quarter 2023. And most importantly, we're still able to deliver our $16.4 billion base investment plan to customers while keeping average annual residential total build growth at or below 4% during the 5-year period. \n Stable and low commodity prices available in our region support our unwavering focus on customer value, allowing us to maintain this commitment. Slide 13 details our financing plan. We are reaffirming our 14% to 16% FFO to debt in all years of the plan. In March, S&P completed their annual review with no change to our BBB+ rating and stable outlook. Our expected equity issuances for 2024 are on track to be completed by year-end through the use of our ATM with approximately 1/3 executed to date, and we continue to have the option to use a forward structure to align proceeds with our flow of work, a flexible financing plan such as utilizing our ATM, the NIPSCO minority interest transaction, potential use of hybrid securities and senior unsecured debt are examples of our plan's diverse funding sources and balance sheet flexibility, enabling us to navigate the balance between growth and credit quality. \n The figures shown on this page support our base capital plan, including the additions Lloyd mentioned earlier, the full ownership capital investments of the Fairbanks and Gibson projects substitutes in tax transferability from tax equity funding. Credit agency treatment of upfront cash supports FFO to debt compared to traditional capital expenditures. Despite the addition of $400 million of investment to our plan, our equity needs through this 5-year period remain unchanged due to the positive cash flow attributes of this substitute.\n I'd like to conclude by highlighting another quarter of meeting our commitments on Slide 14. Our financial commitments are resilient over the 5-year period through 2028, and our first quarter results keep us on track to meet our previously increased 2024 EPS guidance. The NIPSCO gas settlement and continued employment of capital trackers underscore our superior regulatory and stakeholder foundation, increasing investment in our base capital expenditure plan without modifying the need for external equity demonstrates our balance sheet flexibility.\n And finally, our revised base and upside CapEx figures demonstrate the programmatic and enduring nature of our plan. The value proposition NiSource continues to offer investors is a diversified and fully regulated utility with the opportunity to invest in both programmatic gas infrastructure and the long-term energy transition story for a fully integrated electric business. While this fundamental has previously been the case, the emerging opportunity to support unprecedented energy development and power demand resulting from robust economic development, onshoring as well as new data center development truly differentiates the value proposition relative to many alternatives in the marketplace today. \n And now I'd like to turn the call back to the operator for Q&A. Yes. So Shar, first and foremost, I think your question on what are the types of projects, the upside CapEx plan. So still have some electric generation projects in our upside plan based on the results of the 2021 IRP. So we'll watch the 2024 IRP process to understand how these upside projects might fit in our investment timelines. I think gas infrastructure work around PHMSA requirements and some of the additional projects stand out to us are compelling, particularly based on compliance requirements, but we need to watch and see how that plays itself out from a rule-making standpoint.\n Likewise, electric T&D has several projects, which could create upside to the plan, both as we think about MISO Tranche 1 and maybe as we start to approach the next decade Tranche 2. But grid modernization and system hardening is still important work for us to deliver reliable service. And then to Lloyd's point, I mean, we added the economic development and data center and technology innovation support the energy infrastructure to deliver that to Slide 10 as we start to think about the formulation of our upside plan. We think there's a lot of work there, but economic development is challenging. It requires alignment for many different stakeholders, but it can make a big splash for our communities, just like the Intel project did in Central Ohio. \n So it's entirely possible that these -- the portfolio of these projects develop and could do so quickly. But we don't put those into the base plan as Lloyd said until we're highly certain that these are projects that can deliver value. And then in terms of financing for these projects, we'll evaluate this as it arises. Part of the criteria for investing in these upside projects is seeking accretive projects to help NiSource and our communities grow. We believe the portfolio of projects that we've identified will help us do just that. And in many cases, we think the financing required will be fairly efficient because of the profile of these projects. Fortunately, we operate in constructive regulatory jurisdictions with efficient regulatory mechanisms, which balance the value creation for customers and shareholders. But we're a fully regulated business and committed to balancing our capital structure to ensure the credit quality that we've been able to obtain here, and we'll be committed to do so. Yes. Maybe one last point here, this is Shawn. The stakeholder alignment is critical, and so the timing to implement the rules will matter as you think about our current CapEx plan, '23 to '28. So we'll need to pace that through. So what you'll see if it moves from the upside plan to the base plan will be actionable projects within the context of the timing of this CapEx plan. But those rules could extend the amount of work into the early 2030s. And so how we segment that along the actual jurisdictions that Michael just referenced will be dictated a lot by our stakeholder engagement and the pacing set forth by themselves. Yes, this is Shawn. I'll take that. The existing project cost allocation is set forth to be about $250 million across NiSource, but that splits itself to the allocation across their jurisdiction. So think about it around $150 million of capital that will flow through NIPSCO, both on the electric side and the gas side. And then -- yes, it covers the onetime O&M component of it and then some depreciation and amortization. We did approximately 1/3 on the ATM to date."

            "name": "Lloyd Yates",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 3. The NiSource investment thesis is simple. We serve our customers by delivering safe and reliable energy at an affordable price. Affordable energy delivery requires deployment of capital and operating assets efficiently. It requires operating in jurisdictions which have constructive regulatory mechanisms. The byproduct of these fundamentals generates competitive regulated returns for our shareholders while maintaining and improving our balance sheet position. Capital deployment comes from a $16.4 billion base CapEx plan projected over the next 5 years, plus over $1.5 billion in upside projects as well as substantial opportunity for investment beyond 2028. \n The stable public policy and ratemaking in our states across multiple election and regulatory appointment cycles has been crucial to efficient capital allocation and recovery to support our communities. Our balance sheet is derisked and more flexible than ever before and enables industry-leading sustainable organic investment. As part of this flexibility, we are more disciplined and return-focused with our internal allocation decisions whenever. We recognize the competitive environment for capital and we do not take your investment for granted. \n Our total year-end 2023 rate base was $18.8 billion, consisting of $9 billion in Indiana, $4 billion in Ohio, $3 billion in Pennsylvania and over $1 billion in Virginia. Our nearly 4 million customers contribute to gross domestic product of over $3.8 trillion across our 6 states of operation or approximately 14% of U.S. GDP. We expect our system to see substantial low growth over the next 5 years due to data centers and reshoring of manufacturing. Northern Indiana offers constructive fundamentals for data center development through robust electric transmission, overall energy system capacity, plentiful land, limited physical disaster risk, tax incentives and a pro-business policy environment. During the last 5 years, NIPSCO and the Columbia gas family of companies have contributed over $1.4 billion in property taxes in their local communities. This funding goes to schools, parks, roads, emergency and other essential services and keeps our communities moving in the right direction. \n Each and every day of the year, we provide safe, reliable, sustainable and cost-effective service for our customers. Slide 4 shows our key priorities. Today, we reported first quarter 2024 adjusted EPS of $0.85, 10% above the $0.77 reported 1 year ago. We are reaffirming 2024 adjusted EPS guidance of $1.70 to $1.74. We are also reaffirming annual 2023 to 2028 guidance for adjusted EPS of 6% to 8% and rate base of 8% to 10%. We continue to target FFO to debt of 14% to 16% in all years of the client. Our superior regulatory and stakeholder foundation is differentiated. We have a long history of working collaboratively to deliver value across diverse constituencies. The most recent example is our NIPSCO Gas general rate case settlement announced in March. Late in the quarter, we also filed CPCN amendments for full ownership of the Fairbanks and Gibson Solar Projects. This follows CPCN amendment approvals from the IURC for Cavalry and Dunns Bridge II in January. \n Our intention has been to layer projects into our base plan during the course of the year. Consistent with our pending request at the IURC, today, I am pleased to announce we are adding full ownership of the Fairbanks and Gibson projects to our base capital plan. This incremental NiSource investment simplifies the project structure and reduces cost to customers when compared to the prior tax equity configuration. Reliability and efficiency remain core elements of our operational excellence culture as seen on Slide 5. In 2022, we began the process of upgrading outdated technology that, in some cases, predated the Columbia Gas merger in 2000.\n Our multiyear technology investment initiative is continuing to take shape with work and asset management programs addressing the scheduling dispatch and execution of work and the management of underlying assets, an upfront investment can drive decades of both reliability improvement and cost savings for customers. In March, NIPSCO requested a regulatory deferral mechanism for these investments, seeking to align ratemaking with long-term customer value realization. Amid increasing weather extremes and natural disaster frequency throughout the country, customers are benefiting from energy resiliency more than ever. NiSource delivered this through multiple channels with both major gas and electric systems.\n Our electric generation mix includes renewables and on-demand natural gas, balancing intermittency and fuel price volatility risk. Meanwhile, our gas system is insulated from harsh weather and can deliver dependable energy for our customers and even the most extreme conditions. I want to wrap up my comments by acknowledging each of our over 11,000 employees and contractors. Without their tireless effort on behalf of our customers, none of this work will be possible. \n I'll now turn things over to Melody. So I think as I said in some of my remarks, I think Shawn also repeated it. When you think about the NIPSCO system in Northern Indiana, and we have a number of fundamentals, one, a very robust transmission system, plentiful land, a lot of farmland there, available energy capacity. Great energy policy, really enhance a really positive place to do business. I mean you start to realize a region is right for data center development. And because of that, we are in the midst and have been midst of discussions with several data center developers, and we're really optimistic about the opportunity to grow our load with respect to data centers.\n I think you said something really important and that is -- I think we're working hard on how we're evaluating ways to structure the opportunity so that it benefits all stakeholders. That includes our customers, our shareholders and the communities we serve. So I know I'm not directly answering your question because we don't have real specifics. We like to have detail and have quantifiable detail before we put them into our IRP and our load growth projections. And we're still working on those things, although we are very optimistic about our ability to develop data centers in the NIPSCO  service territory. So I'll ask Shawn handle that. Maybe Michael will help him. So I think it could be a combination of both, but things could definitely evolve faster than the IRP process in Indiana. I think just like all the other companies across the industry, the data center developers are talking to a lot of people. I think that they are looking for utilities or energy companies that can move quickly. We want to be one of those. And I think that process may develop or could or probably will develop faster than the IRP process. I will pass it to Melody who heads up our regulatory utilities. So it should not have an impact on the rate case. We still expect to get an order on the NIPSCO gas rate case sometime this summer. And because of the deferral mechanism, it should not have a negative impact on our financials. I mean I think the way to think about it is to think about the size of our jurisdictions, right? So you think about Ohio, Indiana and then Pennsylvania will have the broadest impact in terms of capital investment from those rules of that $1.6 billion. There are. You asked the biggest impact. I think there are opportunities in all of those jurisdictions for capital investment as a result of the new rules. But again, it will be, I'd say, allocated to be a size of the jurisdiction is the way to think about that. Michael, do you want to add anything to that? Yes. So I'd say some -- I mean, I think you started thinking about the economic development in Ohio, in Indiana outside of data centers is really strong. You think about reshore and you think about the Intel project just here in Columbus, you think of some of the battery, Stellantis in Indiana. I mean, reshoring or onshoring; however, you want to characterize that is, again, a great opportunity for us. We are strengthening our economic development pipeline getting more focused on that because there are more people interested in that. I mean, I think we have -- I mean the -- one of the strengths of the company is we did -- the jurisdictions we operate in, most if it, not all of our states, provide huge economic development incentives and people are very motivated to create manufacturing jobs where possible. That's the one thing no matter what your politics or everybody agrees on job creation and economic development and we're positioned very well to take advantage of those. Yes. I mean we are actively involved with federal government and I'll say the PHMSA rulemaking. As you probably know, PHMSA is about really grading leaks and repair timelines and leak detection methodologies. We think those rules will be finalized by the end of this -- by the end of 2024, so far and as we start to develop plans for compliance to those rules, you'll start to see us have input to our capital plan or additions to our capital plan to facilitate those rules by some time in the middle of the plan. So if you develop a compliance plan within 18 months. And in 36 months, you kind of have to roll into your capital plan. So we expect to see capital upside from the PHMSA rule sometime in the middle of the plan. Again, thank you for participating in the phone call. We're optimistic about the NiSource plan. Appreciate the questions. Have a great day."
