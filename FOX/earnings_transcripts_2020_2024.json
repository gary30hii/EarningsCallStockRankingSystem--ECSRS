I'll now turn the conference over to Chief Investor Relations Officer and Executive Vice President of Corporate Initiatives, Mr. Joe Dorrego. Please go ahead, sir.\nJoseph Dorrego: Thank you, Noah. Hello, and welcome to our fiscal 2020 year-end earnings call. Joining me on the call today are Lachlan Murdoch, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Nallen, Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Tomsic, our Chief Financial Officer. First, Lachlan and Steve will give some prepared remarks on the fiscal year and most recent quarter, and then we'll take a couple of questions from the investment community.  Please note that this call may include forward-looking statements regarding Fox's financial performance and operating results. These statements are based on management's current expectations, and actual results could differ from what is stated as a result of certain factors identified on today's call and in the company's SEC filings.  Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA or EBITDA, as we refer to it on this call. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and our SEC filings, which are both available in the Investor Relations section of the website. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Lachlan.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter results and to reflect on our first full fiscal year as new Fox. I know a lot of you on the phone have had a long day and have just come from another earnings call, so we will try to keep this as tight and as brief as possible.  I doubt any of us consider 2020 a great calendar year. It's been extraordinarily difficult on our businesses, on our health and on our families. I'm sure it's a year we would all like to be through and done with, and we will be soon. But looking back on Fox's 2020 fiscal year is another story. Our fiscal year has been extraordinary, not because of COVID-19, but in spite of it, our 2020 fiscal year has shown off the strength of Fox, the logic of our strategy and the resilience of our business model and of our teams. To that last point, I would like to acknowledge the outstanding work and dedication of my Fox colleagues across the country. They too are extraordinary. Without them, there would be no sport, no news and no entertainment on our platforms and stations.  What together we achieved last year was remarkable. I'd like to first give FOX Sports a shout out for an incredible year, which saw the brilliant broadcast of both the historic 7-game World Series and an exciting Super Bowl LIV, watched by over 100 million people. Of course, not long after the Super Bowl in Miami, sport was shut down. But the team at FOX Sports never stopped working to bring NASCAR, baseball and eventually football back into America's living rooms. On our last earnings call, I said, like the rest of America, we can't wait for the first pitch thrown, the first ball hike and the sound of engines starting again. Thankfully, the wait was not long. Our FOX Sports production team lost no time preparing to produce America's biggest events in ways we didn't think possible just a few months before. The sports team has invented new technologies to not only produce, but enhance the games being played today.  NASCAR was the first major American sport to return from its pandemic hiatus, and America's pent-up demand for sports was palpable. Working closely with NASCAR, FOX Sports designed a production that involved minimum crews, minimum travel and maximum health protocols to ensure a safe and enduring race season. We brought NASCAR back using only 1/3 of the people we would normally have trackside. Our director and camera operators and audio were on site, while graphics, replays, producers and talent were spread out between Charlotte and Los Angeles. With very few or no fans on the track, it allowed us to break new ground with miniature drones flying overhead to get never before seen aerial footage. As the season progressed, even our in-car audio production and feature editing were produced live in technicians' homes.  We then turned our attention to baseball, when, on July 23, the Fox baseball season opened, with a triple header highlighted by 2.8 million viewers for the Yankees/Nationals game. The opening was up almost 20% over Fox's prime time Major League Baseball average last year and was sold out due to heavy advertising demand. We produced four baseball games on our first weekend, and none of the 7 talent were in the same place as we connected 10 different facilities in real time with our producers and directors in Los Angeles. In addition to our enhanced crowd audio, we have now introduced computer-generated virtual fans to the stadium. This innovation was created by mixing our first down line technology and real-time theatrical visual effects. And now we can't wait until the start of football.  We love sports for the adrenaline, it provides us, for the passion it inspires in us and for the narrative and drama of watching the classic underdog win from behind. Team U.S.A., beating the Soviet ice hockey team at the 1980 Winter Olympics or Buster Douglas knocking out Tyson or the FOX Entertainment network finishing the broadcast season in first place from fourth the year prior.  The network staged a dramatic comeback this past year and leapfrogged our competitors to regain the number one broadcast network title for the first time in 8 years. Fox was the only network to deliver year-over-year ratings gains among adults 18 to 49 and total viewers. We outperformed the number two network by 31% in the demo, driven by The Masked Singer, LEGO Masters and 9-1-1: Lone Star, the season's number one new scripted show.  And the network will also have a robust and stable entertainment lineup in the fall. We will debut two new series that were shot and ready to air before the pandemic, the psychological thriller, NEXT; and the Southern soap opera, Filthy Rich. We remain hopeful that The Masked Singer's fourth season will also be on air for the fall. Of course, animation has always been a strength of Fox, and earlier in the fiscal year, FOX Entertainment brought the Bento Box animation studio into the Fox family. Bento Box was a natural addition to enhance the capabilities of FOX Entertainment and has already proven to be an impactful investment. It's important to note that animation production has not been significantly impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.  Not only did we renew Bento Box's Emmy-winning show, Bob's Burgers for an 11th season on FOX, Bento Box is also producing 11 new animated shows, including for third-party customers such as Netflix and HBO Max. These new shows follow the May launch of Central Park, Bento Box's Apple TV+ Comedy Series. More recently, in April, we completed our acquisition of the advertising video-on-demand platform, Tubi. Tubi has seen phenomenal growth since it joined Fox. In June, it surpassed 200 million hours streamed per month, representing more than 100% growth year-over-year. During the fourth quarter, several Fox hit shows were added to Tubi, with The Masked Singer quickly becoming Tubi's number one streamed series.  Tubi's young and diverse audience gives it a unique appeal with advertisers seeking to connect with consumers that are traditionally more challenging to reach. Tubi complements Fox portfolio and underscores our long-term strategic initiative to broaden and enhance direct-to-consumer digital reach and engagement, while providing advertising partners with more opportunities to engage audiences at scale. During this year's upfront season, we have begun selling Tubi advertising alongside broadcast, significantly expanding our clients' reach. According to one research company, 87% of the Tubi audience cannot be reached by cable television. They are young and diverse with a median age of only 34. It's a great business and a great fit with Fox. Another business that's had an extraordinary year is FOX News, which ended fiscal year 2020 with record-breaking viewership. In June 2020, FOX News was the leading prime time network in all of television among total viewers, making it the first cable network to ever lead all broadcast networks in ratings for an entire month. For the fiscal year, we were again the number one channel in all of cable for total viewers across prime and total day. Now I could say that's another extraordinary achievement, but the etymologist in me won't allow it. That's because FOX News has been the number one channel in all cable for 4 years running and the number one channel in cable news for 18 years.  We have a long track record of succeeding through multiple economic and political cycles and during administrations of both political parties. We are pacing calendar 2020 to have our highest-rated prime time year in network history, with total viewers up 39% over 2019. Our content programs are now routinely notching around 4 million viewers a night. Though not a head-to-head comparison, the FOX News channel is eclipsing broadcast news stalwarts like TODAY, Good Morning America, CBS This Morning and Meet the Press in viewership.  And viewers are coming to us not just for news and opinion, but increasingly for documentary and lifestyle programming on platforms such as FOX Nation and FoxNews.com. In fact, FOX Nation more than doubled its subscriber base this fiscal year, sustaining a trial to pay conversion rate of over 80% and a monthly churn rate of under 10%. Momentum built as the year progressed, with content starts up over 120% and hours watched up over 170% in the second half of fiscal year compared to the first half.  Within FOX News, we have also organically cultivated one of the most impactful digital platforms in the country. FOX News Media charted its highest digital traffic in fiscal year 2020, with record total digital page views and a record time spent. Users viewed over 40 billion pages and spent 98 billion minutes on our FOX News digital platforms. We expect this trend to accelerate as we head into election season in November.  The fall will be busy for our news organizations at FOX News and at our stations. Later this month, FOX News will bring viewers coverage of the Democratic and Republican national conventions, in whatever form they take. And as we close in on November, we expect to continue to achieve a record amount of political revenue across both our national channels and local stations.  It's important to note that according to a study by Nielsen MRI Fusion, FOX News has more than doubled the number of independent viewers than CNN, 119% more to be exact. And we have 62% more independent viewers than MSNBC. This points clearly to our highly trusted, balanced news reporting and is a key differentiator between us and our competitors for political advertising.  In the political cycle today, inclusive of the impact of COVID-19, our political advertising revenue is pacing more than 50% ahead of the equivalent period 4 years ago. We are encouraged by recent trends in our local markets and expect healthy political demand up and down the ballot in the coming quarters. Nine of our 18 stations are a presidential battleground space. These are led by Arizona, Florida, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, but also include Georgia, Michigan and Minnesota. We have center races in 10 markets and lower house races in all, a number of which are expected to be close and hotly contested.  Record political revenue has already offset some of the impact from COVID-19 in local markets. While our top 7 markets where businesses have not yet fully reopened, we are now pacing, overall, down 29% at the start of Q1. Our next 11 markets are together pacing down just 4%. That's a tremendous recovery from what we were seeing just a couple of months ago. And 3 of our markets are now pacing well ahead of last year. These are Atlanta, Tampa and Phoenix. Not coincidentally, these are all strong political markets.  The fourth quarter saw affiliate revenues grow by 8%, where healthy rate increases were offset by a decline in subscriber volumes of around 6.5%. For the full fiscal year, our total company affiliate revenues increased 7%, an important illustration of our brand's prominence and strength with audiences and distribution partners alike. This past year, we have completed significant distribution agreements, including an early renewal with Comcast as well as new deals with Verizon, Cox, Charter and YouTube TV, among others, each with rate increases that underscore the importance of our channels.  As we articulated more than a year ago during our Investor Day and as we've demonstrated with our disciplined and intentional acquisitions to date, we are taking a deliberate and selective approach to M&A and strong businesses fit within our vision, are well-executed and properly integrated with the rest of the company. We continually assess opportunities to deepen our strengths by expanding lines of business and the types of operations at which we excel. Our goal remains to expand the ways our audiences interact with and connect to our brands, while simultaneously diversifying each brand's sources of revenue.  But before turning things over to Steve, let me reinforce one key point as we mark the end of our first fiscal year. The assets and businesses of Fox were deliberately composed for efficient growth and success in the current media environment. The stability and trajectory of the company are underscored by the revenue structure and unrivaled viewer engagement. Fox has demonstrated consistent clarity of vision by assembling the portfolio we have and by evolving to embrace opportunities in order to meet the challenges of our time. We entered the COVID-19 crisis on firm footing financially, strategically and operationally. Our innovative thinking in combination with the tailwinds of the upcoming fall sports and entertainment seasons and ongoing need for live news, analysis and opinion will see Fox emerge from this pandemic-cost year more competitive, more focused and even more strongly positioned to deliver for our viewers, our partners and our shareholders.  And now Steve will take us through a bit detailed. Thank you.\nSteven Tomsic: Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. Despite the broader macroeconomic factors affecting our businesses, as Lachlan just highlighted, our first fiscal year as a stand-alone public company demonstrates that we are delivering on the strategies that we outlined at the time of the spin and that truly differentiate Fox.  Let me now take you through our financial results for the fiscal year as well as the fourth quarter. I'll also take a few minutes to review the key investments we've made since the spin, before concluding with some financial markets for the months ahead.  Our full year results saw total revenues increased 8% to $12.3 billion. This revenue growth was broad-based and led by affiliate revenue growth of 7% on the back of retransmission revenue increases at the television segment. We delivered this industry-leading affiliate revenue growth, despite an uptick in the rate of net subscriber declines. Using fiscal '19 as a base, we renewed 70% of total affiliate revenue in fiscal '20. Looking forward, the renewal profile in the immediate future is significantly lighter, with around 5% of total fiscal '20 affiliate revenue due for renewal in each of fiscal '21 and '22. Full year advertising revenues increased 5%, led by our broadcast of Super Bowl LIV. Partially offsetting this growth was the impact of COVID-19 in recent months. As we foreshadowed in May, the impact was most pronounced at our local television stations as well as FOX Sports due to the postponement of live events and at FOX Entertainment as new scripted programs were held back for our fall schedule.  We also increased other revenues nearly 30%, primarily through the consolidation of Bento Box at the television segment beginning in August and the consolidation of Credible in our other segment beginning in October.  Total full year adjusted EBITDA was $2.8 billion, an increase of 4% over the prior year. This growth was delivered despite the negative comparison to the accounting benefit from certain shared services and overhead costs being presented on a carve-out basis in the first 3 quarters of the prior year. Full year net income attributable to stockholders was $1 billion or $1.62 a share, while adjusted EPS was $2.48 versus $2.63 last year. Again, year-on-year comparison is impacted by the treatment of certain shared services and overhead costs in the prior year in accordance with SEC guidelines. Turning to the fourth quarter. Total company revenues were $2.4 billion, down 4% versus last year as COVID-19 related declines in our advertising revenues, overwhelmingly influenced by declines at our local television stations, and to a lesser extent, at the FOX Network, more than offset affiliate revenue growth of 8%.  We indicated on our May call that we expected the COVID-related advertising headwinds across our business in the June quarter, excluding sports, to be in the $200 million to $240 million range, with the local market being down approximately 50%. We ended the quarter ahead of these expectations, with our advertising revenue down approximately $160 million across these businesses, with the local market down closer to 35% and FOX News advertising revenues actually posting a year-on-year gain.  Adjusted EBITDA was $742 million, a 5% increase over the $709 million generated last year, led by higher contributions from the cable segment. This growth was partially offset in our Television segment due to the COVID-19-related advertising weakness.  From a bottom line perspective, net income attributable to stockholders of $122 million or $0.20 per share was lower than the $0.73 per share in the prior year quarter, most notably due to the higher impairment and restructuring charges, including the negotiated settlement to exit our rights agreement with the USGA. Controlling for this and other noncore items in both years, adjusted EPS of $0.62 was consistent with the prior year quarter.  Now turning to the operating performance of our segments for the fourth quarter, with Cable Networks' EBITDA of $674 million, was up 12% despite revenue being down 2%. The lower cable segment revenues were most notably due to a $22 million or 8% decline in our advertising revenues, including the impact of the postponement of live events at our sports networks and the absence of the FIFA Women's World Cup compared to the fourth quarter last year. Meanwhile, higher ratings and pricing helped to grow advertising revenues at Fox News Media in the quarter. Cable affiliate revenues increased 1%, supported by higher average rates, partially offset by a net decrease in pay television subscribers. Other revenues were down 31%, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 on our sports business, partially offset by higher FOX Nation and radio revenues at FOX News Media.  EBITDA at our cable segment increased 12% over the prior period, most notably reflecting lower sports programming rights amortization and production costs due to the postponement of live events and the absence of the FIFA Women's World Cup compared to the fourth quarter of last year.  Our television segment reported EBITDA of $169 million, down from the $214 million reported in the prior year quarter. As revenue declines of 6% were partially offset by expenses that decreased nearly 3%. Television affiliate revenues grew 22%, consistent with the overall trajectory we outlined at our Investor Day in May of 2019. Television advertising revenues declined 29%, primarily from the impact of the pandemic on the local advertising market at the FOX Television Station and the postponement of live events at FOX Sports.  Furthermore, in response to COVID-19, we deferred the planned spring premiers of certain scripted programs at FOX Entertainment into our fall schedule. These COVID-led declines more than offset the growth in affiliate revenues along with revenue growth from our new businesses, Tubi and Bento Box. The decrease in expenses primarily reflects lower programming amortization across FOX Sports and FOX Entertainment. From not airing sports events or first run programming, partially offset by the consolidation of Tubi and Bento Box.  We expect the majority of the amortization-related savings to be timing related, with costs expected to shift into our fiscal '21 financials, but more on that in a moment. In aggregate, we estimated that COVID-19 created an EBITDA headwind of approximately $15 million in the quarter across our entire business.  Finally, from a P&L perspective, the net EBITDA loss in our other segment amounted to $101 million, a slight improvement from the comparable quarter in the prior year. Meanwhile, our P&L tax rate ended the year at 27%. The strong overall P&L results generated free cash flow, which we calculate as net cash provided by operating activities, less cash invested in property, plant and equipment of over $850 million in the quarter and $2 billion for the year. This equates to over 70% EBITDA to free cash flow conversion in the year, demonstrating the robust free cash flow profile we outlined at our Investor Day.  And from an overall balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with over $4.6 billion in cash and just under $8 billion in debt, which includes the $1.2 billion in 5- and 10-year senior notes that we raised this past quarter. In the 16 months since the spin, we've invested approximately $1.25 billion into our businesses through organic investments in our core operations, including the recent relaunch of our FOX Sports digital properties, and through strategic M&A. This latter group and our minority investments in acquisitions are worth highlighting given their inherent value to Fox that is not reflected in simple EBITDA multiple-based valuations. At our 2019 Investor Day, we announced a strategic partnership with The Stars Group. At the time, we invested approximately $240 million in the publicly-traded TSG and licensed our brand to the Fox Bet suite of pay-to-play and free-to-play games. As part of the partnership, we have an option over 50 -- of up to 50% of the equity in TSG's U.S. businesses.  Subsequent to TSG's merger with Flutter and our incremental equity investment of approximately $100 million, we now own roughly 3% of parent company, Flutter, at a current market valuation of more than $600 million. We retain our up to 50% call option over TSG's U.S. businesses, but in addition, have also secured the right to buy an approximately 18.5% equity stake in FanDuel with an exercise period of 10 years.  Last October, we completed the acquisition of a 67% stake in Credible Labs, an emerging fintech marketplace, which was a key part of the Fox business brand refresh and is now in the early stages of integrating alongside our national and local news assets. Since announcement, Credible -- since announcement, Credible's trailing 12-month revenue has grown from the approximately $40 million that it reported as a stand-alone public company to approximately $70 million through the June quarter, with this momentum supporting our confidence to continue to invest cross promotional resources in growing the platform.  In April, we closed on the acquisition of Tubi, which we now report in our Television segment. Notwithstanding the challenges from COVID-19, we expect the boom in usage Lachlan outlined earlier, along with more effective monetization, to make Tubi a key source of revenue growth for many years to come. These recently acquired businesses, coupled with the renowned production capabilities in real estate of the Fox Studio lot and our tax asset, collectively represents significant pools of below-the-line value, hiding in plain sight at Fox Corporation.  Before we open the call up to Q&A, let me provide a few markers to help you navigate the financial swings across our businesses in fiscal 2021.  Beginning with a reminder of the events that create comparability issues between FY '20 and FY '21, where fiscal 2020 included the Super Bowl, 7-game World Series, the culmination of the FIFA Women's World Cup, along with Fox's Emmy Awards rotation. While fiscal 2021 will include what shapes to be a strong political year, the alternating NFC divisional playoff game and a full year consolidating our recent investments, including Tubi and Credible.  Looking specifically at Q1, the combined effect of comparability in COVID is expected to reduce advertising revenue by roughly $250 million as compared to Q1 in fiscal 2020. While we will enjoy the benefits from political advertising, a greater volume of MLB regular season games and NASCAR races, along with the acquisition of Tubi, these will be more than offset by lower base advertising at our local stations, a reduced slate of fresh entertainment programming, fewer NFL and college football games in our Q1 schedule and the absence of the World Cup, Emmys and the MLB All-Star game.  You will recall that we amortize the costs of our live sports programming when the games actually air on our networks. As such, the postponement of the sports calendar in the June quarter creates a shift of amortization, primarily across MLB and NASCAR rights, into the first quarter of our fiscal '21. We anticipate that this will increase our total sports operating expenses in the September quarter by approximately $70 million in the cable segment, broadly offsetting other savings.  This all, of course, assumes that the COVID-driven disruptions to major sports are behind us and that we enjoy a full season of NFL, a conference-only 10-game college football season and the MLB season completes. These assumptions remain valid today, and we have no intention of using this call to run through the list of what is. We're in constant dialogue with our sports partners, and if circumstances change, we will take appropriate steps for the business.  The same underlying fundamentals hold for FOX Entertainment, where we amortize the costs of our programming as the content is on our broadcast network. What we are now looking at is a 2021 broadcast season that includes a number of titles originally intended for our spring 2020 schedule shifted into the fall.  Furthermore, we are optimistic that our key returning titles, including The Masked Singer, can be made available for mid-season returns. If this outlook holds, we could end up seeing a relatively full broadcast season. However, our programming amortization may not follow its normal cadence across quarters. Rather, from an amortization standpoint, our fiscal Q1 and Q2 are likely to be lighter than a normal year, with a heavier concentration of costs being absorbed in Q4. Again, pending the timing of a return to production.  From a cash flow perspective, we are planning for a high level of capital expenditure in fiscal '21, supporting the final phases of the build-out of our technical broadcast facility in Arizona and the upgrade of some of our station facilities. We will also have higher interest payments related to our debt raised this past quarter.  Underscoring our financial strength and confidence from a capital allocation perspective, we have today declare a semiannual $0.23 a share dividend payable on October 7, right in line with the pre-COVID dividend we declared in February.  While the continued uncertainties make it challenging for us to estimate the future performance of our business, the company entered this crisis in a position of operating and financial strength. We will continue to manage our business and our balance sheet in a disciplined and conservative manner so that we emerge as well-positioned as possible to take advantage of the opportunities during the recovery.  And with that, I'd like to turn the call back to Joe.\nJoseph Dorrego: Thank you, Steve. And now we would be happy to take a few questions from the investment community.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We have a question from Benjamin Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.\nBenjamin Swinburne: I will limit myself to one question. I was wondering if you guys could talk a little bit more about sports betting? You've obviously talked about The Stars Group investment, and we followed that, and that's been a very successful one. But this appears to be a market that's really booming in the states, even with COVID, and the prospects are quite optimistic.  So I'm just wondering how you think about taking advantage of that opportunity even more than you already have? Are there things you're doing strategically with your partners or even on the FOX Network to sort of really lean in to sports betting to make it a bigger part of the business and a part of the story?\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks, Ben. So look, we -- I think we agree with you, from what it sounds like, and that we are big fans of the sports betting opportunity. Every projection is that it will be a several billion-dollar industry in the medium to long term. And everything we've seen to date not only reinforces that, but I think makes us believe it could be even larger than that.  I think we feel today very well positioned both in having the joint venture in Fox Bet, which we -- as Steve mentioned, we have the option to go to 50% ownership of, depending on licensing. But we also have the 18.5% option to buy into the FanDuel. So we effectively have 2 dogs in the race, and we think that puts us in a great position.  Moving forward, obviously, we have to see how the states open up from a regulatory point of view and as we move into each market. It's not necessarily the case that you'll have FanDuel and FOX Bet in all the same markets. For example, we found in FOX Bet the best markets for us, and we've just opened in Colorado, a market that have both sports betting but also gaming licenses.  When you think about the funnel sort of monetize the customer -- the consumer, we'd start with a FOX Bet Super 6 as a free-to-play game. Those people, some of them will move through the funnel into our sports betting, the FOX Bet app or the FanDuel experience. And then a subset of those will actually go into our gaming environment, when there's no sports betting being played. So look, we think the opportunity is huge and is something that we'll continue to spend time on to drive -- to promote to FOX Sports and to invest in.\nOperator: We have a question from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: I have an advertising question. Lachlan mentioned in his opening remarks that there will be or is an upfront. Can you talk about the timing and expectations, any color you can give? Will the sales be across all of your platforms, sports, news, broadcast and Tubi? And then on FOX News, given the growth in ratings and given the expectations for strong ratings for the next few months, how -- do you feel like you're monetizing your ratings as well as -- are your ratings being monetized the way they should be? Or is there still upside from here?\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks, Jessica. I know there's been a lot of talk about the upfront and some discussion about it on other calls. I think the thing -- well, the first thing I'd like to say is that the sales is very active at the moment, but it's a different sort of upfront this year for everyone, right, than in past years. I would call it sort of a rolling upfront. It's not a process that has a beginning, a middle and an end. We are working, as I think I said in the last call, with all of the agency groups and each of our clients as they reengage with their -- with consumers and customers across our platforms.  And so some have been much more heavily impacted by COVID-19 than others. Obviously, the categories that are affected, retail, theatrical entertainment, fast food restaurants. Obviously, travel are all highly impacted by COVID-19. So each of those clients, we're engaged with and sort of negotiating with as we go forward.  I think what you'll see is as we close -- and as we have closed upfront negotiations, you'll see that going right up until really through to the beginning of the football season. And we are incredibly heartened by the strength of scatter in the market. I think scatter, across the board, is in the mid- to high teens. I think that shows the demand for marketers to get back on air in a mass market and broad way.  We are selling it across all of our platforms, news, sports, entertainment and Tubi. Tubi is now integrated in most, if not all, of our upfront conversations. When we add Tubi to a sale, it increases reach by over 20% for the client and also obviously makes the demographic younger and more diverse.  And Jessica, to your question on FOX News, FOX News ratings have been astronomical. We are monetizing them very well. One of the benefits of COVID-19 has been with a larger news audience. The audience has also gotten younger, and that's brought actually new advertisers that hadn't advertised on FOX News, new advertisers on to the platform. So it's a very strong positive story for FOX News.\nOperator: We have a question from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson.\nMichael Nathanson: I have two quick ones, I promise. So first question is this, what is your thinking about -- I have a terrible echo, one second. What's your thinking about Thursday Night Football returning again, given how much profits you guys made at the FOX TV business before Thursday Night? And how less are Thursday to your P&L? Second, Steve did a very good job in laying out the valuation case for your stock, and as it -- was really cheap on cash flow, asset value and any way you look at it.\nLachlan Murdoch: Michael, we lost you on a little bit of the second part of the second question. So I'll let Steve answer that one. You came in and out a bit, but I think we got the gist of it. And about Thursday Night Football, we don't have any update for the market nor would we of the sort of the details of our negotiations with the NFL beyond what we've said already, which is they are an incredible partner with us, they have been for 25 years. And frankly, we value all of their content, and we'll update the market as our negotiation comes to a close with them. But there's no updates on Thursday Night Football or Sunday afternoon.  I should say though, obviously, football and our partnership with the NFL is really that and Major League Baseball form the foundation of the brand of FOX Sports, so it's important content for us.\nSteven Tomsic: Yes. And Michael, I'll try and answer the question I think you're asking. I think there is an element of frustration in sort of the value attributed to the company. I think the way we sort of look at it, you've got this traditional business that is in a strong, competitive and strategic position, highly profitable, throws off a lot of cash. We don't get the sort of benefit from the cash flow generating aspects of the business, and then we've bought into various other investments, which I highlighted in my opening remarks, where it feels as though we're not even getting acquisition value for those businesses. So the extent to which we can shine torches on both aspects of the business is helpful, we think, to sort of getting the share price to a more appropriate place.\nOperator: We have a question from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.\nAlexia Quadrani: My question is really on football, college and NFL. I totally understand you guys don't want to speculate whether it will come back or not. But speaking more broadly about your relationship with your distributors, I guess what sort of alternatives or sort of leeways do you have if these -- some or part of these sports are outright canceled and they don't return sort of later on in the year? I'm just curious about, is there any danger of breaching the sort of the affiliate contracts there?\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks, Alexia. First, I should say, we fully expect both college football and the NFL to come back in the fall. We expect to hear from our college conferences later this week in terms of a schedule for their seasons. And I think the NFL has announced coming back on September 10. So we are full speed ahead, working with the college conferences and with the NFL in ensuring a safe and consistent and full seasons for the NFL. And there's a reduction in the season for college football, so that they play within their conferences and minimize travel for their student athletes. So we expect both to come back, and we're looking forward to it.\nOperator: We have a question from John Janedis with Wolfe Research.\nJohn Janedis: I was hoping you guys can expand a little more on your advertising outlook. What are you seeing in terms of underlying demand? I guess what I'm saying, I'm trying to better understand to what extent you're seeing improvements in the first quarter, given your comments about sports and political relative to the fourth quarter?\nLachlan Murdoch: So we're seeing strong demand. You've got to break it down, I suppose, for us, by vertical. There's a -- the news ratings are so far above last year's. And as I mentioned, we have new clients and new categories of clients on FOX News.  So news demand is really driven by the audience and by the ratings there, so we're seeing tremendous demand in news. Obviously, it's going to be a -- continue to be an incredibly strong news cycle, I think -- and certainly through to the end of the year. There's no let up there. And I think advertisers are flocking to the certainty of those ratings and that audience. I think sports, there's a great pent-up demand for sport. We saw that in the sellouts in Major League Baseball. We saw that when we brought back NASCAR, the advertiser interest in NASCAR, and we expect to see it with football going forward as well.  As we go through our upfront process, we have visibility in terms of what the clients are telling us that they expect to spend. And certainly, in news and sport, we're seeing healthy budgets there. I think entertainment is a different kettle of fish as people are waiting to see what happens in the fall season. As we explained earlier on the call, we have a relatively fresh scripted season with 2 shows that we had in the can that we hadn't aired. And we do hope to have The Masked Singer, not for mid-season, but for the fall, if possible. And that would be -- that will absolutely drive ratings and revenue there as well.  When we look to the stations, the -- we're heartened to see how quickly local advertising is coming back, particularly in those smaller markets. So the bottom half of our -- I don't want to say bottom half, but the smaller half of our station group, where they have, perhaps, less sort of population density, less shutdowns due to COVID-19, and those markets are coming back well. And as I mentioned before, the markets that are really buoyed are the ones where this political revenue has started to pour in. And then the overlay of all of that is obviously scatter being very strong, which I think just goes anecdotally to the demand by advertisers and clients to get back and sort of mass marketing.\nJoseph Dorrego: At this point, we are out of time. But if you have any further questions, please give me or Dan Carey a call. Thank you once again for joining today's call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Steven Tomsic",
            "content": "Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. Despite the broader macroeconomic factors affecting our businesses, as Lachlan just highlighted, our first fiscal year as a stand-alone public company demonstrates that we are delivering on the strategies that we outlined at the time of the spin and that truly differentiate Fox.  Let me now take you through our financial results for the fiscal year as well as the fourth quarter. I'll also take a few minutes to review the key investments we've made since the spin, before concluding with some financial markets for the months ahead.  Our full year results saw total revenues increased 8% to $12.3 billion. This revenue growth was broad-based and led by affiliate revenue growth of 7% on the back of retransmission revenue increases at the television segment. We delivered this industry-leading affiliate revenue growth, despite an uptick in the rate of net subscriber declines. Using fiscal '19 as a base, we renewed 70% of total affiliate revenue in fiscal '20. Looking forward, the renewal profile in the immediate future is significantly lighter, with around 5% of total fiscal '20 affiliate revenue due for renewal in each of fiscal '21 and '22. Full year advertising revenues increased 5%, led by our broadcast of Super Bowl LIV. Partially offsetting this growth was the impact of COVID-19 in recent months. As we foreshadowed in May, the impact was most pronounced at our local television stations as well as FOX Sports due to the postponement of live events and at FOX Entertainment as new scripted programs were held back for our fall schedule.  We also increased other revenues nearly 30%, primarily through the consolidation of Bento Box at the television segment beginning in August and the consolidation of Credible in our other segment beginning in October.  Total full year adjusted EBITDA was $2.8 billion, an increase of 4% over the prior year. This growth was delivered despite the negative comparison to the accounting benefit from certain shared services and overhead costs being presented on a carve-out basis in the first 3 quarters of the prior year. Full year net income attributable to stockholders was $1 billion or $1.62 a share, while adjusted EPS was $2.48 versus $2.63 last year. Again, year-on-year comparison is impacted by the treatment of certain shared services and overhead costs in the prior year in accordance with SEC guidelines. Turning to the fourth quarter. Total company revenues were $2.4 billion, down 4% versus last year as COVID-19 related declines in our advertising revenues, overwhelmingly influenced by declines at our local television stations, and to a lesser extent, at the FOX Network, more than offset affiliate revenue growth of 8%.  We indicated on our May call that we expected the COVID-related advertising headwinds across our business in the June quarter, excluding sports, to be in the $200 million to $240 million range, with the local market being down approximately 50%. We ended the quarter ahead of these expectations, with our advertising revenue down approximately $160 million across these businesses, with the local market down closer to 35% and FOX News advertising revenues actually posting a year-on-year gain.  Adjusted EBITDA was $742 million, a 5% increase over the $709 million generated last year, led by higher contributions from the cable segment. This growth was partially offset in our Television segment due to the COVID-19-related advertising weakness.  From a bottom line perspective, net income attributable to stockholders of $122 million or $0.20 per share was lower than the $0.73 per share in the prior year quarter, most notably due to the higher impairment and restructuring charges, including the negotiated settlement to exit our rights agreement with the USGA. Controlling for this and other noncore items in both years, adjusted EPS of $0.62 was consistent with the prior year quarter.  Now turning to the operating performance of our segments for the fourth quarter, with Cable Networks' EBITDA of $674 million, was up 12% despite revenue being down 2%. The lower cable segment revenues were most notably due to a $22 million or 8% decline in our advertising revenues, including the impact of the postponement of live events at our sports networks and the absence of the FIFA Women's World Cup compared to the fourth quarter last year. Meanwhile, higher ratings and pricing helped to grow advertising revenues at Fox News Media in the quarter. Cable affiliate revenues increased 1%, supported by higher average rates, partially offset by a net decrease in pay television subscribers. Other revenues were down 31%, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 on our sports business, partially offset by higher FOX Nation and radio revenues at FOX News Media.  EBITDA at our cable segment increased 12% over the prior period, most notably reflecting lower sports programming rights amortization and production costs due to the postponement of live events and the absence of the FIFA Women's World Cup compared to the fourth quarter of last year.  Our television segment reported EBITDA of $169 million, down from the $214 million reported in the prior year quarter. As revenue declines of 6% were partially offset by expenses that decreased nearly 3%. Television affiliate revenues grew 22%, consistent with the overall trajectory we outlined at our Investor Day in May of 2019. Television advertising revenues declined 29%, primarily from the impact of the pandemic on the local advertising market at the FOX Television Station and the postponement of live events at FOX Sports.  Furthermore, in response to COVID-19, we deferred the planned spring premiers of certain scripted programs at FOX Entertainment into our fall schedule. These COVID-led declines more than offset the growth in affiliate revenues along with revenue growth from our new businesses, Tubi and Bento Box. The decrease in expenses primarily reflects lower programming amortization across FOX Sports and FOX Entertainment. From not airing sports events or first run programming, partially offset by the consolidation of Tubi and Bento Box.  We expect the majority of the amortization-related savings to be timing related, with costs expected to shift into our fiscal '21 financials, but more on that in a moment. In aggregate, we estimated that COVID-19 created an EBITDA headwind of approximately $15 million in the quarter across our entire business.  Finally, from a P&L perspective, the net EBITDA loss in our other segment amounted to $101 million, a slight improvement from the comparable quarter in the prior year. Meanwhile, our P&L tax rate ended the year at 27%. The strong overall P&L results generated free cash flow, which we calculate as net cash provided by operating activities, less cash invested in property, plant and equipment of over $850 million in the quarter and $2 billion for the year. This equates to over 70% EBITDA to free cash flow conversion in the year, demonstrating the robust free cash flow profile we outlined at our Investor Day.  And from an overall balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with over $4.6 billion in cash and just under $8 billion in debt, which includes the $1.2 billion in 5- and 10-year senior notes that we raised this past quarter. In the 16 months since the spin, we've invested approximately $1.25 billion into our businesses through organic investments in our core operations, including the recent relaunch of our FOX Sports digital properties, and through strategic M&A. This latter group and our minority investments in acquisitions are worth highlighting given their inherent value to Fox that is not reflected in simple EBITDA multiple-based valuations. At our 2019 Investor Day, we announced a strategic partnership with The Stars Group. At the time, we invested approximately $240 million in the publicly-traded TSG and licensed our brand to the Fox Bet suite of pay-to-play and free-to-play games. As part of the partnership, we have an option over 50 -- of up to 50% of the equity in TSG's U.S. businesses.  Subsequent to TSG's merger with Flutter and our incremental equity investment of approximately $100 million, we now own roughly 3% of parent company, Flutter, at a current market valuation of more than $600 million. We retain our up to 50% call option over TSG's U.S. businesses, but in addition, have also secured the right to buy an approximately 18.5% equity stake in FanDuel with an exercise period of 10 years.  Last October, we completed the acquisition of a 67% stake in Credible Labs, an emerging fintech marketplace, which was a key part of the Fox business brand refresh and is now in the early stages of integrating alongside our national and local news assets. Since announcement, Credible -- since announcement, Credible's trailing 12-month revenue has grown from the approximately $40 million that it reported as a stand-alone public company to approximately $70 million through the June quarter, with this momentum supporting our confidence to continue to invest cross promotional resources in growing the platform.  In April, we closed on the acquisition of Tubi, which we now report in our Television segment. Notwithstanding the challenges from COVID-19, we expect the boom in usage Lachlan outlined earlier, along with more effective monetization, to make Tubi a key source of revenue growth for many years to come. These recently acquired businesses, coupled with the renowned production capabilities in real estate of the Fox Studio lot and our tax asset, collectively represents significant pools of below-the-line value, hiding in plain sight at Fox Corporation.  Before we open the call up to Q&A, let me provide a few markers to help you navigate the financial swings across our businesses in fiscal 2021.  Beginning with a reminder of the events that create comparability issues between FY '20 and FY '21, where fiscal 2020 included the Super Bowl, 7-game World Series, the culmination of the FIFA Women's World Cup, along with Fox's Emmy Awards rotation. While fiscal 2021 will include what shapes to be a strong political year, the alternating NFC divisional playoff game and a full year consolidating our recent investments, including Tubi and Credible.  Looking specifically at Q1, the combined effect of comparability in COVID is expected to reduce advertising revenue by roughly $250 million as compared to Q1 in fiscal 2020. While we will enjoy the benefits from political advertising, a greater volume of MLB regular season games and NASCAR races, along with the acquisition of Tubi, these will be more than offset by lower base advertising at our local stations, a reduced slate of fresh entertainment programming, fewer NFL and college football games in our Q1 schedule and the absence of the World Cup, Emmys and the MLB All-Star game.  You will recall that we amortize the costs of our live sports programming when the games actually air on our networks. As such, the postponement of the sports calendar in the June quarter creates a shift of amortization, primarily across MLB and NASCAR rights, into the first quarter of our fiscal '21. We anticipate that this will increase our total sports operating expenses in the September quarter by approximately $70 million in the cable segment, broadly offsetting other savings.  This all, of course, assumes that the COVID-driven disruptions to major sports are behind us and that we enjoy a full season of NFL, a conference-only 10-game college football season and the MLB season completes. These assumptions remain valid today, and we have no intention of using this call to run through the list of what is. We're in constant dialogue with our sports partners, and if circumstances change, we will take appropriate steps for the business.  The same underlying fundamentals hold for FOX Entertainment, where we amortize the costs of our programming as the content is on our broadcast network. What we are now looking at is a 2021 broadcast season that includes a number of titles originally intended for our spring 2020 schedule shifted into the fall.  Furthermore, we are optimistic that our key returning titles, including The Masked Singer, can be made available for mid-season returns. If this outlook holds, we could end up seeing a relatively full broadcast season. However, our programming amortization may not follow its normal cadence across quarters. Rather, from an amortization standpoint, our fiscal Q1 and Q2 are likely to be lighter than a normal year, with a heavier concentration of costs being absorbed in Q4. Again, pending the timing of a return to production.  From a cash flow perspective, we are planning for a high level of capital expenditure in fiscal '21, supporting the final phases of the build-out of our technical broadcast facility in Arizona and the upgrade of some of our station facilities. We will also have higher interest payments related to our debt raised this past quarter.  Underscoring our financial strength and confidence from a capital allocation perspective, we have today declare a semiannual $0.23 a share dividend payable on October 7, right in line with the pre-COVID dividend we declared in February.  While the continued uncertainties make it challenging for us to estimate the future performance of our business, the company entered this crisis in a position of operating and financial strength. We will continue to manage our business and our balance sheet in a disciplined and conservative manner so that we emerge as well-positioned as possible to take advantage of the opportunities during the recovery.  And with that, I'd like to turn the call back to Joe. Yes. And Michael, I'll try and answer the question I think you're asking. I think there is an element of frustration in sort of the value attributed to the company. I think the way we sort of look at it, you've got this traditional business that is in a strong, competitive and strategic position, highly profitable, throws off a lot of cash. We don't get the sort of benefit from the cash flow generating aspects of the business, and then we've bought into various other investments, which I highlighted in my opening remarks, where it feels as though we're not even getting acquisition value for those businesses. So the extent to which we can shine torches on both aspects of the business is helpful, we think, to sort of getting the share price to a more appropriate place."

            "name": "Lachlan Murdoch",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter results and to reflect on our first full fiscal year as new Fox. I know a lot of you on the phone have had a long day and have just come from another earnings call, so we will try to keep this as tight and as brief as possible.  I doubt any of us consider 2020 a great calendar year. It's been extraordinarily difficult on our businesses, on our health and on our families. I'm sure it's a year we would all like to be through and done with, and we will be soon. But looking back on Fox's 2020 fiscal year is another story. Our fiscal year has been extraordinary, not because of COVID-19, but in spite of it, our 2020 fiscal year has shown off the strength of Fox, the logic of our strategy and the resilience of our business model and of our teams. To that last point, I would like to acknowledge the outstanding work and dedication of my Fox colleagues across the country. They too are extraordinary. Without them, there would be no sport, no news and no entertainment on our platforms and stations.  What together we achieved last year was remarkable. I'd like to first give FOX Sports a shout out for an incredible year, which saw the brilliant broadcast of both the historic 7-game World Series and an exciting Super Bowl LIV, watched by over 100 million people. Of course, not long after the Super Bowl in Miami, sport was shut down. But the team at FOX Sports never stopped working to bring NASCAR, baseball and eventually football back into America's living rooms. On our last earnings call, I said, like the rest of America, we can't wait for the first pitch thrown, the first ball hike and the sound of engines starting again. Thankfully, the wait was not long. Our FOX Sports production team lost no time preparing to produce America's biggest events in ways we didn't think possible just a few months before. The sports team has invented new technologies to not only produce, but enhance the games being played today.  NASCAR was the first major American sport to return from its pandemic hiatus, and America's pent-up demand for sports was palpable. Working closely with NASCAR, FOX Sports designed a production that involved minimum crews, minimum travel and maximum health protocols to ensure a safe and enduring race season. We brought NASCAR back using only 1/3 of the people we would normally have trackside. Our director and camera operators and audio were on site, while graphics, replays, producers and talent were spread out between Charlotte and Los Angeles. With very few or no fans on the track, it allowed us to break new ground with miniature drones flying overhead to get never before seen aerial footage. As the season progressed, even our in-car audio production and feature editing were produced live in technicians' homes.  We then turned our attention to baseball, when, on July 23, the Fox baseball season opened, with a triple header highlighted by 2.8 million viewers for the Yankees/Nationals game. The opening was up almost 20% over Fox's prime time Major League Baseball average last year and was sold out due to heavy advertising demand. We produced four baseball games on our first weekend, and none of the 7 talent were in the same place as we connected 10 different facilities in real time with our producers and directors in Los Angeles. In addition to our enhanced crowd audio, we have now introduced computer-generated virtual fans to the stadium. This innovation was created by mixing our first down line technology and real-time theatrical visual effects. And now we can't wait until the start of football.  We love sports for the adrenaline, it provides us, for the passion it inspires in us and for the narrative and drama of watching the classic underdog win from behind. Team U.S.A., beating the Soviet ice hockey team at the 1980 Winter Olympics or Buster Douglas knocking out Tyson or the FOX Entertainment network finishing the broadcast season in first place from fourth the year prior.  The network staged a dramatic comeback this past year and leapfrogged our competitors to regain the number one broadcast network title for the first time in 8 years. Fox was the only network to deliver year-over-year ratings gains among adults 18 to 49 and total viewers. We outperformed the number two network by 31% in the demo, driven by The Masked Singer, LEGO Masters and 9-1-1: Lone Star, the season's number one new scripted show.  And the network will also have a robust and stable entertainment lineup in the fall. We will debut two new series that were shot and ready to air before the pandemic, the psychological thriller, NEXT; and the Southern soap opera, Filthy Rich. We remain hopeful that The Masked Singer's fourth season will also be on air for the fall. Of course, animation has always been a strength of Fox, and earlier in the fiscal year, FOX Entertainment brought the Bento Box animation studio into the Fox family. Bento Box was a natural addition to enhance the capabilities of FOX Entertainment and has already proven to be an impactful investment. It's important to note that animation production has not been significantly impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.  Not only did we renew Bento Box's Emmy-winning show, Bob's Burgers for an 11th season on FOX, Bento Box is also producing 11 new animated shows, including for third-party customers such as Netflix and HBO Max. These new shows follow the May launch of Central Park, Bento Box's Apple TV+ Comedy Series. More recently, in April, we completed our acquisition of the advertising video-on-demand platform, Tubi. Tubi has seen phenomenal growth since it joined Fox. In June, it surpassed 200 million hours streamed per month, representing more than 100% growth year-over-year. During the fourth quarter, several Fox hit shows were added to Tubi, with The Masked Singer quickly becoming Tubi's number one streamed series.  Tubi's young and diverse audience gives it a unique appeal with advertisers seeking to connect with consumers that are traditionally more challenging to reach. Tubi complements Fox portfolio and underscores our long-term strategic initiative to broaden and enhance direct-to-consumer digital reach and engagement, while providing advertising partners with more opportunities to engage audiences at scale. During this year's upfront season, we have begun selling Tubi advertising alongside broadcast, significantly expanding our clients' reach. According to one research company, 87% of the Tubi audience cannot be reached by cable television. They are young and diverse with a median age of only 34. It's a great business and a great fit with Fox. Another business that's had an extraordinary year is FOX News, which ended fiscal year 2020 with record-breaking viewership. In June 2020, FOX News was the leading prime time network in all of television among total viewers, making it the first cable network to ever lead all broadcast networks in ratings for an entire month. For the fiscal year, we were again the number one channel in all of cable for total viewers across prime and total day. Now I could say that's another extraordinary achievement, but the etymologist in me won't allow it. That's because FOX News has been the number one channel in all cable for 4 years running and the number one channel in cable news for 18 years.  We have a long track record of succeeding through multiple economic and political cycles and during administrations of both political parties. We are pacing calendar 2020 to have our highest-rated prime time year in network history, with total viewers up 39% over 2019. Our content programs are now routinely notching around 4 million viewers a night. Though not a head-to-head comparison, the FOX News channel is eclipsing broadcast news stalwarts like TODAY, Good Morning America, CBS This Morning and Meet the Press in viewership.  And viewers are coming to us not just for news and opinion, but increasingly for documentary and lifestyle programming on platforms such as FOX Nation and FoxNews.com. In fact, FOX Nation more than doubled its subscriber base this fiscal year, sustaining a trial to pay conversion rate of over 80% and a monthly churn rate of under 10%. Momentum built as the year progressed, with content starts up over 120% and hours watched up over 170% in the second half of fiscal year compared to the first half.  Within FOX News, we have also organically cultivated one of the most impactful digital platforms in the country. FOX News Media charted its highest digital traffic in fiscal year 2020, with record total digital page views and a record time spent. Users viewed over 40 billion pages and spent 98 billion minutes on our FOX News digital platforms. We expect this trend to accelerate as we head into election season in November.  The fall will be busy for our news organizations at FOX News and at our stations. Later this month, FOX News will bring viewers coverage of the Democratic and Republican national conventions, in whatever form they take. And as we close in on November, we expect to continue to achieve a record amount of political revenue across both our national channels and local stations.  It's important to note that according to a study by Nielsen MRI Fusion, FOX News has more than doubled the number of independent viewers than CNN, 119% more to be exact. And we have 62% more independent viewers than MSNBC. This points clearly to our highly trusted, balanced news reporting and is a key differentiator between us and our competitors for political advertising.  In the political cycle today, inclusive of the impact of COVID-19, our political advertising revenue is pacing more than 50% ahead of the equivalent period 4 years ago. We are encouraged by recent trends in our local markets and expect healthy political demand up and down the ballot in the coming quarters. Nine of our 18 stations are a presidential battleground space. These are led by Arizona, Florida, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, but also include Georgia, Michigan and Minnesota. We have center races in 10 markets and lower house races in all, a number of which are expected to be close and hotly contested.  Record political revenue has already offset some of the impact from COVID-19 in local markets. While our top 7 markets where businesses have not yet fully reopened, we are now pacing, overall, down 29% at the start of Q1. Our next 11 markets are together pacing down just 4%. That's a tremendous recovery from what we were seeing just a couple of months ago. And 3 of our markets are now pacing well ahead of last year. These are Atlanta, Tampa and Phoenix. Not coincidentally, these are all strong political markets.  The fourth quarter saw affiliate revenues grow by 8%, where healthy rate increases were offset by a decline in subscriber volumes of around 6.5%. For the full fiscal year, our total company affiliate revenues increased 7%, an important illustration of our brand's prominence and strength with audiences and distribution partners alike. This past year, we have completed significant distribution agreements, including an early renewal with Comcast as well as new deals with Verizon, Cox, Charter and YouTube TV, among others, each with rate increases that underscore the importance of our channels.  As we articulated more than a year ago during our Investor Day and as we've demonstrated with our disciplined and intentional acquisitions to date, we are taking a deliberate and selective approach to M&A and strong businesses fit within our vision, are well-executed and properly integrated with the rest of the company. We continually assess opportunities to deepen our strengths by expanding lines of business and the types of operations at which we excel. Our goal remains to expand the ways our audiences interact with and connect to our brands, while simultaneously diversifying each brand's sources of revenue.  But before turning things over to Steve, let me reinforce one key point as we mark the end of our first fiscal year. The assets and businesses of Fox were deliberately composed for efficient growth and success in the current media environment. The stability and trajectory of the company are underscored by the revenue structure and unrivaled viewer engagement. Fox has demonstrated consistent clarity of vision by assembling the portfolio we have and by evolving to embrace opportunities in order to meet the challenges of our time. We entered the COVID-19 crisis on firm footing financially, strategically and operationally. Our innovative thinking in combination with the tailwinds of the upcoming fall sports and entertainment seasons and ongoing need for live news, analysis and opinion will see Fox emerge from this pandemic-cost year more competitive, more focused and even more strongly positioned to deliver for our viewers, our partners and our shareholders.  And now Steve will take us through a bit detailed. Thank you. Thanks, Ben. So look, we -- I think we agree with you, from what it sounds like, and that we are big fans of the sports betting opportunity. Every projection is that it will be a several billion-dollar industry in the medium to long term. And everything we've seen to date not only reinforces that, but I think makes us believe it could be even larger than that.  I think we feel today very well positioned both in having the joint venture in Fox Bet, which we -- as Steve mentioned, we have the option to go to 50% ownership of, depending on licensing. But we also have the 18.5% option to buy into the FanDuel. So we effectively have 2 dogs in the race, and we think that puts us in a great position.  Moving forward, obviously, we have to see how the states open up from a regulatory point of view and as we move into each market. It's not necessarily the case that you'll have FanDuel and FOX Bet in all the same markets. For example, we found in FOX Bet the best markets for us, and we've just opened in Colorado, a market that have both sports betting but also gaming licenses.  When you think about the funnel sort of monetize the customer -- the consumer, we'd start with a FOX Bet Super 6 as a free-to-play game. Those people, some of them will move through the funnel into our sports betting, the FOX Bet app or the FanDuel experience. And then a subset of those will actually go into our gaming environment, when there's no sports betting being played. So look, we think the opportunity is huge and is something that we'll continue to spend time on to drive -- to promote to FOX Sports and to invest in. Thanks, Jessica. I know there's been a lot of talk about the upfront and some discussion about it on other calls. I think the thing -- well, the first thing I'd like to say is that the sales is very active at the moment, but it's a different sort of upfront this year for everyone, right, than in past years. I would call it sort of a rolling upfront. It's not a process that has a beginning, a middle and an end. We are working, as I think I said in the last call, with all of the agency groups and each of our clients as they reengage with their -- with consumers and customers across our platforms.  And so some have been much more heavily impacted by COVID-19 than others. Obviously, the categories that are affected, retail, theatrical entertainment, fast food restaurants. Obviously, travel are all highly impacted by COVID-19. So each of those clients, we're engaged with and sort of negotiating with as we go forward.  I think what you'll see is as we close -- and as we have closed upfront negotiations, you'll see that going right up until really through to the beginning of the football season. And we are incredibly heartened by the strength of scatter in the market. I think scatter, across the board, is in the mid- to high teens. I think that shows the demand for marketers to get back on air in a mass market and broad way.  We are selling it across all of our platforms, news, sports, entertainment and Tubi. Tubi is now integrated in most, if not all, of our upfront conversations. When we add Tubi to a sale, it increases reach by over 20% for the client and also obviously makes the demographic younger and more diverse.  And Jessica, to your question on FOX News, FOX News ratings have been astronomical. We are monetizing them very well. One of the benefits of COVID-19 has been with a larger news audience. The audience has also gotten younger, and that's brought actually new advertisers that hadn't advertised on FOX News, new advertisers on to the platform. So it's a very strong positive story for FOX News. Michael, we lost you on a little bit of the second part of the second question. So I'll let Steve answer that one. You came in and out a bit, but I think we got the gist of it. And about Thursday Night Football, we don't have any update for the market nor would we of the sort of the details of our negotiations with the NFL beyond what we've said already, which is they are an incredible partner with us, they have been for 25 years. And frankly, we value all of their content, and we'll update the market as our negotiation comes to a close with them. But there's no updates on Thursday Night Football or Sunday afternoon.  I should say though, obviously, football and our partnership with the NFL is really that and Major League Baseball form the foundation of the brand of FOX Sports, so it's important content for us. Thanks, Alexia. First, I should say, we fully expect both college football and the NFL to come back in the fall. We expect to hear from our college conferences later this week in terms of a schedule for their seasons. And I think the NFL has announced coming back on September 10. So we are full speed ahead, working with the college conferences and with the NFL in ensuring a safe and consistent and full seasons for the NFL. And there's a reduction in the season for college football, so that they play within their conferences and minimize travel for their student athletes. So we expect both to come back, and we're looking forward to it. So we're seeing strong demand. You've got to break it down, I suppose, for us, by vertical. There's a -- the news ratings are so far above last year's. And as I mentioned, we have new clients and new categories of clients on FOX News.  So news demand is really driven by the audience and by the ratings there, so we're seeing tremendous demand in news. Obviously, it's going to be a -- continue to be an incredibly strong news cycle, I think -- and certainly through to the end of the year. There's no let up there. And I think advertisers are flocking to the certainty of those ratings and that audience. I think sports, there's a great pent-up demand for sport. We saw that in the sellouts in Major League Baseball. We saw that when we brought back NASCAR, the advertiser interest in NASCAR, and we expect to see it with football going forward as well.  As we go through our upfront process, we have visibility in terms of what the clients are telling us that they expect to spend. And certainly, in news and sport, we're seeing healthy budgets there. I think entertainment is a different kettle of fish as people are waiting to see what happens in the fall season. As we explained earlier on the call, we have a relatively fresh scripted season with 2 shows that we had in the can that we hadn't aired. And we do hope to have The Masked Singer, not for mid-season, but for the fall, if possible. And that would be -- that will absolutely drive ratings and revenue there as well.  When we look to the stations, the -- we're heartened to see how quickly local advertising is coming back, particularly in those smaller markets. So the bottom half of our -- I don't want to say bottom half, but the smaller half of our station group, where they have, perhaps, less sort of population density, less shutdowns due to COVID-19, and those markets are coming back well. And as I mentioned before, the markets that are really buoyed are the ones where this political revenue has started to pour in. And then the overlay of all of that is obviously scatter being very strong, which I think just goes anecdotally to the demand by advertisers and clients to get back and sort of mass marketing."

At this time, all participation phone lines are in a listen-only mode. And later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the conference over to Chief Investor Relations Officer and Executive Vice President of Corporate Initiatives, Mr. Joe Dorrego. Please go ahead, sir.\nJoe Dorrego: Thank you, operator. Hello, and welcome to our Third Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on the call today are Lachlan Murdoch, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Nallen, Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Tomsic, our Chief Financial Officer. First, Lachlan and Steve will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter, and then we'll take questions from the investment community. Please note that this call may include forward-looking statements regarding Fox Corporation's financial performance and operating results. These statements are based on management's current expectations, and actual results could differ from what is stated as a result of certain factors identified on today's call and in the company's SEC filings. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA or EBITDA, as we refer to it on this call. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and our SEC filings, which are both available in the Investor Relations section of our website. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Lachlan.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We are living through extraordinary times. Since we last all spoke together, who would have imagined our lives could have all been turned so upside down. The impact of COVID-19 has impacted our economy, our businesses, our colleagues and ourselves. We owe deep gratitude to the nurses, doctors, police, teachers, aged care workers, volunteers and countless other front-line workers for their incredible and brave sacrifices. At Fox, we thank every one of them. Their work humbles ours. We have spent these last few months protecting the health of our employees; providing essential news, information and entertainment to our communities; all while bolstering the strength of our company in order to best tackle the challenges ahead. At the outset, let me say that, if there is anything you take away from my remarks today, it should be that Fox is in a strong position to deal with the impact of this pandemic. Our strength was clearly demonstrated in the quarter, which was only partially impacted by the pandemic and is illustrative of the outstanding results Fox delivers in unaffected cycles. The strength of Fox has also been on display in the weeks since the end of the quarter as we navigate these unprecedented times to continue to provide our services to communities across the country. Starting with a review of our third quarter, you will have seen that we delivered exceptional financial results, achieving revenue and EBITDA growth of 25% and 20%, respectively, adjusted earnings per share growth of 22%, and generating over $1.5 billion of free cash flow. Our revenue growth was multipronged. It feels like a lifetime ago, but as a reminder, the quarter began with our record-breaking broadcast of Super Bowl 54, where we generated around $600 million of gross revenue across the company. But the strength in the quarter extended well beyond the Super Bowl. Local advertising at the FOX Television stations grew by over 20% as Super Bowl revenues were supplemented with over $35 million of gross political ad revenues in the quarter. At FOX News, advertising revenues grew by 15%, led by a 45% increase in digital ad revenues. And we had another strong affiliate quarter with total company affiliate revenues growing by 10%, despite a touch over 5% reduction in pay-TV subscribers. Steve will cover the details of our financial results shortly. Operationally, the quarter saw FOX News and FOX Business deliver their largest audiences in each network's history with FOX News ratings up approximately 40% year-on-year. The success of FOX News Media's brands extended beyond their linear properties, FOX News Digital achieved its highest quarter ever across all KPIs, including over 11 billion digital page views. Company-wide digital reach grew 42%, while digital engagement nearly doubled year-on-year. Elsewhere on screens, the quarter brought us another successful season of The Masked Singer and the number one new broadcast reality series, the family-friendly hit, Lego Masters, two shows that we hope will shape the Fox Network lineup for years to come. While still early days, our strategy to leverage the cross-promotional power of our platform to support shows we have an ownership interest in is showing encouraging results. Bless The Harts was the number one new comedy and adds another leg to our Sunday Animation Block, while Prodigal Son was the second highest-rated new scripted drama on television. Locally, the FOX television stations continued the expansion of their news coverage, adding an additional five hours per week across Atlanta and Los Angeles. The stations' unified programming strategy drove ratings growth in essentially every day part, including daytime and late news. Corporately, during the past quarter, we completed important transactions to support the ongoing growth and momentum of FOX. Among them were, the closing of our agreement with Nexstar, in which we expanded our local market footprint through the acquisition of key stations in Seattle and Milwaukee, and the transfer of our Charlotte stations to them; the early renewal of our distribution agreement with one of our largest partners, Comcast, and our full portfolio of channels; and the announcement and subsequent closing of our acquisition of Tubi, which immediately expands our direct to consumer capabilities and provides our advertisers with even more opportunities to reach audiences at great scale. Coupled with combined power of Fox's existing networks, Tubi provides a substantial base from which we will drive long-term growth in the direct to consumer market. As an example of the scale, in April, Tubi generated total viewing time of over 200 million hours, which is up more than 150% versus prior year. This was also the first full quarter reflecting the results of Credible, our digital loan marketplace business. And while we are only just at the beginning of exploring the marketing synergies between Fox and Credible, the business has had a great quarter, doubling its closed loan volume and revenue year-on-year. Overall, the financial and operating results through the first nine months of the year confirms just how sturdy our business is and demonstrates the power and importance of our live sports, news and event programming to our partners and our audiences. Of course, our achievements have been rightly overshadowed by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, and by the challenges it has presented to all of the company's stakeholders, including our colleagues, the communities we serve, our business partners and our shareholders. We understand our responsibility to each stakeholder and are mindful of them in the balanced actions we are taking to address the crisis. As I mentioned earlier, our main priority remains the health, safety and well-being of our more than 8,000 colleagues. We continue to follow federal, state and local guidelines when it comes to our workforce in our locations across the U.S. Those whose job functions allow it have been working remotely since mid-March. And we have over 70% of our employees offsite at the moment. We are grateful to those essential employees, whose jobs remain -- require them to work onsite for their commitment and for their resolve. We have taken actions to protect and ensure the well-being of these employees, particularly for those that are out in the community informing the country of every aspect of the pandemic at a national and local level. While taking steps to keep our colleagues safe, we also continue to provide our viewers with the information they seek to better understand this pandemic on a national and local basis. In this spirit, we swiftly launched coronavirusnow.com, a free to use website featuring the latest news about the pandemic. Drawing on our news gathering and digital capabilities across the country, bolstered by third party content from government and health organizations, such as the Center for Disease Control, we've created the site to provide our employees, viewers and communities with reliable up to date information about this public health issue. Over 1.3 million Americans have accessed these specific resources. It's a wonderful example of the breadth of Fox coming together to provide a public service to our audiences at a critical time and in a new and distinctive way. Further, working with our distribution partners to ensure that all Americans could receive the latest national and local news regarding coronavirus, we offered free access to the FOX News channel and FOX Television stations, starting in mid-March and continuing for over a month. We are doing impactful work across our platforms to inform our viewers and to give back to our audiences. Fox raised over $13 million for Feeding America and the First Responders Children's Foundation, through our broadcast of Fox Presents the iHeart Living Room Concert for America, which paid tribute to the brave medical professionals and local heroes who are working on so many aspects of the pandemic. In early April, Fox News and Facebook co-hosted a coronavirus town hall, featuring medical and business experts, including members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. Fox News and Facebook jointly donated $1 million to Feeding America's COVID-19 Response fund. In partnership with NASCAR and with the NFL, FOX Sports donated to Feed The Children, the American Red Cross and Feeding America. FOX Sports and FOX News talent have taped special service -- public service announcements, encouraging viewers to stay home and to seek the latest guidance from the CDC. To date, we have broadcast nearly 30,000 COVID-19 PSAs. Our FOX Television stations have spearheaded charitable initiatives to assist their local communities from benefiting food banks and presenting on-air school lessons for students with limited access to technology. And an initiative I am particularly proud of is the preparation and delivery of 2,000 meals a day for the disabled community in Los Angeles by our Fox Studios foodservice staff. This gives us the dual benefit of keeping our amazing staff in work, while providing much needed support to the people of LA. We'll continue with many of these and other initiatives where we can be helpful. And I've asked each of our 8,000-plus employees to look for ways they can contribute to their community while working from home. At the same time, we're keeping a close eye on the evolving impact of the crisis on our business, adjusting the way we operate in the near-term, communicating with our partners and evaluating our longer-term models to ensure that we maintain the strength of Fox for the future. Clearly, we are not immune to the impact of COVID-19, and we acknowledge the continuing pandemic will influence our future financial results. The uncertain nature of the situation, however, makes it challenging for us to estimate the future performance of our business, particularly over the near to medium-term. So what has been the impact on our business to-date? At a macro level, sports events have been deferred and the production of certain entertainment content slated for the fall has been suspended. However, our activities around news have grown and intensified. Our local and national news ratings have been strong with FOX News ending the third quarter with its largest audience in history. We have seen this momentum accelerate into the current quarter with audience levels rising further, most notably in the younger student demos. This quarter so far has seen the network's adults 25 to 54 audience nearly double from prior year levels. This growth has not gone unnoticed by advertisers with new business coming to FOX News from clients looking to reach these younger demos or to transition dormant sports dollars to news or to present different marketing messages in light of the virus, thereby, mitigating most of the pullback in the categories that you would expect, such as auto, entertainment and retail. Categories that have moved spending into FOX News to reach our expanded and engaged audiences include insurance, fast-service restaurants, telecom, streaming and tech. Where the impact of the pandemic is most apparent in our business is at our local stations across the country, where despite viewership gains for our local news programming, fiscal fourth quarter advertising revenues are pacing down around 50% from year ago levels. The local auto, local retail, local travel, and local entertainment categories are leading this decline for us and the rest of the TV market -- local TV market. We'll only see the pattern of how these categories will return after states and municipalities open back up for business. On our last earnings call, I indicated that all signs pointed to a robust political ad cycle for our local markets. As a result of the contraction of the field of presidential candidates and the postponement of many state primaries due to the pandemic, we have seen a slowdown in the active political advertising spend that we saw in the third quarter. However, traditionally, the political campaign significantly ramped up spending in our first fiscal quarter, and we expect, with election day still six months away, that this category will intensify again as we approach November. Turning to sports, which accounts for over 40% of our total annual advertising revenue. Very little of this revenue has been affected so far by the shutdowns. Our sports revenue is concentrated in the fall when baseball's postseason and the college and NFL football seasons are most active. We're in close contact with all of our sports partners and know that they are being thoughtful around their scheduling decisions by prioritizing the health and safety of all of the personnel associated with their sport, their fans and their production partners like us. We'll look to them for their conclusions around when they will commence play. Whenever they are ready to start, we'll be ready to produce and to broadcast. Like the rest of America, we can't wait for the first pitch thrown, the first ball hiked and the roar of engines starting again. On the entertainment side, COVID-19 has caused the temporary cessation of nearly all program production in the industry. Regardless, Fox will enter the next broadcast year with a great deal of stability. This is partially because animation production has been less affected than live action, and we expect to return in the fall with all new seasons of The Simpsons, Bless The Harts, Bob's Burgers and Family Guy. Also slated for the fall, we have already completed new seasons of our Gordon Ramsey franchises, Hell's Kitchen, and MasterChef Junior, and have all new series finished and ready to go to air, including the psychological thriller, NeXt and the Southern gothic soap opera, Filthy Rich. At this time, should the conditions allow for it, we are planning for production in early August of Season 4 of The Masked Singer, which will target for a fall debut. We have also begun preparing new seasons of 9-1-1, 9-1-1: Lone Star, Prodigal Son and Lego Masters for mid-season launch dates. Given the uncertainty that our advertisers are facing in their own businesses, along with the potential variability in our programming schedule, you'll have noted the cancellation of our advertising Upfront, which would otherwise have taken place next Monday. Although, we will not be hosting this traditional event this year, we remain in constant dialogue with our advertising partners to ensure that we provide them with the flexibility needed to navigate these unprecedented times. Fox executives have been front and center with our clients, hosting video conferences to speak about the marketplace and the impact on their businesses. While the flexibility that we provide our partners will certainly be reflected in reduced advertising revenues in the current quarter, it is our priority to preserve these long-term relationships and do what we can to ensure the health and sustainability of their businesses and brands. Finally, as for distribution, we are pleased with increased viewing that we're delivering for our partners' video offerings and for our FOX-affiliated stations across the country. As it relates to pay TV subscribers, it's unclear so far of the impact of COVID-19 will materially alter recent trends. We know that a few major distributors have publicly expressed a bearish outlook for their video subs. And there will no doubt be recessionary economic pressures across a significant number of pay-TV households in the near term. These factors alone would likely exacerbate the recent trends in subscriber declines. But we also know from Nielsen Ratings that more people are consuming TV right now, particularly in the news category. And we know there is strong pent-up demand for live and event programming that is the cornerstone of our portfolio brands, beginning, for example, with the return of NASCAR in just 11 days. While the bias would have to lean toward near-term pressure on subscriber levels, how all of these factors interact and get reflected in subscriber numbers will become more clear as the year progresses. I'll wrap up my comments where I started. Fox is in a strong position to weather this turmoil. Our outsized exposure to news, a genre that should be less impacted than others and the timing of the sports that we broadcast has curbed the immediate impact on us so far. We entered this crisis in a position of financial strength and we remain well capitalized and highly liquid. Our steadfastly conservative financial management and our strong free cash flow profile underpin the company's balance sheet even with the uncertainty around the shape and pace of the economic recovery in the United States. As we emerge, Fox's focused collection of brands skewed heavily towards live and event programming will be even more in demand by advertisers and audiences alike. I am confident that we'll come out of this crisis as a stronger, more efficient and more agile company positioned for the future toward our continued goal of maximizing long-term shareholder value. And now, I'll turn the call over to Steve.\nSteve Tomsic: Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. Let me start with a brief summary of our third quarter results, before going on to discuss current trading conditions. As Lachlan mentioned earlier, Q3 was a clear demonstration of Fox's financial strength. The company reported total revenues of $3.44 billion, up 25% over the comparative period in fiscal 2019, reflecting revenue growth across all operating segments. Total company advertising revenues increased 44%, led by the broadcast of Super Bowl 54, while total company affiliate revenues increased 10%, demonstrating the strength of our brands and our focused portfolio of channels. We achieved double-digit affiliate revenue growth despite the rate of net subscriber declines of just over 5%. Quarterly EBITDA was $920 million, and notwithstanding the comparison to carve out financials in the prior year period still represented growth of 20% led by increases of the television and cable network programming segment, partially offset by the impact of corporate expenses at the other segment. The increase in these expenses reflects the full costs of Fox operating as a standalone public company in the current year versus the presentation of carve-out financial statement in the prior year quarter. From a bottom-line perspective, net income attributable to stockholders of $78 million or $0.13 a share was lower than the $529 million or $0.85 per share in the prior year quarter. This decline was primarily due to the change in fair value of the company's investments recognized in other net. Most notably, the book loss incurred following the sale of our stake in Roku in March. From an economic perspective, the Roku sale, which equated to nine times our initial investment, delivered a post-tax gain relative to initial cash investment of approximately $300 million and strategically allowed us to convert a minority shareholding into the full ownership of leading AVOD player Tubi. Excluding this impact and other non-core items, adjusted EPS of $0.93 was up significantly compared to last year's $0.76 per share, reflecting the growth in EBITDA, partially offset by higher net interest expense, which as we have flagged in the past, primarily reflects interest on the standalone debt structure of Fox versus the carve-out presentation in the prior year quarter. So now turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter, where cable EBITDA of $792 million was up 7% on revenue growth of 6%. As expected, we saw growth in cable affiliate revenues accelerate to 4%, as the impact of new distribution agreements and higher average rates across essentially all of our brands, was partially offset by the net decrease in pay television subscribers. This growth also reflects the launch of FOX News and Fox Business on Sling late last year. Cable advertising revenues increased 10%, led by results at FOX News Media, including the impact of higher ratings and continued strength in our digital sales, partially offset by high preemptions associated with breaking news coverage. Segment advertising growth was also impacted by fewer live NASCAR events at Fox Sports 1, due to the postponement of early season races as a result of COVID-19. Other cable revenues grew by $18 million, driven by contractual sports sublicensing revenues, primarily associated with college basketball content in the quarter. EBITDA at our cable segment increased 7% over the prior year, reflecting these higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses. FOX News Media costs were up in the quarter, due to coverage of the presidential primaries and continued digital investment in FOX Nation, which were partially offset in the segment by lower programming rights amortization of Fox Sports 1 from fewer live NASCAR events. The quarter also included one-time costs at FOX Sports and FOX News Media related to the production of shoulder programming leading up to the broadcast of Super Bowl 54. The Television segment reported EBITDA of $224 million, an increase of $125 million over the prior year quarter on revenue growth of 41%. The revenue growth was led by a 56% increase in television advertising revenues, including the impact across our network and stations from Super Bowl Sunday. Excluding the impact of the Super Bowl and the impact of one less NFL divisional playoff game compared to the prior year, advertising revenues would have been up 1%, primarily due to strong CPM growth for FOX Network and higher political advertising revenues at the Fox Television Stations. These were partially offset by the impact of COVID-19 on our local stations during the closing weeks of the quarter. Television affiliate revenues increased 22% in the period, reflecting double-digit increases for both our programming fees from non-owned station affiliates and direct retransmission revenues at our owned and operated stations. EBITDA at our Television segment increased $125 million over the prior year, reflecting these higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses. The increase in expenses was driven by programming rights amortization and production and costs associated with the broadcast of Super Bowl 54, partially offset by the impact of the rotating NFL divisional playoff game and prior year programming write-downs. Similar to our second quarter, we continued to make investments in programming, which included our first year of WWE content, the expansion of original entertainment programming and our participation in coproduction arrangements with third-party studios. Finally, from a P&L perspective, the net EBITDA loss in our other segment amounted to $96 million, which reflects the full quarter of stand-alone cost, as opposed to the carve-out basis of presentation in the corresponding quarter of the prior year. We still expect the net EBITDA loss in our other segment to be in the mid to high $300 million range for the full fiscal year. Turning now to cash flow. As expected, our free cash flow generation in the quarter of more than $1.5 billion was strong, supported by the collection of advertising revenues from our fall programming and the fact that our sports rights payments were concentrated in prior quarters. As a reminder, we calculate free cash flow as net cash used in operating activity, plus cash invested in property, plant and equipment. As part of our balanced approach to capital allocation, in March, we closed on the previously announced Nexstar Television stations transaction at a net purchase price of approximately $300 million. We also generated net proceeds of approximately $340 million from the sale of our stake in Roku, which was earmarked from the acquisition of Tubi for approximately $445 million in net cash consideration at closing last month. During the quarter, we purchased 3.9 million Class A and 2.9 million Class B shares for $173 million. Against our buyback authorization of $2 billion, we have now cumulatively repurchased $600 million, representing nearly 3% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in November. Given the current uncertain economic conditions, we have not bought back shares since the onset of the crisis. From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $3.2 billion in cash and $6.8 billion in debt. Since then, out of an abundance of caution, we took the opportunity to add to our already strong liquidity position by raising $1.2 billion of five-year and 10-year notes in April, which was significantly oversubscribed. The weighted average cost of this new issuance was approximately 3.3%, thereby making it attractive from a cost perspective to essentially prefund our $750 million maturity due in January 2022. So with the combined benefits of strong free cash flow and liquidity, moderate leverage and the absence of any debt maturity for almost two years, we face the challenges of COVID-19 from a position of financial strength. As Lachlan mentioned, while we are very proud of the operational and the financial results that we have achieved, we're acutely aware of the impact of COVID-19 and the challenges it presents to all of our businesses and all of our stakeholders. We note that there are a number of moving variables, among them the outlook for the gradual reopening of the economy, the timing in the return of sporting events and the evolution of the upfront advertising cycle that make it difficult to forecast our business beyond the very short term. As such, our commentary today will focus only on our fiscal fourth quarter and only on advertising revenues, which is where we are seeing the most significant impact to our business. The most immediate impact has been on advertising revenue at our local television stations, where inventory is sold essentially on a spot basis and many of our advertising partners operate in sectors most displaced by COVID-19. If pacing continues at current levels, we would expect our local advertising to be down by approximately 50% as against prior year. Meanwhile, our News and Entertainment businesses are expected to be more insulated in the immediate term. News is being supported by strong ratings, the growth of its digital properties, the category mix of its core advertisers, along with the new advertising clients it is attracting that help partially offset decline from the legacy advertising base. At Entertainment, we are already substantially through the broadcast season with our advertising revenues well supported by inventory that was sold during last year's upfront and until recently, a strong scatter market. So before we get to our Sports business, the collective Q4 impact of weaker advertising demand at our local TV stations, national news, and Entertainment businesses is anticipated to be around $200 million to $240 million or 25% to 30% compared to prior year. Across these businesses, we do not anticipate COVID-19 having a meaningful impact on Q4 costs. Now turning to our Sports business, where uncertainty around schedule makes it impossible to forecast top line impact. However, it is worth pointing out that we typically amortize the associated rights fees and production expenses on our P&L when the games or events actually air on our networks. So from a bottom line perspective, advertising revenues from events being postponed is often offset by the P&L expense benefit of not having the rights cost. Although these uncertainties make it challenging for us to estimate the future performance of our businesses, as Lachlan mentioned in his our financial results to illustrate, the company entered this crisis in a position of operating and financial strength. We will continue to manage our business and balance sheet in a disciplined and conservative manner so that we emerge as well positioned as possible to take advantage of opportunities during the recovery. And with that, I'd now like to turn the call back to Joe.\nJoe Dorrego: Thank you, Steve. And now we'd be happy to take questions from the investment community.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] It looks like our first question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Ehrlich of Bank of America.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Great. Thank you. So my multipart, one question. I've always said you're a super nimble company, very entrepreneurial. And out of all of this, maybe there's some opportunity. I'm just wondering if you're thinking about longer-term changes in your business where you can find more efficiencies? And then more immediately, what can you say in terms of sports? Well, I mean, WWE is still on. Can you talk about what the ratings have been and what the advertising has been? I'm just wondering sports without fans, does it change the demand in advertising? NFL is supposed to announce their schedule tomorrow. Do you think that will impact the advertising demand? Thank you.\nLachlan Murdoch: Yes. Thanks, Jessica. Let me answer both of those questions. Thank you. There were two questions, I think. There are variations of one, but I'll answer them both, and I appreciate them both. So in terms of efficiencies, I think what we have -- because we are in such a strong position, we haven't looked at how we drive efficiencies in terms of a specific COVID-19 impact. Our employees are fully engaged in running each of their businesses. Our businesses are all fully operational. And as you know, when we separated from Disney, we went through a process at that time of really creating what we felt was a very efficient platform from which to go forward. Having said that, we've looked at how we produce sports, how we produce news, how we operate as a team, many of our corporate functions. And we've learned the lessons from telecommuting, working in more flexible and more innovative ways. And we think, absolutely, going forward, there are significant ways we can be more efficient and more agile as a company, as I mentioned in my earlier comments. So there is a process we're working through. It's a process we're working through before COVID-19. And we certainly see that there's opportunities there. From a sports perspective, look we're very pleased, obviously, with the return of NASCAR on May 17. We've seen a very strong demand from our clients to be associated with and to market within that race and within future races. So we're very pleased with what we see from an advertiser demand. We have worked, I should say, with our clients over the last six weeks -- incredibly closely, engaged through -- not physically closely, but digitally closely, engaged in literally hundreds of teleconferences. We're taking them through the marketplace, having us understand the impact of COVID-19 on their businesses and how we can help them as we come out of this health crisis going forward. That process is now evolving where we can now have much more specific conversations with them, particularly about the fall. We're pleased that the NFL will be releasing their schedule 8 o\u2019clock tomorrow night Eastern Time. That obviously gives us a trigger to be much more specific in our conversations with our clients. But we are seeing tremendous pent-up demand for sports programming and live event programming. As for the WWE, I have to give a shout out to the WWE. They have done a tremendous job delivering us live content, week in, week out, under very difficult circumstances. And we're very appreciative of them for it. So thank you, Jessica.\nJoe Dorrego: Operator, we can go to the next question.\nOperator: Next in queue is the line of Ben Swinburne, Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. \nBen Swinburne: Thank you. Good afternoon. It's -- I think it was a year ago you had your Investor Day, which feels like 10 years ago at this point. But I wanted to ask you about a couple of things that you guys focused on then. One was the outlook for retransmission revenues, which is obviously a key driver of growth for the business. And I was curious, just given how much the ecosystem has evolved since then, if you continue to be confident you can deliver on those expectations, realizing that the world has changed quite a bit. And then secondly, I can't remember, John, how you phrased it, but something to the effect of, we're going to be cautious with buybacks and conservative with our balance sheet, sort of, for a rainy day or for a change in the cycle and be opportunistic. And we've certainly arrived at that point, I think you would agree. I'm just curious how you think about using your balance sheet, which is a strategic advantage in times like this to continue to sort of reinvent the company as you look out over time.\nLachlan Murdoch: So Ben, let me address the first part of the question, and John and Steve can address the second question. From a retransmission perspective, we remain 100% confident that we can achieve our goal, which we announced at the Investor Day, which you're right, does feel like 10 years ago. I'm sure we all have a few more gray hairs. And to remind people, I think, everyone was there, but that goal was to achieve an additional $1 billion in affiliate revenue by calendar 2022. And we are -- we believe we are on track to achieve that goal. John, I'll pass it over to you for the second question.\nJohn Nallen: Thanks, Lachlan. And thanks, Ben. The -- no, you're right. We've always viewed and have particularly viewed, with the birth of Fox Corporation, our balance sheet to be a true strategic asset of the company. But the balance sheet really reflects -- the strength of the balance sheet reflects the strength of the operations of the company. And I think, fundamentally, that's what you have to look at first is how strong the businesses are. It does give us optionality as we look longer term. But I think all the comments Lachlan made and Steve made in the near-term, with the amount of uncertainty around, we're really just focused on the strength -- the operating strength of the business. As Steve said, we paused the buyback once the pandemic hit. And I think we're just going to be cautious here for a little while and know that we have this strategic asset to continue to build the company.\nJoe Dorrego: Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Comes from the line of Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. \nMichael Nathanson: Thanks. I have two. So one is on Tubi. I was just interested in the rationale for you guys to do it. And where do you think you can add the most value? It seems like -- there's a lot of library content on there, and you guys are mostly a live-producing company. So I'd love to hear about where you see you can create value for Tubi. And then secondly, I think, Lachlan, on the last call you mentioned that you guys were still -- were talking to the NFL about a new renewal from next contract. I wonder if those discussions continue and if any of the data points you see of the quarter to come maybe give you some pause to hold on and to doing the deal until you see maybe light at the end of the tunnel in terms of what trends will emerge post-COVID? Thanks.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks, Michael. So two good questions, and we could talk about them for hours. But on Tubi, Tubi gives us tremendous reach. And we've talked before about our direct-to-consumer strategy. We were very pleased with both our kind of authenticated strategy through FOX NOW. It's obviously an authenticated platform for our product but also with the strength and the growth in FOX Nation. I should say FOX Nation has had I think April was the second-strongest month for FOX Nation, and it continues, which is interesting as it gets bigger, to achieve an over-80% conversion rate from free trialists into paying subscribers. So, the consumers of FOX Nation are absolutely enjoying and paying for that product as it grows. So -- and we've talked before about Fox Bet and Credible as a part of our direct-to-consumer strategy. But as far as Tubi goes, we feel that we are not getting back into the entertainment production -- original production business through Tubi. We see our existing slate of brands as being very important to the growth of Tubi. What we can do both through the entertainment network and its content, you can see today. The number one television show on Tubi is The Marked Singer and is driving a lot of important viewership and advertising impressions. And what we can do with sports and news and our local stations in the future, we think, is very exciting. So, Tubi is a great business. It's grown 150% year-on-year in terms of video hours viewed, but we can make it an even greater business. And we're getting to know the team, and we like them a lot. We think they're going to do great things. So -- but it is important that it's our brands, and Tubi's distribution, I think, is going to really be very exciting. On the NFL, obviously, COVID-19, we haven't been able to sit down across the table with the NFL to discuss their future plans and the renewal of our deals. We have been in contact with the NFL every day about a whole range of other things. So we remain very close to them. There's nothing that we see in the marketplace today that makes us feel any differently about the value of our partnership with the NFL. They've been a tremendous partner of ours for over 25 years. And we've built our business as they've built theirs, and we look forward to that continuing for many years to come.\nOperator: Next we have the line of Alexia Quadrani of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you, very much. I just want to follow up on your comments about the upfront market. I understand the process is very different this year, and there's a tremendous amount of flexibility. But do you believe there will be some upfront markets that will occur, meaning that advertisers will be willing to make commitments for the fall and for next year? And I guess when you look at Fox's portfolio, sports being such a big component of it, do you feel that they will remain on the sidelines until you do get better visibility on that front? I know you mentioned having the line of games coming out soon will be helpful, but is it enough to sort of get them to kind of make these commitments?\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks, Alexia. So, as I mentioned before, I think with Jessica's question, we've been fully engaged with our clients and ad agencies over the last six weeks. We don't see that changing. We don't see a virtual singular upfront as the right thing to do today because all of our clients are affected by COVID-19 in different ways. And they will all emerge from their COVID-19 impacts in different ways. So for example, our retail clients or our auto clients will emerge from COVID-19 in a very different way from, say, our financial services or insurance clients. Entertainment will be very different from telecom or professional services. And so it's important for us as we've engaged with them to understand what their needs are and to tailor our partnership with them in very unique and specific ways, and that will continue. Obviously, there are triggers to those conversations, such as the NFL schedule being released, such as NASCAR being back on air, on the track. And those are exciting milestones. But we'll continue to work closely with each of our clients and work to their specific needs to work them into our schedule. I think one of the key things to remember, Alexia, is, aside from the sports schedule, which is starting to take shape, our entertainment schedule in the fall looks incredibly stable, really thanks to a large amount of our programming already being filmed and edited and phrase in the can. The only open question in our fall entertainment schedule is whether we get Masked Singer back into production in time for a fall schedule or for a mid-season schedule. The rest of our schedule and by the way, I should mention, I think I did in my earlier comments, the fact that animation is virtually -- the production schedule of our animation is virtually untouched, knock on wood, by COVID-19 has been a great boon to us. So we are very confident and pleased that we have a strong entertainment schedule in the fall. Now this, of course, the elephant in the room is the tremendous ratings of news. Our news ratings are the strongest they've ever been. The demographics within those ratings within that viewership is younger and as attractive as it's ever been, and we're very pleased with that. So it's not just about sports, sports coming back, but it's about news and entertainment that we are very confident, and we'll have a strong quarter.\nJoe Dorrego: Operator, we can go to the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Next we have a question from the line of Doug Mitchelson, Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thanks very much. I guess the first question is jump ball. Has this environment impacted making any new investments in entertainment programming? And how does the accounting work for the programs that you're bringing back? I believe you booked them on a cash basis last year when you made the investments. Now that they're returning for second seasons and they've been successful, does that have any implications for downstream revenues that you start to book or cash you start to receive? And the second question, Lachlan, I was going to ask, it seems like you have an idiosyncratic mix of acquisitions to-date, and what should we expect next in terms of M&A? And it's interesting because you strung three together as part of a direct-to-consumer strategy. So either way, whether it's an idiosyncratic mix or whether it's actually targeted to a specific strategy, any thoughts on what's next for M&A would be helpful. Thank you.\nLachlan Murdoch: Doug, let me start with the first half of your first question, and then I can go to your second question. I'll let Steve answer the accounting of it, but the impact of any new investments in entertainment in terms of how we look at -- as I mentioned, the production today is effectively shut down globally. How we plan for new seasons and new shows, which we are excited about, whether for really for the fall sorry, not for the fall, for mid-season or for next year, there's been no sort of disruption in how -- in our development cycle in terms of new shows and new IP. One thing that's been occurring behind the scenes all the time is virtual riders rooms and virtual development where people don't have to be on an expensive movie studio a lot. For example, all of that work is continuing behind the scenes, which has been positive to see.\nSteve Tomsic: Yes. And Doug, just picking up on the accounting and just, we called out -- just going back to the Investor Day, again, we called out $200 million to $250 million of programming investments, and we're on pace to be in that range for the full year. So I think we'll spend close to sort of $170 million of that so far in the first three quarters of the year. So we're still on pace, and as Lachlan mentioned, continue to look at how we invest in that going forward. The accounting won't change for us in terms of the amort of entertainment programming, which we generally sort of go through on first run. So there'll be no changes on amortization.\nLachlan Murdoch: And then as to the idiosyncratic investment or M&A, the -- look, I think you can put it into two different categories. One is expanding our existing strength on our existing base. So for example, if I look at Tubi and I think of the digital video impressions that they garner us, we can both strengthen Tubi from a content point of view, and we can strengthen them from an ad sales point of view. They benefit tremendously from the association with us. We think it's a tremendous acquisition that really plays to Fox strengths. But it's doing what we do today. It's putting with new technologies and advertising video-on-demand basis, puts our content in front of new markets with greater reach and gives more opportunity for our advertisers. So it's perhaps a simple strategy, but we think one that's really very exciting for us. So one bucket is the businesses that are in our wheelhouse. They're expanding what we already do in an exciting way. The other, which you can put Credible and Fox Bet into those categories is how do we look at businesses that -- where we can monetize our existing audiences in different ways. So not so when you look at our revenues today, our revenue is equally split roughly between advertising and affiliate revenue to grow new revenue streams, less reliant on those two is an important goal of ours. Credible, we're incredibly excited. It's doubled in size over last year. Doubled its loan volumes and doubled its revenue. And Fox Bet had an incredible Super Bowl. Obviously, since COVID-19, there's less sports being played. But I should say that part of that acquisition was an equity stake in TSG, which has done rather well with the merger with Flutter, which I should congratulate Peter Jackson for, which closed on Monday. So, those businesses are really about getting -- those best strategies are really about getting into new businesses, based upon our existing audiences and serving our existing audiences in new ways.\nJoe Dorrego: Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Our last question will come from the line of John Janedis, Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Mr. Janedis, your line is open here for us.\nJoe Dorrego: I think we go to the next question. Operator: Come from the line of Steven Cahall, Wells Fargo. Your line is open Sir.\nSteven Cahall: Thank you. So maybe just first, you talked about the TV station pacing of around down 50%. As we've come through the current quarter, have you seen any sequential improvement that makes you think that, that down 50% isn't going to repeat again in the next quarter? And I know, that's a bit of a call on how reopening looks but just wondering if you're seeing that down 50% start to improve as parts of the economy start to reopen at this point and then, just a quick follow-up on political.\nLachlan Murdoch: So on the -- let me talk sort of broadly over local and national. I don't want to per plate too because they're obviously different. But clearly, when we talk about our projections for a 50% reduction in local advertising, that's a mix of all sorts of different categories, right? The categories that you would expect are being affected significantly worse by COVID-19, they're pacing below -- or say, worse than 50% below. So travel, entertainment, restaurants are all pacing worse than 50%. But that's ameliorated by many categories that are down significantly less than that. Professional services, insurance and some categories frankly that, are up like pharmaceutical. So, it's a real mix. Again, as we said before, we can't really say from a local perspective, how local markets are going to recover. It will be state by state as various states and municipalities lift their shelter-at-home orders. But we are beginning to see positive signs in the pacing going forward. Over the last two weeks -- now, I'm not talking including national, over the last couple weeks we have seen a severe lessening of requests for flexibility with advertising. I think people -- advertisers and marketers are starting to look forward into the first quarter of next fiscal year and are beginning to think about how they market and get their products and their brands in front of our consumers again. So, we're just -- its early days, but we're just beginning to see that positive shift. As to political advertising, despite the impact of COVID-19 in the last couple weeks of the third quarter, the third quarter still was a record political year for us -- sorry, quarter for us -- the third quarter for us. Fourth quarter always is a trough, as the advertising start -- political advertising starts to pick up again in the first fiscal quarter of the next fiscal year. So we expect that trend to continue. We expect the political advertising to ramp up in the first quarter of the next fiscal year. And we believe we are still on track for a record political season. The reason we say that is, if you look at our markets. Obviously, it's going to be a hard-fought election. We have nine of our 18 markets or about half our markets are battleground states, including Arizona, Florida, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, to some extent also Georgia, Michigan and Minnesota. Ten of our markets have U.S. Senate races. I won't list them all. And two of our markets have gubernatorial races. Of course, the House has contests in every market. So we think, our markets are -- I wouldn't say fortuitously, but are certainly positioned well to capture, a lion's share of the political revenue really in the first quarter of the next fiscal year. Thank you.\nJoe Dorrego: At this point, we're out of time. But if you have any further questions, please give me or Dan Carey a call. Thank you once again for joining today's call.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Lachlan Murdoch",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We are living through extraordinary times. Since we last all spoke together, who would have imagined our lives could have all been turned so upside down. The impact of COVID-19 has impacted our economy, our businesses, our colleagues and ourselves. We owe deep gratitude to the nurses, doctors, police, teachers, aged care workers, volunteers and countless other front-line workers for their incredible and brave sacrifices. At Fox, we thank every one of them. Their work humbles ours. We have spent these last few months protecting the health of our employees; providing essential news, information and entertainment to our communities; all while bolstering the strength of our company in order to best tackle the challenges ahead. At the outset, let me say that, if there is anything you take away from my remarks today, it should be that Fox is in a strong position to deal with the impact of this pandemic. Our strength was clearly demonstrated in the quarter, which was only partially impacted by the pandemic and is illustrative of the outstanding results Fox delivers in unaffected cycles. The strength of Fox has also been on display in the weeks since the end of the quarter as we navigate these unprecedented times to continue to provide our services to communities across the country. Starting with a review of our third quarter, you will have seen that we delivered exceptional financial results, achieving revenue and EBITDA growth of 25% and 20%, respectively, adjusted earnings per share growth of 22%, and generating over $1.5 billion of free cash flow. Our revenue growth was multipronged. It feels like a lifetime ago, but as a reminder, the quarter began with our record-breaking broadcast of Super Bowl 54, where we generated around $600 million of gross revenue across the company. But the strength in the quarter extended well beyond the Super Bowl. Local advertising at the FOX Television stations grew by over 20% as Super Bowl revenues were supplemented with over $35 million of gross political ad revenues in the quarter. At FOX News, advertising revenues grew by 15%, led by a 45% increase in digital ad revenues. And we had another strong affiliate quarter with total company affiliate revenues growing by 10%, despite a touch over 5% reduction in pay-TV subscribers. Steve will cover the details of our financial results shortly. Operationally, the quarter saw FOX News and FOX Business deliver their largest audiences in each network's history with FOX News ratings up approximately 40% year-on-year. The success of FOX News Media's brands extended beyond their linear properties, FOX News Digital achieved its highest quarter ever across all KPIs, including over 11 billion digital page views. Company-wide digital reach grew 42%, while digital engagement nearly doubled year-on-year. Elsewhere on screens, the quarter brought us another successful season of The Masked Singer and the number one new broadcast reality series, the family-friendly hit, Lego Masters, two shows that we hope will shape the Fox Network lineup for years to come. While still early days, our strategy to leverage the cross-promotional power of our platform to support shows we have an ownership interest in is showing encouraging results. Bless The Harts was the number one new comedy and adds another leg to our Sunday Animation Block, while Prodigal Son was the second highest-rated new scripted drama on television. Locally, the FOX television stations continued the expansion of their news coverage, adding an additional five hours per week across Atlanta and Los Angeles. The stations' unified programming strategy drove ratings growth in essentially every day part, including daytime and late news. Corporately, during the past quarter, we completed important transactions to support the ongoing growth and momentum of FOX. Among them were, the closing of our agreement with Nexstar, in which we expanded our local market footprint through the acquisition of key stations in Seattle and Milwaukee, and the transfer of our Charlotte stations to them; the early renewal of our distribution agreement with one of our largest partners, Comcast, and our full portfolio of channels; and the announcement and subsequent closing of our acquisition of Tubi, which immediately expands our direct to consumer capabilities and provides our advertisers with even more opportunities to reach audiences at great scale. Coupled with combined power of Fox's existing networks, Tubi provides a substantial base from which we will drive long-term growth in the direct to consumer market. As an example of the scale, in April, Tubi generated total viewing time of over 200 million hours, which is up more than 150% versus prior year. This was also the first full quarter reflecting the results of Credible, our digital loan marketplace business. And while we are only just at the beginning of exploring the marketing synergies between Fox and Credible, the business has had a great quarter, doubling its closed loan volume and revenue year-on-year. Overall, the financial and operating results through the first nine months of the year confirms just how sturdy our business is and demonstrates the power and importance of our live sports, news and event programming to our partners and our audiences. Of course, our achievements have been rightly overshadowed by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, and by the challenges it has presented to all of the company's stakeholders, including our colleagues, the communities we serve, our business partners and our shareholders. We understand our responsibility to each stakeholder and are mindful of them in the balanced actions we are taking to address the crisis. As I mentioned earlier, our main priority remains the health, safety and well-being of our more than 8,000 colleagues. We continue to follow federal, state and local guidelines when it comes to our workforce in our locations across the U.S. Those whose job functions allow it have been working remotely since mid-March. And we have over 70% of our employees offsite at the moment. We are grateful to those essential employees, whose jobs remain -- require them to work onsite for their commitment and for their resolve. We have taken actions to protect and ensure the well-being of these employees, particularly for those that are out in the community informing the country of every aspect of the pandemic at a national and local level. While taking steps to keep our colleagues safe, we also continue to provide our viewers with the information they seek to better understand this pandemic on a national and local basis. In this spirit, we swiftly launched coronavirusnow.com, a free to use website featuring the latest news about the pandemic. Drawing on our news gathering and digital capabilities across the country, bolstered by third party content from government and health organizations, such as the Center for Disease Control, we've created the site to provide our employees, viewers and communities with reliable up to date information about this public health issue. Over 1.3 million Americans have accessed these specific resources. It's a wonderful example of the breadth of Fox coming together to provide a public service to our audiences at a critical time and in a new and distinctive way. Further, working with our distribution partners to ensure that all Americans could receive the latest national and local news regarding coronavirus, we offered free access to the FOX News channel and FOX Television stations, starting in mid-March and continuing for over a month. We are doing impactful work across our platforms to inform our viewers and to give back to our audiences. Fox raised over $13 million for Feeding America and the First Responders Children's Foundation, through our broadcast of Fox Presents the iHeart Living Room Concert for America, which paid tribute to the brave medical professionals and local heroes who are working on so many aspects of the pandemic. In early April, Fox News and Facebook co-hosted a coronavirus town hall, featuring medical and business experts, including members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. Fox News and Facebook jointly donated $1 million to Feeding America's COVID-19 Response fund. In partnership with NASCAR and with the NFL, FOX Sports donated to Feed The Children, the American Red Cross and Feeding America. FOX Sports and FOX News talent have taped special service -- public service announcements, encouraging viewers to stay home and to seek the latest guidance from the CDC. To date, we have broadcast nearly 30,000 COVID-19 PSAs. Our FOX Television stations have spearheaded charitable initiatives to assist their local communities from benefiting food banks and presenting on-air school lessons for students with limited access to technology. And an initiative I am particularly proud of is the preparation and delivery of 2,000 meals a day for the disabled community in Los Angeles by our Fox Studios foodservice staff. This gives us the dual benefit of keeping our amazing staff in work, while providing much needed support to the people of LA. We'll continue with many of these and other initiatives where we can be helpful. And I've asked each of our 8,000-plus employees to look for ways they can contribute to their community while working from home. At the same time, we're keeping a close eye on the evolving impact of the crisis on our business, adjusting the way we operate in the near-term, communicating with our partners and evaluating our longer-term models to ensure that we maintain the strength of Fox for the future. Clearly, we are not immune to the impact of COVID-19, and we acknowledge the continuing pandemic will influence our future financial results. The uncertain nature of the situation, however, makes it challenging for us to estimate the future performance of our business, particularly over the near to medium-term. So what has been the impact on our business to-date? At a macro level, sports events have been deferred and the production of certain entertainment content slated for the fall has been suspended. However, our activities around news have grown and intensified. Our local and national news ratings have been strong with FOX News ending the third quarter with its largest audience in history. We have seen this momentum accelerate into the current quarter with audience levels rising further, most notably in the younger student demos. This quarter so far has seen the network's adults 25 to 54 audience nearly double from prior year levels. This growth has not gone unnoticed by advertisers with new business coming to FOX News from clients looking to reach these younger demos or to transition dormant sports dollars to news or to present different marketing messages in light of the virus, thereby, mitigating most of the pullback in the categories that you would expect, such as auto, entertainment and retail. Categories that have moved spending into FOX News to reach our expanded and engaged audiences include insurance, fast-service restaurants, telecom, streaming and tech. Where the impact of the pandemic is most apparent in our business is at our local stations across the country, where despite viewership gains for our local news programming, fiscal fourth quarter advertising revenues are pacing down around 50% from year ago levels. The local auto, local retail, local travel, and local entertainment categories are leading this decline for us and the rest of the TV market -- local TV market. We'll only see the pattern of how these categories will return after states and municipalities open back up for business. On our last earnings call, I indicated that all signs pointed to a robust political ad cycle for our local markets. As a result of the contraction of the field of presidential candidates and the postponement of many state primaries due to the pandemic, we have seen a slowdown in the active political advertising spend that we saw in the third quarter. However, traditionally, the political campaign significantly ramped up spending in our first fiscal quarter, and we expect, with election day still six months away, that this category will intensify again as we approach November. Turning to sports, which accounts for over 40% of our total annual advertising revenue. Very little of this revenue has been affected so far by the shutdowns. Our sports revenue is concentrated in the fall when baseball's postseason and the college and NFL football seasons are most active. We're in close contact with all of our sports partners and know that they are being thoughtful around their scheduling decisions by prioritizing the health and safety of all of the personnel associated with their sport, their fans and their production partners like us. We'll look to them for their conclusions around when they will commence play. Whenever they are ready to start, we'll be ready to produce and to broadcast. Like the rest of America, we can't wait for the first pitch thrown, the first ball hiked and the roar of engines starting again. On the entertainment side, COVID-19 has caused the temporary cessation of nearly all program production in the industry. Regardless, Fox will enter the next broadcast year with a great deal of stability. This is partially because animation production has been less affected than live action, and we expect to return in the fall with all new seasons of The Simpsons, Bless The Harts, Bob's Burgers and Family Guy. Also slated for the fall, we have already completed new seasons of our Gordon Ramsey franchises, Hell's Kitchen, and MasterChef Junior, and have all new series finished and ready to go to air, including the psychological thriller, NeXt and the Southern gothic soap opera, Filthy Rich. At this time, should the conditions allow for it, we are planning for production in early August of Season 4 of The Masked Singer, which will target for a fall debut. We have also begun preparing new seasons of 9-1-1, 9-1-1: Lone Star, Prodigal Son and Lego Masters for mid-season launch dates. Given the uncertainty that our advertisers are facing in their own businesses, along with the potential variability in our programming schedule, you'll have noted the cancellation of our advertising Upfront, which would otherwise have taken place next Monday. Although, we will not be hosting this traditional event this year, we remain in constant dialogue with our advertising partners to ensure that we provide them with the flexibility needed to navigate these unprecedented times. Fox executives have been front and center with our clients, hosting video conferences to speak about the marketplace and the impact on their businesses. While the flexibility that we provide our partners will certainly be reflected in reduced advertising revenues in the current quarter, it is our priority to preserve these long-term relationships and do what we can to ensure the health and sustainability of their businesses and brands. Finally, as for distribution, we are pleased with increased viewing that we're delivering for our partners' video offerings and for our FOX-affiliated stations across the country. As it relates to pay TV subscribers, it's unclear so far of the impact of COVID-19 will materially alter recent trends. We know that a few major distributors have publicly expressed a bearish outlook for their video subs. And there will no doubt be recessionary economic pressures across a significant number of pay-TV households in the near term. These factors alone would likely exacerbate the recent trends in subscriber declines. But we also know from Nielsen Ratings that more people are consuming TV right now, particularly in the news category. And we know there is strong pent-up demand for live and event programming that is the cornerstone of our portfolio brands, beginning, for example, with the return of NASCAR in just 11 days. While the bias would have to lean toward near-term pressure on subscriber levels, how all of these factors interact and get reflected in subscriber numbers will become more clear as the year progresses. I'll wrap up my comments where I started. Fox is in a strong position to weather this turmoil. Our outsized exposure to news, a genre that should be less impacted than others and the timing of the sports that we broadcast has curbed the immediate impact on us so far. We entered this crisis in a position of financial strength and we remain well capitalized and highly liquid. Our steadfastly conservative financial management and our strong free cash flow profile underpin the company's balance sheet even with the uncertainty around the shape and pace of the economic recovery in the United States. As we emerge, Fox's focused collection of brands skewed heavily towards live and event programming will be even more in demand by advertisers and audiences alike. I am confident that we'll come out of this crisis as a stronger, more efficient and more agile company positioned for the future toward our continued goal of maximizing long-term shareholder value. And now, I'll turn the call over to Steve. Yes. Thanks, Jessica. Let me answer both of those questions. Thank you. There were two questions, I think. There are variations of one, but I'll answer them both, and I appreciate them both. So in terms of efficiencies, I think what we have -- because we are in such a strong position, we haven't looked at how we drive efficiencies in terms of a specific COVID-19 impact. Our employees are fully engaged in running each of their businesses. Our businesses are all fully operational. And as you know, when we separated from Disney, we went through a process at that time of really creating what we felt was a very efficient platform from which to go forward. Having said that, we've looked at how we produce sports, how we produce news, how we operate as a team, many of our corporate functions. And we've learned the lessons from telecommuting, working in more flexible and more innovative ways. And we think, absolutely, going forward, there are significant ways we can be more efficient and more agile as a company, as I mentioned in my earlier comments. So there is a process we're working through. It's a process we're working through before COVID-19. And we certainly see that there's opportunities there. From a sports perspective, look we're very pleased, obviously, with the return of NASCAR on May 17. We've seen a very strong demand from our clients to be associated with and to market within that race and within future races. So we're very pleased with what we see from an advertiser demand. We have worked, I should say, with our clients over the last six weeks -- incredibly closely, engaged through -- not physically closely, but digitally closely, engaged in literally hundreds of teleconferences. We're taking them through the marketplace, having us understand the impact of COVID-19 on their businesses and how we can help them as we come out of this health crisis going forward. That process is now evolving where we can now have much more specific conversations with them, particularly about the fall. We're pleased that the NFL will be releasing their schedule 8 o'clock tomorrow night Eastern Time. That obviously gives us a trigger to be much more specific in our conversations with our clients. But we are seeing tremendous pent-up demand for sports programming and live event programming. As for the WWE, I have to give a shout out to the WWE. They have done a tremendous job delivering us live content, week in, week out, under very difficult circumstances. And we're very appreciative of them for it. So thank you, Jessica. So Ben, let me address the first part of the question, and John and Steve can address the second question. From a retransmission perspective, we remain 100% confident that we can achieve our goal, which we announced at the Investor Day, which you're right, does feel like 10 years ago. I'm sure we all have a few more gray hairs. And to remind people, I think, everyone was there, but that goal was to achieve an additional $1 billion in affiliate revenue by calendar 2022. And we are -- we believe we are on track to achieve that goal. John, I'll pass it over to you for the second question. Thanks, Michael. So two good questions, and we could talk about them for hours. But on Tubi, Tubi gives us tremendous reach. And we've talked before about our direct-to-consumer strategy. We were very pleased with both our kind of authenticated strategy through FOX NOW. It's obviously an authenticated platform for our product but also with the strength and the growth in FOX Nation. I should say FOX Nation has had I think April was the second-strongest month for FOX Nation, and it continues, which is interesting as it gets bigger, to achieve an over-80% conversion rate from free trialists into paying subscribers. So, the consumers of FOX Nation are absolutely enjoying and paying for that product as it grows. So -- and we've talked before about Fox Bet and Credible as a part of our direct-to-consumer strategy. But as far as Tubi goes, we feel that we are not getting back into the entertainment production -- original production business through Tubi. We see our existing slate of brands as being very important to the growth of Tubi. What we can do both through the entertainment network and its content, you can see today. The number one television show on Tubi is The Marked Singer and is driving a lot of important viewership and advertising impressions. And what we can do with sports and news and our local stations in the future, we think, is very exciting. So, Tubi is a great business. It's grown 150% year-on-year in terms of video hours viewed, but we can make it an even greater business. And we're getting to know the team, and we like them a lot. We think they're going to do great things. So -- but it is important that it's our brands, and Tubi's distribution, I think, is going to really be very exciting. On the NFL, obviously, COVID-19, we haven't been able to sit down across the table with the NFL to discuss their future plans and the renewal of our deals. We have been in contact with the NFL every day about a whole range of other things. So we remain very close to them. There's nothing that we see in the marketplace today that makes us feel any differently about the value of our partnership with the NFL. They've been a tremendous partner of ours for over 25 years. And we've built our business as they've built theirs, and we look forward to that continuing for many years to come. Thanks, Alexia. So, as I mentioned before, I think with Jessica's question, we've been fully engaged with our clients and ad agencies over the last six weeks. We don't see that changing. We don't see a virtual singular upfront as the right thing to do today because all of our clients are affected by COVID-19 in different ways. And they will all emerge from their COVID-19 impacts in different ways. So for example, our retail clients or our auto clients will emerge from COVID-19 in a very different way from, say, our financial services or insurance clients. Entertainment will be very different from telecom or professional services. And so it's important for us as we've engaged with them to understand what their needs are and to tailor our partnership with them in very unique and specific ways, and that will continue. Obviously, there are triggers to those conversations, such as the NFL schedule being released, such as NASCAR being back on air, on the track. And those are exciting milestones. But we'll continue to work closely with each of our clients and work to their specific needs to work them into our schedule. I think one of the key things to remember, Alexia, is, aside from the sports schedule, which is starting to take shape, our entertainment schedule in the fall looks incredibly stable, really thanks to a large amount of our programming already being filmed and edited and phrase in the can. The only open question in our fall entertainment schedule is whether we get Masked Singer back into production in time for a fall schedule or for a mid-season schedule. The rest of our schedule and by the way, I should mention, I think I did in my earlier comments, the fact that animation is virtually -- the production schedule of our animation is virtually untouched, knock on wood, by COVID-19 has been a great boon to us. So we are very confident and pleased that we have a strong entertainment schedule in the fall. Now this, of course, the elephant in the room is the tremendous ratings of news. Our news ratings are the strongest they've ever been. The demographics within those ratings within that viewership is younger and as attractive as it's ever been, and we're very pleased with that. So it's not just about sports, sports coming back, but it's about news and entertainment that we are very confident, and we'll have a strong quarter. Doug, let me start with the first half of your first question, and then I can go to your second question. I'll let Steve answer the accounting of it, but the impact of any new investments in entertainment in terms of how we look at -- as I mentioned, the production today is effectively shut down globally. How we plan for new seasons and new shows, which we are excited about, whether for really for the fall sorry, not for the fall, for mid-season or for next year, there's been no sort of disruption in how -- in our development cycle in terms of new shows and new IP. One thing that's been occurring behind the scenes all the time is virtual riders rooms and virtual development where people don't have to be on an expensive movie studio a lot. For example, all of that work is continuing behind the scenes, which has been positive to see. And then as to the idiosyncratic investment or M&A, the -- look, I think you can put it into two different categories. One is expanding our existing strength on our existing base. So for example, if I look at Tubi and I think of the digital video impressions that they garner us, we can both strengthen Tubi from a content point of view, and we can strengthen them from an ad sales point of view. They benefit tremendously from the association with us. We think it's a tremendous acquisition that really plays to Fox strengths. But it's doing what we do today. It's putting with new technologies and advertising video-on-demand basis, puts our content in front of new markets with greater reach and gives more opportunity for our advertisers. So it's perhaps a simple strategy, but we think one that's really very exciting for us. So one bucket is the businesses that are in our wheelhouse. They're expanding what we already do in an exciting way. The other, which you can put Credible and Fox Bet into those categories is how do we look at businesses that -- where we can monetize our existing audiences in different ways. So not so when you look at our revenues today, our revenue is equally split roughly between advertising and affiliate revenue to grow new revenue streams, less reliant on those two is an important goal of ours. Credible, we're incredibly excited. It's doubled in size over last year. Doubled its loan volumes and doubled its revenue. And Fox Bet had an incredible Super Bowl. Obviously, since COVID-19, there's less sports being played. But I should say that part of that acquisition was an equity stake in TSG, which has done rather well with the merger with Flutter, which I should congratulate Peter Jackson for, which closed on Monday. So, those businesses are really about getting -- those best strategies are really about getting into new businesses, based upon our existing audiences and serving our existing audiences in new ways. So on the -- let me talk sort of broadly over local and national. I don't want to per plate too because they're obviously different. But clearly, when we talk about our projections for a 50% reduction in local advertising, that's a mix of all sorts of different categories, right? The categories that you would expect are being affected significantly worse by COVID-19, they're pacing below -- or say, worse than 50% below. So travel, entertainment, restaurants are all pacing worse than 50%. But that's ameliorated by many categories that are down significantly less than that. Professional services, insurance and some categories frankly that, are up like pharmaceutical. So, it's a real mix. Again, as we said before, we can't really say from a local perspective, how local markets are going to recover. It will be state by state as various states and municipalities lift their shelter-at-home orders. But we are beginning to see positive signs in the pacing going forward. Over the last two weeks -- now, I'm not talking including national, over the last couple weeks we have seen a severe lessening of requests for flexibility with advertising. I think people -- advertisers and marketers are starting to look forward into the first quarter of next fiscal year and are beginning to think about how they market and get their products and their brands in front of our consumers again. So, we're just -- its early days, but we're just beginning to see that positive shift. As to political advertising, despite the impact of COVID-19 in the last couple weeks of the third quarter, the third quarter still was a record political year for us -- sorry, quarter for us -- the third quarter for us. Fourth quarter always is a trough, as the advertising start -- political advertising starts to pick up again in the first fiscal quarter of the next fiscal year. So we expect that trend to continue. We expect the political advertising to ramp up in the first quarter of the next fiscal year. And we believe we are still on track for a record political season. The reason we say that is, if you look at our markets. Obviously, it's going to be a hard-fought election. We have nine of our 18 markets or about half our markets are battleground states, including Arizona, Florida, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, to some extent also Georgia, Michigan and Minnesota. Ten of our markets have U.S. Senate races. I won't list them all. And two of our markets have gubernatorial races. Of course, the House has contests in every market. So we think, our markets are -- I wouldn't say fortuitously, but are certainly positioned well to capture, a lion's share of the political revenue really in the first quarter of the next fiscal year. Thank you."

            "name": "Steve Tomsic",
            "content": "Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. Let me start with a brief summary of our third quarter results, before going on to discuss current trading conditions. As Lachlan mentioned earlier, Q3 was a clear demonstration of Fox's financial strength. The company reported total revenues of $3.44 billion, up 25% over the comparative period in fiscal 2019, reflecting revenue growth across all operating segments. Total company advertising revenues increased 44%, led by the broadcast of Super Bowl 54, while total company affiliate revenues increased 10%, demonstrating the strength of our brands and our focused portfolio of channels. We achieved double-digit affiliate revenue growth despite the rate of net subscriber declines of just over 5%. Quarterly EBITDA was $920 million, and notwithstanding the comparison to carve out financials in the prior year period still represented growth of 20% led by increases of the television and cable network programming segment, partially offset by the impact of corporate expenses at the other segment. The increase in these expenses reflects the full costs of Fox operating as a standalone public company in the current year versus the presentation of carve-out financial statement in the prior year quarter. From a bottom-line perspective, net income attributable to stockholders of $78 million or $0.13 a share was lower than the $529 million or $0.85 per share in the prior year quarter. This decline was primarily due to the change in fair value of the company's investments recognized in other net. Most notably, the book loss incurred following the sale of our stake in Roku in March. From an economic perspective, the Roku sale, which equated to nine times our initial investment, delivered a post-tax gain relative to initial cash investment of approximately $300 million and strategically allowed us to convert a minority shareholding into the full ownership of leading AVOD player Tubi. Excluding this impact and other non-core items, adjusted EPS of $0.93 was up significantly compared to last year's $0.76 per share, reflecting the growth in EBITDA, partially offset by higher net interest expense, which as we have flagged in the past, primarily reflects interest on the standalone debt structure of Fox versus the carve-out presentation in the prior year quarter. So now turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter, where cable EBITDA of $792 million was up 7% on revenue growth of 6%. As expected, we saw growth in cable affiliate revenues accelerate to 4%, as the impact of new distribution agreements and higher average rates across essentially all of our brands, was partially offset by the net decrease in pay television subscribers. This growth also reflects the launch of FOX News and Fox Business on Sling late last year. Cable advertising revenues increased 10%, led by results at FOX News Media, including the impact of higher ratings and continued strength in our digital sales, partially offset by high preemptions associated with breaking news coverage. Segment advertising growth was also impacted by fewer live NASCAR events at Fox Sports 1, due to the postponement of early season races as a result of COVID-19. Other cable revenues grew by $18 million, driven by contractual sports sublicensing revenues, primarily associated with college basketball content in the quarter. EBITDA at our cable segment increased 7% over the prior year, reflecting these higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses. FOX News Media costs were up in the quarter, due to coverage of the presidential primaries and continued digital investment in FOX Nation, which were partially offset in the segment by lower programming rights amortization of Fox Sports 1 from fewer live NASCAR events. The quarter also included one-time costs at FOX Sports and FOX News Media related to the production of shoulder programming leading up to the broadcast of Super Bowl 54. The Television segment reported EBITDA of $224 million, an increase of $125 million over the prior year quarter on revenue growth of 41%. The revenue growth was led by a 56% increase in television advertising revenues, including the impact across our network and stations from Super Bowl Sunday. Excluding the impact of the Super Bowl and the impact of one less NFL divisional playoff game compared to the prior year, advertising revenues would have been up 1%, primarily due to strong CPM growth for FOX Network and higher political advertising revenues at the Fox Television Stations. These were partially offset by the impact of COVID-19 on our local stations during the closing weeks of the quarter. Television affiliate revenues increased 22% in the period, reflecting double-digit increases for both our programming fees from non-owned station affiliates and direct retransmission revenues at our owned and operated stations. EBITDA at our Television segment increased $125 million over the prior year, reflecting these higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses. The increase in expenses was driven by programming rights amortization and production and costs associated with the broadcast of Super Bowl 54, partially offset by the impact of the rotating NFL divisional playoff game and prior year programming write-downs. Similar to our second quarter, we continued to make investments in programming, which included our first year of WWE content, the expansion of original entertainment programming and our participation in coproduction arrangements with third-party studios. Finally, from a P&L perspective, the net EBITDA loss in our other segment amounted to $96 million, which reflects the full quarter of stand-alone cost, as opposed to the carve-out basis of presentation in the corresponding quarter of the prior year. We still expect the net EBITDA loss in our other segment to be in the mid to high $300 million range for the full fiscal year. Turning now to cash flow. As expected, our free cash flow generation in the quarter of more than $1.5 billion was strong, supported by the collection of advertising revenues from our fall programming and the fact that our sports rights payments were concentrated in prior quarters. As a reminder, we calculate free cash flow as net cash used in operating activity, plus cash invested in property, plant and equipment. As part of our balanced approach to capital allocation, in March, we closed on the previously announced Nexstar Television stations transaction at a net purchase price of approximately $300 million. We also generated net proceeds of approximately $340 million from the sale of our stake in Roku, which was earmarked from the acquisition of Tubi for approximately $445 million in net cash consideration at closing last month. During the quarter, we purchased 3.9 million Class A and 2.9 million Class B shares for $173 million. Against our buyback authorization of $2 billion, we have now cumulatively repurchased $600 million, representing nearly 3% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in November. Given the current uncertain economic conditions, we have not bought back shares since the onset of the crisis. From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $3.2 billion in cash and $6.8 billion in debt. Since then, out of an abundance of caution, we took the opportunity to add to our already strong liquidity position by raising $1.2 billion of five-year and 10-year notes in April, which was significantly oversubscribed. The weighted average cost of this new issuance was approximately 3.3%, thereby making it attractive from a cost perspective to essentially prefund our $750 million maturity due in January 2022. So with the combined benefits of strong free cash flow and liquidity, moderate leverage and the absence of any debt maturity for almost two years, we face the challenges of COVID-19 from a position of financial strength. As Lachlan mentioned, while we are very proud of the operational and the financial results that we have achieved, we're acutely aware of the impact of COVID-19 and the challenges it presents to all of our businesses and all of our stakeholders. We note that there are a number of moving variables, among them the outlook for the gradual reopening of the economy, the timing in the return of sporting events and the evolution of the upfront advertising cycle that make it difficult to forecast our business beyond the very short term. As such, our commentary today will focus only on our fiscal fourth quarter and only on advertising revenues, which is where we are seeing the most significant impact to our business. The most immediate impact has been on advertising revenue at our local television stations, where inventory is sold essentially on a spot basis and many of our advertising partners operate in sectors most displaced by COVID-19. If pacing continues at current levels, we would expect our local advertising to be down by approximately 50% as against prior year. Meanwhile, our News and Entertainment businesses are expected to be more insulated in the immediate term. News is being supported by strong ratings, the growth of its digital properties, the category mix of its core advertisers, along with the new advertising clients it is attracting that help partially offset decline from the legacy advertising base. At Entertainment, we are already substantially through the broadcast season with our advertising revenues well supported by inventory that was sold during last year's upfront and until recently, a strong scatter market. So before we get to our Sports business, the collective Q4 impact of weaker advertising demand at our local TV stations, national news, and Entertainment businesses is anticipated to be around $200 million to $240 million or 25% to 30% compared to prior year. Across these businesses, we do not anticipate COVID-19 having a meaningful impact on Q4 costs. Now turning to our Sports business, where uncertainty around schedule makes it impossible to forecast top line impact. However, it is worth pointing out that we typically amortize the associated rights fees and production expenses on our P&L when the games or events actually air on our networks. So from a bottom line perspective, advertising revenues from events being postponed is often offset by the P&L expense benefit of not having the rights cost. Although these uncertainties make it challenging for us to estimate the future performance of our businesses, as Lachlan mentioned in his our financial results to illustrate, the company entered this crisis in a position of operating and financial strength. We will continue to manage our business and balance sheet in a disciplined and conservative manner so that we emerge as well positioned as possible to take advantage of opportunities during the recovery. And with that, I'd now like to turn the call back to Joe. Yes. And Doug, just picking up on the accounting and just, we called out -- just going back to the Investor Day, again, we called out $200 million to $250 million of programming investments, and we're on pace to be in that range for the full year. So I think we'll spend close to sort of $170 million of that so far in the first three quarters of the year. So we're still on pace, and as Lachlan mentioned, continue to look at how we invest in that going forward. The accounting won't change for us in terms of the amort of entertainment programming, which we generally sort of go through on first run. So there'll be no changes on amortization."

And with that, I\u2019m pleased to turn the call over to Lachlan.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks Joe. Good afternoon and thanks everyone for joining us for our fiscal 2020 second quarter earnings call. We just reported an exceptional quarter which really underscores the strength of Fox and our unique position in the market. Nowhere with that strength and uniqueness on greater display than this past weekend culminating with our groundbreaking broadcast of Super Bowl LIV. Let me say at the outset, how pleased I am of the efforts of our entire company. Our people delivered a flawless broadcast of Sunday's game to more than 150 million unique viewers across the country virtually guaranteeing its place as the most watched live television event of 2020. We surrounded the Super Bowl with an immersive and innovative programming lineup from Miami across Fox Sports, Fox News, Fox Sports 1 and our local stations. And we use this enormous platform to launch Season 3 of the Masked Singer right after the game which became TV's highest rated reality telecast in eight years. On Sunday, Fox had the largest revenue day in TV history generating around $600 million of gross revenue and providing an unmatched platform for over 100 advertisers from the pregame through the Masked Singer. And we delivered extraordinary ratings for our advertising, distribution and NFL partners. And while there's a massive amount of planning and activity that goes with broadcasting the Super Bowl, it is not been at the expense of delivering other imperatives for our business. During the first six months of the fiscal year, we have already achieved a substantial number of key operating milestones in support of Fox's growth and momentum. Among them were attaining number 1 status for the Fox Network and broadcast and maintaining the number one position of Fox News in all of cable. Delivering a strong sports calendar to viewers and advertisers particularly across baseball and football. Launching the WWE, acquiring credible and activating FOX Bet. We announced the expansion of our local station footprint with the acquisition of two key local market stations. We completed a substantial number of major distribution deals in line with our expectations, including gaining carriage for Fox News and Fox Business on Sling. And we have delivered impressive financial results led by revenue growth. This quarter, we've really knocked it out of the park. Steve will provide further color around the financial results shortly. But our first half results illustrate the power and importance of our brands to our partners and audiences, validating our strategy to build Fox around live sports, live news and event programming. Overall, our top revenue - our top line revenue is trending nicely. Total affiliate revenue increased by nearly 6% in the first six months of the fiscal year. And our advertising markets, both national and local, are buoyant, as illustrated by the current scatter market where we see pricing well over 20% higher than upfront levels. The strength of the television advertising market for us is at a level that we have not seen for some time. Across all of Fox, we are seeing growing demand because we are delivering sizable audiences for brands. And our national networks categories that are leading this intensity include financial, insurance, the streamers, technology, and foreign auto. At the local level, most of these same categories are prominent except domestic autos are currently running ahead of foreign. On the national news side of our business, Fox News and Fox Business are seeing a significant advertising client expansion across both our linear and digital advertising business led by their financial and technology categories. The FOX News audience is increasingly sought after by more and more advertisers as they look to reach a large engaged audience particularly across Middle America. This advertising strength is based in large part from delivering on the promise made last May at our upfront that Fox would own the fall across the entire Fox network. Overall, the Fox network took the top rating spot for the fall broadcast season marking its first number one finish in the 18 to 49 demographic in 10 years. Additionally, Fox is the only network to achieve year-over-year gains in both total viewers and in the 18 to 49 demo. Fox also ranked as the number one entertainment network in the fall in all viewers for the first time in our history fueled by the success of the Masked Singer, 9-1-1 and the top new series Prodigal Son. We're focused on sustaining this momentum in the second half of the year with the addition of the Deputy and 9-1-1 Lone Star and non-scripted content like Gordon Ramsay's 24 Hours to Hell and Back, the third season of the Masked Singer and our newest show LEGO Masters which debuts tonight on Fox. I suggest watching with your whole family. It's truly great. On the sports side of our business, we continue to drive unparalleled audiences to our signature programming. So far this fiscal year FOX Sports has been home to the U.S. Women's National Soccer Team, a riveting seven game World Series, the inaugural broadcast presentation of WWE SmackDown and ambitious new college football strategy and the launch of our partnership with TSG and FOX Bet. And clearly, it was a great year for NFL football and Fox which culminated Sunday with the broadcast of Super Bowl 54. For the second year in a row, Fox was able to expand its audience for Thursday Night Football, college football Saturdays and NFL Sundays. In aggregate, total regular season football viewing on Fox, NFL, and college football combined was up 14% over 2018. It's worth noting that no other network was up more than half this level. While the momentum we've seen at the broadcast network has been strong, equally as impressive is the performance of Fox News. Fox News finished calendar 2019 as a top rated basic cable network across all cable networks for a fourth year in a row, beating its nearest competitors by over 40% and achieving its highest rated primetime in history. Given the well-documented headwinds facing the broader cable industry, Fox News's ability to grow its audience over last year is a testament to the enduring power of the brand. The current news cycle continues to drive passionate viewers to Fox News and it's hard to see that trend subsiding. All of these achievements point to a simple fact. Fox is the home to both a top rated broadcast network and the most viewed cable network and that is an exciting position to be in. Equally exciting is to be the home of the two events that command the attention of the entire country in the same year. We started calendar 2020 with the first event, the broadcast of Super Bowl 54 on Fox. We now set our focus on the second event, the news equivalent of the Super Bowl, the presidential election. Fox News has branded Democracy 2020 election coverage is already in full swing. If history is any guide, audience levels and engagement will build significantly as the cycle progresses through the upcoming primaries and caucuses, the conventions, and the presidential debates, all culminating in our election night coverage across Fox News Media on Tuesday, November 3. As we build towards November, the financial benefits are not limited to Fox News. We'll see a sizable ad revenue uplift at our local television stations. As reference, in calendar 2018, during the last midterm election, our stations collectively generated record gross political revenues in excess of $200 million, shattering the previous record set during that to 2012 Obama-Romney election by 40%. Although we are very early in the political season, we are already seeing signs of further increased political spending with a vast majority of the spend dedicated to the unmatched reach of television. We saw it on Sunday for spending in the Super Bowl on a national level and we're already been seeing it at our local stations which positions us to deliver a new record for political revenues in calendar 2020. Our confidence is further strengthened by the fact that we will soon be expanding our station footprint which already includes stations in Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, and Virginia into another perennial swing state, Wisconsin, with the previously announced acquisition of the Fox affiliate in Milwaukee. As you can tell I'm thrilled with the rapid progress that we have made and the recognition of the great value of our networks by our distribution partners. As indicated earlier, we have achieved our goals in all the distribution renewals we have completed which reflects the importance of our content to the market. But, of course, we recognized that the trends in the paid subscriber universe has an impact on our business. As you know we are dependent on our traditional and digital distribution partners and their business plans for our inclusion in their pay television retail offerings. Well I'm not going to predict where a normalized pay TV subscriber base ends up in the near- to medium-term, I know that this ecosystem will still be the large component of our revenues for some time. Nevertheless, we have begun allocating capital to expand our revenue base while reserving our subscriber fee relationships into direct-to-consumer initiatives which will grow in importance over time. FOX Nation, FOX Between, and Credible, our three recent examples of this but we continue to evaluate opportunities where Fox can bring unique value directly to consumers while sustaining existing business models. Nonetheless, there is solid growth and momentum at the company's existing digital businesses where total engagement increasing last quarter by over 40% versus the previous quarter. Fox News Digital had a record calendar 2019 beating cnn.com in both total views and minutes consumed. And for the first time, Fox News Digital averaged over 100 million unique comScore Monthly visitors. Fox Sports also had a record digital year in calendar 2019, grown both total video views across streaming and social platforms and total minutes consumed by over 20%. It was also our highest streamed regular season for the NFL on Fox with growth of 57% last - over last year and I\u2019ll refer to the Super Bowl, one more time, the game was the most streamed ever, 11.7 million users streamed all or part of the Super Bowl and 70% of their consumption was on Fox-owned platforms. While we have remain focused on executing against our operational plans and hitting our financial targets, we have also demonstrated how we look to deploy our capital to an appropriate balance of organic investment, strategic M&A return of capital to our shareholders. On the organic investment side, the previously announced $200 million to $250 million EBITDA investment began to ramp up this past quarter with the broadcast of WWE SmackDown and our investments in greater originality and co-production rights at the Fox Network, along with investment in our digital initiatives led by Fox Nation and the refresh on Fox business. In terms of strategic M&A, in October, we deployed approximately $260 million for the previously mentioned acquisition of Credible Labs. In the short time we have owned Credible Labs, we have seen the signs of the excess - exceptional growth the business is capable of. For example, during calendar 2019, Credible more than doubled its cumulative registered user base and experienced record close loan volume both of which drove substantial top line revenue growth. We have also committed around $300 million to acquire the Nexstar television stations in Seattle and Milwaukee in exchange for our station - stations in Charlotte. We expect this deal to close in the next month or so. And our commitment to return capital to our shareholders remains an integral element of our capital allocation strategy. In addition to the just announced semiannual dividend, we have now finished the initial $500 million of share repurchases that we committed to when we announced the $2 billion authorization three months ago. As we have consistently noted, we remain committed to deploying capital in a disciplined manner to maximize shareholder value through this balanced approach. Now, I will turn the call over to Steve to provide more detail on our financial results.\nSteve Tomsic: Thanks Lachlan, and good afternoon. As you just heard, our operating momentum continued in the second quarter and we continue to exceed the internal goals that we commence the year with. This past quarter we delivered strong top line growth led by an increase in total affiliate revenue of 7%. We achieved this growth despite aggregate industry pay TV subscribers continuing to decline at a rate in excess of 4% over calendar year to 2019. During this period, the losses across traditional distributors many of whom reported last week where at least partially offset by continued growth of digital MBPDs where subscribers have grown 2.3 million. In this past quarter, we saw digital MBPDs grow by over 1.5 million representing sequential quarterly growth of over 20%. As we've highlighted in the past, the natural seasonality of our business means the second quarter is traditionally the low watermark from an EBITDA margin standpoint. This is primarily due to the timing of broadcast sports and entertainment expenses that are concentrated in the fall season. This includes the investments in sports and entertainment content at the Fox Network which have - which as we have previously outlined, set us up well to complete our remaining distribution renewals in this cycle and achieve our longer term financial targets. Let me now take you through our second quarter results. And along the way, we remind you of some key factors that shaped the remainder of our fiscal year. In the second quarter, the company reported total revenues of $3.78 billion, up 5% over the comparative period in fiscal 2019, reflecting revenue growth across all operating segments. EBITDA was $261 million, which compares to the $445 million generated in the prior-year period. As growth at the cable segment was more than offset by lower operating results for the television segment and the impact of corporate expenses at the other segment now being reported on an actual basis. The latter reflects the costs of Fox operating as a stand-alone public company in the current year quarter. This is the presentation of carved out financial statements in the prior year. From a bottom line perspective, net income attributable to stockholders of $300 million or $0.48 per share. It was higher than the $8 million or $0.01 per share in the prior-year quarter. This growth was primarily due to the change in fair value of the company's investments recognized in other net including the Stars group and Roku which together have a current market value of approximately $1.1 billion. Excluding this impact and other onetime items, adjusted EPS of $0.10 cents was down compared to last year\u2019s $0.43 per share, reflecting the change in EBITDA and interest expense, which as we have flagged in the past now reflects the amount associated with operating a stand-alone company. So, now turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter where cable network EBITDA of $556 million was up 7% on revenue growth of 2%. Cable affiliate revenues increased 2% as the impact of higher average rates across essentially all of our brands was partially offset by the net decrease in pay television subscribers that I mentioned earlier. Assuming current subscriber volume trends continue, we continue to anticipate modestly accelerating growth in cable affiliate revenue in the second half of the fiscal year as the full impact of rate resets from recent renegotiations begin to take effect. Cable advertising revenues decreased 5% due to fewer units at FOX News Media including higher preemptions associated with its breaking news coverage of the impeachment hearings and the absence of USC programming at the national sports networks. These impacts were partially offset by strong results from our coverage of the MLB American League Championship Series between New York Yankees and Houston Astros on FOX Sports 1. Cable other revenues grew by $32 million. This increase was driven by high sports sub licensing revenue and pay-per-view boxing revenues associated with the heavyweight bout between Wilder and Ortiz as well as subscription revenues from FOX Nation. EBITDA at our cable segment increased 7% over the prior year reflecting these higher revenues while costs were essentially held flat. From a cost perspective, savings from our non-renewable of UHC programming were offset by the contractual increases on existing sports rights agreements at the national sports networks along with higher costs at FOX News Media which includes our investment in digital. It is worth noting that we anticipate elevated growth in cable segment expenses in our fiscal third quarter versus the prior year. This is driven by the increased costs at our national sports networks reflecting both contractual increases for our sports rights and the production costs of the shoulder programming around the broadcast of Super Bowl 54. It also includes increased costs of FOX News Media related to our coverage of the presidential election and continued investment in FOX Nation. The television segment reported an EBITDA loss of $214 million, higher than the loss of $40 million in the prior quarter on a revenue growth of 5%. The revenue growth was led by an 18% increase in television affiliate revenues reflecting double digit programming fee growth from non-owned station affiliates and double digit direct retransmission revenue growth at our owned and operated stations. Television advertising revenues in the quarter increased $39 million or 2%. This was achieved despite us lapping the record political advertising revenues at our owned and operated stations from the midterm elections in the prior year quarter. This result was underpinned by the very robust advertising market conditions that Lachlan just described, coupled with stronger NFL ratings, The programming successes we've delivered at FOX Entertainment a compelling seven-game World Series, and the introduction to the schedule of WWE Friday Night SmackDown. EBITDA at our television segment decreased $200 million over the prior year as an increase in expenses over of over $300 million more than offset strong revenue growth. The increase in expenses was due to the anticipated increase in sports programming amortization and production expenses led by the NFL along with investments we have made in television segment programming. During the quarter, these investments included the premiere of WWE, the expansion of original entertainment programming and our participation in coproduction arrangements with third party studios. Finally from a P&L perspective, the net EBITDA loss in our other segment amounted to$81 million which reflects a full quarter of standalone costs as oppose to the carve out basis of presentation in the corresponding quarter at the prior year. Turning now to cash flow. Over the first six months of fiscal 2020 the company generated negative free cash flow of $366 million which we calculate as net cash used in operating activities plus cash invested in property plant and equipment. As a reminder, this anticipated use of capital reflects the typical seasonality you should expect to see in the business. Here the first half of our fiscal year is impacted by the working capital deficit that results from the concentration of our annual sports rights payments, and the recognized but yet to collect peak advertising revenues that are associated with our sports and entertainment programming in the full broadcast season. These factors were reversed in the second half of our fiscal year, as we harvest cash from the collection on prior quarters advertising revenues and payments for sports rights subside resulting in a significant cash surplus. On a full-year basis we all benefit from the natural low working capital usage of our business along with our cash tax benefit and will therefore convert a significant percentage of the company's EBITDA to free cash flow. From an overall balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with just under $2 billion in cash and $6.8 billion in debt. As Lachlan mentioned earlier, we have completed the initial $500 million stock repurchase goal that we outlined three months ago comprising $350 million of Class A shares and $150 million of Class B shares. You'll also have seen that we just declared our semi-annual dividend of $0.23 a share. Finally, as part of our balanced approach to capital allocation, we closed on the acquisition of a 67% stake in Credible Labs in early October. And with regulatory approval snow secured we expect to see and close the previously announced Nexstar television stations transaction at a net purchase price of approximately $300 million. And with that, I would now like to turn the call back to Joe.\nJoe Dorrego: Thank you, Steve. And now we'd be happy to take questions from the investment community.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson. Please go ahead.\nMichael Nathanson: I have a two for anyone who want to take it. So first one is when you guys separated this new company out, the assumption was you\u2019d have more bargaining clout with distributors because you have less channels to defend. As Lachlan said you achieved your goals in these negotiations just happened. Could you give us a sense of what those goals were and maybe how the goals have changed given the change in terms of landscape or for chord cutting? And then secondly, I believe you still own 5% stake in Roku. Could you talk about how that asset fits in with your cap allocation scheme especially in light of what happened last week with the impacts you guys had with Roku. So thanks.\nLachlan Murdoch: Michael, thank you very much for the question. Two questions. John, do you want to address our success with affiliate fees, and I\u2019ll address Roku.\nJohn Nallen: Yes. So, Michael, thanks. I would say the first six months of the year was unprecedented for us with the amount of renewals that we had all of which were successful against our internal plans. And you're right when we said in the separation that our goals were different than we were at 21CF. It was because we now had the opportunity to use the full power and leverage of the FOX Network and FOX News on a pricing standpoint and on a full distribution standpoint. And your phrase of bargaining clout those as Lachlan referred to earlier are the two most successful television channels in America right now. So we were able to use that to achieve multi-year pricing for those channels at levels that were at or above what we planned and distribution fully with our distribution partners. So I think those are the two that we were really focused on.\nLachlan Murdoch: And in light of that Michael. You know I think we can say that I'm \u2013 I know we can say that you know our announced expectation that we will do a $1 billion of additional affiliate revenue by calendar 2022, we are absolutely still expecting to hit that number and cross the hurdle. So and that's factoring in the subscriber volume declines. So I think we're really doing a terrific job in driving those affiliate fees. In regards to Roku, as you know sort of widely reported last Friday our distribution deal with Roku was expiring. We went through frankly a very normal course sort of negotiation with them not unlike the negotiations we have with all of our distributors. What happens in these negotiations and often this is what becomes public as both sides prepare for a non-resolution of the issues, but ultimately they like all of our distributors and platforms so the value of the Fox brands and content on their platform and we were able to resolve our differences and agree to a new agreement really I think to mutual benefit. Throughout it all it was very professional. We have a huge regard for Anthony Wood and his management team at Roku. We think they're doing a tremendous stake, positioned the company to really be one of the leading if not the lead beneficiary of over the top streaming and we are happy shareholders in the company.\nJoe Dorrego: I think we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from line of Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAlexia Quadrani: On FOX News you've seen such a great rebound, which given the news environment looks like this momentum will continue. I guess my question is how well can you capitalize on the ratings gross on an advertising perspective? Do you have enough inventory to sell? And then just a follow up on the NFL, any color you could give us in terms of when you think the discussions for renewal might really kick in?\nJohn Nallen: So, on advertising. So, you're right. We're obviously doing well because of our rating strength and obviously not just at the FOX Network, but at FOX News as well. And the \u2013 as I mentioned in my earlier comments we see that that ratings strength really just continuing. In fact last night over the State of the Union broadcast I think \u2013 I know because I\u2019ve seen the numbers. Maybe many of you have already. But FOX News ratings were double the ratings of CNN and MSNBC combined. So it really is a tremendous performance. What we've been doing and I think others have followed our lead is working to build in as many advertising units as we can. This includes using the innovative use of sort of squeezing back advertising and having sort of a split screen sort of experience where you can cover some of the breaking news while also showing that the ad or the ad break. So we are gathering as much of that revenue as possible. I think the important note though around FOX News advertising is really the expansion in the number of marketers and partners that we have on FOX News. There's a growing sense in the market that if you want to reach Middle America there's no better place than placing your brand, your advertising than on FOX News. So, the advertising team is doing a tremendous job and we expect to capture a significant amount through the upside revenue as we run to this political season. And that\u2019s not to say none of them have mentioned the local stations obviously in California we have two markets, in Texas where we have three markets, North Carolina, Virginia, Minnesota and now with the addition soon of Wisconsin now we are very well placed in swing states will it be a significant amount of our advertising spend towards this election.\nLachlan Murdoch: Second part of the question.\nJohn Nallen: Oh, the NFL sorry, I was too provoked for both on the first part of the question. NFL renewal conversations have early stages but they certainly have begun. We obviously spent practically all of last week with the NFL both the administration and many of the terrific families of the owners of the teams. We feel we're in a good place to work with them. As our most important partner to you know, to renew our rights going forward. But it's early days in the conversations.\nJoe Dorrego: Operator, I think we can go to the next question.\nOperator: Our next question will be from the line of Michael Morris with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.\nMichael Morris: On the affiliate revenue in fiscal second quarter you guided to sort of a similar level to what you saw in the first. But you reported that acceleration. My question is can you parse that was it all virtual MVPD driven were there other parts? Did it have anything to do with your new renewals that you done? And is that an incremental tailwind as you move into the step ups next year that will also be beneficial. And then just on the digital side, you\u2019ve been clear about your partnerships with your traditional providers? You have left the door open to doings something digital. I believe that\u2019s the case if or when that the time that that would make sense. If you look at your current content base, do you have what you need to perhaps pursue that or are there specific places that you would still want to bolster to have a product ready? Thank you.\nLachlan Murdoch: You want me to take that? I\u2019ll take the affiliate.\nJohn Nallen: So Michael, in terms of the affiliate, the combination of what you just outlined. So we got the benefit of an increasing that stub period in the final quarter of the calendar year with a couple of the renewals that we completed last calendar year. The other piece to it is just a little bit around subscriber mix where we obviously talk to the sort of heightened level of growth - the digital MVPDs and given the sort of more recent deal vintage there. The pricing is a little bit better than some of the older deals and so we benefited from that but it doesn't - as I said in my opening remarks we continue to expect that we'll get progressive increases in cable affiliate growth going into this second half of our fiscal year.\nLachlan Murdoch: And then, Michael, on the digital question, I think we're always going to play to our strengths and our strengths are very clearly live news, live sport and big event entertainment programming. And if we - you asked do we have what we need to succeed in those sectors whether it's on the broadcast or in a direct-to-consumer experience. We have the two of the most watched channels in America the number one broadcast our network and the number one cable channel. So clearly our audiences are engaging with our content. They're engaging with our content today in a number of different forms not just broadcast. I mentioned in my earlier remarks, I think it was 11.7 million people watched the Super Bowl via streaming. Our broadcast Super Bowl of our streaming and 70% which is actually a remarkable number 70% of those - of that 11.7 million watch it on platforms that we own. So I think we are already progressing down that path. And I should also just call out Fox Nation which is obviously a really excellent sort of direct-to-consumer product out of Fox News. 80% of the people who sample Fox Nation and take a free trial, 80% of them are convert - to paid subscribers. And December and January were the two highest months in history in terms of both subscriber acquisition but also and just as importantly in terms of engagement on the platform. So, we're really very happy with how Fox Nation is progressing as well.\nJoe Dorrego: Operator, the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question will be from Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nDoug Mitchelson: It's interesting to hear you mentioned sort of investments in direct-to-consumer. So I just want to continue along that theme. Is this sort of an urgent priority for the company or something that just want to lean into the next three years - a few years to capture growth? And I think what investors want to know is at what point would you take Fox Broadcast Network or Fox News, put them online \u00e0 la carte that, maybe a big premium to your wholesale rate? But what has to happen in the broader environment for that to become an interesting pivot for the company. And if I could I was just going to ask John in the weeds question. He had massing around last year, second half the season as well, so you're certain the comp year-over-year on that. But I imagine the ad rates this year are a little bit better than the ad rates last year at any sort of color around sort of ad rate increase on that show would be would be super interesting? Thank you.\nLachlan Murdoch: Look, it's something what we're always looking at, but we also have an eye on not damaging the current business model where we generate still and tremendous and growing amount of revenue from our cable subscribers. So I think that we have the capability to go direct consumer. We took the technology that we built with us when we separated from Disney. We are running direct-to-consumer businesses with Fox Sports in pay-per-view with Fox Nation and in a different manner through Credible. So, we're happy where we are now, and we'll see what the future brings.\nJohn Nallen: And Doug, just look, advertising I think both Lachlan and Steve touched on that advertising, we just haven't seen markets like this for a while. And each of our products is leading into this, each of our shows and whether it's entertainment or sports. But just as guys you'll remember, the upfront was up 10% and scatter is now up over 20% on top of that. So, it's not like massing. It was fully sold in the upfront, so we're enjoying the benefit of what is a very active market right now.\nJoe Dorrego: Okay. Operator, I think we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.\nJohn Hodulik: Maybe for Lachlan, I'm following up on the political question and $200 million. Can you give us some more color on the sort of the pacing as you saw that\u2019s been the last election cycle through the year and maybe the benefits you saw on maybe sort of TV side and versus the cable side. And then secondly, and this is maybe for Steve. You completed the $500 million buyback, obviously very low leverage. How should we think of the buyback pacing going forward?\nLachlan Murdoch: I'll let John answer the buyback - the buyback piece. But I mean I don't steal your thunder, John. But we fully expect to spend the remaining amount of $1.5 billion that we have approval to buyback share so. But I\u2019ll let John give some more detail on that - on the\u2026\nJohn Nallen: Yes, thank you for your headline.\nLachlan Murdoch: So - sorry, John. On the political pacing, it's really - it's very strong but it's - we're at the very beginning of it. Obviously we've seen from national advertising from both sides of the political spectrum. On the local side we haven't seen any advertising yet locally from the President's reelection campaign. But of course we\u2019ve seen a lot of advertising already starting to come in from the democratic side. It's relatively short and I think it was reported in the Bloomberg campaign has expected to sort of double its advertising spend earlier this week. But the Bloomberg campaign is buying on a week-to-week basis so it's hard to predict that out. But obviously we expect it to be very strong and particularly as I mentioned in the markets of our of our local TV stations.\nJohn Nallen: John, it's John. I'll - end it on really something Lachlan said at the beginning. This is with respect to the buyback which is our commitment to returns of capital to the shareholders is just an integral element of the overall balance capital allocation. We committed to a $2 billion authorization and we're going to complete that.\nJoe Dorrego: Okay at this point, we are out of time. But if you have any further questions please give me or Dan Carey a call. Thank you once again for joining today's call.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks everyone.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Lachlan Murdoch",
            "content": "Thanks Joe. Good afternoon and thanks everyone for joining us for our fiscal 2020 second quarter earnings call. We just reported an exceptional quarter which really underscores the strength of Fox and our unique position in the market. Nowhere with that strength and uniqueness on greater display than this past weekend culminating with our groundbreaking broadcast of Super Bowl LIV. Let me say at the outset, how pleased I am of the efforts of our entire company. Our people delivered a flawless broadcast of Sunday's game to more than 150 million unique viewers across the country virtually guaranteeing its place as the most watched live television event of 2020. We surrounded the Super Bowl with an immersive and innovative programming lineup from Miami across Fox Sports, Fox News, Fox Sports 1 and our local stations. And we use this enormous platform to launch Season 3 of the Masked Singer right after the game which became TV's highest rated reality telecast in eight years. On Sunday, Fox had the largest revenue day in TV history generating around $600 million of gross revenue and providing an unmatched platform for over 100 advertisers from the pregame through the Masked Singer. And we delivered extraordinary ratings for our advertising, distribution and NFL partners. And while there's a massive amount of planning and activity that goes with broadcasting the Super Bowl, it is not been at the expense of delivering other imperatives for our business. During the first six months of the fiscal year, we have already achieved a substantial number of key operating milestones in support of Fox's growth and momentum. Among them were attaining number 1 status for the Fox Network and broadcast and maintaining the number one position of Fox News in all of cable. Delivering a strong sports calendar to viewers and advertisers particularly across baseball and football. Launching the WWE, acquiring credible and activating FOX Bet. We announced the expansion of our local station footprint with the acquisition of two key local market stations. We completed a substantial number of major distribution deals in line with our expectations, including gaining carriage for Fox News and Fox Business on Sling. And we have delivered impressive financial results led by revenue growth. This quarter, we've really knocked it out of the park. Steve will provide further color around the financial results shortly. But our first half results illustrate the power and importance of our brands to our partners and audiences, validating our strategy to build Fox around live sports, live news and event programming. Overall, our top revenue - our top line revenue is trending nicely. Total affiliate revenue increased by nearly 6% in the first six months of the fiscal year. And our advertising markets, both national and local, are buoyant, as illustrated by the current scatter market where we see pricing well over 20% higher than upfront levels. The strength of the television advertising market for us is at a level that we have not seen for some time. Across all of Fox, we are seeing growing demand because we are delivering sizable audiences for brands. And our national networks categories that are leading this intensity include financial, insurance, the streamers, technology, and foreign auto. At the local level, most of these same categories are prominent except domestic autos are currently running ahead of foreign. On the national news side of our business, Fox News and Fox Business are seeing a significant advertising client expansion across both our linear and digital advertising business led by their financial and technology categories. The FOX News audience is increasingly sought after by more and more advertisers as they look to reach a large engaged audience particularly across Middle America. This advertising strength is based in large part from delivering on the promise made last May at our upfront that Fox would own the fall across the entire Fox network. Overall, the Fox network took the top rating spot for the fall broadcast season marking its first number one finish in the 18 to 49 demographic in 10 years. Additionally, Fox is the only network to achieve year-over-year gains in both total viewers and in the 18 to 49 demo. Fox also ranked as the number one entertainment network in the fall in all viewers for the first time in our history fueled by the success of the Masked Singer, 9-1-1 and the top new series Prodigal Son. We're focused on sustaining this momentum in the second half of the year with the addition of the Deputy and 9-1-1 Lone Star and non-scripted content like Gordon Ramsay's 24 Hours to Hell and Back, the third season of the Masked Singer and our newest show LEGO Masters which debuts tonight on Fox. I suggest watching with your whole family. It's truly great. On the sports side of our business, we continue to drive unparalleled audiences to our signature programming. So far this fiscal year FOX Sports has been home to the U.S. Women's National Soccer Team, a riveting seven game World Series, the inaugural broadcast presentation of WWE SmackDown and ambitious new college football strategy and the launch of our partnership with TSG and FOX Bet. And clearly, it was a great year for NFL football and Fox which culminated Sunday with the broadcast of Super Bowl 54. For the second year in a row, Fox was able to expand its audience for Thursday Night Football, college football Saturdays and NFL Sundays. In aggregate, total regular season football viewing on Fox, NFL, and college football combined was up 14% over 2018. It's worth noting that no other network was up more than half this level. While the momentum we've seen at the broadcast network has been strong, equally as impressive is the performance of Fox News. Fox News finished calendar 2019 as a top rated basic cable network across all cable networks for a fourth year in a row, beating its nearest competitors by over 40% and achieving its highest rated primetime in history. Given the well-documented headwinds facing the broader cable industry, Fox News's ability to grow its audience over last year is a testament to the enduring power of the brand. The current news cycle continues to drive passionate viewers to Fox News and it's hard to see that trend subsiding. All of these achievements point to a simple fact. Fox is the home to both a top rated broadcast network and the most viewed cable network and that is an exciting position to be in. Equally exciting is to be the home of the two events that command the attention of the entire country in the same year. We started calendar 2020 with the first event, the broadcast of Super Bowl 54 on Fox. We now set our focus on the second event, the news equivalent of the Super Bowl, the presidential election. Fox News has branded Democracy 2020 election coverage is already in full swing. If history is any guide, audience levels and engagement will build significantly as the cycle progresses through the upcoming primaries and caucuses, the conventions, and the presidential debates, all culminating in our election night coverage across Fox News Media on Tuesday, November 3. As we build towards November, the financial benefits are not limited to Fox News. We'll see a sizable ad revenue uplift at our local television stations. As reference, in calendar 2018, during the last midterm election, our stations collectively generated record gross political revenues in excess of $200 million, shattering the previous record set during that to 2012 Obama-Romney election by 40%. Although we are very early in the political season, we are already seeing signs of further increased political spending with a vast majority of the spend dedicated to the unmatched reach of television. We saw it on Sunday for spending in the Super Bowl on a national level and we're already been seeing it at our local stations which positions us to deliver a new record for political revenues in calendar 2020. Our confidence is further strengthened by the fact that we will soon be expanding our station footprint which already includes stations in Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, and Virginia into another perennial swing state, Wisconsin, with the previously announced acquisition of the Fox affiliate in Milwaukee. As you can tell I'm thrilled with the rapid progress that we have made and the recognition of the great value of our networks by our distribution partners. As indicated earlier, we have achieved our goals in all the distribution renewals we have completed which reflects the importance of our content to the market. But, of course, we recognized that the trends in the paid subscriber universe has an impact on our business. As you know we are dependent on our traditional and digital distribution partners and their business plans for our inclusion in their pay television retail offerings. Well I'm not going to predict where a normalized pay TV subscriber base ends up in the near- to medium-term, I know that this ecosystem will still be the large component of our revenues for some time. Nevertheless, we have begun allocating capital to expand our revenue base while reserving our subscriber fee relationships into direct-to-consumer initiatives which will grow in importance over time. FOX Nation, FOX Between, and Credible, our three recent examples of this but we continue to evaluate opportunities where Fox can bring unique value directly to consumers while sustaining existing business models. Nonetheless, there is solid growth and momentum at the company's existing digital businesses where total engagement increasing last quarter by over 40% versus the previous quarter. Fox News Digital had a record calendar 2019 beating cnn.com in both total views and minutes consumed. And for the first time, Fox News Digital averaged over 100 million unique comScore Monthly visitors. Fox Sports also had a record digital year in calendar 2019, grown both total video views across streaming and social platforms and total minutes consumed by over 20%. It was also our highest streamed regular season for the NFL on Fox with growth of 57% last - over last year and I'll refer to the Super Bowl, one more time, the game was the most streamed ever, 11.7 million users streamed all or part of the Super Bowl and 70% of their consumption was on Fox-owned platforms. While we have remain focused on executing against our operational plans and hitting our financial targets, we have also demonstrated how we look to deploy our capital to an appropriate balance of organic investment, strategic M&A return of capital to our shareholders. On the organic investment side, the previously announced $200 million to $250 million EBITDA investment began to ramp up this past quarter with the broadcast of WWE SmackDown and our investments in greater originality and co-production rights at the Fox Network, along with investment in our digital initiatives led by Fox Nation and the refresh on Fox business. In terms of strategic M&A, in October, we deployed approximately $260 million for the previously mentioned acquisition of Credible Labs. In the short time we have owned Credible Labs, we have seen the signs of the excess - exceptional growth the business is capable of. For example, during calendar 2019, Credible more than doubled its cumulative registered user base and experienced record close loan volume both of which drove substantial top line revenue growth. We have also committed around $300 million to acquire the Nexstar television stations in Seattle and Milwaukee in exchange for our station - stations in Charlotte. We expect this deal to close in the next month or so. And our commitment to return capital to our shareholders remains an integral element of our capital allocation strategy. In addition to the just announced semiannual dividend, we have now finished the initial $500 million of share repurchases that we committed to when we announced the $2 billion authorization three months ago. As we have consistently noted, we remain committed to deploying capital in a disciplined manner to maximize shareholder value through this balanced approach. Now, I will turn the call over to Steve to provide more detail on our financial results. Michael, thank you very much for the question. Two questions. John, do you want to address our success with affiliate fees, and I'll address Roku. And in light of that Michael. You know I think we can say that I'm \u2013 I know we can say that you know our announced expectation that we will do a $1 billion of additional affiliate revenue by calendar 2022, we are absolutely still expecting to hit that number and cross the hurdle. So and that's factoring in the subscriber volume declines. So I think we're really doing a terrific job in driving those affiliate fees. In regards to Roku, as you know sort of widely reported last Friday our distribution deal with Roku was expiring. We went through frankly a very normal course sort of negotiation with them not unlike the negotiations we have with all of our distributors. What happens in these negotiations and often this is what becomes public as both sides prepare for a non-resolution of the issues, but ultimately they like all of our distributors and platforms so the value of the Fox brands and content on their platform and we were able to resolve our differences and agree to a new agreement really I think to mutual benefit. Throughout it all it was very professional. We have a huge regard for Anthony Wood and his management team at Roku. We think they're doing a tremendous stake, positioned the company to really be one of the leading if not the lead beneficiary of over the top streaming and we are happy shareholders in the company. Second part of the question. You want me to take that? I'll take the affiliate. And then, Michael, on the digital question, I think we're always going to play to our strengths and our strengths are very clearly live news, live sport and big event entertainment programming. And if we - you asked do we have what we need to succeed in those sectors whether it's on the broadcast or in a direct-to-consumer experience. We have the two of the most watched channels in America the number one broadcast our network and the number one cable channel. So clearly our audiences are engaging with our content. They're engaging with our content today in a number of different forms not just broadcast. I mentioned in my earlier remarks, I think it was 11.7 million people watched the Super Bowl via streaming. Our broadcast Super Bowl of our streaming and 70% which is actually a remarkable number 70% of those - of that 11.7 million watch it on platforms that we own. So I think we are already progressing down that path. And I should also just call out Fox Nation which is obviously a really excellent sort of direct-to-consumer product out of Fox News. 80% of the people who sample Fox Nation and take a free trial, 80% of them are convert - to paid subscribers. And December and January were the two highest months in history in terms of both subscriber acquisition but also and just as importantly in terms of engagement on the platform. So, we're really very happy with how Fox Nation is progressing as well. Look, it's something what we're always looking at, but we also have an eye on not damaging the current business model where we generate still and tremendous and growing amount of revenue from our cable subscribers. So I think that we have the capability to go direct consumer. We took the technology that we built with us when we separated from Disney. We are running direct-to-consumer businesses with Fox Sports in pay-per-view with Fox Nation and in a different manner through Credible. So, we're happy where we are now, and we'll see what the future brings. I'll let John answer the buyback - the buyback piece. But I mean I don't steal your thunder, John. But we fully expect to spend the remaining amount of $1.5 billion that we have approval to buyback share so. But I'll let John give some more detail on that - on the... So - sorry, John. On the political pacing, it's really - it's very strong but it's - we're at the very beginning of it. Obviously we've seen from national advertising from both sides of the political spectrum. On the local side we haven't seen any advertising yet locally from the President's reelection campaign. But of course we've seen a lot of advertising already starting to come in from the democratic side. It's relatively short and I think it was reported in the Bloomberg campaign has expected to sort of double its advertising spend earlier this week. But the Bloomberg campaign is buying on a week-to-week basis so it's hard to predict that out. But obviously we expect it to be very strong and particularly as I mentioned in the markets of our of our local TV stations. Thanks everyone."

            "name": "Steve Tomsic",
            "content": "Thanks Lachlan, and good afternoon. As you just heard, our operating momentum continued in the second quarter and we continue to exceed the internal goals that we commence the year with. This past quarter we delivered strong top line growth led by an increase in total affiliate revenue of 7%. We achieved this growth despite aggregate industry pay TV subscribers continuing to decline at a rate in excess of 4% over calendar year to 2019. During this period, the losses across traditional distributors many of whom reported last week where at least partially offset by continued growth of digital MBPDs where subscribers have grown 2.3 million. In this past quarter, we saw digital MBPDs grow by over 1.5 million representing sequential quarterly growth of over 20%. As we've highlighted in the past, the natural seasonality of our business means the second quarter is traditionally the low watermark from an EBITDA margin standpoint. This is primarily due to the timing of broadcast sports and entertainment expenses that are concentrated in the fall season. This includes the investments in sports and entertainment content at the Fox Network which have - which as we have previously outlined, set us up well to complete our remaining distribution renewals in this cycle and achieve our longer term financial targets. Let me now take you through our second quarter results. And along the way, we remind you of some key factors that shaped the remainder of our fiscal year. In the second quarter, the company reported total revenues of $3.78 billion, up 5% over the comparative period in fiscal 2019, reflecting revenue growth across all operating segments. EBITDA was $261 million, which compares to the $445 million generated in the prior-year period. As growth at the cable segment was more than offset by lower operating results for the television segment and the impact of corporate expenses at the other segment now being reported on an actual basis. The latter reflects the costs of Fox operating as a stand-alone public company in the current year quarter. This is the presentation of carved out financial statements in the prior year. From a bottom line perspective, net income attributable to stockholders of $300 million or $0.48 per share. It was higher than the $8 million or $0.01 per share in the prior-year quarter. This growth was primarily due to the change in fair value of the company's investments recognized in other net including the Stars group and Roku which together have a current market value of approximately $1.1 billion. Excluding this impact and other onetime items, adjusted EPS of $0.10 cents was down compared to last year's $0.43 per share, reflecting the change in EBITDA and interest expense, which as we have flagged in the past now reflects the amount associated with operating a stand-alone company. So, now turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter where cable network EBITDA of $556 million was up 7% on revenue growth of 2%. Cable affiliate revenues increased 2% as the impact of higher average rates across essentially all of our brands was partially offset by the net decrease in pay television subscribers that I mentioned earlier. Assuming current subscriber volume trends continue, we continue to anticipate modestly accelerating growth in cable affiliate revenue in the second half of the fiscal year as the full impact of rate resets from recent renegotiations begin to take effect. Cable advertising revenues decreased 5% due to fewer units at FOX News Media including higher preemptions associated with its breaking news coverage of the impeachment hearings and the absence of USC programming at the national sports networks. These impacts were partially offset by strong results from our coverage of the MLB American League Championship Series between New York Yankees and Houston Astros on FOX Sports 1. Cable other revenues grew by $32 million. This increase was driven by high sports sub licensing revenue and pay-per-view boxing revenues associated with the heavyweight bout between Wilder and Ortiz as well as subscription revenues from FOX Nation. EBITDA at our cable segment increased 7% over the prior year reflecting these higher revenues while costs were essentially held flat. From a cost perspective, savings from our non-renewable of UHC programming were offset by the contractual increases on existing sports rights agreements at the national sports networks along with higher costs at FOX News Media which includes our investment in digital. It is worth noting that we anticipate elevated growth in cable segment expenses in our fiscal third quarter versus the prior year. This is driven by the increased costs at our national sports networks reflecting both contractual increases for our sports rights and the production costs of the shoulder programming around the broadcast of Super Bowl 54. It also includes increased costs of FOX News Media related to our coverage of the presidential election and continued investment in FOX Nation. The television segment reported an EBITDA loss of $214 million, higher than the loss of $40 million in the prior quarter on a revenue growth of 5%. The revenue growth was led by an 18% increase in television affiliate revenues reflecting double digit programming fee growth from non-owned station affiliates and double digit direct retransmission revenue growth at our owned and operated stations. Television advertising revenues in the quarter increased $39 million or 2%. This was achieved despite us lapping the record political advertising revenues at our owned and operated stations from the midterm elections in the prior year quarter. This result was underpinned by the very robust advertising market conditions that Lachlan just described, coupled with stronger NFL ratings, The programming successes we've delivered at FOX Entertainment a compelling seven-game World Series, and the introduction to the schedule of WWE Friday Night SmackDown. EBITDA at our television segment decreased $200 million over the prior year as an increase in expenses over of over $300 million more than offset strong revenue growth. The increase in expenses was due to the anticipated increase in sports programming amortization and production expenses led by the NFL along with investments we have made in television segment programming. During the quarter, these investments included the premiere of WWE, the expansion of original entertainment programming and our participation in coproduction arrangements with third party studios. Finally from a P&L perspective, the net EBITDA loss in our other segment amounted to$81 million which reflects a full quarter of standalone costs as oppose to the carve out basis of presentation in the corresponding quarter at the prior year. Turning now to cash flow. Over the first six months of fiscal 2020 the company generated negative free cash flow of $366 million which we calculate as net cash used in operating activities plus cash invested in property plant and equipment. As a reminder, this anticipated use of capital reflects the typical seasonality you should expect to see in the business. Here the first half of our fiscal year is impacted by the working capital deficit that results from the concentration of our annual sports rights payments, and the recognized but yet to collect peak advertising revenues that are associated with our sports and entertainment programming in the full broadcast season. These factors were reversed in the second half of our fiscal year, as we harvest cash from the collection on prior quarters advertising revenues and payments for sports rights subside resulting in a significant cash surplus. On a full-year basis we all benefit from the natural low working capital usage of our business along with our cash tax benefit and will therefore convert a significant percentage of the company's EBITDA to free cash flow. From an overall balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with just under $2 billion in cash and $6.8 billion in debt. As Lachlan mentioned earlier, we have completed the initial $500 million stock repurchase goal that we outlined three months ago comprising $350 million of Class A shares and $150 million of Class B shares. You'll also have seen that we just declared our semi-annual dividend of $0.23 a share. Finally, as part of our balanced approach to capital allocation, we closed on the acquisition of a 67% stake in Credible Labs in early October. And with regulatory approval snow secured we expect to see and close the previously announced Nexstar television stations transaction at a net purchase price of approximately $300 million. And with that, I would now like to turn the call back to Joe."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now turn the -- like to turn the conference over to our Chief Investor Relations Officer and Executive Vice President of Corporate Initiatives, Mr. Joe Dorrego. Please go ahead sir.\nJoe Dorrego: Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone and welcome to our first quarter fiscal 2020 earnings conference call. Joining me on the call today are Lachlan Murdoch, Executive Chairman and CEO; John Nallen, COO and Steve Tomsic, our CFO. First, Lachlan and Steve will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter and then we\u2019ll take questions from the investment community. Please note that this call may include forward-looking statements regarding Fox Corporation's financial performance and operating results. These statements are based on management\u2019s current expectations and actual results could differ from what is stated as a result of certain factors identified on today\u2019s call and the company\u2019s SEC filings. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA or EBITDA as we refer to it on this call. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and our SEC filings which are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. And with that, I\u2019m pleased to turn it over to Lachlan.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon, and thanks everyone for joining us today on Fox Corporation's 2020 first quarter earnings call. Our first full fiscal year as a standalone public company is off to a solid start with good positive momentum across all our businesses. We've just reported strong financial results, which Steve will comment further on shortly. But perhaps more importantly, we are making significant progress on the operational goals and strategic initiatives that we outlined to you at our Investor Day. Our strategy to build Fox around live sports, news and event programming is producing results and delivering audience growth and engagement faster than we expected. For example, we are now six weeks into the fall season and Fox's establish itself as both the number one rated broadcast network and the only Big 4 network to deliver year-on-year audience growth in the key 18 to 49 demographic and in total viewers. We're up 5% in 1,849 ratings and 10% in total viewers. This leadership position stems from the investments we're making across our network beginning with Fox Sports, which is accounted for 22 of the 50 most-watched telecast in the country since the NFL kickoff. Our ratings are up 11% across our entire portfolio of college and pro football led by Thursday Night with viewership up 22% and our Sunday broadcast which is up 8% to a 3-year high. Another new addition to the Fox Network was the debut of WWE's Friday Night SmackDown on October 4 to an average audience of nearly 4 million viewers. We are thrilled with our WWE partnership as it completes our strategy, the program live content from Thursday through Sunday in the fall. The momentum behind football and WWE continued into the second quarter with a solid major-league baseball postseason, culminating with a historic 7-Game World Series. Fox wins in adults 18 to 49 on four nights, Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, more nightly wins than any other network. The success of the network extends well beyond sport with our entertainment slate off to a great start, led by two of the top three programs on television. We are pleased to be seeing such positive signs of momentum as we execute the strategy we laid out last May. Our mix of live and near live tentpole content mixed with high quality entertainment is clearly paying dividends. The Masked Singer has returned for second season as the number one entertainment show on broadcast. And 911 is the top program on Mondays and it's the number two scripted program on all the television. And Prodigal Son is the highest-rated new broadcast program on any network this season. In fact, in entertainment programming only, Fox ranks number one over the first six weeks of the season for the first time since 2011. Speaking of number one, the Fox News Network is on track to finish the calendar year as the number one cable channel for the fourth straight year. And as the number one news channel for 18 years running. And speaking of news our station group has continued to expand the already extraordinary amount of local news we broadcast which positions us well the robust political ad market we expect next year. The real strength and value of these distinctive brands is evidenced by the momentum we've had on the distribution and affiliate renewal front where we remain on pace to achieve the targets we\u2019ve previously outlined. We have successfully renewed distribution agreements with Charter, DISH and Cox, along with affiliate agreements with Nexstar, Gray and TEGNA. In each of these renewals, we were able to achieve value that reflects the strength of our core brands. Having said that, we have seen the rate of subscriber declines in the traditional MVPD universe escalate in recent months with this quarter yielding industry declines of over 4%. But it is important to note that the subscriber losses reported by just one distributor, which accounts for approximately 25% of pay television subscribers, represent the majority of the net losses we experienced over the past 12 months. That distributor accounts for almost 80% of total losses over the last year. And without them, sub losses would decrease to about 1.3%, helped by strong gains from the leading the MVPDs. This is important because it suggests that it is too early to draw firm conclusions from a market that is still clearly fluid, especially in light of searching results from our leading digital partners. It is though something we are clearly focused on. Another area of focus is growing the company's digital revenues and businesses. I should mention that we do not include the MVPD distribution revenue in our digital results. The reach of our direct platforms has grown to over 250 million users per month with total engagement grown to over 11 billion minutes per month. Interestingly, we now see well about 10% of our streaming audience consuming the 4K stream. With very positive feedback and we're excited to be the first broadcaster ever to stream the Super Bowl in 4K. It will be a groundbreaking experience for fans. Our digital strategy inclusive of businesses like Fox Bet incredible its crucial to heightened engagement with our audiences, which is already driving meaningful growth. Year-over-year digital revenue has grown over 30% in the quarter and we continue to work to optimize our digital platforms. For the first time ever our Fox News, Fox Business and Fox Television Stations, Digital Properties are all now underpinned by the same text platforms. And FOX Sports' is being transitioned this quarter enabling us to drive improved monetization across these businesses. Of course, driving that improvement also leads us to new business models and new revenue streams. In conjunction with the kickoff of the football season, we launched a free to play Fox Sports Super 6 app nationally, which has already achieved nearly 1 million registered users and almost 10 million plays. The Stars Group is now live with the digital sports wagering service Fox Bet in both New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The proposed merger between Flutter Entertainment, the owner of FanDuel and our partner of the Stars Group will create many opportunities for us. We are excited to develop the Fox Bet brand in partnership with FanDuel and are confident in the dual brand strategy to capitalize on the rapidly growing sports wagering market. Over a month ago, Fox Business debuted a brand refresh across its linear and digital platforms, including a new logo and tagline invested in EU. As part of this initiative, FoxBusiness.com and the Fox Business app were launched with new content and editorial tools to drive engagement. The initial performance of the relaunch digital properties has been encouraging. As we have seen substantial increases in page views and in unique users. A core part of our strategy for FoxBusiness.com is our acquisition of Credible Labs, which closed a few weeks ago. We are now beginning the process of integrating its service with our core businesses starting with Fox Business. While we\u2019ve remained focused on executing against our operational plans, we also continue to make progress towards other strategic initiatives, while maintaining a balanced approach to capital allocation. To further strengthen our portfolio of assets, yesterday we announced agreement with Nexstar to acquire their local television stations in their Seattle and Milwaukee markets. In return, we've agreed to sell them our stations in the Charlotte market, which geographically aligns with Nexstar's existing operations in the Carolinas and in Virginia. It's a great deal for both companies and a rare win-win. This acquisition expand the reach of one of Fox's core assets, our television stations portfolio and further strengthens what is already a highly profitable and cash generative business. This transaction will expand our market presence to 14 of the top 15 DMAs, and importantly, adds two major markets with NFL, Major-League Baseball, Pack 12 and Big 10 teams. Finally consistent with the timing we laid out at our Investor Day, we have today announced that our Board of Directors has authorized a $2 billion stock repurchase program. We are pleased to have the buyback authorization formerly in place as part of our capital took kit. The company also announced its intend to complete $500 million of stock repurchases in the near-term. In light of all the positive momentum I\u2019ve just touched upon, in Light of our success of the network at sports, at news and in our growing station group, in light of our market-leading investments in sports gaming and in the Credible marketplace, and in light of the unique cash benefits of our tax structure, we believe we are undervalued in respect to our peers and to other investment opportunities available to us at this time. This buyback reflects both our confidence in the long-term strength of our business and our commitment to finding the most efficient use of our capital. We remain committed to deploying capital in a disciplined manner to maximize shareholder value to a balanced approach of organic investment, accretive AMA and return of capital to our stockholders. We will not follow a prescribed formula of deployment, instead we will be opportunistic and invest capital where we feel the company can achieve the greatest return on investment. Now, Steve will provide more detail on our financial results.\nSteve Tomsic: Thanks, Lachlan, good afternoon. We\u2019ve made a solid start to fiscal 2020. And notwithstanding the subscriber headwinds Lachlan just mentioned, overall we are exceeding our internal plans that we commenced the year with. We delivered healthy top line and double-digit EBITDA growth in the first quarter, which sets us up well for the remainder of fiscal 2020. Let me now take you through our results and along the way remind you of some key factors that shaped the rest of that fiscal year. In the first quarter, the company reported a total revenues of $2.7 billion, up 5% over the comparative. In fiscal 2019, reflecting revenue growth across all operating segments. EBITDA was $856 million, a 12% increase over the $761 million generated in the prior year, led by high contributions from the television and cable segment. This growth was partially offset by higher corporate expenses reported in the other segment, which reflect the cost of Fox operating as a standalone public company in the current year quarter. This is the presentation of carve-out financial statements in the prior year, From the bottom line perspective, net income attributable to stockholders of $499 million or $0.80 per share was lower than the $604 million or $0.97 per share in the prior year quarter. This decrease was primarily attributable to $115 million reduction in the unrealized gain recognized in other net related to the changing fair value of the company's investment in Roku. Excluding this impact and other one-time items, adjusted EPS of $0.83 was up slightly over last year's $0.82 per share as a strong operating performance was largely offset by below the line item such as interest and tax expense which as we\u2019ve flagged in the past, now reflect the full amount associated with operating as a standalone company. So now turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter. Where company network EBITDA of $684 million, was up 8% on revenue growth of 2%,. The revenue increase was led by other revenue growth of $30 million, This increase was driven by pay-per-view boxing revenues, including the Pacquiao-Thurman bout that took place on July, along with increased sports of licensing revenues and subscription revenues from Fox Nation. Cable affiliate revenues were in line with those in the prior year quarter. As the impact of higher average rates across essentially all of our brand, was offset by the net decrease in pay television subscribers that Lachlan mentioned earlier. Sorry material changes in current subscriber trends, we anticipate a return to growth in cable affiliate revenue in the second half of the fiscal year as rate resets from recent renegotiations begin to take effect. Cable advertising revenues decreased 4% reflecting lower contributions from the women's FIFA World Cup in the current year as compared to the men's tournament in the prior year along with the absence of UFC programming at the national sports networks. EBITDA at our cable segment increased 8% over the prior year, reflecting the higher revenues and a 5% reduction in cost. The decrease in expenses was attributable to lower rise in production costs related to the men's FIFA World Cup in the prior year quarter and the absence of UFC programming in the current year quarter, partially offset by contractual increases on existing sports rights agreements. The television segment EBITDA was $251 million, an increase of $80 million or 47% from the prior your quarter on the back of revenue growth of 6%. The revenue growth was led by a 40% increase in television affiliate revenues, reflecting double-digit programming fee growth from non-owned station affiliates and double-digit direct retransmission revenue growth at our owned and operated stations. This growth is consistent with the overall TV affiliate revenue trajectory we laid out that our Investor Day in May where we announced our expectation to deliver revenues of approximately $2.65 billion by calendar year 2022. Other revenues in the television segment grew by $34 million driven by higher digital content licensing revenues and revenues from our recently acquired Animation Studio, Bento Box. As expected, advertising revenues in the quarter decreased by $12 million or 2%/ This higher entertainment advertising revenues which include the impact of the broadcast of the Emmy awards on Fox. We are more than offset by the several expected cyclical factors versus the quarter a year-ago. These include the impacts of political advertising revenues at the local stations related to the 2018 mid-term elections and more people will cap matches in the prior year quarter. Television segment expenses were in line with prior year amounts. There is a contractual increases on existing sports rights agreements and expenses associated with the broadcast of the Emmy awards. We are offset by the absence of the rights expense associated with the broadcast of the men's FIFA World cup in the prior year quarter. Well, most of you are already aware, at this point it is worth remembering that seasonal and cyclical factors have a particularly pronounced impact on our quarterly results in our television segment. This will be most visible in our Q2 results with the impact of higher sports rights and production expenses at the Fox network reflecting the contractual annual escalators on the NFL major-league baseball and college football contracts. And the addition of WWE rights as well as lower political advertising revenue at our local television stations when compared to the prior year. Finally from a P&L perspective, the net EBITDA loss in our other segment amounted to $79 million, which reflects the full quarter of standalone costs as opposed to the carve-out basis of presentation in the corresponding quarter last year. A strong overall P&L results generated free cash flow which we calculate as net cash provided by operating activity, less cash invested in property plant and equipment of just over $160 million in this quarter. The modest rate of conversion of EBITDA to free cash flow of approximately 20%, reflects the typical seasonality you should expect to see in the business. Here our first and second quarter cash flow are impacted by the working capital deficit from sports rights payments and the timing of cash collections and advertising revenue, which both reverse in the second half of that fiscal year. On a full-year basis, we continue to expect to benefit from natural low working capital usage, along with that cash tax benefit. From an overall balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $3.3 billion in cash and $6.8 billion in debt. As Lachlan mentioned earlier, in the very near-term we will be deploying $500 million of cash on hand to the buyback of both A and B class share. To do this, we\u2019ve entered into an accelerated stock repurchase transaction to buy back $350 million of the company's Class A common stock and intend to promptly repurchase approximately $150 million of Class B common stock. Additionally, as part of that balanced capital allocation approach and as we announced yesterday, approximately $300 million of capital will be directed to the Nexstar television stations transaction, which we expect to close in the second half of this fiscal year. And in October, we closed the acquisition of a 67% stake in Credible Labs for approximately $260 million. And with that, I'd now like to return it back to Joe.\nJoe Dorrego: Thanks, Joe. Operator, we would be happy to take questions from the investment community.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And we will go to the line of Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thanks so much. One question. I guess for Lachlan and John, I\u2019m just curious for an update on the progress on investment spending, how much -- was the September core of a proportion to the year in terms of the investment spending that you laid out at the Analysts Day and how are each of those investments doing Lachlan or you already touched on WWE, but in terms of the program investment and in terms of Fox Nation would love to get an update. Thank you.\nLachlan Murdoch: Hey, Doug, I will let Steve tackle on.\nSteve Tomsic: Doug, listen in terms of the amount of investment spending actually deployed in the quarter is actually relatively modest. We called out at the Investor Day, somewhere between $200 million and $250 million of net EBITDA investment over the court to that year. And I would say, less than 10% of that was deployed over the quarter you will see a significant amount of that come through in the quarter we are in now. Because we obviously got WWE that launched on October 4. We are now right in the middle of the full schedule and entertainment programming in Fox Nation, we continue to build in terms of the programming in the marketing.\nJoe Dorrego: We can go to the next question, please.\nOperator: And we will go to the line of Jessica Reese Erlich with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJessica Reese Erlich: Thank you. One question, it's a tough one. So maybe a multipart. Can you give us color on -- we saw the advertising numbers for this quarter. But as you look out to the second quarter and the third quarter with Super Bowl. I mean, given your rating in the upfront can you just give us some color on what\u2019s going on and you have a new advertising structure, which seems to be working well. And then anything you can say on -- any movement and discussions on the NFL negotiations would be great. Any color there?\nLachlan Murdoch: Great, Jessica. Those aren't tough questions. So I'm happy to take them. So thank you. Look, from an advertising point of view talk a little bit about Super Bowl in a second, but in the quarter, despite some of the comparison that Steve mentioned in his earlier comments, advertising has been quite strong, particularly across the entertainment and sports categories. We had a very successful upfront with entertainment pricing up double digits. And with sports pricing up high single digits, which we be very pleased to achieve. In addition, that one of the critical goals of our upfront was also to set the WWE pricing to broadcast pricing, not cable pricing and we did that very successfully. Categories in the market are -- a number of categories are incredibly strong. The streaming services with Disney, Netflix and Apple are recently being spending good money. The tech sector, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, very strong clients. Pharmaceutical has been strong, they have been moving some of the money between demographics. So from -- some money out of news, but on to -- on the sports and entertainment. And of course the financial services sector. Clients like GEICO, Progressive, State Farm have also been -- being spending good money and supporting us very well. So we are happy with where we\u2019re haven\u2019t mentioned news. News, pricing and the upfront was up mid single-digits. The news market as advertising market is softer, then in entertainment and in sport, we think that\u2019s because of some of the ratings deficiencies at our competitors that are some volume has been given away more cheaply than we would agree to. So we were finding the news market softer than sports and news. Pacing in the -- sorry in the quarter, our scatter pricing was up about 25%. There's very little scatter, so it's a good statistic. And going forward, it is lower than that, but still up -- well above the upfront, which leads us to the Super Bowl. We are well ahead of last year's or so -- we -- obviously we don\u2019t know last year as our competitor, but we\u2019re well ahead of our last Super Bowl, where we were selling at this stage in the year. We're sold out of all of our A positions, and we\u2019ve really good momentum as we continue to sell the Super Bowl. So we are very confident that the pricing will be -- I don\u2019t want to give the number, but they're quite the pricing will certainly be the highest cost per 30 second ad in a Super Bowl to date. So we are very pleased with that. On the NFL, we don't have an update for you terms of where we are with negotiations. Obviously, we're engaged with the NFL everyday as we broadcast their fixtures. And -- but negotiations with the NFL in terms of a renewal of any of the packages has not started yet.\nOperator: And next we will go to the line of Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nMichael Nathanson: Thanks. I\u2019m going to ask a couple around Nexstar. So you talk a bit about the accretion math behind the station swap? And do you move to Fox's retrans rate card right away? And is that higher than Nexstar's rate card? And then lastly, beside from rate retrains step ups, if there are any. are there any benefits you derive from getting in those markets. You called out the geographic footprint, but I want to know like what is that drive? What is that benefit you from changing the location of these markets?\nSteve Tomsic: Hey, Michael, it's Steve here. In terms of the retrans benefit, it pretty much is a straight move from taking what they were paying us from those stations from a programming fee perspective and then assuming them into our retrans rates. That's a pretty immediate impact and synergy benefit of taking the station on to their balance sheet. So adversely hits our P&L from day one. Remember though, this won't close until later in the fiscal year. So you probably won't see much of that in fiscal '20.\nJohn Nallen: And Michael, its John. Adding those key markets which were pretty well missed, the only one who's missing when you look at our footprint, particularly for the NFL and the other sports we are in, is just a big revenue upside for us. It helps on both national and a local level. And we achieved cost synergies to given the size of the station group that we have, we just would naturally achieve some cost synergies there.\nJoe Dorrego: We can go to the next question.\nOperator: Yes, sir. Next we will go to the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.\nBen Swinburne: Thank you. Good afternoon. Just on the buyback and sort of the balance sheet, you guys talked about a $1.5 billion minimum cash balance at the Investor Day. As you noted, you guys are over 3. And I think even after the ASR, the acquisitions you've announced the dividend you\u2019re still not even spending your free cash flow this year at least up on our numbers. So I\u2019m just wondering if you have any timeline in mind or sense of urgency about optimizing the balance sheet from a cash debt perspective? It's a not sort of way of me trying to figure out how fast you\u2019re going to buyback your stock obviously. So \u2026\nLachlan Murdoch: [Indiscernible]. But look the buyback is just one element of our overall discipline balanced allocation of our capital. So today we're pleased to announce that authorization and the deployment of the $500 million and I'd remind you that this announcement is right in line with the timetable that we had established. It's been well developed by our Board, established in the best interest of all our shareholders and with its adoption ongoing authorizations will be determined as an ordinary course matter with the Board. Now to deal with your question, specifically, while we fully expect to complete the authorization, we won't follow a formulaic approach to any current or future buyback deployment. It just doesn't make any sense to us. So we will invest our capital where we feel we can generate the greatest long-term return and our investment for our shareholders and amongst the various legs of disciplined and balanced capital allocation.\nJoe Dorrego: I think we can go to the next question.\nOperator: And we will go to the line of Rich Greenfield with LightShed.\nBrandon Ross: Hey, guys. It's Brandon Ross. Its Brandon.\nLachlan Murdoch: Welcome back.\nBrandon Ross: Thank you. First on FS1. So Disney took UFC from you guys and recently took Bundesliga, and I'm pretty sure they renewed with Formula One. So just -- can you help us with how you plan to fill the programming hole there? And then thinking about the Super 6 mobile game that you guys launched, which looks like an on-ramp to legalized betting for you guys. Can you give us any takeaways that you've learned so far there? Thanks.\nLachlan Murdoch: So let me just start with Fox Sports One. I would -- politely respectfully disagree with you in terms of sort of any of kind of programming hole. The Fox Sports One programming lineup is pretty impressive. Huge amount of college sports, huge amount of NASCAR, for instance primary home of our NASCAR programming boxing. And so we're very pleased with the programming on Fox Sports One. We will obviously look at continuing to strengthen that as opportunities that are fit with our program strategy emerge. So we are pleased with where Fox Sports One sits today. And I think our distributors are, if you look at the renewals across all of our affiliate renewals, I mean, on Fox Sports One continues to drive increases in affiliate fees and rate. So our affiliates agree with us. And sorry which was the question on ...?\nJohn Nallen: On Super 6.\nLachlan Murdoch: On Super 6.\nJohn Nallen: Yes.\nLachlan Murdoch: So, yes, Super 6 has been incredibly successful. If you look at the strategy of any of these Fox spend, if you look at what the strategy was in Sky in Britain and other countries where legalized sports, digital sports wagering has occurred. Having a free to play game at sort of the top of the phone to attract users is critically important, having with Super 6 and the success the very early and rapid success of Super 6, I think bodes very well to dropping from those users down into Fox Bet for pay game. So we are pleased with Super 6 and we are pleased with Fox Bet. I should mention and I didn\u2019t -- I was remiss not to mention this to in response to Jessica's question, already if you look just in the New York, New Jersey market really for the New Jersey sports betting there are already 13 active gaming advertisers. And so, one of the reasons we were quite pleased about this liberalization of sports wagering rules state-by-state is not only do we think we will gain tremendous long-term value through Fox Bet, but also just from an advertising point of view, we are now seeing several million dollars year-to-date already start to flow through in only the very limited number of states where sports wagering is legalized.\nJoe Dorrego: Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Okay. And that will be from the line of Jon Hollick with UBS. Please go ahead.\nJon Hollick:  Okay. Thanks, guys. Maybe on the affiliate side, I guess, did 4.3% growth this quarter. I think in the last you guys said 7 percentage sort of in the mix. Obviously a lot of moving parts. Maybe talk about -- a little bit about the renewals you guys have talked about when that you should see that hit -- impact the P&L? And yes, that 7% still a good guide for the year? Thanks.\nSteve Tomsic: Hey, Jon, it's Steve. I think -- that\u2019s around the mark. You should see the pattern here and it's a similar pattern to what we saw last year, which is September quarter and December quarter pretty flat for us, and you should see -- so you should expect December this year to be a similar kind of performance for us. But then with renegotiations that we\u2019ve just done, which Lachlan outlined in his opening remarks, the right resets that we get out of those renegotiations really begin to kick in at the start of the calendar next year. So when you look at the first half, second half growth rate, the growth rate will absolutely be skewed to that that second half and in particular at third quarter, where you will see the benefit of those rate resets really kicking. Again, it will be skewed towards retransmission growth as against cable affiliate. But we feel pretty comfortable where we are after the full-year and also that $2.65 billion target for calendar '22.\nJoe Dorrego: At this point we are out of time. Thank you everybody for joining today's call. If you have any further questions, please give Dan Carey or me a call. Speak -- talk to you next quarter.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference call for today. Again, thank you very much for your participation and for using the AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Lachlan Murdoch",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon, and thanks everyone for joining us today on Fox Corporation's 2020 first quarter earnings call. Our first full fiscal year as a standalone public company is off to a solid start with good positive momentum across all our businesses. We've just reported strong financial results, which Steve will comment further on shortly. But perhaps more importantly, we are making significant progress on the operational goals and strategic initiatives that we outlined to you at our Investor Day. Our strategy to build Fox around live sports, news and event programming is producing results and delivering audience growth and engagement faster than we expected. For example, we are now six weeks into the fall season and Fox's establish itself as both the number one rated broadcast network and the only Big 4 network to deliver year-on-year audience growth in the key 18 to 49 demographic and in total viewers. We're up 5% in 1,849 ratings and 10% in total viewers. This leadership position stems from the investments we're making across our network beginning with Fox Sports, which is accounted for 22 of the 50 most-watched telecast in the country since the NFL kickoff. Our ratings are up 11% across our entire portfolio of college and pro football led by Thursday Night with viewership up 22% and our Sunday broadcast which is up 8% to a 3-year high. Another new addition to the Fox Network was the debut of WWE's Friday Night SmackDown on October 4 to an average audience of nearly 4 million viewers. We are thrilled with our WWE partnership as it completes our strategy, the program live content from Thursday through Sunday in the fall. The momentum behind football and WWE continued into the second quarter with a solid major-league baseball postseason, culminating with a historic 7-Game World Series. Fox wins in adults 18 to 49 on four nights, Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, more nightly wins than any other network. The success of the network extends well beyond sport with our entertainment slate off to a great start, led by two of the top three programs on television. We are pleased to be seeing such positive signs of momentum as we execute the strategy we laid out last May. Our mix of live and near live tentpole content mixed with high quality entertainment is clearly paying dividends. The Masked Singer has returned for second season as the number one entertainment show on broadcast. And 911 is the top program on Mondays and it's the number two scripted program on all the television. And Prodigal Son is the highest-rated new broadcast program on any network this season. In fact, in entertainment programming only, Fox ranks number one over the first six weeks of the season for the first time since 2011. Speaking of number one, the Fox News Network is on track to finish the calendar year as the number one cable channel for the fourth straight year. And as the number one news channel for 18 years running. And speaking of news our station group has continued to expand the already extraordinary amount of local news we broadcast which positions us well the robust political ad market we expect next year. The real strength and value of these distinctive brands is evidenced by the momentum we've had on the distribution and affiliate renewal front where we remain on pace to achieve the targets we've previously outlined. We have successfully renewed distribution agreements with Charter, DISH and Cox, along with affiliate agreements with Nexstar, Gray and TEGNA. In each of these renewals, we were able to achieve value that reflects the strength of our core brands. Having said that, we have seen the rate of subscriber declines in the traditional MVPD universe escalate in recent months with this quarter yielding industry declines of over 4%. But it is important to note that the subscriber losses reported by just one distributor, which accounts for approximately 25% of pay television subscribers, represent the majority of the net losses we experienced over the past 12 months. That distributor accounts for almost 80% of total losses over the last year. And without them, sub losses would decrease to about 1.3%, helped by strong gains from the leading the MVPDs. This is important because it suggests that it is too early to draw firm conclusions from a market that is still clearly fluid, especially in light of searching results from our leading digital partners. It is though something we are clearly focused on. Another area of focus is growing the company's digital revenues and businesses. I should mention that we do not include the MVPD distribution revenue in our digital results. The reach of our direct platforms has grown to over 250 million users per month with total engagement grown to over 11 billion minutes per month. Interestingly, we now see well about 10% of our streaming audience consuming the 4K stream. With very positive feedback and we're excited to be the first broadcaster ever to stream the Super Bowl in 4K. It will be a groundbreaking experience for fans. Our digital strategy inclusive of businesses like Fox Bet incredible its crucial to heightened engagement with our audiences, which is already driving meaningful growth. Year-over-year digital revenue has grown over 30% in the quarter and we continue to work to optimize our digital platforms. For the first time ever our Fox News, Fox Business and Fox Television Stations, Digital Properties are all now underpinned by the same text platforms. And FOX Sports' is being transitioned this quarter enabling us to drive improved monetization across these businesses. Of course, driving that improvement also leads us to new business models and new revenue streams. In conjunction with the kickoff of the football season, we launched a free to play Fox Sports Super 6 app nationally, which has already achieved nearly 1 million registered users and almost 10 million plays. The Stars Group is now live with the digital sports wagering service Fox Bet in both New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The proposed merger between Flutter Entertainment, the owner of FanDuel and our partner of the Stars Group will create many opportunities for us. We are excited to develop the Fox Bet brand in partnership with FanDuel and are confident in the dual brand strategy to capitalize on the rapidly growing sports wagering market. Over a month ago, Fox Business debuted a brand refresh across its linear and digital platforms, including a new logo and tagline invested in EU. As part of this initiative, FoxBusiness.com and the Fox Business app were launched with new content and editorial tools to drive engagement. The initial performance of the relaunch digital properties has been encouraging. As we have seen substantial increases in page views and in unique users. A core part of our strategy for FoxBusiness.com is our acquisition of Credible Labs, which closed a few weeks ago. We are now beginning the process of integrating its service with our core businesses starting with Fox Business. While we've remained focused on executing against our operational plans, we also continue to make progress towards other strategic initiatives, while maintaining a balanced approach to capital allocation. To further strengthen our portfolio of assets, yesterday we announced agreement with Nexstar to acquire their local television stations in their Seattle and Milwaukee markets. In return, we've agreed to sell them our stations in the Charlotte market, which geographically aligns with Nexstar's existing operations in the Carolinas and in Virginia. It's a great deal for both companies and a rare win-win. This acquisition expand the reach of one of Fox's core assets, our television stations portfolio and further strengthens what is already a highly profitable and cash generative business. This transaction will expand our market presence to 14 of the top 15 DMAs, and importantly, adds two major markets with NFL, Major-League Baseball, Pack 12 and Big 10 teams. Finally consistent with the timing we laid out at our Investor Day, we have today announced that our Board of Directors has authorized a $2 billion stock repurchase program. We are pleased to have the buyback authorization formerly in place as part of our capital took kit. The company also announced its intend to complete $500 million of stock repurchases in the near-term. In light of all the positive momentum I've just touched upon, in Light of our success of the network at sports, at news and in our growing station group, in light of our market-leading investments in sports gaming and in the Credible marketplace, and in light of the unique cash benefits of our tax structure, we believe we are undervalued in respect to our peers and to other investment opportunities available to us at this time. This buyback reflects both our confidence in the long-term strength of our business and our commitment to finding the most efficient use of our capital. We remain committed to deploying capital in a disciplined manner to maximize shareholder value to a balanced approach of organic investment, accretive AMA and return of capital to our stockholders. We will not follow a prescribed formula of deployment, instead we will be opportunistic and invest capital where we feel the company can achieve the greatest return on investment. Now, Steve will provide more detail on our financial results. Hey, Doug, I will let Steve tackle on. Great, Jessica. Those aren't tough questions. So I'm happy to take them. So thank you. Look, from an advertising point of view talk a little bit about Super Bowl in a second, but in the quarter, despite some of the comparison that Steve mentioned in his earlier comments, advertising has been quite strong, particularly across the entertainment and sports categories. We had a very successful upfront with entertainment pricing up double digits. And with sports pricing up high single digits, which we be very pleased to achieve. In addition, that one of the critical goals of our upfront was also to set the WWE pricing to broadcast pricing, not cable pricing and we did that very successfully. Categories in the market are -- a number of categories are incredibly strong. The streaming services with Disney, Netflix and Apple are recently being spending good money. The tech sector, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, very strong clients. Pharmaceutical has been strong, they have been moving some of the money between demographics. So from -- some money out of news, but on to -- on the sports and entertainment. And of course the financial services sector. Clients like GEICO, Progressive, State Farm have also been -- being spending good money and supporting us very well. So we are happy with where we're haven't mentioned news. News, pricing and the upfront was up mid single-digits. The news market as advertising market is softer, then in entertainment and in sport, we think that's because of some of the ratings deficiencies at our competitors that are some volume has been given away more cheaply than we would agree to. So we were finding the news market softer than sports and news. Pacing in the -- sorry in the quarter, our scatter pricing was up about 25%. There's very little scatter, so it's a good statistic. And going forward, it is lower than that, but still up -- well above the upfront, which leads us to the Super Bowl. We are well ahead of last year's or so -- we -- obviously we don't know last year as our competitor, but we're well ahead of our last Super Bowl, where we were selling at this stage in the year. We're sold out of all of our A positions, and we've really good momentum as we continue to sell the Super Bowl. So we are very confident that the pricing will be -- I don't want to give the number, but they're quite the pricing will certainly be the highest cost per 30 second ad in a Super Bowl to date. So we are very pleased with that. On the NFL, we don't have an update for you terms of where we are with negotiations. Obviously, we're engaged with the NFL everyday as we broadcast their fixtures. And -- but negotiations with the NFL in terms of a renewal of any of the packages has not started yet. [Indiscernible]. But look the buyback is just one element of our overall discipline balanced allocation of our capital.

            "name": "Steve Tomsic",
            "content": "Thanks, Lachlan, good afternoon. We've made a solid start to fiscal 2020. And notwithstanding the subscriber headwinds Lachlan just mentioned, overall we are exceeding our internal plans that we commenced the year with. We delivered healthy top line and double-digit EBITDA growth in the first quarter, which sets us up well for the remainder of fiscal 2020. Let me now take you through our results and along the way remind you of some key factors that shaped the rest of that fiscal year. In the first quarter, the company reported a total revenues of $2.7 billion, up 5% over the comparative. In fiscal 2019, reflecting revenue growth across all operating segments. EBITDA was $856 million, a 12% increase over the $761 million generated in the prior year, led by high contributions from the television and cable segment. This growth was partially offset by higher corporate expenses reported in the other segment, which reflect the cost of Fox operating as a standalone public company in the current year quarter. This is the presentation of carve-out financial statements in the prior year, From the bottom line perspective, net income attributable to stockholders of $499 million or $0.80 per share was lower than the $604 million or $0.97 per share in the prior year quarter. This decrease was primarily attributable to $115 million reduction in the unrealized gain recognized in other net related to the changing fair value of the company's investment in Roku. Excluding this impact and other one-time items, adjusted EPS of $0.83 was up slightly over last year's $0.82 per share as a strong operating performance was largely offset by below the line item such as interest and tax expense which as we've flagged in the past, now reflect the full amount associated with operating as a standalone company. So now turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter. Where company network EBITDA of $684 million, was up 8% on revenue growth of 2%,. The revenue increase was led by other revenue growth of $30 million, This increase was driven by pay-per-view boxing revenues, including the Pacquiao-Thurman bout that took place on July, along with increased sports of licensing revenues and subscription revenues from Fox Nation. Cable affiliate revenues were in line with those in the prior year quarter. As the impact of higher average rates across essentially all of our brand, was offset by the net decrease in pay television subscribers that Lachlan mentioned earlier. Sorry material changes in current subscriber trends, we anticipate a return to growth in cable affiliate revenue in the second half of the fiscal year as rate resets from recent renegotiations begin to take effect. Cable advertising revenues decreased 4% reflecting lower contributions from the women's FIFA World Cup in the current year as compared to the men's tournament in the prior year along with the absence of UFC programming at the national sports networks. EBITDA at our cable segment increased 8% over the prior year, reflecting the higher revenues and a 5% reduction in cost. The decrease in expenses was attributable to lower rise in production costs related to the men's FIFA World Cup in the prior year quarter and the absence of UFC programming in the current year quarter, partially offset by contractual increases on existing sports rights agreements. The television segment EBITDA was $251 million, an increase of $80 million or 47% from the prior your quarter on the back of revenue growth of 6%. The revenue growth was led by a 40% increase in television affiliate revenues, reflecting double-digit programming fee growth from non-owned station affiliates and double-digit direct retransmission revenue growth at our owned and operated stations. This growth is consistent with the overall TV affiliate revenue trajectory we laid out that our Investor Day in May where we announced our expectation to deliver revenues of approximately $2.65 billion by calendar year 2022. Other revenues in the television segment grew by $34 million driven by higher digital content licensing revenues and revenues from our recently acquired Animation Studio, Bento Box. As expected, advertising revenues in the quarter decreased by $12 million or 2%/ This higher entertainment advertising revenues which include the impact of the broadcast of the Emmy awards on Fox. We are more than offset by the several expected cyclical factors versus the quarter a year-ago. These include the impacts of political advertising revenues at the local stations related to the 2018 mid-term elections and more people will cap matches in the prior year quarter. Television segment expenses were in line with prior year amounts. There is a contractual increases on existing sports rights agreements and expenses associated with the broadcast of the Emmy awards. We are offset by the absence of the rights expense associated with the broadcast of the men's FIFA World cup in the prior year quarter. Well, most of you are already aware, at this point it is worth remembering that seasonal and cyclical factors have a particularly pronounced impact on our quarterly results in our television segment. This will be most visible in our Q2 results with the impact of higher sports rights and production expenses at the Fox network reflecting the contractual annual escalators on the NFL major-league baseball and college football contracts. And the addition of WWE rights as well as lower political advertising revenue at our local television stations when compared to the prior year. Finally from a P&L perspective, the net EBITDA loss in our other segment amounted to $79 million, which reflects the full quarter of standalone costs as opposed to the carve-out basis of presentation in the corresponding quarter last year. A strong overall P&L results generated free cash flow which we calculate as net cash provided by operating activity, less cash invested in property plant and equipment of just over $160 million in this quarter. The modest rate of conversion of EBITDA to free cash flow of approximately 20%, reflects the typical seasonality you should expect to see in the business. Here our first and second quarter cash flow are impacted by the working capital deficit from sports rights payments and the timing of cash collections and advertising revenue, which both reverse in the second half of that fiscal year. On a full-year basis, we continue to expect to benefit from natural low working capital usage, along with that cash tax benefit. From an overall balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $3.3 billion in cash and $6.8 billion in debt. As Lachlan mentioned earlier, in the very near-term we will be deploying $500 million of cash on hand to the buyback of both A and B class share. To do this, we've entered into an accelerated stock repurchase transaction to buy back $350 million of the company's Class A common stock and intend to promptly repurchase approximately $150 million of Class B common stock. Additionally, as part of that balanced capital allocation approach and as we announced yesterday, approximately $300 million of capital will be directed to the Nexstar television stations transaction, which we expect to close in the second half of this fiscal year. And in October, we closed the acquisition of a 67% stake in Credible Labs for approximately $260 million. And with that, I'd now like to return it back to Joe. Doug, listen in terms of the amount of investment spending actually deployed in the quarter is actually relatively modest. We called out at the Investor Day, somewhere between $200 million and $250 million of net EBITDA investment over the court to that year. And I would say, less than 10% of that was deployed over the quarter you will see a significant amount of that come through in the quarter we are in now. Because we obviously got WWE that launched on October 4. We are now right in the middle of the full schedule and entertainment programming in Fox Nation, we continue to build in terms of the programming in the marketing. Hey, Michael, it's Steve here. In terms of the retrans benefit, it pretty much is a straight move from taking what they were paying us from those stations from a programming fee perspective and then assuming them into our retrans rates. That's a pretty immediate impact and synergy benefit of taking the station on to their balance sheet. So adversely hits our P&L from day one. Remember though, this won't close until later in the fiscal year. So you probably won't see much of that in fiscal '20. Hey, Jon, it's Steve. I think -- that's around the mark. You should see the pattern here and it's a similar pattern to what we saw last year, which is September quarter and December quarter pretty flat for us, and you should see -- so you should expect December this year to be a similar kind of performance for us. But then with renegotiations that we've just done, which Lachlan outlined in his opening remarks, the right resets that we get out of those renegotiations really begin to kick in at the start of the calendar next year. So when you look at the first half, second half growth rate, the growth rate will absolutely be skewed to that that second half and in particular at third quarter, where you will see the benefit of those rate resets really kicking. Again, it will be skewed towards retransmission growth as against cable affiliate. But we feel pretty comfortable where we are after the full-year and also that $2.65 billion target for calendar '22."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I would like to emphasize that functionality for the question-and-answer queue will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now turn the conference over to Chief Investor Relations Officer, Mr. Joe Dorrego. Please go ahead, sir.\nJoe Dorrego: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and welcome to our fiscal 2021 fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me on the call today are Lachlan Murdoch, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Nallen, Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Tomsic, our Chief Financial Officer. First, Lachlan and Steve will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter, and then we'll take questions from the investment community.  Please note that this call may include forward-looking statements regarding Fox Corporation's financial performance and operating results. These statements are based on management's current expectations, and actual results could differ from what is stated as a result of certain factors identified on today's call and in the company's SEC filings. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA, or EBITDA as we refer to it on this call. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and our SEC filings, both of which are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Lachlan.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 results. At the outset, I want to emphasize the exceptional financial and operational results that we have delivered over the last year despite the challenges posed operating through the COVID-19 pandemic.  The virus brought significant impact to our productions, to our processes and to our people. However, we stayed resolute and focused and demonstrated that, even in the most unexpected and challenging of times, our focus on a handful of powerful, highly engaging brands produces exceptional results.  Over the past fiscal year, we have reinforced the competitive advantages of our core brands, enhanced our digital capabilities, solidified our growth potential, returned $1.25 billion of capital to shareholders through buybacks and dividends, and otherwise prudently allocated our capital.  We have a strongly differentiated position in the market, which continues to benefit us to no end. But our greatest strength is our people who have really stood up this year and performed extremely well under such difficult circumstances. I know myself, my father, the board, and the management team appreciate all their hard work and all their achievements this year.  In fiscal 2021, we generated revenue and profit which exceeded even our own bullish expectations. Our affiliate revenue increased 9% year-over-year, which is net of the distribution credits that we recognized last fall due to COVID.  Our advertising revenue was up 2%, which is tremendous when you recall that we broadcast the Superbowl in the prior fiscal year, during which we generated around $500 million of net advertising revenue.  Importantly, the fiscal fourth quarter saw these trends accelerate, as quarterly revenues increased 20%, led once again by double digit affiliate revenue growth and advertising revenue growth of 38%. This growth was underpinned by the ability of our core businesses to consistently deliver audiences at scale and capture the upward momentum of a rallying advertising market.  We finished the fiscal year with historically strong upfront sales and are currently also enjoying sustained scattered demand with pricing at significant premiums. We finished the fiscal year strong and we feel we are in a very good place \u2013 or we are in a very good place with great momentum starting the new fiscal year.  FOX News Media continued its ratings leadership and its multi-platform growth in the fourth quarter. The FOX News channel was the most watched network in primetime across all of basic cable for the sixth consecutive year, and notched its 78th straight quarter as the leading cable news channel in total viewers.  While the year-over-year ratings comparisons are difficult due to last year's heightened news cycle, the FOX News channel has retained more of its audience than CNN and MSNBC since the presidential election. In fact, since the election, FOX News has solidified his leadership position in cable news, having reasserted its pre-election market share.  For total day audiences, FOX News increased its market share by 11% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year, while CNN and MSNBC lost 9% and 3% respectively over that same period. From a primetime perspective, we once again find ourselves in a familiar position, as we routinely see our ratings exceeding those of our peers combined.  We were also pleased with the performance of FOX News Media's digital assets. FOX News remained the most engaged news brand across social media channels, extending this run to nearly seven consecutive years. This is a critical pathway to reaching, engaging and growing the broadest possible audiences with the FOX News brand.  On the last call, I told you that Fox Nation, the direct-to-consumer offering from FOX News Media had recorded its strongest quarter for customer acquisitions since launch. And this quarter, thanks to new and expanded content offerings, Fox Nation once again notched its best-ever quarter for customer acquisitions.  Later this year, we will expand our FOX News Media portfolio further with the launch of FOX Weather. FOX Weather is just one example of how we plan to grow the FOX News brand across multiple verticals.  And the power of our brands and the growth potential of their digital extensions was also on display at the FOX Network, with another round of ratings wins on broadcast and record breaking results at Tubi.  FOX is the home to the best entertainment programs in television, which together with sport, helped propel the FOX Network to its second consecutive broadcast season as the top network in primetime among the key demo, adults 18 to 49.  This fall, we have strongly performing returning hits and a slate of promising new shows. In particular, we are looking forward to the addition of two new dramas to our full lineup. These are The Big Leap and Our Kind of People. Fox has always thrived with shows featuring music and dance and The Big Leap, like Glee, and so many others before, lives right in that sweet spot. The big leap is an optimistic dramedy about second chances and chasing dreams. We think these themes are spot on coming out of the pandemic.  Our Kind of People is inspired by Lawrence Otis Graham's book of the same name. It is executive produced by Empire creator Lee Daniels and stars Karen Gist. It's an absorbing story that takes place in the aspirational world of Oak Bluffs on Martha's Vineyard.  And I'm very pleased today to announce a new partnership with Gordon Ramsay, Studio Ramsay Global, which will acquire Gordon's current television business and will develop, produce and distribute new culinary and lifestyle programming across all Fox platforms, including TV.  Now, let's take a moment to talk about Tubi. At the end of the fiscal year, Tubi be surpassed 3 billion hours streamed, up more than 50% over the prior year. During the recent June quarter, total view time surpassed 900 million hours, up more than 40% over the prior-year quarter.  We spoke about it together last quarter. But I cannot emphasize enough the importance of total view time, or TBT, as the critical metric for ad supported streaming. It is the best measure of burgeoning engagement on Tubi and correlates directly to the monetization of the platform.  And there's no shortage of great content to keep audiences watching. Tubi leads the industry with the largest library of content, with more than 35,000 movies and TV series available. And that library continues to expand with Tubi's first original movies, exciting genres that are informed by Tubi's machine learning capabilities and supported by tight production budgets. In just weeks, these titles have exceeded our financial and strategic objectives.  Throughout the fall, we will modestly ramp the launch of Tubi Originals, a number of which will be produced in house by Fox Alternative Entertainment and our animation studio Bento Box.  But let me be crystal clear about one thing. Tubi's original programming strategy is very different from the strategies of an SVOD streamer. We have no interest or plans to invest in high cost programming to drive subscriber acquisition as we are not in the subscriber business. We are focused on delivering programming that drives total viewing time and hence monetization in very short order.  The return on our programming investment is measured in weeks, not years, and should be viewed through a completely different lens than investments in the SVOD universe. We are in a very different space. It's a space focus on advertisers. And advertisers are increasingly seeking out Tubi as a leading platform to reach a younger audience that is both largely unduplicated from our traditional Fox audience, and not regularly streaming other AVOD services.  In the recent quarter, Tubi featured ads more than half of the Ad Age Top 200 Brands. With the reach and brand recognition of Fox behind it, Tubi be nearly double the number of brands buying its inventory in the upfront and more than tripled its upfront dollar commitments over the prior year.  Despite the COVID-related headwinds earlier in the fiscal year, Fox television stations recorded core advertising revenue that was on pace with the prior year when excluding the Super Bowl comp last year and the record political revenue in the current year. Just one example, the adoption of legalized gambling is driving increased advertising spend, particularly in Philadelphia and Detroit. We anticipate additional markets, including Arizona and Wisconsin, to launch legalized sports betting in fiscal 2022. The Fox television stations are particularly well positioned to capitalize on this opportunity, given the strength of our stations in these markets.  FOX Sports also had a noteworthy year, expanding its ratings dominance in live sport, while also extending and enhancing our long-term rights agreement with the NFL. We will remain not only the leader in football ratings, but also the home of the premier NSU rights package through the 2033 season, thanks for our new multi-platform rights deal with our partners at the NFL, which includes the designation of FOX Bet, as an authorized sportsbook operator of the league.  We expect the company-wide momentum of fiscal 2021 to carry into our current fiscal year. Macroeconomic trends bode well for a strong advertising market and brands are increasingly turning to our linear and digital assets to reach the largest collection of loyal and engaged viewers.  The return of normal sports and entertainment schedules, coupled with the ongoing leadership of FOX News Media, will enable us to capitalize on the robust ad market. In addition to delivering strong underlying operating and financial results in fiscal 2022, we are focused on expanding our digital businesses. We are reinvesting a portion of the profits and free cash flow from our core businesses into the high growth and high opportunity digital assets that we know to be essential elements of our future.  This past quarter also saw the completion of a wide range of transformational technology investments that provide us with a range of modern, state-of-the-art platforms that will power the growth of our businesses for years to come.  These new capabilities include a new distribution and streaming operation in Arizona, through the brand new data and advertising platforms that will underpin and evolving an advanced set of commercial offerings for clients across all of our products and services. These investments, now complete, position a strongly to seize on the growth opportunities that lie ahead.  We continue to deploy capital in a responsible manner to support Tubi, the FOX News Media digital properties, including Fox Nation and the launch of FOX Weather, as well as our other emerging digital businesses. We believe these investments, relatively modest compared to those being made by our peers in subscription streaming areas, will yield long term significant returns and position us well to continue to adapt, and take advantage of, the evolving media landscape.  Now, Steve will take us through the details of the fiscal year and the fourth quarter.\nSteve Tomsic : Thanks, Lachlan. And good afternoon. Looking back at our recently completed fiscal year, Fox delivered total revenues of $12.9 billion, up 5% versus the prior year. This is despite the impact of COVID-19 and the cyclical comparison with revenues generated from last year's broadcast of Super Bowl 54.  Notwithstanding these two headwinds, full-year advertising revenues still increased 2%, propelled by a record political cycle, the significant contribution of Tubi and robust mid-teens growth of the cable segment, led by FOX News Media.  Our best-in-class affiliate revenue growth was particularly noteworthy. Total company affiliate revenues increased 9% on a reported basis and 10% on an underlying basis after adjusting for potential distribution credits at the cable segment due to COVID. This underlying double-digit companywide growth was led by 20% growth at the television segment.  Momentum across our digital businesses continues to be strong, with digital revenues growing over 40% to reach almost $1.4 billion for the full fiscal year. Taken together, this impressive revenue achievement once again underlines our differentiated strategy centered on our leadership brands and focused portfolio of assets built around live event programming, including news and sports.  From a bottom line perspective, the company delivered full-year adjusted EBITDA of $3.1 billion, an increase of 11% over the prior year, and a record in the company's short history.  Full-year net income attributable to stockholders was $2.2 billion or $3.61 per share, while adjusted EPS was $2.88 per share, up 16% versus $2.48 last year.  Now turning to our results for the fourth quarter. Total company revenues increased 20% to $2.9 billion, driven by our fourth consecutive quarter of underlying double-digit total accompany affiliate revenue growth and strong pricing gains across the national and local ad markets.  Total company affiliate revenues increased 10%, with 16% growth at the television segment and healthy 6% growth at the cable segment. The rate of subscriber declines was stable in the quarter, with trailing 12-month industry sub losses now running below 4.5%.  Total company advertising revenues increased 38%, with over 50% growth at the television segment as the local market continued to rebound from COVID, Tubi delivered another record quarter and the FOX Network benefited from a healthy linear and digital marketplace.  Total company other revenues increased 30%, primarily due to the timing of sports sublicensing revenues as a result of COVID higher production volume at Bento Box and continued momentum at Fox Nation.  Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $717 million, down 3% over the comparative period in fiscal 2020, primarily due to higher programming and production costs, as we return to a more normalized programming schedule as compared to the COVID-related delays and cancellations experienced in prior quarters. Additionally, we also increased our investment in our high growth digital initiatives at FOX News Media and Tubi.  Net income attributable to stockholders at $253 million or $0.43 per share was notably higher than the $122 million or $0.20 per share in the prior-year quarter. This increase reflects the absence of impairment and restructuring charges booked in the prior year quarter, net of the impact of mark-to-market adjustments associated with the company's investments recognized in other net. Excluding these impacts and other non-core items, adjusted EPS of $0.65 per share was up 5% over last year's $0.62 per share.  Turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter, where Cable Networks reported a 10% increase in revenues. Cable affiliate revenues increased 6%, once again led by double-digit pricing gains at FOX News. Cable advertising revenues increased 17%, driven by continued strength in digital monetization at FOX News Media and the return of live events and studio show programming at FOX Sports, which were both impacted by COVID in the prior view. Cable other revenues increased by $25 million, primarily due to the timing of sports sub licensing revenues as a result of COVID and continued subscription momentum at Fox Nation.  EBITDA at our cable segment was flat against the prior year as the revenue increases were offset by higher programming and production costs at FOX Sports following the COVID-related postponements and cancellations in the prior year. We also increased our investment in key digital initiatives at FOX News Media, including Fox Nation and the pending launch of FOX Weather.  Turning now to the Television segment, which reported a 30% increase in quarterly revenues. Television affiliate revenues increased 16%, reflecting double-digit increases for both our programming fees from non-owned station affiliates and for our direct retransmission revenues at our owned and operated stations. This once again reaffirms that we are on track to achieve the television affiliate revenue growth we outlined at our Investor Day.  Television advertising revenues increased by over 50% as we benefited from a meaningful rebound in the base market of the local Fox television stations, achieved strong pricing gains at FOX Entertainment and saw the return of Major League Baseball at FOX Sports this spring. Meanwhile, Tubi continues to exceed expectations, comfortably surpassing $100 million in revenue for the quarter, typically its seasonally slowest quarter. This brings Tubi's full-year revenue to almost $400 million, up nearly 170% versus their full prior year.  Other revenues at Television increased 18% in the quarter, led by higher production volume at Bento Box and higher co-production revenues at FOX Entertainment.  EBITDA in our Television segment was down $21 million versus prior year as gains at our local stations were more than offset by our investment in Tubi and higher costs at the FOX Network, primarily due to schedule changes caused by COVID.  Switching now to cash flow. During the year, we generated free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx, of $2.2 billion. As we foreshadowed on our last earnings call, we deployed $1 billion of capital in fiscal 2021 to repurchase over 22 million Class A shares and over 9 million Class B shares. Against our initial buyback authorization of $2 billion, we have now cumulatively repurchased over $1.6 billion, representing 8% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in November 2019.  And as a reminder, our board recently approved an additional $2 billion to our buyback authorization, meaning that we have over $2.3 billion of our combined authorization remaining.  Underlining our continued commitment to shareholder returns, today we announced an increase in our semi-annual dividend to $0.24 per share. Over the course of the fiscal year, we returned $1.3 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which when including the payment of the dividend we declared today will take the total cumulative amount of capital returned to shareholders to approximately $2.5 billion since the spin of Fox Corporation in March of 2019.  From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $5.9 billion in cash and approximately $8 billion in debt.  Finally, let me take a few moments to provide some markers for our fiscal 2022. We are anticipating robust top line growth across our businesses over the course of next fiscal year. This is predicated on disruption free programming schedules and comes despite the comparison with the record net political revenues of over $350 million we saw in fiscal 2021.  As Lachlan referenced, we expect the underlying companywide advertising momentum to carry into fiscal 22. With approximately 5% of our total company affiliate revenues due for renewal, we expect a moderation in the growth of distribution revenues in fiscal 2022 as we comp against a major renewal in the prior year and prepare for the start of our next renewal cycle in fiscal 2023.  Using the strength of our core business as a platform, we will use fiscal 2022 to invest in the expansion and acceleration of our digital assets. Here we anticipate investing in the range of $200 million to $300 million of net EBITDA, with a particular focus on Tubi, Fox Nation and the launch of FOX Weather. This is an appropriately sized investment for these high growth assets that will be a key part of our future.  Looking further out to fiscal 2023, the confluence of premier sporting events, including the Super Bowl and the World Cup, in combination with the midterm election cycle, will make for a unique opportunity across our leadership brands and platforms. These cyclical items, coupled with the start of our next major distribution renewal cycle, the early exit from our Thursday Night Football deal, and continued growth of our digital initiatives, are poised to provide a strong financial tailwind for our business.  Coming back to today, we entered fiscal 2022 from a position of operating and financial strength. This strength is reflected in our balance sheet where we'll use existing cash balances to pay down the $750 million debt maturity that will come due in January.  Beyond this, we will continue to take a balanced approach to allocating capital between direct investment in our businesses, strategic M&A, and capital returns to shareholders.  And with that, I'll now turn the call back to Joe. \nJoe Dorrego : Thank you, Steve. And now, we'd be happy to take some questions from the investment community. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We do have a question from Jessica Reif Ehrlich of BofA Securities.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: I have a follow up and then a question. So, my follow-up is, you've laid out, Steve, in particular, towards the end, your investment priorities for fiscal 2022, including digital assets and originals, etc. If you can clarify, is this the peak year of spend and whatever you can say about sports rights and sports betting as part of this investment year would be helpful. But even with all of that, you still have an incredibly strong balance sheet. So, do you feel like you need to get bigger?  And then my question is, you've had a great \u2013 really fantastic upfront, as big as the whole industry has had, can you give us color on pricing and sell out pretty much across all of the assets, not just the network, but the cable assets as well as Tubi. \nSteve Tomsic: First of all, in terms of the investment in the digital assets, our digital assets are growing very impressively. I think, this year, if we look at the fiscal year, we ended up at a $1.4 billion of digital revenue, which was up 44% year-on-year. So, obviously, we like these assets and we're going to continue to invest in them to continue to grow them. But I think we're doing so pretty prudently, sort of balancing the opportunity with the costs that we're putting against them.  Do we need to get bigger? We're always looking at how to grow both organically and inorganically. We don't feel any pressing strategic need to get bigger. We don't have any kind of holes in our portfolio, particularly when you look at our kind of strengths in live news and live sports. And now in entertainment, the strength in Tubi, and it's really pleasing to see how quickly Tubi has grown. So, we don't see a strategic need to grow defensively. If you look at the consolidation that's been happening around the industry, a lot of that is around subscription video streaming. And that's not a \u2013 and the desire to sort of acquire larger entertainment libraries and production capabilities, and that's not a \u2013 and that sort of scale, not a space that we need to be in right now. So, we feel pretty confident where we are, but we are pretty comfortable where we are, but we do continue to look at opportunities as they come up. In terms of the upfront pricing and I think you asked to go into some detail around it and current scatter pricing. Look, this was an absolutely historic upfront season for us, but I'm sure for some of our peers, as well as the ad market rebounded from the depths and the lows of the COVID-affected year last year. So, the comparisons are kind because of where we were a year ago. But having said that, all of our categories are up very strongly, with the exception of two, which are auto and telecom. And there are specific reasons around those categories. I know we've spoken on prior quarterly earnings calls about the auto supply issues they're having. But if you look at retail, I'm talking, Jessica, this is for our local business at the moment. So, the TV stations. Our retail is up like 10%. Entertainment, which includes that really growing and exploding wagering categories, is up 300% year-on-year, media up 43%, pharmaceutical up 25%, even travel which is a much smaller category for us locally up 76%. So, a lot of growth across the majority of categories, again, with the exceptions of auto and telco.  If you exclude political advertising, our sales are pacing up about 8% locally. So, we feel we feel really good there and, obviously, the momentum is \u2013 carrying the momentum into the new year. From a national point of view, so the upfronts were very strong. Pricing was all up over the 20% mark and then pushing into the mid-20s. And since the upfront, our scatter pricing is again up that much again and more. The NFL is selling very well. Major League Baseball is interesting as an aside. And I think this bodes well for the rest of the season and postseason. We have a Field of Dreams game next week. And that's set a record for a regular season baseball game. So, a lot of positive momentum across all of our categories, not the least of which is FOX News, which has shown very strong sales, with expanded demographics and, obviously, the digital platform as well.  So, we feel very good about the ad market and we think it's going to continue for some time. \nOperator: We have Robert Fishman of MoffettNathanson. \nRobert Fishman: On Tubi, going to expand on your prepared remarks. How do you measure the ROI of content investment? And can you further explain whether the shift to originals essentially moves you away from the more standard AVOD model of revenue share? And just lastly, on a related note, how do we think about Tubi margins as revenue grows and reaches your billion dollar guidance?\nLachlan Murdoch: Let me start with how do we look at the ROI on the content and then we can get into the margins and maybe Steve can take the financial aspect of that question. So, when we look at Tubi content, from an AVOD perspective, and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks and I've mentioned last quarter, it's all around total viewing time and the advertising impressions that we can generate through increasing and expanding the engagement as measured through total viewing time. And it was really pleasing that, I think, in the fiscal year, we did 3 billion hours of total viewing time, which was up 50% year-on-year.  So, the way to grow, obviously, total viewing time is we can grow viewers and multiply that by the amount of content and the length of time they're spending watching that content. And we look at the content, and basically, I'd say, five different categories. There's your third-party content. And that's where we have 34,000, 35,000 hours of library, which is growing. So, there's that third-party content. That's a mixture of a revenue share and sort of licensed content. There's an increasing amount of Fox-owned content and IP that we're able to put on to Tubi, which is really pleasing to see and I think helps drive the TV awareness and the brand. There's the news category, which is really starting to take shape and increase engagement. There's a sports category, which will be launching sports channels soon, including the NFL channel and some other sports. And then finally, there's Tubi Originals.  And Tubi Original has only just begun to launch, but we are seeing the return in a very short order. These movies are very price effective. And we're able through Tubi's technology to really target them very specifically to very well defined genres that we know, if we promote them correctly on the Tubi platform, they will drive a consistent, expected amount of viewing, which we can then monetize very efficiently. So, the model from the investment into the original programming is really derived specifically by the exact amount of revenue that we can derive out of that original program.  Unlike SVOD where you're creating original programming to pull subscribers in, often once they're in the platform, they don't watch that program or they watch other library programming, we're not interested in the subscriber acquisition. We're purely interested in the time they spend on the platform and the amount of content they're consuming.  Steve, do you want to talk to the margins?\nSteve Tomsic: Robert, just in terms of margin, listen, the biggest single cost of the business is obviously programming. And even with our steps towards original programming, the library is going to be heavily concentrated towards revenue share titles, both movies and series on that front. And so, therefore, it kind of governs a lot of your margin because that revenue share comes straight off of revenue and then you've got customer acquisition or viewer acquisition cost as well as technology. As you sort of call out the billion dollar target that we have, which is an interim target that we have for the business. It's almost like a market establishment phase for this business. And so, you shouldn't expect this business to be a margin contributed to us in anytime soon. We're going to continue to invest in it as we've called out on the call today, and that investment will go towards a sort of three core pillars, being content, user acquisition/marketing, as well as technology.  If you look at sort of the Tubi in the first three quarters of this fiscal year, it was virtually a push for us financially. So, we can almost dial up and dial down that margin as we see fit. But, certainly, our bias at the moment is to lean into investing in that business, which will mean it will be a drag on margin for the next year or two to come.\nOperator: Next, we have John Janedis of Wolfe Research. \nJohn Janedis: One would be, can you tell us more about how you're thinking about spending that incremental investment dollar. Lachlan, you talked about growth. So, when you speak to those growth areas, does that suggest investment in the linear cable and network business and sports will be fairly modest going forward? And then separately, it sounds a lot of AVOD services out there were not aggressively in the upfront and some have a pretty big tailwind on CPMs. And so, can you talk about how you think Tubi's priced relative to other services and to what extent there's a gap? And at a practical level, how quickly can you close it?\nLachlan Murdoch: In terms of the investment going forward, as mentioned in my prepared remarks, the big investment in terms of our \u2013 partially, in terms of our linear business from a technology point of view has been this Arizona play out and data center, technology center, which is now completed, and that brings us into \u2013 I think they are our best-in-class kind of infrastructure for all of our products. Obviously, that's built today to be multi-platform. So it's an investment both in the linear business, but also as importantly in the digital businesses as our digital business continues to grow.  The $200 million to $300 million that Steve has called out in terms of the investment this year, further investment in our digital assets is really split between \u2013 I think Steve mentioned Fox Nation, which is a subscription service, but continues to grow engagement, has really tremendously low churn and remains kind of a fantastic conversion rate from trial users to paid users of well over 80%. FoxNews.com, we'll continue to push into new verticals of content. They're planning and exploring content around sort of real estate, around cooking, around sort of some engaging games and crosswords and things as we drive the Fox News brand into sort of more lifestyle categories. And Tubi, I think we've addressed. So, those are the key areas of the investment this year, not the linear businesses. In AVOD, Tubi, in terms of how we price the upfront, I think the important thing for us \u2013 and I can't talk to our competitors and I wouldn't know \u2013 but the Tubi revenue in our upfront is entirely incremental, right? And that's really important. We're careful to not move revenue from one pocket to another and say, look at all the revenue we've been able to attach or push in Tubi. But Tubi revenue is entirely incremental to what we otherwise sold on our linear assets. And that's a really pleasing thing to see. Because of the way Tubi is structured with our programmatic advertising, in fact, we get a very high rate for our programmatic advertising on Tubi. And so, we were careful actually to constrain ourselves somewhat into what we sold into the upfront for Tubi because we feel towards \u2013 as the year progresses, we'll do extremely well through our programmatic advertising and the CPMs we get through programmatic. So, when we hit the triple revenue mark in the upfront for Tubi, we decided that was enough, we would stop there, and we would leave plenty of impressions for programmatic which I think is the right strategy for us.\nOperator: Ben Swinburne, Morgan Stanley, please go ahead. \nBenjamin Swinburne: Steve, you mentioned renewal cycle starting again in fiscal 2023. And you guys were really helpful back at your initial Investor Day in kind of helping us think about the timing of that over the course of the next few years, which you're now wrapping up. I don't know if there was anything you could help us in thinking about the cycle that starts in 2023, if it looks like the last one in terms of the curve or anything you would add. And then, on Tubi, I don't know if this is for Lachlan or whoever wants to take it, maybe you could just give us sort of the pitch to advertisers who have a number of AVOD or FAST options, including buying, I think, Tubi inventory through people like Roku and Vizio and stuff, what is it that you offer an advertiser that's better or differentiated from Pluto or Hulu or even buying AVOD inventory through one of the platforms that have an ability to aggregate an even larger audience and maybe more specific data? Would just love to hear more about how you guys go to market?\nLachlan Murdoch: Steve, if you want to jump in on distribution. Steve can go through the detail. But fiscal 2023 and 2024 is about a third of our distribution kind of volume comes up. So, this year is relatively quiet compared to that, and then 30 odd percent or 33%, 34% of our deals come up in 2023 and then again in 2024. I don't know, Steve, if you want to add anything.\nSteve Tomsic: Exactly. You're bang on. Really like single digits this year, mid-30s the following year. Then 2024, again, mid-30s, and then about a quarter the year after that. And remember that the 2023 renewals will largely hit us \u2013 will give us the benefit in terms of affiliate revenue growth in the back half of that fiscal year. \nLachlan Murdoch: Ben, you reminded us or me of the Investor Day, the original Investor Day we had, and I think we call it out there that we were going to increase our affiliate revenue in the television segment by $1 billion by, I think it was calendar 2022. And we're well on track to achieve that objective and that target that we set for ourselves back at that Investor Day. So, we're very pleased with that.  For Tubi, in terms of advertisers, Tubi is a very \u2013 it's not about \u2013 you don't sell these advertisers around sort of the mass scale. And so, I understand your point about some of the AVOD aggregators. But with Tubi, we have an audience that's younger, that's more diverse, that can be very targeted. We have very sophisticated advertising tools to ensure that advertisers and, frankly, the people they're trying to reach are not inundated with digital advertising frequently, right? So, we have these frequency tools that make sure that the advertising on Tubi is appropriate and that the viewer is getting a mix of ads served to them. So, there's a dynamic technology behind Tubi, which is very unique and very valuable to our clients.  We're also not duplicated. So, we have very low duplication, not only with the FOX Network, but also Tubi viewers are unlikely \u2013 a very small percentage of them are watching any other AVOD service. They are to a large part exclusive to Tubi. So, it really is a unique offering, an offering that our clients are seeing the value in.  And really, the proof is in the pudding. If you look at tripling the revenue in the upfront, and I think it was sort of doubling the number of top brands on the platform, I think the proof is in the pudding that the Tubi story and the Tubi sales story is really resonating with the top advertising brands and clients in the United States. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson of Credit Suisse.\nDoug Mitchelson: For Steve, my follow-up. I just wanted to be clear on the Tubi investment. It sounds like from Lachlan's commentary that any incremental investment you make in originals, you expect a fairly quick payoff. So, is it right to think that within your $200 million to $300 million of EBITDA, the investment in growth, the Tubi portion of that on a net basis is really just the content and user acquisition? Excuse me, the user acquisition and marketing and technology and not the content front? So, the content return should be so quick in.  Lachlan, the clarification is on NFL advertising pre-sales. How does that compare to the entertainment upfront? Are you seeing similar pricing? Or is there any difference there? And the question, Lachlan, CNN launching a streaming service next year, not necessarily unexpected, but is that interesting from a competitive standpoint? Does that influence your strategy at all with the digital offerings you're pursuing on the FOX News site? \nLachlan Murdoch: I think the first question or clarification or follow-up first, the answer is yes, that the Tubi investment is subscriber acquisition, marketing, which obviously feeds into subscriber acquisition, and technology spend. So, that's the majority of the investment in Tubi. Am I wrong, Steve? I hope not.\nSteve Tomsic: No, you're right. And I think you've got to look at content in two kind of buckets. There's the originals, and I think that's going to be modest from both a cash and P&L perspective, because you physically just can't ramp that up that quickly. And then the second piece with the content investment is just building that bigger library with licensed content. And so, that's going to come in the form of both revenue share deals and license deals, and the license deals will obviously have a P&L impact [indiscernible].\nLachlan Murdoch: I'm glad I was right on that. Look, on NFL, pre-sales NFL is selling very well. CPMs are strong, positive. And we couldn't be more pleased with the sales there. We think for a lot of issues in the marketplace, we think scatter pricing as well is going to remain a robust pricing through the end of the year just because of the availability of spots across the kind of television universe. So, we're confident in a very strong NFL year. By the way, I didn't mention this \u2013 it's not NFL, but on the sports side, the All Star game from Major League Baseball was a terrific revenue result for us nationally. But interestingly, locally, in Atlanta, we generated a really extraordinary amount of political revenue on that local station for the All Star game, which was obviously driven by the controversy around Major League Baseball moving the game from Atlanta, to Denver. And that political advertising was all focused on the midterm elections next year. And so, when we look at that, the lessons I think we're taking from that is that the next political season, the midterm season is going to be another record political season next year. It's not this year, next year, but we're going to see staggering amounts of political dollars flowing into these local stations. And we can see that from simply just the one example of the Atlanta station for the All Star game. On CNN, CNN+ I think it's called, look, we think it's a \u2013 what's the word when someone copies you, it's the best form of flattery. We think Fox Nation continues to grow. We think we're doing all the right things with Fox Nation. I talked about it before, but tremendous growth in the quarter driven off of clever acquisition and clever high quality programming. So, we don't see CNN launching into that space as anything other than am affirming of our strategy and what we're doing, really driving the engagement and the tremendously high engagement from FOX News into a paid for subscription service.  When we look at our competitors, we are heartened by their ratings trends. As I mentioned in my prepared comments, we are now regularly beating both the combined ratings on primetime, and many times in all day, of CNN and MSNBC combined. If you take just last night as one example, ratings just dropped half an hour or so ago while we're on the call, in primetime, FOX News did 2.4 million on P2+. CNN under 750,000 and MSNBC under 1.2 million. So, you've got 2.4 million versus 1.9 million, 2 million. So, we beat them combined, plus with a margin of 20% or so. So, very strong ratings trends, very strong engagement with our audience. And that really goes through our whole digital strategy, how do we take that audience and take that engagement and expand it across multiple platforms.\nJoe Dorrego: At this point, we're out of time. But if you have any further questions, please give me or Dan Carey a call. Thank you once again for joining today's call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. And you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Lachlan Murdoch",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 results. At the outset, I want to emphasize the exceptional financial and operational results that we have delivered over the last year despite the challenges posed operating through the COVID-19 pandemic.  The virus brought significant impact to our productions, to our processes and to our people. However, we stayed resolute and focused and demonstrated that, even in the most unexpected and challenging of times, our focus on a handful of powerful, highly engaging brands produces exceptional results.  Over the past fiscal year, we have reinforced the competitive advantages of our core brands, enhanced our digital capabilities, solidified our growth potential, returned $1.25 billion of capital to shareholders through buybacks and dividends, and otherwise prudently allocated our capital.  We have a strongly differentiated position in the market, which continues to benefit us to no end. But our greatest strength is our people who have really stood up this year and performed extremely well under such difficult circumstances. I know myself, my father, the board, and the management team appreciate all their hard work and all their achievements this year.  In fiscal 2021, we generated revenue and profit which exceeded even our own bullish expectations. Our affiliate revenue increased 9% year-over-year, which is net of the distribution credits that we recognized last fall due to COVID.  Our advertising revenue was up 2%, which is tremendous when you recall that we broadcast the Superbowl in the prior fiscal year, during which we generated around $500 million of net advertising revenue.  Importantly, the fiscal fourth quarter saw these trends accelerate, as quarterly revenues increased 20%, led once again by double digit affiliate revenue growth and advertising revenue growth of 38%. This growth was underpinned by the ability of our core businesses to consistently deliver audiences at scale and capture the upward momentum of a rallying advertising market.  We finished the fiscal year with historically strong upfront sales and are currently also enjoying sustained scattered demand with pricing at significant premiums. We finished the fiscal year strong and we feel we are in a very good place \u2013 or we are in a very good place with great momentum starting the new fiscal year.  FOX News Media continued its ratings leadership and its multi-platform growth in the fourth quarter. The FOX News channel was the most watched network in primetime across all of basic cable for the sixth consecutive year, and notched its 78th straight quarter as the leading cable news channel in total viewers.  While the year-over-year ratings comparisons are difficult due to last year's heightened news cycle, the FOX News channel has retained more of its audience than CNN and MSNBC since the presidential election. In fact, since the election, FOX News has solidified his leadership position in cable news, having reasserted its pre-election market share.  For total day audiences, FOX News increased its market share by 11% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year, while CNN and MSNBC lost 9% and 3% respectively over that same period. From a primetime perspective, we once again find ourselves in a familiar position, as we routinely see our ratings exceeding those of our peers combined.  We were also pleased with the performance of FOX News Media's digital assets. FOX News remained the most engaged news brand across social media channels, extending this run to nearly seven consecutive years. This is a critical pathway to reaching, engaging and growing the broadest possible audiences with the FOX News brand.  On the last call, I told you that Fox Nation, the direct-to-consumer offering from FOX News Media had recorded its strongest quarter for customer acquisitions since launch. And this quarter, thanks to new and expanded content offerings, Fox Nation once again notched its best-ever quarter for customer acquisitions.  Later this year, we will expand our FOX News Media portfolio further with the launch of FOX Weather. FOX Weather is just one example of how we plan to grow the FOX News brand across multiple verticals.  And the power of our brands and the growth potential of their digital extensions was also on display at the FOX Network, with another round of ratings wins on broadcast and record breaking results at Tubi.  FOX is the home to the best entertainment programs in television, which together with sport, helped propel the FOX Network to its second consecutive broadcast season as the top network in primetime among the key demo, adults 18 to 49.  This fall, we have strongly performing returning hits and a slate of promising new shows. In particular, we are looking forward to the addition of two new dramas to our full lineup. These are The Big Leap and Our Kind of People. Fox has always thrived with shows featuring music and dance and The Big Leap, like Glee, and so many others before, lives right in that sweet spot. The big leap is an optimistic dramedy about second chances and chasing dreams. We think these themes are spot on coming out of the pandemic.  Our Kind of People is inspired by Lawrence Otis Graham's book of the same name. It is executive produced by Empire creator Lee Daniels and stars Karen Gist. It's an absorbing story that takes place in the aspirational world of Oak Bluffs on Martha's Vineyard.  And I'm very pleased today to announce a new partnership with Gordon Ramsay, Studio Ramsay Global, which will acquire Gordon's current television business and will develop, produce and distribute new culinary and lifestyle programming across all Fox platforms, including TV.  Now, let's take a moment to talk about Tubi. At the end of the fiscal year, Tubi be surpassed 3 billion hours streamed, up more than 50% over the prior year. During the recent June quarter, total view time surpassed 900 million hours, up more than 40% over the prior-year quarter.  We spoke about it together last quarter. But I cannot emphasize enough the importance of total view time, or TBT, as the critical metric for ad supported streaming. It is the best measure of burgeoning engagement on Tubi and correlates directly to the monetization of the platform.  And there's no shortage of great content to keep audiences watching. Tubi leads the industry with the largest library of content, with more than 35,000 movies and TV series available. And that library continues to expand with Tubi's first original movies, exciting genres that are informed by Tubi's machine learning capabilities and supported by tight production budgets. In just weeks, these titles have exceeded our financial and strategic objectives.  Throughout the fall, we will modestly ramp the launch of Tubi Originals, a number of which will be produced in house by Fox Alternative Entertainment and our animation studio Bento Box.  But let me be crystal clear about one thing. Tubi's original programming strategy is very different from the strategies of an SVOD streamer. We have no interest or plans to invest in high cost programming to drive subscriber acquisition as we are not in the subscriber business. We are focused on delivering programming that drives total viewing time and hence monetization in very short order.  The return on our programming investment is measured in weeks, not years, and should be viewed through a completely different lens than investments in the SVOD universe. We are in a very different space. It's a space focus on advertisers. And advertisers are increasingly seeking out Tubi as a leading platform to reach a younger audience that is both largely unduplicated from our traditional Fox audience, and not regularly streaming other AVOD services.  In the recent quarter, Tubi featured ads more than half of the Ad Age Top 200 Brands. With the reach and brand recognition of Fox behind it, Tubi be nearly double the number of brands buying its inventory in the upfront and more than tripled its upfront dollar commitments over the prior year.  Despite the COVID-related headwinds earlier in the fiscal year, Fox television stations recorded core advertising revenue that was on pace with the prior year when excluding the Super Bowl comp last year and the record political revenue in the current year. Just one example, the adoption of legalized gambling is driving increased advertising spend, particularly in Philadelphia and Detroit. We anticipate additional markets, including Arizona and Wisconsin, to launch legalized sports betting in fiscal 2022. The Fox television stations are particularly well positioned to capitalize on this opportunity, given the strength of our stations in these markets.  FOX Sports also had a noteworthy year, expanding its ratings dominance in live sport, while also extending and enhancing our long-term rights agreement with the NFL. We will remain not only the leader in football ratings, but also the home of the premier NSU rights package through the 2033 season, thanks for our new multi-platform rights deal with our partners at the NFL, which includes the designation of FOX Bet, as an authorized sportsbook operator of the league.  We expect the company-wide momentum of fiscal 2021 to carry into our current fiscal year. Macroeconomic trends bode well for a strong advertising market and brands are increasingly turning to our linear and digital assets to reach the largest collection of loyal and engaged viewers.  The return of normal sports and entertainment schedules, coupled with the ongoing leadership of FOX News Media, will enable us to capitalize on the robust ad market. In addition to delivering strong underlying operating and financial results in fiscal 2022, we are focused on expanding our digital businesses. We are reinvesting a portion of the profits and free cash flow from our core businesses into the high growth and high opportunity digital assets that we know to be essential elements of our future.  This past quarter also saw the completion of a wide range of transformational technology investments that provide us with a range of modern, state-of-the-art platforms that will power the growth of our businesses for years to come.  These new capabilities include a new distribution and streaming operation in Arizona, through the brand new data and advertising platforms that will underpin and evolving an advanced set of commercial offerings for clients across all of our products and services. These investments, now complete, position a strongly to seize on the growth opportunities that lie ahead.  We continue to deploy capital in a responsible manner to support Tubi, the FOX News Media digital properties, including Fox Nation and the launch of FOX Weather, as well as our other emerging digital businesses. We believe these investments, relatively modest compared to those being made by our peers in subscription streaming areas, will yield long term significant returns and position us well to continue to adapt, and take advantage of, the evolving media landscape.  Now, Steve will take us through the details of the fiscal year and the fourth quarter. Let me start with how do we look at the ROI on the content and then we can get into the margins and maybe Steve can take the financial aspect of that question. So, when we look at Tubi content, from an AVOD perspective, and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks and I've mentioned last quarter, it's all around total viewing time and the advertising impressions that we can generate through increasing and expanding the engagement as measured through total viewing time. And it was really pleasing that, I think, in the fiscal year, we did 3 billion hours of total viewing time, which was up 50% year-on-year.  So, the way to grow, obviously, total viewing time is we can grow viewers and multiply that by the amount of content and the length of time they're spending watching that content. And we look at the content, and basically, I'd say, five different categories. There's your third-party content. And that's where we have 34,000, 35,000 hours of library, which is growing. So, there's that third-party content. That's a mixture of a revenue share and sort of licensed content. There's an increasing amount of Fox-owned content and IP that we're able to put on to Tubi, which is really pleasing to see and I think helps drive the TV awareness and the brand. There's the news category, which is really starting to take shape and increase engagement. There's a sports category, which will be launching sports channels soon, including the NFL channel and some other sports. And then finally, there's Tubi Originals.  And Tubi Original has only just begun to launch, but we are seeing the return in a very short order. These movies are very price effective. And we're able through Tubi's technology to really target them very specifically to very well defined genres that we know, if we promote them correctly on the Tubi platform, they will drive a consistent, expected amount of viewing, which we can then monetize very efficiently. So, the model from the investment into the original programming is really derived specifically by the exact amount of revenue that we can derive out of that original program.  Unlike SVOD where you're creating original programming to pull subscribers in, often once they're in the platform, they don't watch that program or they watch other library programming, we're not interested in the subscriber acquisition. We're purely interested in the time they spend on the platform and the amount of content they're consuming.  Steve, do you want to talk to the margins? In terms of the investment going forward, as mentioned in my prepared remarks, the big investment in terms of our \u2013 partially, in terms of our linear business from a technology point of view has been this Arizona play out and data center, technology center, which is now completed, and that brings us into \u2013 I think they are our best-in-class kind of infrastructure for all of our products. Obviously, that's built today to be multi-platform. So it's an investment both in the linear business, but also as importantly in the digital businesses as our digital business continues to grow.  The $200 million to $300 million that Steve has called out in terms of the investment this year, further investment in our digital assets is really split between \u2013 I think Steve mentioned Fox Nation, which is a subscription service, but continues to grow engagement, has really tremendously low churn and remains kind of a fantastic conversion rate from trial users to paid users of well over 80%. FoxNews.com, we'll continue to push into new verticals of content. They're planning and exploring content around sort of real estate, around cooking, around sort of some engaging games and crosswords and things as we drive the Fox News brand into sort of more lifestyle categories. And Tubi, I think we've addressed. So, those are the key areas of the investment this year, not the linear businesses. In AVOD, Tubi, in terms of how we price the upfront, I think the important thing for us \u2013 and I can't talk to our competitors and I wouldn't know \u2013 but the Tubi revenue in our upfront is entirely incremental, right? And that's really important. We're careful to not move revenue from one pocket to another and say, look at all the revenue we've been able to attach or push in Tubi. But Tubi revenue is entirely incremental to what we otherwise sold on our linear assets. And that's a really pleasing thing to see. Because of the way Tubi is structured with our programmatic advertising, in fact, we get a very high rate for our programmatic advertising on Tubi. And so, we were careful actually to constrain ourselves somewhat into what we sold into the upfront for Tubi because we feel towards \u2013 as the year progresses, we'll do extremely well through our programmatic advertising and the CPMs we get through programmatic. So, when we hit the triple revenue mark in the upfront for Tubi, we decided that was enough, we would stop there, and we would leave plenty of impressions for programmatic which I think is the right strategy for us. Steve, if you want to jump in on distribution. Steve can go through the detail. But fiscal 2023 and 2024 is about a third of our distribution kind of volume comes up. So, this year is relatively quiet compared to that, and then 30 odd percent or 33%, 34% of our deals come up in 2023 and then again in 2024. I don't know, Steve, if you want to add anything. Ben, you reminded us or me of the Investor Day, the original Investor Day we had, and I think we call it out there that we were going to increase our affiliate revenue in the television segment by $1 billion by, I think it was calendar 2022. And we're well on track to achieve that objective and that target that we set for ourselves back at that Investor Day. So, we're very pleased with that.  For Tubi, in terms of advertisers, Tubi is a very \u2013 it's not about \u2013 you don't sell these advertisers around sort of the mass scale.

And we couldn't be more pleased with the sales there. We think for a lot of issues in the marketplace, we think scatter pricing as well is going to remain a robust pricing through the end of the year just because of the availability of spots across the kind of television universe. So, we're confident in a very strong NFL year. By the way, I didn't mention this \u2013 it's not NFL, but on the sports side, the All Star game from Major League Baseball was a terrific revenue result for us nationally. But interestingly, locally, in Atlanta, we generated a really extraordinary amount of political revenue on that local station for the All Star game, which was obviously driven by the controversy around Major League Baseball moving the game from Atlanta, to Denver.

CNN under 750,000 and MSNBC under 1.2 million. So, you've got 2.4 million versus 1.9 million, 2 million. So, we beat them combined, plus with a margin of 20% or so. So, very strong ratings trends, very strong engagement with our audience. And that really goes through our whole digital strategy, how do we take that audience and take that engagement and expand it across multiple platforms."

            "name": "Steve Tomsic",
            "content": "Thanks, Lachlan. And good afternoon. Looking back at our recently completed fiscal year, Fox delivered total revenues of $12.9 billion, up 5% versus the prior year. This is despite the impact of COVID-19 and the cyclical comparison with revenues generated from last year's broadcast of Super Bowl 54.  Notwithstanding these two headwinds, full-year advertising revenues still increased 2%, propelled by a record political cycle, the significant contribution of Tubi and robust mid-teens growth of the cable segment, led by FOX News Media.  Our best-in-class affiliate revenue growth was particularly noteworthy. Total company affiliate revenues increased 9% on a reported basis and 10% on an underlying basis after adjusting for potential distribution credits at the cable segment due to COVID. This underlying double-digit companywide growth was led by 20% growth at the television segment.  Momentum across our digital businesses continues to be strong, with digital revenues growing over 40% to reach almost $1.4 billion for the full fiscal year. Taken together, this impressive revenue achievement once again underlines our differentiated strategy centered on our leadership brands and focused portfolio of assets built around live event programming, including news and sports.  From a bottom line perspective, the company delivered full-year adjusted EBITDA of $3.1 billion, an increase of 11% over the prior year, and a record in the company's short history.  Full-year net income attributable to stockholders was $2.2 billion or $3.61 per share, while adjusted EPS was $2.88 per share, up 16% versus $2.48 last year.  Now turning to our results for the fourth quarter. Total company revenues increased 20% to $2.9 billion, driven by our fourth consecutive quarter of underlying double-digit total accompany affiliate revenue growth and strong pricing gains across the national and local ad markets.  Total company affiliate revenues increased 10%, with 16% growth at the television segment and healthy 6% growth at the cable segment. The rate of subscriber declines was stable in the quarter, with trailing 12-month industry sub losses now running below 4.5%.  Total company advertising revenues increased 38%, with over 50% growth at the television segment as the local market continued to rebound from COVID, Tubi delivered another record quarter and the FOX Network benefited from a healthy linear and digital marketplace.  Total company other revenues increased 30%, primarily due to the timing of sports sublicensing revenues as a result of COVID higher production volume at Bento Box and continued momentum at Fox Nation.  Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $717 million, down 3% over the comparative period in fiscal 2020, primarily due to higher programming and production costs, as we return to a more normalized programming schedule as compared to the COVID-related delays and cancellations experienced in prior quarters. Additionally, we also increased our investment in our high growth digital initiatives at FOX News Media and Tubi.  Net income attributable to stockholders at $253 million or $0.43 per share was notably higher than the $122 million or $0.20 per share in the prior-year quarter. This increase reflects the absence of impairment and restructuring charges booked in the prior year quarter, net of the impact of mark-to-market adjustments associated with the company's investments recognized in other net. Excluding these impacts and other non-core items, adjusted EPS of $0.65 per share was up 5% over last year's $0.62 per share.  Turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter, where Cable Networks reported a 10% increase in revenues. Cable affiliate revenues increased 6%, once again led by double-digit pricing gains at FOX News. Cable advertising revenues increased 17%, driven by continued strength in digital monetization at FOX News Media and the return of live events and studio show programming at FOX Sports, which were both impacted by COVID in the prior view. Cable other revenues increased by $25 million, primarily due to the timing of sports sub licensing revenues as a result of COVID and continued subscription momentum at Fox Nation.  EBITDA at our cable segment was flat against the prior year as the revenue increases were offset by higher programming and production costs at FOX Sports following the COVID-related postponements and cancellations in the prior year. We also increased our investment in key digital initiatives at FOX News Media, including Fox Nation and the pending launch of FOX Weather.  Turning now to the Television segment, which reported a 30% increase in quarterly revenues. Television affiliate revenues increased 16%, reflecting double-digit increases for both our programming fees from non-owned station affiliates and for our direct retransmission revenues at our owned and operated stations. This once again reaffirms that we are on track to achieve the television affiliate revenue growth we outlined at our Investor Day.  Television advertising revenues increased by over 50% as we benefited from a meaningful rebound in the base market of the local Fox television stations, achieved strong pricing gains at FOX Entertainment and saw the return of Major League Baseball at FOX Sports this spring. Meanwhile, Tubi continues to exceed expectations, comfortably surpassing $100 million in revenue for the quarter, typically its seasonally slowest quarter. This brings Tubi's full-year revenue to almost $400 million, up nearly 170% versus their full prior year.  Other revenues at Television increased 18% in the quarter, led by higher production volume at Bento Box and higher co-production revenues at FOX Entertainment.  EBITDA in our Television segment was down $21 million versus prior year as gains at our local stations were more than offset by our investment in Tubi and higher costs at the FOX Network, primarily due to schedule changes caused by COVID.  Switching now to cash flow. During the year, we generated free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx, of $2.2 billion. As we foreshadowed on our last earnings call, we deployed $1 billion of capital in fiscal 2021 to repurchase over 22 million Class A shares and over 9 million Class B shares. Against our initial buyback authorization of $2 billion, we have now cumulatively repurchased over $1.6 billion, representing 8% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in November 2019.  And as a reminder, our board recently approved an additional $2 billion to our buyback authorization, meaning that we have over $2.3 billion of our combined authorization remaining.  Underlining our continued commitment to shareholder returns, today we announced an increase in our semi-annual dividend to $0.24 per share. Over the course of the fiscal year, we returned $1.3 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which when including the payment of the dividend we declared today will take the total cumulative amount of capital returned to shareholders to approximately $2.5 billion since the spin of Fox Corporation in March of 2019.  From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $5.9 billion in cash and approximately $8 billion in debt.  Finally, let me take a few moments to provide some markers for our fiscal 2022. We are anticipating robust top line growth across our businesses over the course of next fiscal year. This is predicated on disruption free programming schedules and comes despite the comparison with the record net political revenues of over $350 million we saw in fiscal 2021.  As Lachlan referenced, we expect the underlying companywide advertising momentum to carry into fiscal 22. With approximately 5% of our total company affiliate revenues due for renewal, we expect a moderation in the growth of distribution revenues in fiscal 2022 as we comp against a major renewal in the prior year and prepare for the start of our next renewal cycle in fiscal 2023.  Using the strength of our core business as a platform, we will use fiscal 2022 to invest in the expansion and acceleration of our digital assets. Here we anticipate investing in the range of $200 million to $300 million of net EBITDA, with a particular focus on Tubi, Fox Nation and the launch of FOX Weather. This is an appropriately sized investment for these high growth assets that will be a key part of our future.  Looking further out to fiscal 2023, the confluence of premier sporting events, including the Super Bowl and the World Cup, in combination with the midterm election cycle, will make for a unique opportunity across our leadership brands and platforms. These cyclical items, coupled with the start of our next major distribution renewal cycle, the early exit from our Thursday Night Football deal, and continued growth of our digital initiatives, are poised to provide a strong financial tailwind for our business.  Coming back to today, we entered fiscal 2022 from a position of operating and financial strength. This strength is reflected in our balance sheet where we'll use existing cash balances to pay down the $750 million debt maturity that will come due in January.  Beyond this, we will continue to take a balanced approach to allocating capital between direct investment in our businesses, strategic M&A, and capital returns to shareholders.  And with that, I'll now turn the call back to Joe. First of all, in terms of the investment in the digital assets, our digital assets are growing very impressively. I think, this year, if we look at the fiscal year, we ended up at a $1.4 billion of digital revenue, which was up 44% year-on-year. So, obviously, we like these assets and we're going to continue to invest in them to continue to grow them. But I think we're doing so pretty prudently, sort of balancing the opportunity with the costs that we're putting against them.  Do we need to get bigger? We're always looking at how to grow both organically and inorganically. We don't feel any pressing strategic need to get bigger. We don't have any kind of holes in our portfolio, particularly when you look at our kind of strengths in live news and live sports. And now in entertainment, the strength in Tubi, and it's really pleasing to see how quickly Tubi has grown. So, we don't see a strategic need to grow defensively. If you look at the consolidation that's been happening around the industry, a lot of that is around subscription video streaming. And that's not a \u2013 and the desire to sort of acquire larger entertainment libraries and production capabilities, and that's not a \u2013 and that sort of scale, not a space that we need to be in right now. So, we feel pretty confident where we are, but we are pretty comfortable where we are, but we do continue to look at opportunities as they come up. In terms of the upfront pricing and I think you asked to go into some detail around it and current scatter pricing. Look, this was an absolutely historic upfront season for us, but I'm sure for some of our peers, as well as the ad market rebounded from the depths and the lows of the COVID-affected year last year. So, the comparisons are kind because of where we were a year ago. But having said that, all of our categories are up very strongly, with the exception of two, which are auto and telecom. And there are specific reasons around those categories. I know we've spoken on prior quarterly earnings calls about the auto supply issues they're having. But if you look at retail, I'm talking, Jessica, this is for our local business at the moment. So, the TV stations. Our retail is up like 10%. Entertainment, which includes that really growing and exploding wagering categories, is up 300% year-on-year, media up 43%, pharmaceutical up 25%, even travel which is a much smaller category for us locally up 76%. So, a lot of growth across the majority of categories, again, with the exceptions of auto and telco.  If you exclude political advertising, our sales are pacing up about 8% locally. So, we feel we feel really good there and, obviously, the momentum is \u2013 carrying the momentum into the new year. From a national point of view, so the upfronts were very strong. Pricing was all up over the 20% mark and then pushing into the mid-20s. And since the upfront, our scatter pricing is again up that much again and more. The NFL is selling very well. Major League Baseball is interesting as an aside. And I think this bodes well for the rest of the season and postseason. We have a Field of Dreams game next week. And that's set a record for a regular season baseball game. So, a lot of positive momentum across all of our categories, not the least of which is FOX News, which has shown very strong sales, with expanded demographics and, obviously, the digital platform as well.  So, we feel very good about the ad market and we think it's going to continue for some time. Robert, just in terms of margin, listen, the biggest single cost of the business is obviously programming. And even with our steps towards original programming, the library is going to be heavily concentrated towards revenue share titles, both movies and series on that front. And so, therefore, it kind of governs a lot of your margin because that revenue share comes straight off of revenue and then you've got customer acquisition or viewer acquisition cost as well as technology. As you sort of call out the billion dollar target that we have, which is an interim target that we have for the business. It's almost like a market establishment phase for this business. And so, you shouldn't expect this business to be a margin contributed to us in anytime soon. We're going to continue to invest in it as we've called out on the call today, and that investment will go towards a sort of three core pillars, being content, user acquisition/marketing, as well as technology.  If you look at sort of the Tubi in the first three quarters of this fiscal year, it was virtually a push for us financially. So, we can almost dial up and dial down that margin as we see fit. But, certainly, our bias at the moment is to lean into investing in that business, which will mean it will be a drag on margin for the next year or two to come. Exactly. You're bang on. Really like single digits this year, mid-30s the following year. Then 2024, again, mid-30s, and then about a quarter the year after that. And remember that the 2023 renewals will largely hit us \u2013 will give us the benefit in terms of affiliate revenue growth in the back half of that fiscal year. No, you're right. And I think you've got to look at content in two kind of buckets. There's the originals, and I think that's going to be modest from both a cash and P&L perspective, because you physically just can't ramp that up that quickly. And then the second piece with the content investment is just building that bigger library with licensed content. And so, that's going to come in the form of both revenue share deals and license deals, and the license deals will obviously have a P&L impact [indiscernible]."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I would like to emphasize the functionality for the question-and-answer queue will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Chief Investor Relations Officer, Mr. Joe Dorrego. Please go ahead, sir.\nJoe Dorrego: Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our fiscal 2021 third quarter earnings call. Joining me on the call today are Lachlan Murdoch, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Nallen, Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Tomsic, our Chief Financial Officer. First, Lachlan and Steve will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter, and then we'll take questions from the investment community. Please note that this call may include forward-looking statements regarding Fox Corporation's financial performance and operating results. These statements are based on management's current expectations, and actual results could differ from what is stated as a result of certain factors identified on today's call and in the company's SEC filings. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA, or EBITDA, as we refer to it on this call. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and our SEC filings, which are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Lachlan.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon. And thank you all for joining us to discuss our third quarter results. Once again, we have delivered a quarter of exceptional financial results, underscoring our ability to execute on our operating plan while making great progress on our longer term growth initiatives. Financially, we generated approximately $900 million of EBITDA, nearly as much as we did in the prior year quarter, when we had the benefit of a record breaking Super Bowl on Fox. This past quarter, our total company affiliate revenues increased by double-digits, once again, highlighting that our set of essential brands coupled with a focused strategy yields consistent industry-leading results. Our advertising performance was equally notable, despite the tough Super Bowl comparisons in the prior year, as we continue to see robust advertiser demand for not only our national and local in your assets, but for Tubi and our broader digital portfolio as well. Steve will give further details on these and other financial highlights in a moment. Over recent quarters, market commentary has indicated a focus on ratings trends at FOX News and on the outcome of renewal negotiations with the NFL. Our achievements in these areas are entirely consistent with the positive expectations that we have long been communicating to you. Our clear leadership and news coupled with the long-term renewal of the NFL provides a strong foundation to grow our company for years to come. Let me address each one of them individually. We have for the last several quarters being exceptionally forthcoming and utterly transparent about our expected outlook for FOX News ratings throughout the election cycle. Last November, immediately prior to the presidential election, we shared our belief that post-election the appetite for news would moderate and that a proportion of the record audiences that we were seeing would migrate back to the comfort of sports and entertainment content. At that time, what we did not anticipate was the short but heightened news cycle that immediately followed the election and that clearly benefited our competition. Last quarter, we experienced the post-election audience pullback that we anticipated. We also shared our confidence that the overall news audience would normalize back to pre-election levels. Through maintaining our dedication to providing America's best news, analysis and opinion, we had no doubt that the FOX News channel would regain its cable news ratings lead. I'm pleased to report that what we have shared with you over the last two earnings calls is precisely what has transpired. Since the second impeachment trial, FOX News regained its leadership position and maintain that leading spot ever since, averaging a 40% share of total day in primetime cable news audiences. Over this time, FOX News audience levels have held relatively firm when compared to our competition that have seen their audiences dropped significantly. With MSNBC losing approximately one-third of its audience and CNN losing over half over half of its audience. In fact, the FOX News channel finished this last quarter as the most watched cable network in primetime and finished March as the most watched cable news network overall. Calendar year-to-date, the FOX News channel is again the top rated cable news network and achievement that reflects a return to the leadership position that we expect not just to maintain, but to grow. Fortifying the success are the long thought out programming changes that we started implementing following the election and that have continued over the past several months. In April, the FOX News channel debuted the late night program, Gutfeld!, the exclamation mark is apropos as since its launch, the show is average over 1.5 million viewers per night, representing a 25% increase in the 11:00 PM to midnight time period versus the month prior. To put this into context, Gutfeld! is drawing an audience that is roughly the same size as Jimmy Kimmel Live! and larger than The Tonight Show, despite FOX News reaching fewer households than the broadcast networks. Our success at FOX News Media over the past quarter is not limited to our cable networks. FOX Nation, the direct-to-consumer offering from FOX News Media also had an impressive quarter, with the highest number of customer acquisition since launch and this momentum, which has carried over into the current quarter. Since mid-February, FOX Nation has seen a 40% increase in subscriber growth. The key drivers of this growth are the streaming of live events and the premier of exclusive flagship content, including the streaming of CPAC in February and the launch of Tucker Carlson content, including a new video of podcast series entitled, Tucker Carlson Today and long form documentaries entitled, Tucker Carlson Originals. Given the success that we have seen with this content, you should anticipate us to continue to invest in new programming for FOX Nation in the quarters ahead, to further increase engagement with our current subscribers and to attract new customers. Turning to the other important business development, I mentioned, we are immensely pleased with our renewal agreement with the NFL. Fox will continue as the home of the Sunday NFC package, the most valuable rights package in the NFL portfolio for the next 13 seasons. Just one reference point of its value to Fox. The Sunday NFC package has been the most watched NFL package for the past 15 years. Our NFC coverage is an important foundation for the FOX Network and strategically aligns with our local stations where we own and operate the Fox affiliate in 14 of the 16 NFC markets. Maintaining the Sunday NFC package is a significant programming milestone for our own stations and their local business partners and for our national affiliate base as well. In addition to our NFC package, we also added new and exclusive holiday games and secured rights to broadcast four of the next 12 Super Bowls. Fiscally, we are very comfortable with the scale of the new rights package, coupled with our decision not to renew the Thursday-night package. While we could not discuss this while we were in negotiations. Our intent was always to release Thursday-night and focus our future NFL investment solely on Sunday afternoon. Not only will we exit Thursday-night, but we also took the opportunity to do so one year in advance of the expiration of our existing deal with Amazon, assuming the rights to the 2022 and 2023 season or 2022-2023 season. Importantly, our NFL renewal also broadens and enhances our package of digital rights, providing us with the necessary flexibility and optionality to maximize all linear and digital opportunities in the future. Regardless of the way our businesses may change, our rights package provides us the ability to continue to evolve our business model. For example, we'll be increasing our digital programming right away by using our expanded digital rights to launch an NFL branded VOD channel on Tubi this coming season. Another important element of the new NFL deal relates to FOX Bet. Fox extended its rights to continue supporting America's leading free-to-play wagering game, FOX Bet Super 6. Additionally, FOX Bet has been designated an authorized sports book operator by the NFL. And we hope to share more details on the launch of NFL related integrations in the quarters ahead. The opportunity presented by uniting a leading media brand with prominent betting assets and influencers is tremendous. We continue to see substantial growth and revenue upside in this market and are investing to further expand and enhance our presence. Today, I'm pleased to announce an agreement to acquire Clay Travis' leading sports news and opinion platform, Outkick. Outkick is a natural compliment to several of our brands. And we'll deepen our investment in the sports wagering ecosystem. As a leader in sports opinion and pop culture content, Outkick provides clear overlap where their businesses and areas of expertise. Importantly, Outkick also creates content about sports wagering. And currently has an exclusive marketing arrangement with FanDuel that has proven remarkably successful. I want to welcome Clay and the Outkick team to Fox. Speaking of successful sports wagering businesses, we highly value our various partnerships with the Flutter Group. Currently, we are both looking to clarify our ongoing arrangements through a pending arbitration. While the arbitration process is ongoing, we do not expect to make any further comment about it. Turning to a couple of other areas. The harmonious mix of leading sports and entertainment on the FOX Network continues to prove a winning combination. Season to-date, Fox is the number one broadcast network for all primetime programming. FOX Entertainment programming, such as top unscripted shows like the Masked Singer and I Can See Your Voice and leading dramas like 911 and 911: Lone Star are delivering big audiences. We are deep in our program development process and are enthusiastic about the new shows coming to the network this fall. As we anticipate a return to a normalized full schedule, we are actively involved in our early upfront process and we are engaged with the leading agencies and brands about our respective plans. Brands are eagerly anticipating the pent-up consumer demand, following COVID and Fox offers the best place to invest multi-platform, multi-genre advertising commitments. Because of this, the very healthy current scatter market and the overall improving economic outlook, I am optimistic that there will be substantial demand across all of our platforms during the upfront, as we look to deliver solutions for advertisers. To that end, we are deeply integrating Tubi into this year\u2019s upfront discussions. The unmatched reach of broadcast network television and the substantial digital audience of Tubi presents unique opportunity for our advertising partners. Our decision to acquire Tubi was present, and we are focused on its growth plan over the near-term. In the short period, we have owned it. It is already exceeding all of our expectations and we continue to find innovative ways to expand its product offering and propel its growth. In terms of operating performance, in the month of March, Tubi\u2019s reach increased over 30% as measured by viewers and now reaches $40 million monthly active users. But as we have shared before, we are intently focused on engagement as measured by total view time or TVT, because that is what we monetize. To that end Tubi generated over 275 million hours of total view time streamed in March, a monthly record for the platform. Tubi also set a record for total view time in the third quarter with nearly 800 million hours streamed up more than 50% year-over-year. And this is on top of the exponential growth the platform experienced in 2020, where Tubi streamed more than 2.5 billion hours of content. We also shared additional demographic info for Tubi as part of its impressive new front presentation earlier this week. The median age of the platform\u2019s viewers is 37 years, that's 20 years younger than linear TV. Nearly 40% of Tubi\u2019s audience identifies as multicultural and over two-thirds of its audience does not watch other ad supported streaming services. Tubi truly broadens the reach of never television and allows our advertising partners to access a substantial incremental digital audience. And an audience that is not readily consuming other AVOD services as well. The increase in viewers total view time, and the unmatched advertising opportunity has translated into significant year-over-year revenue gains. Tubi\u2019s quarterly revenue increased over 150% compared to the same period last year. The power of Fox\u2019s promotional sales and content synergies are accelerating Tubi\u2019s business, putting it on a path to be $1 billion revenue business in the coming years. On the content side, Tubi has now expanded its library to over 30,000 titles, comprising of movies and series from all major Hollywood studios. Additionally, we are continuing to make more Fox programs available on the platform. Tubi features key Fox titles, including the Masked Singer, I Can See Your Voice and Lego Masters among others. And while Tubi continues to expand its library, it will also soon be home to its own original content. This fall, Tubi will introduce approximately 150 hours of original content, including movies and documentaries produced by Fox alternative entertainment and animated films produced by Bento Box. Contrary to the strategy of the major SVOD services. Tubi\u2019s goal is to turbocharge certain genres of content that already make Tubi successful, and thereby allow us to super serve certain segments of Tubi\u2019s audience, again, all to continue to drive engagement and therefore monetization to new heights. And the good news is, given Tubi\u2019s best in class tech stack, we will be able to measure the ROI on the original content investment as we go. Another important differentiator of Tubi\u2019s content is live local news. Tubi recently closed deals with scripts and talks to bring an additional 20 local new stations to the platform later this year. These added stations extend news on Tubi and on Tubi\u2019s reach to 24 of the top 25 markets. Underpinning the news on Tubi offering our live local news feeds from 18 owned and operated FOX Television Stations. In total news on Tubi will carry nearly 100 local station feeds in 2021 covering 58 DMAs and offering the most robust local news offering of any free streaming service. Another digital achievement across the company is the growth we are seeing at FOX Television Stations. Digital ad sales at our core stations are up nearly 40% compared to the third quarter last year. Our multi-year strategic investment to further build our digital capabilities and enhance our digital product and advertising teams at the stations are yielding great results. Across the entire company, we surpassed $1 billion in digital revenues for the third quarter year-to-date. Our owned and operated stations are also benefiting from the ongoing lifting of COVID restrictions. The financial services category and the entertainment category, which includes gaming are performing particularly well. We're optimistic that this trajectory will continue as restaurants, retail and other businesses continue to reopen in the large metro areas where our stations are located. Even despite COVID related disruptions, our fiscal year-to-date has been characterized by an operating and financial performance that has exceeded even our own high standards and our initial expectations. Our core businesses provide a stable foundation, but the opportunities that were propelled our future growth. We are optimistic about the current fourth quarter and look forward to milestones in fiscal 2022 that include the return of our full sports and entertainment lineups, the beginning of the midterm election season, investments in the growth of Tubi and FOX Nation, the launch of FOX Weather and the integration of Outkick. We continue to capitalize on the ongoing momentum of our core brands, as well as capturing the added growth from the initiatives I've discussed today. And now with that, Steve will take us through the details of this impressive quarter.\nSteve Tomsic: Thanks Lachlan, good afternoon. Having delivered another strong quarter, we are encouraged by the robust underlying trends that underpin our distribution and advertising revenues. And our strategic investments are exceeding expectations highlighted by the trajectory of Tubi. Before reviewing our financial performance for the quarter, it is worth noting at the outset that our third quarter results are comparing against our broadcast to Super Bowl LIV in the prior corresponding quarter, which accounted for approximately $500 million of net advertising revenue and approximately $100 million of EBITDA across the company last year. Where appropriate, I will share both our reported results and the underlying performance when excluding the impact of Super Bowl LIV. Now turning to our results for the current quarter. Our leadership brands and focused portfolio of assets delivered double-digit growth in total company affiliate revenues and mid-single digit growth in underlying total company advertising revenues. Excluding the benefit of the Super Bowl in the prior quarter and the consolidation of Tubi in the current year quarter. Total company affiliate revenues increased 10% with 18% growth at the Television segment and healthy 6% growth at the Cable segment. Meanwhile, the rate of subscriber declines continue to moderate in the quarter, with trailing 12 months industry sub losses running at approximately 4.5%. Our reported advertising revenues declined 24% in the quarter, due to the absence of the prior year broadcast to Super Bowl LIV and a slower news cycle. Despite the headwinds from comparability, our brands continue to deliver robust CPM growth across the portfolio led by the FOX Network and FOX News. Encouragingly, our core local television stations like Super Bowl, Political and the impact of the next stock transaction return to growth across the base market in the quarter. Meanwhile, advertising revenue growth of Tubi continues to exceed expectations. Today, we anticipate reaching revenue of $350 million for the current fiscal year, which is up from the $300 million forecast we shared with you on our last earnings call. Putting it altogether, reported total company revenues of $3.22 billion were down 7% over the comparative period in fiscal 2020. Excluding the impact of Super Bowl and the acquisition of Tubi, underlying total company revenues increased mid-single digits. Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $899 million, down 2% over the comparative period in fiscal 2020, excluding last year\u2019s Super Bowl contribution, quarterly adjusted EBITDA grew low-double digits led by continued growth at the Cable Network segment. Net income attributable to stockholders of $567 million or $0.96 per share was notably higher than the $78 million or $0.13 per share in the prior quarter. This was primarily the result of movements recognizing of the net, including the mark-to-market adjustments associated with the company's investments. Excluding this impact in other non-core items, adjusted EPS of $0.88 was up slightly from last year's $0.93, primarily reflecting the comparative items that I've just mentioned. Turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter. Our Cable Networks reported a 7% increase in EBITDA on essentially stable revenues. Cable affiliate revenues increased 6%, once again, led by double-digit pricing gains at FOX News and continued moderation in the rate of industry subscriber erosion. Cable advertising revenues decreased 7%. As continued strength in linear pricing and digital commercialization at Fox News Media was more than offset by the elevated linear audience levels of the prior year. Cable other revenues fell 24%, primarily due to the lowest sports sublicensing revenues and the absence of pay-per-view boxing events in the current year, both due to COVID as well as the disposition of our sports marketing businesses. EBITDA at our Cable segment increased by $58 million over the prior year and benefited from lower costs at FOX Sports, including the absence the prior year's Super Bowl week studio shows and production cost efficiencies. Our Television segment reported a 12% decline in revenues and an $89 million decline in EBITDA, both of which principally reflect the absence of the prior year contribution from the broadcast of Super Bowl LIV. Television affiliate revenues increased 18% in the quarter. This robust growth reflects double-digit increases for both our programming fees from non-owned station affiliates and for our direct retransmission revenues at our owned and operated stations and reaffirms, we are on track to achieve the television affiliate revenue growth we outlined at our Investor Day. Television advertising revenues declined by 28%, primarily due to the absence of the price of Super Bowl, partially offset by the benefit this quarter from the timing of our NFL Week 17 double header and the rotating NFL divisional playoff game. Meanwhile, on the back of the increasing total view time Lachlan mentioned earlier. Tubi set another advertising record this time for the March quarter, which seasonally is its slowest quarter. Other revenues at television increased 21%, led by higher production revenues at FOX Entertainment and higher content revenues at Bento Box. Turning now to cash flow. In the quarter, we generated strong feet free cash flow with $1.54 billion, reflecting our normal seasonal cycle of collecting advertising revenues from our fall programming and the result of our sports rights payments being concentrated in the first half of our fiscal year. Year-to-date, we have deployed $825 million of capital to repurchase approximately 90 million Class A shares and nearly 8 million Class B shares, and are on track to complete the $1 billion of share repurchases this fiscal year that we announced on our last call. Against our buyback authorization of $2 billion, we have net cumulative fleet repurchased over $1.42 billion, representing approximately 7% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in November 2019. From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $5.77 billion in cash and $7.95 billion in debt. As we look to the final quarter of our fiscal year, we expect continued progress and affiliate revenue growth and fair advertising revenues to strongly outpace prior year, driven in large part by the strong rebound in local advertising sales, as well as the acquisition of Tubi. Well, this couple and growth in the quarter will be more than offset by our investments in the Tubi and FOX News Media digital platforms, as well as higher programming costs due to the return of normal sports and entertainment schedules. We expect to deliver full year revenues and EBITDA comfortably ahead of fiscal 2020, despite the challenges of COVID and the comparison to a Super Bowl need. And with that, I\u2019ll now hand the call back to Joe.\nJoe Dorrego: Thank you, Steve. And I\u2019d be happy to take questions from the investment community.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We have a question from the line of Alexia Quadrani with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\nAlexia Quadrani: Yes. Really circling back to the decision to get out of Thursday Night Football a year earlier. I'm curious what kind of programming you plan to replace it with? And then more generally speaking, what other sports rights would make sense for you guys in terms of potentially adding to that portfolio?\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks, Alexia. Hope you're doing well. So we are \u2013 Thursday Night Football, when we entered into that agreement some years ago, we were focused on building that brand for the NFL and really sort of increasing its ratings and its production quality, bring it back to one home, if you remember, it was split amongst a couple of different networks, and I think we achieved all those goals. But having that, it was expensive and Sunday afternoon football is really the home of football frankly for America and for Fox. So having the \u2013 securing the NFC package at an appropriate price for us was our absolute focus. By releasing Thursday Night Football are early \u2013 a year early that we have to. We're going to achieve roughly a $350 million to $400 million EBITDA positive impact in that fiscal year, which we think is important. And then invest in the NFL rights going forward, so financially, it was absolutely the right decision, and we're proud of how we've been custodians of Thursday Night Football over the last few years.\nAlexia Quadrani: And in terms of other sports rights, you might make sense for you guys to look at or are you very happy with the NFL and NTL and the other sports you already have, and there is nothing else?\nLachlan Murdoch: No. Look, we're always keeping an open eye on sports rights and sports rights that become available. I think we look at everything, but we're very sort of financially disciplined with what we believe they're worth on our \u2013 certainly on our platforms and paying appropriate prices that are going to drive either our growth, whether it's from a subscription or retransmission point of view or an advertising point of view. But we continue to look at any significant sports rights that come available.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you.\nJoe Dorrego: Operator, can we go to the next question, please?\nOperator: We have a question from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBen Swinburne: Thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask a couple of questions on Tubi sort of the longer-term strategy. I know you guys have owned it, I think for about a year, maybe a little less. On the programming side, Lachlan, how are you thinking about programming Tubi as it relates to content that Fox owns and produces sort of the way you've run the broadcast network over the years versus just trying to build a big audience that you can monetize through advertising and using third-party content. If you have a view on that yet, it'd be interested in. And then as you go to market in the upfront and think about even the $350 million guidance you've given, how do we think about how incremental that is? In other words, I guess there is an argument that maybe some of that money is just coming out of Fox broadcast without a one pocket into the other. Can you just talk a little bit about your conviction in driving incremental revenue into the company from Tubi over the course of the next year or so?\nLachlan Murdoch: Sure. So thanks, Ben. Thanks for the question. So first of all on Tubi, the programming strategy at Tubi is entirely as we've discussed and this is a critical difference between Tubi and certainly other subscription video on-demand services and the hybrid advertising into a subscription video on-demand services that we see our competitors operating. And the Tubi is entirely focused on total viewing time. And the reason we're entirely focused on total viewing time is because that translates directly into revenue. So the more we can grow total viewing time and this is as opposed to purely users or and as far as service subscribers, the more we can grow total viewing time, we can translate that very directly into increased advertising revenues. And so, when we look at our programming strategy, we're not interested in spending billions of dollars as the others are on sort of driving subscriber basis with very expensive programming. What we're interested in doing is very efficiently scaling our programming to drive our total viewing time. And we can do this because of the technology, we can really target specific genres and specific cohorts of our viewers to drive their total viewing time, and hence drive revenue. So it directly correlates with it, so we've had a record total viewing time in the last months and it completely correlates with having driving record revenue. So that's a business model and that fits into the \u2013 sort of the efficiency of our programming strategy. To the second question, in terms of where we moving money from one pocket to the other, absolutely not. I don't know, well, I'm sure you did have the opportunity to watch the Tubi presentation at the new fronts just a few days ago. What Tubi allows for us and frankly for any advertiser that's also advertising at broadcast, it allows them to increase their reach dramatically. The advertisers are trying to reach new viewers and viewers that don't traditionally watch broadcast, they're younger, they're more diverse, they really need to go to Tubi to reach those audiences that can't reach them anywhere else. So what that allows us to do is really expand both the amount of the partnership, the scale of partnership with our current advertisers, but also find new advertisers that we haven't enjoyed our relationship with before.\nJoe Dorrego: Operator, you can go to the next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Ehrlich with BofA Securities. Please go ahead.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you. I have a question on sports betting, but just two small follow-ups, but it's from the previous questions. If you could say on Tubi like what the incremental investment will be in the coming year and on Thursday Night Football, will that effect your retrans, do you think over the next couple of years? And then for my question, it's on sports betting. Can you talk about the impact now on, I guess the owners are benefiting from advertising. Are you seeing any impact on ratings in markets where it's legal and what are the expectations down the road? There is a direct investment, but what are the ripple effects of sports betting? And if you can include your new acquisition of outset, you haven't said what you're paying or how big it is and so you'll integrate it? Thanks.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks, Jessica. I lost track of how many questions it was. So if you could \u2013 if I forget any, please remind me, it's good to hear your voice. So first on Tubi and I think it was the further investment in Tubi. We're really focused on being very efficient, being very disciplined around an investment in Tubi, while at the same time not losing sight of the immense opportunities that the Tubi is. I think we've designed our programming strategy and our marketing strategy around that. So a lot of the investment you will see will be accommodation of continuing to assign the revenue and what would have been sort of profitability of Tubi back into growing the business and adding some modest for capital in addition to that. So it's not a tremendous sized investment when it comes to sort of the scale of a Fox, but we think it's appropriate, given the opportunity that Tubi presents us. On Thursday Night Football, I think you asked what the effect on retransmission would be, the logic behind being able to release Thursday Night Football, not to follow it in the new deal and indeed to release it a year early is that we don't think it gives us incremental retransmission revenue above what we already get for the premium NFL package in the country, which is Sunday afternoon NFC package. So due to that, we can really save the cost of the Thursday Night Football package and invest further in Sunday, retaining all of our potential retransmission revenue through Sunday football. On sports betting, there was a couple questions, but I think the impact of sports betting and on the ecosystem sports betting in every market where there is licensed operators, they are spending heavily which is a terrific benefit to our station groups. We think this will continue. It's a very competitive market and this won't ameliorate anytime soon. And all the more reason why we consider further investment in Outkick is a great example is sort of a leading operator in both sports news and critically in sports opinion. You haven't seen Outkick or listened to any of its podcasts or radio shows or been through its website. You should, it's really a unique and special voice. And I think the one that aligns with the Fox audience incredibly well. So we're very excited to bring that team to be a part of ours.\nJoe Dorrego: Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question is from Robert Fishman with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nRobert Fishman: Hi, good afternoon. I also have an NFL related follow-up question. So with Sunday NFL rights locked up, do you expect your relative negotiating position to actually improve in your next set of deals with both the distributors and your TV station affiliates, especially if some of your peers make their live NFL games available on their streaming platforms?\nSteve Tomsic: Yes, so we are very mindful of the exclusive value of live NFL on broadcast television. And we're very mindful of the value that that attributes to both our O&Os, and also to all of our highly valued affiliates. So we don't have a \u2013 on a streaming service behind a paywall where we would currently put a similar cast of our NFL games. And we have no plans currently to do so.\nJoe Dorrego: Go to the next question, please.\nOperator: We have a question from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thanks so much. So I just wanted continue on the NFL vein, Lachlan. Thank you for taking the question. There's been a lot of discussion about the digital flexibility, the NFL broadcast rights holders have earned under these new NFL contracts. And Comcast already indicated it will simulcast its Sunday night football games on Peacock. Do you have any concerns regarding the impact more NFL streaming by your competitors if not by you might have on pay-TV subscriber levels as a result of more NFL games being streamed, and you noted the ability to be flexible in your business model, given the rights that you have. So what's the fail-safe if you start to see more erosion than you might've liked in the pay-TV subscriber base. What does Fox do to monetize those rights and earn a return on that contract? That'd be helpful. Thank you so much.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks, Doug. Yes, look, a huge part for us, and I can't speak for anyone else, but of our negotiations with the NFL in particular, because this is such a long-term deal was making sure we had the flexibility going forward to monetize these rights in different ways. And it's hard enough to think or to predict five years or six years out rather than sort of 12 years or 13 years out. And so we made sure we had every ounce of flexibility within our rights package to be able to evolve our business model and monetize these rights going forward. Having said that, today clearly the best monetization, the best opportunity to monetize the rights are through broadcast television, both with our owners and our affiliates. And that's really where our focus is.\nJoe Dorrego: Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: We have a question from the line of Kannan Venkat with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nKannan Venkat: Thank you. So Lachlan, I guess, if you just step back and look at some of the strategic decisions you guys have made recently, which is walking away from Thursday night football and investing in Tubi and sports betting. Broadly, it almost seems like a pivot in the business model where you guys were the loss leaders in football in the mid-90s and one slice of football and investing in other areas, is that how we should think about the investment priorities going forward, which is potentially new areas become bigger priorities for investment. And legacy television broadly becomes a cash source to pivot your business model. And then broadly, you think about the broadcast business, football is of course important, but what role does it have in the broader ecosystem? I mean, it is structurally in decline with respect to pay-TV subscribers and the kind of role it used to play in the past with respect to reach is very different versus what it plays today. So if you could just expand on the portfolio on the legacy television side and what the strategic priorities are across your portfolio? Thanks.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thank you very much. Look, I think our so-called legacy television businesses are all very healthy and we expect it to grow them significantly. But when you look at them from a point of view in terms of how we grow and how we \u2013 I think you used the word pivot, our business model going forward. You have to look at what they can offer in broader \u2013 with broader opportunities to monetize their existing content, right, and their existing genre of content. So if you look in the sports business, the sports business is really what's driving our wagering business, right, on our betting business. You're going to see us be really one of the major players, certainly from a media point of view in the sports wagering business in America, going forward, we're going to continue to exploit that marketplace and to grow in that marketplace. And that's really driven off the \u2013 our engagement with our audiences through our sports broadcasting business. We wouldn't have nearly the opportunity I believe in wagering, a stand-alone without coupling it with the FOX Sports and overall Fox brand and Fox audience. And this can be seen very clearly through our success with our FOX Bet Super 6. FOX Bet Super 6 in the last year, we grew very aggressively through marketing it across all of our platforms, FOX Sports, FOX Entertainment, FOX News. And we drove to over five million users. There was no other free-to-play game like that and at that scale in the United States and what that allows us to do with FOX Bet Super 6 obviously, is in the markets where we're licensed, drive that traffic or drive that sort of the widest part of that funnel into sports wagering and also the poker and casino businesses where they're licensed. So there's a tremendous opportunity there, but it's really because of our strength in our traditional sports broadcasting business. The same thing by the way is true at FOX News, we branded the FOX News business, FOX News Media, I think a couple of years ago. And that's really because you can't look at FOX News anymore as just a linear cable channel. The opportunities of FOX News to grow revenue beyond the impressive growth within cable is really through it's powerful website, it's podcasting, FOX Nation, new channels like FOX Weather. We're seeing a tremendous opportunities to expand its reach and the power of its brands.\nJoe Dorrego: At this point, we are out of time. But if you have any further questions, please give me or Dan Carey a call. Thank you once again for joining today's call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference call for today. Thank you for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Lachlan Murdoch",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon. And thank you all for joining us to discuss our third quarter results. Once again, we have delivered a quarter of exceptional financial results, underscoring our ability to execute on our operating plan while making great progress on our longer term growth initiatives. Financially, we generated approximately $900 million of EBITDA, nearly as much as we did in the prior year quarter, when we had the benefit of a record breaking Super Bowl on Fox. This past quarter, our total company affiliate revenues increased by double-digits, once again, highlighting that our set of essential brands coupled with a focused strategy yields consistent industry-leading results. Our advertising performance was equally notable, despite the tough Super Bowl comparisons in the prior year, as we continue to see robust advertiser demand for not only our national and local in your assets, but for Tubi and our broader digital portfolio as well. Steve will give further details on these and other financial highlights in a moment. Over recent quarters, market commentary has indicated a focus on ratings trends at FOX News and on the outcome of renewal negotiations with the NFL. Our achievements in these areas are entirely consistent with the positive expectations that we have long been communicating to you. Our clear leadership and news coupled with the long-term renewal of the NFL provides a strong foundation to grow our company for years to come. Let me address each one of them individually. We have for the last several quarters being exceptionally forthcoming and utterly transparent about our expected outlook for FOX News ratings throughout the election cycle. Last November, immediately prior to the presidential election, we shared our belief that post-election the appetite for news would moderate and that a proportion of the record audiences that we were seeing would migrate back to the comfort of sports and entertainment content. At that time, what we did not anticipate was the short but heightened news cycle that immediately followed the election and that clearly benefited our competition. Last quarter, we experienced the post-election audience pullback that we anticipated. We also shared our confidence that the overall news audience would normalize back to pre-election levels. Through maintaining our dedication to providing America's best news, analysis and opinion, we had no doubt that the FOX News channel would regain its cable news ratings lead. I'm pleased to report that what we have shared with you over the last two earnings calls is precisely what has transpired. Since the second impeachment trial, FOX News regained its leadership position and maintain that leading spot ever since, averaging a 40% share of total day in primetime cable news audiences. Over this time, FOX News audience levels have held relatively firm when compared to our competition that have seen their audiences dropped significantly. With MSNBC losing approximately one-third of its audience and CNN losing over half over half of its audience. In fact, the FOX News channel finished this last quarter as the most watched cable network in primetime and finished March as the most watched cable news network overall. Calendar year-to-date, the FOX News channel is again the top rated cable news network and achievement that reflects a return to the leadership position that we expect not just to maintain, but to grow. Fortifying the success are the long thought out programming changes that we started implementing following the election and that have continued over the past several months. In April, the FOX News channel debuted the late night program, Gutfeld!, the exclamation mark is apropos as since its launch, the show is average over 1.5 million viewers per night, representing a 25% increase in the 11:00 PM to midnight time period versus the month prior. To put this into context, Gutfeld! is drawing an audience that is roughly the same size as Jimmy Kimmel Live! and larger than The Tonight Show, despite FOX News reaching fewer households than the broadcast networks. Our success at FOX News Media over the past quarter is not limited to our cable networks. FOX Nation, the direct-to-consumer offering from FOX News Media also had an impressive quarter, with the highest number of customer acquisition since launch and this momentum, which has carried over into the current quarter. Since mid-February, FOX Nation has seen a 40% increase in subscriber growth. The key drivers of this growth are the streaming of live events and the premier of exclusive flagship content, including the streaming of CPAC in February and the launch of Tucker Carlson content, including a new video of podcast series entitled, Tucker Carlson Today and long form documentaries entitled, Tucker Carlson Originals. Given the success that we have seen with this content, you should anticipate us to continue to invest in new programming for FOX Nation in the quarters ahead, to further increase engagement with our current subscribers and to attract new customers. Turning to the other important business development, I mentioned, we are immensely pleased with our renewal agreement with the NFL. Fox will continue as the home of the Sunday NFC package, the most valuable rights package in the NFL portfolio for the next 13 seasons. Just one reference point of its value to Fox. The Sunday NFC package has been the most watched NFL package for the past 15 years. Our NFC coverage is an important foundation for the FOX Network and strategically aligns with our local stations where we own and operate the Fox affiliate in 14 of the 16 NFC markets. Maintaining the Sunday NFC package is a significant programming milestone for our own stations and their local business partners and for our national affiliate base as well. In addition to our NFC package, we also added new and exclusive holiday games and secured rights to broadcast four of the next 12 Super Bowls. Fiscally, we are very comfortable with the scale of the new rights package, coupled with our decision not to renew the Thursday-night package. While we could not discuss this while we were in negotiations. Our intent was always to release Thursday-night and focus our future NFL investment solely on Sunday afternoon. Not only will we exit Thursday-night, but we also took the opportunity to do so one year in advance of the expiration of our existing deal with Amazon, assuming the rights to the 2022 and 2023 season or 2022-2023 season. Importantly, our NFL renewal also broadens and enhances our package of digital rights, providing us with the necessary flexibility and optionality to maximize all linear and digital opportunities in the future. Regardless of the way our businesses may change, our rights package provides us the ability to continue to evolve our business model. For example, we'll be increasing our digital programming right away by using our expanded digital rights to launch an NFL branded VOD channel on Tubi this coming season. Another important element of the new NFL deal relates to FOX Bet. Fox extended its rights to continue supporting America's leading free-to-play wagering game, FOX Bet Super 6. Additionally, FOX Bet has been designated an authorized sports book operator by the NFL. And we hope to share more details on the launch of NFL related integrations in the quarters ahead. The opportunity presented by uniting a leading media brand with prominent betting assets and influencers is tremendous. We continue to see substantial growth and revenue upside in this market and are investing to further expand and enhance our presence. Today, I'm pleased to announce an agreement to acquire Clay Travis' leading sports news and opinion platform, Outkick. Outkick is a natural compliment to several of our brands. And we'll deepen our investment in the sports wagering ecosystem. As a leader in sports opinion and pop culture content, Outkick provides clear overlap where their businesses and areas of expertise. Importantly, Outkick also creates content about sports wagering. And currently has an exclusive marketing arrangement with FanDuel that has proven remarkably successful. I want to welcome Clay and the Outkick team to Fox. Speaking of successful sports wagering businesses, we highly value our various partnerships with the Flutter Group. Currently, we are both looking to clarify our ongoing arrangements through a pending arbitration. While the arbitration process is ongoing, we do not expect to make any further comment about it. Turning to a couple of other areas. The harmonious mix of leading sports and entertainment on the FOX Network continues to prove a winning combination. Season to-date, Fox is the number one broadcast network for all primetime programming. FOX Entertainment programming, such as top unscripted shows like the Masked Singer and I Can See Your Voice and leading dramas like 911 and 911: Lone Star are delivering big audiences. We are deep in our program development process and are enthusiastic about the new shows coming to the network this fall. As we anticipate a return to a normalized full schedule, we are actively involved in our early upfront process and we are engaged with the leading agencies and brands about our respective plans. Brands are eagerly anticipating the pent-up consumer demand, following COVID and Fox offers the best place to invest multi-platform, multi-genre advertising commitments. Because of this, the very healthy current scatter market and the overall improving economic outlook, I am optimistic that there will be substantial demand across all of our platforms during the upfront, as we look to deliver solutions for advertisers. To that end, we are deeply integrating Tubi into this year's upfront discussions. The unmatched reach of broadcast network television and the substantial digital audience of Tubi presents unique opportunity for our advertising partners. Our decision to acquire Tubi was present, and we are focused on its growth plan over the near-term. In the short period, we have owned it. It is already exceeding all of our expectations and we continue to find innovative ways to expand its product offering and propel its growth. In terms of operating performance, in the month of March, Tubi's reach increased over 30% as measured by viewers and now reaches $40 million monthly active users. But as we have shared before, we are intently focused on engagement as measured by total view time or TVT, because that is what we monetize. To that end Tubi generated over 275 million hours of total view time streamed in March, a monthly record for the platform. Tubi also set a record for total view time in the third quarter with nearly 800 million hours streamed up more than 50% year-over-year. And this is on top of the exponential growth the platform experienced in 2020, where Tubi streamed more than 2.5 billion hours of content. We also shared additional demographic info for Tubi as part of its impressive new front presentation earlier this week. The median age of the platform's viewers is 37 years, that's 20 years younger than linear TV. Nearly 40% of Tubi's audience identifies as multicultural and over two-thirds of its audience does not watch other ad supported streaming services. Tubi truly broadens the reach of never television and allows our advertising partners to access a substantial incremental digital audience. And an audience that is not readily consuming other AVOD services as well. The increase in viewers total view time, and the unmatched advertising opportunity has translated into significant year-over-year revenue gains. Tubi's quarterly revenue increased over 150% compared to the same period last year. The power of Fox's promotional sales and content synergies are accelerating Tubi's business, putting it on a path to be $1 billion revenue business in the coming years. On the content side, Tubi has now expanded its library to over 30,000 titles, comprising of movies and series from all major Hollywood studios. Additionally, we are continuing to make more Fox programs available on the platform. Tubi features key Fox titles, including the Masked Singer, I Can See Your Voice and Lego Masters among others. And while Tubi continues to expand its library, it will also soon be home to its own original content. This fall, Tubi will introduce approximately 150 hours of original content, including movies and documentaries produced by Fox alternative entertainment and animated films produced by Bento Box. Contrary to the strategy of the major SVOD services. Tubi's goal is to turbocharge certain genres of content that already make Tubi successful, and thereby allow us to super serve certain segments of Tubi's audience, again, all to continue to drive engagement and therefore monetization to new heights. And the good news is, given Tubi's best in class tech stack, we will be able to measure the ROI on the original content investment as we go. Another important differentiator of Tubi's content is live local news. Tubi recently closed deals with scripts and talks to bring an additional 20 local new stations to the platform later this year. These added stations extend news on Tubi and on Tubi's reach to 24 of the top 25 markets. Underpinning the news on Tubi offering our live local news feeds from 18 owned and operated FOX Television Stations. In total news on Tubi will carry nearly 100 local station feeds in 2021 covering 58 DMAs and offering the most robust local news offering of any free streaming service. Another digital achievement across the company is the growth we are seeing at FOX Television Stations. Digital ad sales at our core stations are up nearly 40% compared to the third quarter last year. Our multi-year strategic investment to further build our digital capabilities and enhance our digital product and advertising teams at the stations are yielding great results. Across the entire company, we surpassed $1 billion in digital revenues for the third quarter year-to-date. Our owned and operated stations are also benefiting from the ongoing lifting of COVID restrictions. The financial services category and the entertainment category, which includes gaming are performing particularly well. We're optimistic that this trajectory will continue as restaurants, retail and other businesses continue to reopen in the large metro areas where our stations are located. Even despite COVID related disruptions, our fiscal year-to-date has been characterized by an operating and financial performance that has exceeded even our own high standards and our initial expectations. Our core businesses provide a stable foundation, but the opportunities that were propelled our future growth. We are optimistic about the current fourth quarter and look forward to milestones in fiscal 2022 that include the return of our full sports and entertainment lineups, the beginning of the midterm election season, investments in the growth of Tubi and FOX Nation, the launch of FOX Weather and the integration of Outkick. We continue to capitalize on the ongoing momentum of our core brands, as well as capturing the added growth from the initiatives I've discussed today. And now with that, Steve will take us through the details of this impressive quarter. Thanks, Alexia. Hope you're doing well. So we are \u2013 Thursday Night Football, when we entered into that agreement some years ago, we were focused on building that brand for the NFL and really sort of increasing its ratings and its production quality, bring it back to one home, if you remember, it was split amongst a couple of different networks, and I think we achieved all those goals. But having that, it was expensive and Sunday afternoon football is really the home of football frankly for America and for Fox. So having the \u2013 securing the NFC package at an appropriate price for us was our absolute focus. By releasing Thursday Night Football are early \u2013 a year early that we have to. We're going to achieve roughly a $350 million to $400 million EBITDA positive impact in that fiscal year, which we think is important. And then invest in the NFL rights going forward, so financially, it was absolutely the right decision, and we're proud of how we've been custodians of Thursday Night Football over the last few years. No. Look, we're always keeping an open eye on sports rights and sports rights that become available. I think we look at everything, but we're very sort of financially disciplined with what we believe they're worth on our \u2013 certainly on our platforms and paying appropriate prices that are going to drive either our growth, whether it's from a subscription or retransmission point of view or an advertising point of view. But we continue to look at any significant sports rights that come available. Sure. So thanks, Ben. Thanks for the question. So first of all on Tubi, the programming strategy at Tubi is entirely as we've discussed and this is a critical difference between Tubi and certainly other subscription video on-demand services and the hybrid advertising into a subscription video on-demand services that we see our competitors operating. And the Tubi is entirely focused on total viewing time. And the reason we're entirely focused on total viewing time is because that translates directly into revenue.

So it directly correlates with it, so we've had a record total viewing time in the last months and it completely correlates with having driving record revenue. So that's a business model and that fits into the \u2013 sort of the efficiency of our programming strategy. To the second question, in terms of where we moving money from one pocket to the other, absolutely not. I don't know, well, I'm sure you did have the opportunity to watch the Tubi presentation at the new fronts just a few days ago. What Tubi allows for us and frankly for any advertiser that's also advertising at broadcast, it allows them to increase their reach dramatically.

Thanks, Jessica. I lost track of how many questions it was. So if you could \u2013 if I forget any, please remind me, it's good to hear your voice. So first on Tubi and I think it was the further investment in Tubi. We're really focused on being very efficient, being very disciplined around an investment in Tubi, while at the same time not losing sight of the immense opportunities that the Tubi is.

And I think the one that aligns with the Fox audience incredibly well. So we're very excited to bring that team to be a part of ours. Thanks, Doug. Yes, look, a huge part for us, and I can't speak for anyone else, but of our negotiations with the NFL in particular, because this is such a long-term deal was making sure we had the flexibility going forward to monetize these rights in different ways. And it's hard enough to think or to predict five years or six years out rather than sort of 12 years or 13 years out. And so we made sure we had every ounce of flexibility within our rights package to be able to evolve our business model and monetize these rights going forward. Having said that, today clearly the best monetization, the best opportunity to monetize the rights are through broadcast television, both with our owners and our affiliates.

So if you look in the sports business, the sports business is really what's driving our wagering business, right, on our betting business. You're going to see us be really one of the major players, certainly from a media point of view in the sports wagering business in America, going forward, we're going to continue to exploit that marketplace and to grow in that marketplace. And that's really driven off the \u2013 our engagement with our audiences through our sports broadcasting business. We wouldn't have nearly the opportunity I believe in wagering, a stand-alone without coupling it with the FOX Sports and overall Fox brand and Fox audience. And this can be seen very clearly through our success with our FOX Bet Super 6. FOX Bet Super 6 in the last year, we grew very aggressively through marketing it across all of our platforms, FOX Sports, FOX Entertainment, FOX News. And we drove to over five million users. There was no other free-to-play game like that and at that scale in the United States and what that allows us to do with FOX Bet Super 6 obviously, is in the markets where we're licensed, drive that traffic or drive that sort of the widest part of that funnel into sports wagering and also the poker and casino businesses where they're licensed. So there's a tremendous opportunity there, but it's really because of our strength in our traditional sports broadcasting business. The same thing by the way is true at FOX News, we branded the FOX News business, FOX News Media, I think a couple of years ago. And that's really because you can't look at FOX News anymore as just a linear cable channel. The opportunities of FOX News to grow revenue beyond the impressive growth within cable is really through it's powerful website, it's podcasting, FOX Nation, new channels like FOX Weather. We're seeing a tremendous opportunities to expand its reach and the power of its brands."

            "content": "Thanks Lachlan, good afternoon. Having delivered another strong quarter, we are encouraged by the robust underlying trends that underpin our distribution and advertising revenues. And our strategic investments are exceeding expectations highlighted by the trajectory of Tubi. Before reviewing our financial performance for the quarter, it is worth noting at the outset that our third quarter results are comparing against our broadcast to Super Bowl LIV in the prior corresponding quarter, which accounted for approximately $500 million of net advertising revenue and approximately $100 million of EBITDA across the company last year. Where appropriate, I will share both our reported results and the underlying performance when excluding the impact of Super Bowl LIV. Now turning to our results for the current quarter. Our leadership brands and focused portfolio of assets delivered double-digit growth in total company affiliate revenues and mid-single digit growth in underlying total company advertising revenues. Excluding the benefit of the Super Bowl in the prior quarter and the consolidation of Tubi in the current year quarter. Total company affiliate revenues increased 10% with 18% growth at the Television segment and healthy 6% growth at the Cable segment. Meanwhile, the rate of subscriber declines continue to moderate in the quarter, with trailing 12 months industry sub losses running at approximately 4.5%. Our reported advertising revenues declined 24% in the quarter, due to the absence of the prior year broadcast to Super Bowl LIV and a slower news cycle. Despite the headwinds from comparability, our brands continue to deliver robust CPM growth across the portfolio led by the FOX Network and FOX News. Encouragingly, our core local television stations like Super Bowl, Political and the impact of the next stock transaction return to growth across the base market in the quarter. Meanwhile, advertising revenue growth of Tubi continues to exceed expectations. Today, we anticipate reaching revenue of $350 million for the current fiscal year, which is up from the $300 million forecast we shared with you on our last earnings call. Putting it altogether, reported total company revenues of $3.22 billion were down 7% over the comparative period in fiscal 2020. Excluding the impact of Super Bowl and the acquisition of Tubi, underlying total company revenues increased mid-single digits. Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $899 million, down 2% over the comparative period in fiscal 2020, excluding last year's Super Bowl contribution, quarterly adjusted EBITDA grew low-double digits led by continued growth at the Cable Network segment. Net income attributable to stockholders of $567 million or $0.96 per share was notably higher than the $78 million or $0.13 per share in the prior quarter. This was primarily the result of movements recognizing of the net, including the mark-to-market adjustments associated with the company's investments. Excluding this impact in other non-core items, adjusted EPS of $0.88 was up slightly from last year's $0.93, primarily reflecting the comparative items that I've just mentioned. Turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter. Our Cable Networks reported a 7% increase in EBITDA on essentially stable revenues. Cable affiliate revenues increased 6%, once again, led by double-digit pricing gains at FOX News and continued moderation in the rate of industry subscriber erosion. Cable advertising revenues decreased 7%. As continued strength in linear pricing and digital commercialization at Fox News Media was more than offset by the elevated linear audience levels of the prior year. Cable other revenues fell 24%, primarily due to the lowest sports sublicensing revenues and the absence of pay-per-view boxing events in the current year, both due to COVID as well as the disposition of our sports marketing businesses. EBITDA at our Cable segment increased by $58 million over the prior year and benefited from lower costs at FOX Sports, including the absence the prior year's Super Bowl week studio shows and production cost efficiencies. Our Television segment reported a 12% decline in revenues and an $89 million decline in EBITDA, both of which principally reflect the absence of the prior year contribution from the broadcast of Super Bowl LIV. Television affiliate revenues increased 18% in the quarter. This robust growth reflects double-digit increases for both our programming fees from non-owned station affiliates and for our direct retransmission revenues at our owned and operated stations and reaffirms, we are on track to achieve the television affiliate revenue growth we outlined at our Investor Day. Television advertising revenues declined by 28%, primarily due to the absence of the price of Super Bowl, partially offset by the benefit this quarter from the timing of our NFL Week 17 double header and the rotating NFL divisional playoff game. Meanwhile, on the back of the increasing total view time Lachlan mentioned earlier. Tubi set another advertising record this time for the March quarter, which seasonally is its slowest quarter. Other revenues at television increased 21%, led by higher production revenues at FOX Entertainment and higher content revenues at Bento Box. Turning now to cash flow. In the quarter, we generated strong feet free cash flow with $1.54 billion, reflecting our normal seasonal cycle of collecting advertising revenues from our fall programming and the result of our sports rights payments being concentrated in the first half of our fiscal year. Year-to-date, we have deployed $825 million of capital to repurchase approximately 90 million Class A shares and nearly 8 million Class B shares, and are on track to complete the $1 billion of share repurchases this fiscal year that we announced on our last call. Against our buyback authorization of $2 billion, we have net cumulative fleet repurchased over $1.42 billion, representing approximately 7% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in November 2019. From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $5.77 billion in cash and $7.95 billion in debt. As we look to the final quarter of our fiscal year, we expect continued progress and affiliate revenue growth and fair advertising revenues to strongly outpace prior year, driven in large part by the strong rebound in local advertising sales, as well as the acquisition of Tubi. Well, this couple and growth in the quarter will be more than offset by our investments in the Tubi and FOX News Media digital platforms, as well as higher programming costs due to the return of normal sports and entertainment schedules. We expect to deliver full year revenues and EBITDA comfortably ahead of fiscal 2020, despite the challenges of COVID and the comparison to a Super Bowl need. And with that, I'll now hand the call back to Joe. Yes, so we are very mindful of the exclusive value of live NFL on broadcast television. And we're very mindful of the value that that attributes to both our O&Os, and also to all of our highly valued affiliates. So we don't have a \u2013 on a streaming service behind a paywall where we would currently put a similar cast of our NFL games. And we have no plans currently to do so."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, I would like to emphasize that the functionality for the question-and-answer queue has recently changed. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I\u2019ll now turn the conference over to Chief Investor Relations Officer and Executive Vice President of Corporate Initiatives, Mr. Joe Dorrego. Please go ahead, sir.\nJoe Dorrego: Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome to our fiscal 2021 second quarter earnings call. Joining me on the call today are Lachlan Murdoch, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Nallen, Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Tomsic, our Chief Financial Officer. First, Lachlan and Steve will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter, and then we'll take questions from the Investment Community. Please note that this call may include forward-looking statements regarding Fox Corporation's financial performance and operating results. These statements are based on management's current expectations, and actual results could differ from what is stated as a result of certain factors identified on today's call and in the company's SEC filings. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA or EBITDA, as we refer to it on this call. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and our SEC filings, which are both available in the Investor Relations section of our website. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Lachlan.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks, Joe. Good morning and thank you all for joining us to discuss our second quarter results. Financially and operationally, we continued our impressive results and strong momentum in the quarter with EBITDA growing by 17%, driven by revenue growth of 8%. These financial results were led by exceptional gains in advertising revenues, which grew by 14%, spurred by record political cycle, in which we generated more than $420 million of net political revenue company-wide during calendar 2020. The overall advertising strength was propelled by our FOX Television Stations, gains at FOX News Media, and the dramatic growth of Tubi. Beyond advertising and because of the substantial pricing power of our brands, our affiliate revenues grew by 6% despite a reserve taken for potential distribution credits. While we experienced a decline in subscriber volume, the trend improved for the third consecutive quarter. This quarter, we saw industry subscribers declined just above 5%, which is more than a 50 basis point improvement from what we experienced in Q1. The financial performance of Fox is illustrative of the strength of the core brands that anchor our company and of the contributions of new assets to lay the groundwork for continued growth and rapid evolution. As you know, the new cycle over the last year has been quite active and it has led directly to gains across our local stations as well as all the networks and all the extensions of FOX News Media. For example, Fox\u2019s ability to provide the best in local news was on full display at FOX 5 Atlanta during the Georgia Senate runoffs. Not only did our colleagues at FOX 5 report on the national significance of the Georgia election, they also expanded news coverage in response to viewer demand, held a candidate debate and produced special runoff programming focused on the issues impacting Georgia voters. During the entire runoff period, FOX 5 was the number one station in Atlanta for 6.5-hour morning news block. Hard work begets just awards. And so, it\u2019s no surprise we led the market in political revenues generated. This success was replicated across the FOX Television Stations footprint. Net political revenue approximated $190 million in the quarter, bringing our total for the stations in the first half of the fiscal year to approximately $260 million, an amount more than three times greater than the last presidential cycle. The news cycle also continued to connect engaged audiences to the various FOX News Media platforms: linear, digital, radio, and streaming for news, analysis and opinion. In fact, the FOX News Channel finished the quarter with the highest average prime time ratings in the history of cable news. The FOX News Channel closed the calendar year as the number one television network in weekday prime time, continuously topping all broadcast networks and total viewers since the very early months of 2020. FOX News was number one in election night coverage during prime time, beating all television networks and averaging 25% share of total viewers. While calendar 2020 ratings were record breaking, we are now seeing the expected post-election audience pullback that we anticipated on this call last quarter, and which is consistent with prior election cycles. We fully expect that the overall news audience will normalize and our share of ratings will dominate. In fact, this trend is already beginning as we have seen substantial share gains versus our competition since the inauguration. As in the past, we are confident that the strength and breadth of the FOX News Media businesses positions us for sustained long-term growth. I\u2019m pleased to announce that FOX News Media CEO, Suzanne Scott, has extended her term with the company. Under her leadership, FOX News has expanded its reach for consumers and has diversified significantly to become a multi-platform media brand. I\u2019ve been fortunate to work closely with Suzanne over the last several years, and I\u2019ve seen in action her ability to seamlessly guide the newsroom as stories break, her openness to new ideas and her ability to innovate new opportunities to grow our business. I\u2019m also happy with the programming changes that Suzanne is implementing, including Larry Kudlow\u2019s show on FOX Business Network that will premiere next week. We all welcome Larry to FOX. Turning to other areas of the company. Our mix of assets our viewers flock and even greater numbers to FOX Sports and Tubi post-election. FOX Sports leadership and live events demonstrates why it proudly and correctly claims to own the fall. Even within an atypical fall sport schedule, it was crowded with out-of-season events that had been postponed earlier in the year and included unexpected and sudden cancellations. Fox clocked nearly 170 billion minutes of live sports viewing in the fall, more than 50% above the next competing network. Our 27th season of the NFL demonstrated that Fox continues to be the preeminent broadcaster of America\u2019s most popular sport. With nearly 45 million viewers tuning in to Fox for the NFC Championship game, we eclipsed last year\u2019s NFC Championships audience that was broadcast during the later window. I want to congratulate the NFL for completing its season last Sunday. I know many of you on this call worried about the risks associated to Fox, if the NFL season fell short. It\u2019s a testament to the leadership of Commissioner Goodell and the professionalism of both the NFL and the incredible team at FOX Sports that we were able to deliver and broadcast such a historic season. Proud is not my favorite word or concept, but I am very proud of our team for this achievement. Elsewhere, the return of live sports boosted our sports wagering partnership, FOX Bet. After adding nearly 3 million players during the NFL season, FOX Bet Super 6 now has a user base in excess of 4.3 million players and continues to be the biggest free-to-play game of its kind in the country. We also continued our successful track record with non-sports Super 6 contests. For example, the Super 6 game covering the Georgia Senate runoff and the recently launched Stock Market Challenge game and weekly Quiz Show as promoted on Fox & Friends, enabled us to fully engage non-sports fans who generally wouldn\u2019t interact with the wagering brand. A key differentiator for FOX Bet has been across promotional power of all of Fox\u2019s assets to ignite the FOX Bet brand. In a similar fashion, we have mobilized the entire Fox portfolio to support and supercharge Tubi, which we acquired less than a year ago. This strategic acquisition, which is already a core asset for Fox Corporation, clearly merits some focused commentary. Tubi is an exciting growth engine for the company and a key strategic platform for not only our digital expansion, but also our broader reimagining of Fox\u2019s broadcast model for the future. In fact, I believe Tubi is an investment in what we internally call the broadening of broadcast, meaning the FOX Network and Tubi combining seamlessly to create a modern network-inspired business. With Tubi as part of our portfolio, Fox broadens from being the leader in broadcast network television into a leader in linear and streaming ecosystems. Both Fox and Tubi deliver distinct value to our viewers, partners and advertisers already. And we believe Tubi\u2019s technology and market approach, coupled with Fox\u2019s unique positioning as a focused network-first business, make them even more impactful when operated and offered together. You know the broadcast network well and our marketplace differentiation, so I\u2019ll focus on the already meaningful momentum and results of Tubi, and the significant sustainable growth that we envision ahead. Tubi have seen dramatic year-over-year increases across every key metric and it continues to grow beyond even our best acquisition expectations. Over the first half of the year, we have seen yearly unique viewers more than triple, total view time grow by nearly 70% and revenue more than double. In fact, Tubi\u2019s revenue for this past quarter alone broadly approximated Tubi\u2019s revenue for the entire fiscal year before we acquired the company. While some streaming services focus attention on metrics like sign ups or monthly active users, we think the most meaningful metric when measuring the performance of any AVOD service is Total View Time or TVT, as it is viewership that has direct and proportional relationship to advertising inventory and revenue opportunities. It is this profile of Tubi that is driving digital advertising partners to engage with our audience. Looking ahead to our plans to continue to boost Tubi, let me give you a bit more color on our content, technology and synergies strategies. Tubi\u2019s vast content library, by design, caters to a broad audience. We continue to strategically add to its offerings with marquee titles from Fox and nearly other program \u2013 every other program of note. The addition of The Masked Singer to Tubi provides a perfect example of the power of these assets combined. The show was a sensation when it launched on Fox. When we added The Masked Singer to Tubi, it added reach for advertisers, delivered significant view time on the platform and broadened advertisers seeking to be associated with the young, diverse and complementary audience that Tubi adds to the Fox offering. Another important differentiator for Tubi is its technology. Tubi is constantly enhancing its ad technology to provide better data and the results to digital advertisers. For example, Tubi recently introduced its advanced frequency management tool, which reduces ad repetition. In early study with a major insurance brand, this tool reduced over frequency to the same viewers by more than 360%. Simply stated, rather than continuing to show the same ad to the same viewers, as is often the case across other AVOD platforms, Tubi\u2019s tool enabled this insurance company to advertise to nearly 100,000 more households within the same ad buy. These compelling results led the insurance brand to make a multimillion-dollar ad payment to Tubi throughout 2021, and the brand is also a FOX advertiser now as well. Expect more technology advancements and offerings in the months ahead. Tubi\u2019s tech stack in general will separate Tubi from lesser AVOD options for years to come. Tubi has also rapidly become a synergistic acquisition. We\u2019ve had incredible success with advertisers who find their way to Tubi from existing relationships with other FOX brands. For instance, 50 advertisers who had not previously worked with Tubi, chose to buy Tubi during their recent upfront season. By combining Tubi into our portfolio of advertisers, we reached brands that may have been unfamiliar with Tubi\u2019s unique and additive audience, nearly 50% of which doesn\u2019t have a pay-TV subscription. We have a laser focus on growth and monetization at Tubi. As we continue to invest in Tubi, we believe it will become the AVOD platform of choice for viewers and digital advertisers alike, and become a larger piece of the broader Fox Corporation business. Translating this financially, we expect Tubi revenues to more than double in the current fiscal year, to exceed $300 million. And as we look out a few years, we envision Tubi becoming a $1 billion business and a core pillar of FOX. Tubi is a tremendous addition to our pre-existing portfolio of growing digital businesses, which we have built over time in a fiscally responsible manner. Over the first half of our fiscal year, our FOX News, Sports, Entertainment and Television Stations, digital businesses have attracted more than 330 million average monthly users, over a 30% increase in the comparable period in the prior year. These users spent more than 160 billion minutes consuming our digital content during this time, an increase of more than 70% from the first half of fiscal 2020. Tubi\u2019s digital destinations coupled with Tubi and Credible, we have generated well over $650 million of digital revenue through the first half of our fiscal year, with approximately two-thirds representing digital advertising revenues. These rapidly growing platforms, along with our must-have linear television brands and market expanding partnerships are exceeding expectations. As a united portfolio, they are even stronger with wide run rates for the businesses to collaborate, retaining existing viewers, harnessing new audiences, engaging consumers in new ways and broadening the touch points users have with FOX. And now, Steve will take us through the details of the quarter.\nSteve Tomsic: Thanks. Lachlan, and good morning. Highlighting the strength and momentum across our businesses, the company delivered double-digit growth in advertising revenues along with underlying double-digit growth in affiliate revenues in our fiscal second quarter. Our total advertising revenues increased 14%, with this strong growth led by the FOX Television Stations, the inclusion of Tubi, and continued linear and digital strength at FOX News Media. As we previewed on our most recent earnings call, the growth at our television stations was driven by record political advertising revenues. When viewed across the entirety of our portfolio, we generated quarterly political advertising revenues of approximately $250 million, bringing our fiscal year-to-date to approximately $340 million. Total company affiliate revenues increased double digits on an underlying basis in the quarter, once again demonstrating the strength of our brands and our focused portfolio of leadership channels. During the quarter, we recorded an accrual for potential distribution credits due to canceled college football games. While this credit was fully offset in our programming costs, on a reported basis, our total company affiliate revenue growth was 6%. This strength in our two most significant revenue streams drove total reported company revenues to $4.09 billion, up 8% over the comparative period in fiscal 2020. Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $305 million, up $44 million over the comparative period in fiscal 2020, due to the top line increases in revenues partially offset by contractual annual escalators for our key sports franchises. Net income attributable to stockholders of $224 million or $0.37 per share was lower than the $300 million or $0.48 per share in the prior year quarter. This decrease was the result of higher gains recognized in other net in the prior year quarter, most notably from the mark-to-market adjustments associated with the company\u2019s investments. Excluding this impact and other non-core items, adjusted EPS of $0.16 per share was up $0.06 compared to last year\u2019s $0.10 per share, primarily reflecting the growth in EBITDA. Turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter, with cable networks EBITDA of $571 million, was up 3% on revenue growth of 1%. Cable advertising revenues increased 31%, with the record audiences and digital engagement of FOX News Media leading this growth. Underlying cable affiliate revenues increased mid-single digits. This growth was underpinned by rate increases, including double-digit pricing gains at FOX News Media, along with a moderation in the rate of industry subscriber erosion, which is currently trending at a little over 5%. As I mentioned earlier, during the quarter, there were a number of COVID-19 related cancellations of college football games. As a result, we have recorded an accrual for the potential credit of certain distribution fees. While this credit reduces our reported cable affiliate revenues, it is broadly offset by a corresponding reduction in rights costs. Cable other revenues decreased by 32%, primarily due to lower sports sub-licensing revenues, again as a result of the cancellation of certain college football games due to COVID-19. These lower sub-licensing revenues were also broadly offset by corresponding reduction in rights costs. EBITDA at our cable segment increased by $15 million over the prior year period. This reflects the revenue growth that I just noted, partially offset by the shift of certain sports costs from our fiscal first quarter into our second quarter that we foreshadowed on our last call. The Television segment reported revenue growth of 13%, with the EBITDA loss improving $29 million to $185 million. Continuing the consistently strong growth we\u2019ve delivered since the establishment of Fox Corp, Television affiliate revenues increased 23% in the quarter. This reflects double-digit increases for both our programming fees from non-owned station affiliates and direct retransmission revenues at our owned and operated stations. The growth in Television advertising revenues was driven by the record political advertising I mentioned earlier, coupled with the addition of revenues from the fast-growing Tubi. These factors were partially offset in the segment by lower sports advertising revenues, including the impact of COVID-related cancellations of certain college football games, along with the postponement of key scripted entertainment program. EBITDA at our Television segment increased $29 million over the prior year period. This reflects the revenue growth that I just noted, as well as higher programming rights amortization of FOX Sports, primarily due to the contractual annual rights increases for our major sports franchises, including the NFL, and incremental costs due to the consolidation of Tubi. Partially offsetting these increases was a lower programming rights amortization at FOX Entertainment due to the postponement of key scripted entertainment programming as a result of COVID-19. Turning now to free cash flow, which we calculate as net cash provided by operating activities, less cash invested in property, plant and equipment. In the quarter, we generated a free cash flow loss of $155 million, which is consistent with the seasonality of working capital in our business. Reflecting our continued confidence in the business and our balanced approach to capital allocation, today we announced a semi-annual dividend of $0.23 per share and continue to be active with our stock repurchase program. So far, this fiscal year, we have deployed $450 million of capital to repurchase approximately 11.3 million Class A shares and 4.9 million Class B shares against our buyback authorization of $2 billion. We have now cumulatively repurchased just over $1 billion, representing approximately 5.4% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in November 2019. From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $4.5 billion in cash and $7.9 billion in debt. Looking through to the second half of our fiscal year is worth reminding you of a few factors that will impact comparability with the prior year. Starting with Sport. In the current March quarter, we will comp against last year\u2019s broadcast, the Super Bowl 54 on FOX. However, we did enjoy the benefit of one additional week of the regular season, as well as the rotating divisional playoff game this January. Our plans also anticipate a timely start to the NASCAR and Major League Baseball season. However, as we have demonstrated in the past, we will adapt to any potential COVID-driven disruptions across our sports calendar. Meanwhile, from an entertainment perspective, due to COVID-19, the launch of our key scripted titles on the FOX network has shifted from the first half into the second half of our fiscal year, with completion of our full season still dependent on minimal future disruptions to production schedules. In terms of cash flow, we continue to anticipate relatively low working capital usage over the course of the full fiscal year; and as a result, the normal working capital deficit exhibited in this year\u2019s first half reverses in the second half of the year. As we foreshadowed in the past, we continue to expect a higher level of capital expenditure in fiscal 2021 to support the final phase of the build out of our technical broadcast facility in Arizona and the upgrade of some of our local station facilities. With the majority of our full year advertising revenue already earned in the first half, a very light slate of affiliate renewals and a working capital tailwind that will build on our already ample liquidity, we approach the second half of this fiscal year from a position of financial strength. Assuming the continuation of a constructive macroeconomic environment, we intend to continue to both to deploy capital towards share repurchases and at targeting an additional $550 million in our fiscal second half to reach $1 billion in total buyback volume this fiscal year. To sum this all up, the results of our first two fiscal quarters demonstrate the strength of our underlying business. Its operating momentum combined with the benefits of strong free cash flow and liquidity and moderate leverage, position us particularly well for the future. And with that, I will now turn the call back to Joe.\nJoe Dorrego: Thank you, Steve. And now we\u2019d be happy to take questions from the Investment Community.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBen Swinburne: Good morning. My question is around FOX News. Obviously, there is been a lot written about the network and the business in the press of late, and you guys just put up a really strong first half of the year. Can you talk a little bit about the strategy to maintain leadership at the network, particularly sort of post the last administration, post the inauguration? And cord cutting is obviously out of everybody\u2019s control, but if you think about a mid-single digit headwind on volume for that business, do you think you can grow cash flows over time? I ask this because when I look at the stock, it seems like the FOX News outlook is not being reflected in the stock price. I\u2019m curious if you think that business can grow even with the sort of industry headwinds that we\u2019re all aware about? Thanks a lot.\nLachlan Murdoch: Hey, Ben; it\u2019s Lachlan. Thank you for the question. You\u2019re right, a lot being written about and we are few more trees cut down. I think I\u2019m writing about it in the days and weeks to come. Look, I think the fundamental \u2013 let me answer \u2013 there\u2019s two part to your question. Let me answer \u2013 I\u2019ll answer both parts, but let me answer the first part broadly and then specifically. So, in the journalism business, the journals in trade. What you do is you work out what your market is and you produce the best product you can possibly produce for that target market, right, for your readers or your listeners or your viewers. FOX News, the success of FOX News throughout its entire history has been to provide the absolute best news and opinion for a market that we believe is firmly center right. And we don\u2019t pivot or change that, and we haven\u2019t pivoted or changed that throughout the history of FOX News. So, we\u2019ll continue to provide the best journalism with the best hosts, with the best analysis, with the best opinion, going forward, as we have throughout our past new cycles. And we believe where we\u2019re targeted to the center-right is exactly where we should be targeted, as we\u2019ve been. We don\u2019t need to go further right. We don\u2019t believe America is further right, and we\u2019re obviously not going to pivot left. All of our significant competitors are to the far left. So, we\u2019ll stick where we are, and we think that\u2019s exactly right and that\u2019s the best thing for the business and for our viewers. Now with that, we will see a return in our ratings dominance. As I said, we believe the center-right is where Americas politics are, and we expected\u2013 as we foreshadowed in the last call \u2013 our ratings to be tempered after this election cycle, and we were right. We\u2019re down about 13% in ratings. If I go back to the Trump/Clinton election, CNN was down about 10% \u2013 17%, sorry, and CNN \u2013 MSNBC 10%. So, CNN 17%, MSNBC \u2013 sorry, yes, that\u2019s right. CNN 17%, MSNBC 10%. And so, we\u2019re right in between in that metric. So, this is a cycle that we\u2019ve seen before. It\u2019s a cycle we expected. We look forward to the news normalizing, and we will go on from strength to strength. The second part of your question though about, about really driving the business, continue to drive the business harder and continue to generate cash, I think we look at in two different ways. One is obviously the pricing power of our affiliate revenue remains relatively untapped. We think we can continue to drive pricing for FOX News well ahead of any sort of volume declines in subscriber numbers. That\u2019s very clear to us looking forward. And I think the other part is that the new businesses that we\u2019re driving out of FOX News Media, now with FOX Nation, FOX \u2013 the FOX Business Channel is growing, the FOX digital, all of the FOX digital assets, FOXNews.com and our radio, Fox radio; and now we announced this past quarter the launch, the coming launch of FOX Weather. So, when we look at FOX News Media, really is a broader ecosystem of FOX News brands that are all growing, and will all further contribute to growing EBITDA and cash going forward. Thanks, Ben.\nJoe Dorrego: Operator, we could go to the next question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Ehrlich from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you. I have a topic \u2013 multipart topic on sports betting. Can you talk about the impact that sports betting had on the quarter at the local station level? And as the adoptions continue to grow state-by-state, how big do you think that pool, that advertising pool can be? And then can you give us any update on your options and what you\u2019re thinking about your options on FOX Bet intangible? And finally, on NFL, how much is sports betting part of the conversation in your upcoming \u2013 in your negotiations for the upcoming \u2013 the next cycle? Thank you.\nLachlan Murdoch: Sorry, Jessica, can you just repeat the last one of the multiple? I guess definitely two questions.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: One question on sports betting.\nLachlan Murdoch: Yes.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Yes. So, on the NFL, I mean negotiations presumably are progressing hopefully well. How much is sports betting part of the conversation, given your unique assets?\nLachlan Murdoch: Great. Thank you, Jessica. Nice to hear your voice as well. So, first of all, from an advertising point of view, our strongest category in the station group is entertainment, which is pacing up 10% year-on-year. Entertainment is really made up of two things. One is sort of streaming services, and the second is sports betting. So, absolutely the sort of wagering businesses, both locally and in the States, we\u2019re wagering as legal but also FanDuel and DraftKings is really helping drive local performance at the station group level. I don\u2019t have that sort of broken out as \u2013 not as even as a category, but as a sub-category in sports wagering for you, but it is in the very top growth tier for us. And then obviously, so we\u2019re enjoying the growth of our sports betting, sports wagering on multiple fronts. One, from an advertising front at the local station level, but also obviously participating in it with FOX Bet and with our action, our option in FanDuel. We are really incredibly excited about the opportunities for FOX Bet. The Super 6, as we\u2019ve talked before in these calls and in person, the Super 6 funnel at the top of FOX Bet is working very efficiently. We set ourselves a goal during this NFL season to reach over 4 million active users. I will actually say, we set goal \u2013 we ended up with a goal of 4 million. We started with a lower goal. We\u2019re tracking so well during \u2013 middle of the football season that we increased the goal to actually 4.4 million users, which we achieved at the very end of the season. And that funnel is then successfully driving people into FOX Bet wagering, where it\u2019s licensed and legal, and we just launched in Michigan, January 26, and it was a very successful launch for us in that state. The \u2013 I think we\u2019ve talked about before, but the FanDuel option for our 18.5% is a 10-year option beginning this summer. I think its June or July. And that option is based on a fair market value, which are \u2013 were set with the Flutter acquisition of the Fastball stake in FanDuel. So, we will continue to be proponents and fans of the Duel brand strategy with FOX Bet alongside with FanDuel in these markets. And we are enjoying our partnership, our deep partnership, an important part of our partnership with Flutter. As to the NFL, this is a growing business; and absolutely, the NFL understands that this is a business that\u2019s important to us and it\u2019s important to how we are able to monetize our rights, our deals with them. I don\u2019t want to go into the detail of the NFL negotiations that we continue to be in \u2013 we\u2019ve been in for a while. We hope to bring those to a conclusion in the near to medium-term. But the NFL is very aware of the importance of sports wagering, I\u2019m sure to us, I\u2019m sure to sort of others as well. Thank you for the question, Jessica.\nJoe Dorrego: Operator, we can go to the next question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thanks so much. So, question for Lachlan, but I guess partly a jump ball. I\u2019m just curious, future profitability potential for Tubi. So that\u2019s the one question. The details are, you talked about the usage up 100% and advertising up 70%. So, a view time of 70%, revenue up more than 100%. So, CPMs are obviously expanded. I\u2019m just curious what the level of ad pricing is now relative to, say, broadcast primetime and where you see upside there? And you talked about Tubi being the leading AVOD platform in the future, and I\u2019m just curious, your view on competitive differentiation. I think a lot of content that ends up on these AVOD services is not exclusive. And so, what do you think will attract people to Tubi versus other AVOD platforms that are out there? And then lastly, just the margin structure when you hit that $1 billion plus of ad revenue for Tubi would be super interesting. Thank you.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thank you very much, Doug. So, let me start and Steve can jump in if I\u2019ve forgotten any part of the question. So, with Tubi \u2013 and I\u2019ll answer your question honestly, but I\u2019m not sure when I look at competitors\u2019 SVOD services, whether you prefer us to say we would be profitable early or we\u2019d spend billions of dollars in investing in the business before we saw breakeven because certainly, our strategy is very different from our competitor strategy. We see the SVOD competitive set as the potential to lose very many billions of dollars. We see it is very crowded. We see it is very hard to stand apart and differentiate ourselves within SVOD. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve really chosen to embrace AVOD as our direct-to-consumer strategy, and we think we can do this for really two reasons. I must say, what we hope to achieve out of this or we will achieve out of this is really twofold. One, and just to be very clear because I spent a lot of words in my preamble to this call talking about Tubi, but if the headline wasn\u2019t clear, it is that we expect to win in AVOD. We expect to win in AVOD and be the leading AVOD player in this country. And secondly, we expect to be able to do it by reinvesting our profits, but not by losing billions of dollars in programming costs or other costs in the time it takes to breakeven. Because of those two things, we will drive Tubi very aggressively. We will hit $1 billion in the medium term or near-term in revenue and the business will ultimately become a very profitable one for us. The other elements of the question, I think on sort of our broadcast CPMs versus digital CPMs; digital CPMs are lower than broadcaster and they\u2019re sort of the high teens. Obviously, some of the tech stack allows us to drive that further. And Steve, did I miss any other part?\nSteve Tomsic: Yes. So, Doug, just in terms of the other question, in terms of margin development as we get to that $1 billion, we aren\u2019t going to put a target out there obviously. But I think the way you should think about it is, in the near-term, if you look back over the last six months, Tubi has actually been P&L neutral for us, up from a bottom line perspective. We would expect that to change over the course of the second half as we continue to invest in the growth. And then over time as we take our foot off the gas in terms of investing in growth, you\u2019d see some pretty good conversion of revenue into bottom line margin as this business gets to scale, so. And when you look at that revenue development in the near-term, Lachlan is absolutely right in terms of where CPMs are. The way where we see a lot of headroom, where we\u2019ve gotten a lot of growth from in the initial phase has just been fill rate. And so, there\u2019s still plenty of headroom to take that further north.\nJoe Dorrego: Operator, we can go to the next question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Fishman from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nRobert Fishman: Hi. Good morning. As you think about future negotiations with the major sports leagues, how do you think Fox is positioned with its portfolio of networks plus Tubi compared to the other media companies that look to be using a hybrid approach of linear networks and their SVOD services for the top sports rights? And then on a related note, in light of NBC Sports Network shutting down, can you discuss the company\u2019s outlook for FOX Sports 1 and FOX Sports 2, and how you can use Flutter or FanDuel partnership to possibly play a role there?\nLachlan Murdoch: Sure. Thanks, Robert, for the question. So, first of all, we see NBC Sports, the announcement of it shutting down as probably a net positive for FOX Sports 1. There is less competition, I suppose, although we never saw them as our main competition. This year, FOX Sports 1 beat both ESPN2 and NBCSN for an entire year for the first time ever. So, we feel very well positioned. Obviously, with COVID and with some sports being less available, opinion programming, which is probably very reliable and you don\u2019t have the higher rights costs accounted for 35% of the FOX Sports 1 schedule and over 20% of viewing, which I think is important statistic. It shows that you can be compelling and you can win with a mix of both live sports, but also with the sports analysis and opinion that Fox Sports 1 has. Clearly, having a breadth of sports platforms will ultimately help FOX Bet and our partnership also with FanDuel. I\u2019d also include in that obviously the local stations and the amount of time and effort the local stations and their news and their sports broadcasting also contribute to promoting FOX Bet and engaging also with our partners at FanDuel. The last part there in terms of about sort of sports rights, I think that the thing that Fox has always had as part of its DNA is really a focus on the major sports rights as well. So, it\u2019s obviously Major League Baseball, the NFL, WWE. And so, our focus on our bouquet of sports is really the big sports that are going to move the needle and not so much in smaller \u2013 still great sports but smaller sports for other platforms.\nJoe Dorrego: Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Okay. That question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Can you elaborate on the overall advertising market? You had very positive comments on Tubi and its ad outlook, and I assume most of that is coming from the investments and improvements you\u2019re making on the platform, but are you also seeing kind of a nice tailwind from an ad recovery? And then just a follow-up to circle back on some comments you made earlier on, on seeing some improvements in the subscriber declines. I\u2019m curious if you can give us some color if that slight improvement is coming from bigger contributions or from virtual MVPDs or something else?\nLachlan Murdoch: Sure. So, first on the ad market, and in this last quarter, we\u2019re talking about, obviously, the impact of political as we\u2019ve discussed, Alexia, has just been tremendous. I\u2019d be tempted to say we\u2019ll never see a political season so big, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. I think when you have a Senate and the House so finely balanced, I think we\u2019re going to see these records broken in two years and four years for sure. So, the spending was pretty staggering. Obviously, we have the additional bonus of sorts with the Atlanta station and the Georgia runoff, which I think contributed to. I\u2019m not sure it was just a runoff, but the Atlanta station alone contributed about $60 million of political revenue in itself. So, in the past quarter, obviously the story, the headline is all political. I think in the current quarter, obviously we have difficult comps because of the Super Bowl, and obviously having had the Super Bowl last year, which by the way rated almost 102 million viewers. It was a terrific Super Bowl and a great achievement. That obviously, we can take that comp out. So, if we strip out the Super Bowl revenue, we\u2019re pacing in the negative single \u2013 mid single-digits, maybe even a little bit better than that. So mid single-digits down 5%, 6% as where we would expect to end up in local advertising for the quarter. That\u2019s a tremendous improvement if we look to COVID from a year ago, right. Every quarter, every month, we have seen advertisers come back. And now we are stripping out football and stripping out political and everything else. We\u2019re about back to where we\u2019d expect to be year-on-year. Of course, looking forward, the comps become much better because we will have been \u2013 we\u2019ll be comparing to the first quarter that was CVOID impacted versus now being in a more normalized advertising environment. From a category\u2019s point of view, I think I mentioned too in response to Jessica\u2019s question, entertainment leads the categories; home, professional services, all strong. I should just mention that on the flip side, that automotive, which is obviously a very large category for us, is still down. But this is primarily driven, skewed upon by our domestic manufacturers. In fact, foreign auto spending is roughly flat. By the way, second part of your question\u2026\nSteve Tomsic: Yes, Alexia, just in terms of the improvement in sub-decline, if I look where we were like six months ago, I think what we\u2019ve seen is continued growth of the virtual MVPD is for sure. But we\u2019ve also seen a bit more balance coming. We\u2019ve actually seen the traditionals, their sub decline has moderated a touch. So, coming from both sides of that equation.\nJoe Dorrego: At this point, we are out of time, but if you have any further questions, please give me or Dan Carey a call. Thank you once again for joining today\u2019s call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Lachlan Murdoch",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe. Good morning and thank you all for joining us to discuss our second quarter results. Financially and operationally, we continued our impressive results and strong momentum in the quarter with EBITDA growing by 17%, driven by revenue growth of 8%. These financial results were led by exceptional gains in advertising revenues, which grew by 14%, spurred by record political cycle, in which we generated more than $420 million of net political revenue company-wide during calendar 2020. The overall advertising strength was propelled by our FOX Television Stations, gains at FOX News Media, and the dramatic growth of Tubi. Beyond advertising and because of the substantial pricing power of our brands, our affiliate revenues grew by 6% despite a reserve taken for potential distribution credits. While we experienced a decline in subscriber volume, the trend improved for the third consecutive quarter. This quarter, we saw industry subscribers declined just above 5%, which is more than a 50 basis point improvement from what we experienced in Q1. The financial performance of Fox is illustrative of the strength of the core brands that anchor our company and of the contributions of new assets to lay the groundwork for continued growth and rapid evolution. As you know, the new cycle over the last year has been quite active and it has led directly to gains across our local stations as well as all the networks and all the extensions of FOX News Media. For example, Fox's ability to provide the best in local news was on full display at FOX 5 Atlanta during the Georgia Senate runoffs. Not only did our colleagues at FOX 5 report on the national significance of the Georgia election, they also expanded news coverage in response to viewer demand, held a candidate debate and produced special runoff programming focused on the issues impacting Georgia voters. During the entire runoff period, FOX 5 was the number one station in Atlanta for 6.5-hour morning news block. Hard work begets just awards. And so, it's no surprise we led the market in political revenues generated. This success was replicated across the FOX Television Stations footprint. Net political revenue approximated $190 million in the quarter, bringing our total for the stations in the first half of the fiscal year to approximately $260 million, an amount more than three times greater than the last presidential cycle. The news cycle also continued to connect engaged audiences to the various FOX News Media platforms: linear, digital, radio, and streaming for news, analysis and opinion. In fact, the FOX News Channel finished the quarter with the highest average prime time ratings in the history of cable news. The FOX News Channel closed the calendar year as the number one television network in weekday prime time, continuously topping all broadcast networks and total viewers since the very early months of 2020. FOX News was number one in election night coverage during prime time, beating all television networks and averaging 25% share of total viewers. While calendar 2020 ratings were record breaking, we are now seeing the expected post-election audience pullback that we anticipated on this call last quarter, and which is consistent with prior election cycles. We fully expect that the overall news audience will normalize and our share of ratings will dominate. In fact, this trend is already beginning as we have seen substantial share gains versus our competition since the inauguration. As in the past, we are confident that the strength and breadth of the FOX News Media businesses positions us for sustained long-term growth. I'm pleased to announce that FOX News Media CEO, Suzanne Scott, has extended her term with the company. Under her leadership, FOX News has expanded its reach for consumers and has diversified significantly to become a multi-platform media brand. I've been fortunate to work closely with Suzanne over the last several years, and I've seen in action her ability to seamlessly guide the newsroom as stories break, her openness to new ideas and her ability to innovate new opportunities to grow our business. I'm also happy with the programming changes that Suzanne is implementing, including Larry Kudlow's show on FOX Business Network that will premiere next week. We all welcome Larry to FOX. Turning to other areas of the company. Our mix of assets our viewers flock and even greater numbers to FOX Sports and Tubi post-election. FOX Sports leadership and live events demonstrates why it proudly and correctly claims to own the fall. Even within an atypical fall sport schedule, it was crowded with out-of-season events that had been postponed earlier in the year and included unexpected and sudden cancellations. Fox clocked nearly 170 billion minutes of live sports viewing in the fall, more than 50% above the next competing network. Our 27th season of the NFL demonstrated that Fox continues to be the preeminent broadcaster of America's most popular sport. With nearly 45 million viewers tuning in to Fox for the NFC Championship game, we eclipsed last year's NFC Championships audience that was broadcast during the later window. I want to congratulate the NFL for completing its season last Sunday. I know many of you on this call worried about the risks associated to Fox, if the NFL season fell short. It's a testament to the leadership of Commissioner Goodell and the professionalism of both the NFL and the incredible team at FOX Sports that we were able to deliver and broadcast such a historic season. Proud is not my favorite word or concept, but I am very proud of our team for this achievement. Elsewhere, the return of live sports boosted our sports wagering partnership, FOX Bet. After adding nearly 3 million players during the NFL season, FOX Bet Super 6 now has a user base in excess of 4.3 million players and continues to be the biggest free-to-play game of its kind in the country. We also continued our successful track record with non-sports Super 6 contests. For example, the Super 6 game covering the Georgia Senate runoff and the recently launched Stock Market Challenge game and weekly Quiz Show as promoted on Fox & Friends, enabled us to fully engage non-sports fans who generally wouldn't interact with the wagering brand. A key differentiator for FOX Bet has been across promotional power of all of Fox's assets to ignite the FOX Bet brand. In a similar fashion, we have mobilized the entire Fox portfolio to support and supercharge Tubi, which we acquired less than a year ago. This strategic acquisition, which is already a core asset for Fox Corporation, clearly merits some focused commentary. Tubi is an exciting growth engine for the company and a key strategic platform for not only our digital expansion, but also our broader reimagining of Fox's broadcast model for the future. In fact, I believe Tubi is an investment in what we internally call the broadening of broadcast, meaning the FOX Network and Tubi combining seamlessly to create a modern network-inspired business. With Tubi as part of our portfolio, Fox broadens from being the leader in broadcast network television into a leader in linear and streaming ecosystems. Both Fox and Tubi deliver distinct value to our viewers, partners and advertisers already. And we believe Tubi's technology and market approach, coupled with Fox's unique positioning as a focused network-first business, make them even more impactful when operated and offered together. You know the broadcast network well and our marketplace differentiation, so I'll focus on the already meaningful momentum and results of Tubi, and the significant sustainable growth that we envision ahead. Tubi have seen dramatic year-over-year increases across every key metric and it continues to grow beyond even our best acquisition expectations. Over the first half of the year, we have seen yearly unique viewers more than triple, total view time grow by nearly 70% and revenue more than double. In fact, Tubi's revenue for this past quarter alone broadly approximated Tubi's revenue for the entire fiscal year before we acquired the company. While some streaming services focus attention on metrics like sign ups or monthly active users, we think the most meaningful metric when measuring the performance of any AVOD service is Total View Time or TVT, as it is viewership that has direct and proportional relationship to advertising inventory and revenue opportunities. It is this profile of Tubi that is driving digital advertising partners to engage with our audience. Looking ahead to our plans to continue to boost Tubi, let me give you a bit more color on our content, technology and synergies strategies. Tubi's vast content library, by design, caters to a broad audience. We continue to strategically add to its offerings with marquee titles from Fox and nearly other program \u2013 every other program of note. The addition of The Masked Singer to Tubi provides a perfect example of the power of these assets combined. The show was a sensation when it launched on Fox. When we added The Masked Singer to Tubi, it added reach for advertisers, delivered significant view time on the platform and broadened advertisers seeking to be associated with the young, diverse and complementary audience that Tubi adds to the Fox offering. Another important differentiator for Tubi is its technology. Tubi is constantly enhancing its ad technology to provide better data and the results to digital advertisers. For example, Tubi recently introduced its advanced frequency management tool, which reduces ad repetition. In early study with a major insurance brand, this tool reduced over frequency to the same viewers by more than 360%. Simply stated, rather than continuing to show the same ad to the same viewers, as is often the case across other AVOD platforms, Tubi's tool enabled this insurance company to advertise to nearly 100,000 more households within the same ad buy. These compelling results led the insurance brand to make a multimillion-dollar ad payment to Tubi throughout 2021, and the brand is also a FOX advertiser now as well. Expect more technology advancements and offerings in the months ahead. Tubi's tech stack in general will separate Tubi from lesser AVOD options for years to come. Tubi has also rapidly become a synergistic acquisition. We've had incredible success with advertisers who find their way to Tubi from existing relationships with other FOX brands. For instance, 50 advertisers who had not previously worked with Tubi, chose to buy Tubi during their recent upfront season. By combining Tubi into our portfolio of advertisers, we reached brands that may have been unfamiliar with Tubi's unique and additive audience, nearly 50% of which doesn't have a pay-TV subscription. We have a laser focus on growth and monetization at Tubi. As we continue to invest in Tubi, we believe it will become the AVOD platform of choice for viewers and digital advertisers alike, and become a larger piece of the broader Fox Corporation business. Translating this financially, we expect Tubi revenues to more than double in the current fiscal year, to exceed $300 million. And as we look out a few years, we envision Tubi becoming a $1 billion business and a core pillar of FOX. Tubi is a tremendous addition to our pre-existing portfolio of growing digital businesses, which we have built over time in a fiscally responsible manner. Over the first half of our fiscal year, our FOX News, Sports, Entertainment and Television Stations, digital businesses have attracted more than 330 million average monthly users, over a 30% increase in the comparable period in the prior year. These users spent more than 160 billion minutes consuming our digital content during this time, an increase of more than 70% from the first half of fiscal 2020. Tubi's digital destinations coupled with Tubi and Credible, we have generated well over $650 million of digital revenue through the first half of our fiscal year, with approximately two-thirds representing digital advertising revenues. These rapidly growing platforms, along with our must-have linear television brands and market expanding partnerships are exceeding expectations. As a united portfolio, they are even stronger with wide run rates for the businesses to collaborate, retaining existing viewers, harnessing new audiences, engaging consumers in new ways and broadening the touch points users have with FOX. And now, Steve will take us through the details of the quarter. Hey, Ben; it's Lachlan. Thank you for the question. You're right, a lot being written about and we are few more trees cut down. I think I'm writing about it in the days and weeks to come. Look, I think the fundamental \u2013 let me answer \u2013 there's two part to your question. Let me answer \u2013 I'll answer both parts, but let me answer the first part broadly and then specifically. So, in the journalism business, the journals in trade. What you do is you work out what your market is and you produce the best product you can possibly produce for that target market, right, for your readers or your listeners or your viewers. FOX News, the success of FOX News throughout its entire history has been to provide the absolute best news and opinion for a market that we believe is firmly center right. And we don't pivot or change that, and we haven't pivoted or changed that throughout the history of FOX News. So, we'll continue to provide the best journalism with the best hosts, with the best analysis, with the best opinion, going forward, as we have throughout our past new cycles. And we believe where we're targeted to the center-right is exactly where we should be targeted, as we've been. We don't need to go further right. We don't believe America is further right, and we're obviously not going to pivot left. All of our significant competitors are to the far left. So, we'll stick where we are, and we think that's exactly right and that's the best thing for the business and for our viewers. Now with that, we will see a return in our ratings dominance. As I said, we believe the center-right is where Americas politics are, and we expected\u2013 as we foreshadowed in the last call \u2013 our ratings to be tempered after this election cycle, and we were right. We're down about 13% in ratings. If I go back to the Trump/Clinton election, CNN was down about 10% \u2013 17%, sorry, and CNN \u2013 MSNBC 10%. So, CNN 17%, MSNBC \u2013 sorry, yes, that's right. CNN 17%, MSNBC 10%. And so, we're right in between in that metric. So, this is a cycle that we've seen before. It's a cycle we expected. We look forward to the news normalizing, and we will go on from strength to strength. The second part of your question though about, about really driving the business, continue to drive the business harder and continue to generate cash, I think we look at in two different ways. One is obviously the pricing power of our affiliate revenue remains relatively untapped. We think we can continue to drive pricing for FOX News well ahead of any sort of volume declines in subscriber numbers. That's very clear to us looking forward. And I think the other part is that the new businesses that we're driving out of FOX News Media, now with FOX Nation, FOX \u2013 the FOX Business Channel is growing, the FOX digital, all of the FOX digital assets, FOXNews.com and our radio, Fox radio; and now we announced this past quarter the launch, the coming launch of FOX Weather. So, when we look at FOX News Media, really is a broader ecosystem of FOX News brands that are all growing, and will all further contribute to growing EBITDA and cash going forward. Thanks, Ben. Sorry, Jessica, can you just repeat the last one of the multiple? I guess definitely two questions. Yes. Great. Thank you, Jessica. Nice to hear your voice as well. So, first of all, from an advertising point of view, our strongest category in the station group is entertainment, which is pacing up 10% year-on-year. Entertainment is really made up of two things. One is sort of streaming services, and the second is sports betting. So, absolutely the sort of wagering businesses, both locally and in the States, we're wagering as legal but also FanDuel and DraftKings is really helping drive local performance at the station group level. I don't have that sort of broken out as \u2013 not as even as a category, but as a sub-category in sports wagering for you, but it is in the very top growth tier for us. And then obviously, so we're enjoying the growth of our sports betting, sports wagering on multiple fronts. One, from an advertising front at the local station level, but also obviously participating in it with FOX Bet and with our action, our option in FanDuel. We are really incredibly excited about the opportunities for FOX Bet. The Super 6, as we've talked before in these calls and in person, the Super 6 funnel at the top of FOX Bet is working very efficiently. We set ourselves a goal during this NFL season to reach over 4 million active users. I will actually say, we set goal \u2013 we ended up with a goal of 4 million. We started with a lower goal. We're tracking so well during \u2013 middle of the football season that we increased the goal to actually 4.4 million users, which we achieved at the very end of the season. And that funnel is then successfully driving people into FOX Bet wagering, where it's licensed and legal, and we just launched in Michigan, January 26, and it was a very successful launch for us in that state. The \u2013 I think we've talked about before, but the FanDuel option for our 18.5% is a 10-year option beginning this summer. I think its June or July. And that option is based on a fair market value, which are \u2013 were set with the Flutter acquisition of the Fastball stake in FanDuel. So, we will continue to be proponents and fans of the Duel brand strategy with FOX Bet alongside with FanDuel in these markets. And we are enjoying our partnership, our deep partnership, an important part of our partnership with Flutter. As to the NFL, this is a growing business; and absolutely, the NFL understands that this is a business that's important to us and it's important to how we are able to monetize our rights, our deals with them. I don't want to go into the detail of the NFL negotiations that we continue to be in \u2013 we've been in for a while. We hope to bring those to a conclusion in the near to medium-term. But the NFL is very aware of the importance of sports wagering, I'm sure to us, I'm sure to sort of others as well. Thank you for the question, Jessica. Thank you very much, Doug. So, let me start and Steve can jump in if I've forgotten any part of the question. So, with Tubi \u2013 and I'll answer your question honestly, but I'm not sure when I look at competitors' SVOD services, whether you prefer us to say we would be profitable early or we'd spend billions of dollars in investing in the business before we saw breakeven because certainly, our strategy is very different from our competitor strategy. We see the SVOD competitive set as the potential to lose very many billions of dollars. We see it is very crowded. We see it is very hard to stand apart and differentiate ourselves within SVOD. And that's why we've really chosen to embrace AVOD as our direct-to-consumer strategy, and we think we can do this for really two reasons. I must say, what we hope to achieve out of this or we will achieve out of this is really twofold. One, and just to be very clear because I spent a lot of words in my preamble to this call talking about Tubi, but if the headline wasn't clear, it is that we expect to win in AVOD. We expect to win in AVOD and be the leading AVOD player in this country. And secondly, we expect to be able to do it by reinvesting our profits, but not by losing billions of dollars in programming costs or other costs in the time it takes to breakeven. Because of those two things, we will drive Tubi very aggressively. We will hit $1 billion in the medium term or near-term in revenue and the business will ultimately become a very profitable one for us. The other elements of the question, I think on sort of our broadcast CPMs versus digital CPMs; digital CPMs are lower than broadcaster and they're sort of the high teens. Obviously, some of the tech stack allows us to drive that further. And Steve, did I miss any other part? Sure. Thanks, Robert, for the question. So, first of all, we see NBC Sports, the announcement of it shutting down as probably a net positive for FOX Sports 1. There is less competition, I suppose, although we never saw them as our main competition. This year, FOX Sports 1 beat both ESPN2 and NBCSN for an entire year for the first time ever. So, we feel very well positioned. Obviously, with COVID and with some sports being less available, opinion programming, which is probably very reliable and you don't have the higher rights costs accounted for 35% of the FOX Sports 1 schedule and over 20% of viewing, which I think is important statistic. It shows that you can be compelling and you can win with a mix of both live sports, but also with the sports analysis and opinion that Fox Sports 1 has. Clearly, having a breadth of sports platforms will ultimately help FOX Bet and our partnership also with FanDuel. I'd also include in that obviously the local stations and the amount of time and effort the local stations and their news and their sports broadcasting also contribute to promoting FOX Bet and engaging also with our partners at FanDuel. The last part there in terms of about sort of sports rights, I think that the thing that Fox has always had as part of its DNA is really a focus on the major sports rights as well. So, it's obviously Major League Baseball, the NFL, WWE. And so, our focus on our bouquet of sports is really the big sports that are going to move the needle and not so much in smaller \u2013 still great sports but smaller sports for other platforms. Sure. So, first on the ad market, and in this last quarter, we're talking about, obviously, the impact of political as we've discussed, Alexia, has just been tremendous. I'd be tempted to say we'll never see a political season so big, but I don't think that's true. I think when you have a Senate and the House so finely balanced, I think we're going to see these records broken in two years and four years for sure. So, the spending was pretty staggering. Obviously, we have the additional bonus of sorts with the Atlanta station and the Georgia runoff, which I think contributed to. I'm not sure it was just a runoff, but the Atlanta station alone contributed about $60 million of political revenue in itself. So, in the past quarter, obviously the story, the headline is all political. I think in the current quarter, obviously we have difficult comps because of the Super Bowl, and obviously having had the Super Bowl last year, which by the way rated almost 102 million viewers. It was a terrific Super Bowl and a great achievement. That obviously, we can take that comp out. So, if we strip out the Super Bowl revenue, we're pacing in the negative single \u2013 mid single-digits, maybe even a little bit better than that. So mid single-digits down 5%, 6% as where we would expect to end up in local advertising for the quarter. That's a tremendous improvement if we look to COVID from a year ago, right. Every quarter, every month, we have seen advertisers come back. And now we are stripping out football and stripping out political and everything else. We're about back to where we'd expect to be year-on-year. Of course, looking forward, the comps become much better because we will have been \u2013 we'll be comparing to the first quarter that was CVOID impacted versus now being in a more normalized advertising environment. From a category's point of view, I think I mentioned too in response to Jessica's question, entertainment leads the categories; home, professional services, all strong. I should just mention that on the flip side, that automotive, which is obviously a very large category for us, is still down. But this is primarily driven, skewed upon by our domestic manufacturers. In fact, foreign auto spending is roughly flat. By the way, second part of your question..."

            "name": "Steve Tomsic",
            "content": "Thanks. Lachlan, and good morning. Highlighting the strength and momentum across our businesses, the company delivered double-digit growth in advertising revenues along with underlying double-digit growth in affiliate revenues in our fiscal second quarter. Our total advertising revenues increased 14%, with this strong growth led by the FOX Television Stations, the inclusion of Tubi, and continued linear and digital strength at FOX News Media. As we previewed on our most recent earnings call, the growth at our television stations was driven by record political advertising revenues. When viewed across the entirety of our portfolio, we generated quarterly political advertising revenues of approximately $250 million, bringing our fiscal year-to-date to approximately $340 million. Total company affiliate revenues increased double digits on an underlying basis in the quarter, once again demonstrating the strength of our brands and our focused portfolio of leadership channels. During the quarter, we recorded an accrual for potential distribution credits due to canceled college football games. While this credit was fully offset in our programming costs, on a reported basis, our total company affiliate revenue growth was 6%. This strength in our two most significant revenue streams drove total reported company revenues to $4.09 billion, up 8% over the comparative period in fiscal 2020. Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $305 million, up $44 million over the comparative period in fiscal 2020, due to the top line increases in revenues partially offset by contractual annual escalators for our key sports franchises. Net income attributable to stockholders of $224 million or $0.37 per share was lower than the $300 million or $0.48 per share in the prior year quarter. This decrease was the result of higher gains recognized in other net in the prior year quarter, most notably from the mark-to-market adjustments associated with the company's investments. Excluding this impact and other non-core items, adjusted EPS of $0.16 per share was up $0.06 compared to last year's $0.10 per share, primarily reflecting the growth in EBITDA. Turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter, with cable networks EBITDA of $571 million, was up 3% on revenue growth of 1%. Cable advertising revenues increased 31%, with the record audiences and digital engagement of FOX News Media leading this growth. Underlying cable affiliate revenues increased mid-single digits. This growth was underpinned by rate increases, including double-digit pricing gains at FOX News Media, along with a moderation in the rate of industry subscriber erosion, which is currently trending at a little over 5%. As I mentioned earlier, during the quarter, there were a number of COVID-19 related cancellations of college football games. As a result, we have recorded an accrual for the potential credit of certain distribution fees. While this credit reduces our reported cable affiliate revenues, it is broadly offset by a corresponding reduction in rights costs. Cable other revenues decreased by 32%, primarily due to lower sports sub-licensing revenues, again as a result of the cancellation of certain college football games due to COVID-19. These lower sub-licensing revenues were also broadly offset by corresponding reduction in rights costs. EBITDA at our cable segment increased by $15 million over the prior year period. This reflects the revenue growth that I just noted, partially offset by the shift of certain sports costs from our fiscal first quarter into our second quarter that we foreshadowed on our last call. The Television segment reported revenue growth of 13%, with the EBITDA loss improving $29 million to $185 million. Continuing the consistently strong growth we've delivered since the establishment of Fox Corp, Television affiliate revenues increased 23% in the quarter. This reflects double-digit increases for both our programming fees from non-owned station affiliates and direct retransmission revenues at our owned and operated stations. The growth in Television advertising revenues was driven by the record political advertising I mentioned earlier, coupled with the addition of revenues from the fast-growing Tubi. These factors were partially offset in the segment by lower sports advertising revenues, including the impact of COVID-related cancellations of certain college football games, along with the postponement of key scripted entertainment program. EBITDA at our Television segment increased $29 million over the prior year period. This reflects the revenue growth that I just noted, as well as higher programming rights amortization of FOX Sports, primarily due to the contractual annual rights increases for our major sports franchises, including the NFL, and incremental costs due to the consolidation of Tubi. Partially offsetting these increases was a lower programming rights amortization at FOX Entertainment due to the postponement of key scripted entertainment programming as a result of COVID-19. Turning now to free cash flow, which we calculate as net cash provided by operating activities, less cash invested in property, plant and equipment. In the quarter, we generated a free cash flow loss of $155 million, which is consistent with the seasonality of working capital in our business. Reflecting our continued confidence in the business and our balanced approach to capital allocation, today we announced a semi-annual dividend of $0.23 per share and continue to be active with our stock repurchase program. So far, this fiscal year, we have deployed $450 million of capital to repurchase approximately 11.3 million Class A shares and 4.9 million Class B shares against our buyback authorization of $2 billion. We have now cumulatively repurchased just over $1 billion, representing approximately 5.4% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in November 2019. From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $4.5 billion in cash and $7.9 billion in debt. Looking through to the second half of our fiscal year is worth reminding you of a few factors that will impact comparability with the prior year. Starting with Sport. In the current March quarter, we will comp against last year's broadcast, the Super Bowl 54 on FOX. However, we did enjoy the benefit of one additional week of the regular season, as well as the rotating divisional playoff game this January. Our plans also anticipate a timely start to the NASCAR and Major League Baseball season. However, as we have demonstrated in the past, we will adapt to any potential COVID-driven disruptions across our sports calendar. Meanwhile, from an entertainment perspective, due to COVID-19, the launch of our key scripted titles on the FOX network has shifted from the first half into the second half of our fiscal year, with completion of our full season still dependent on minimal future disruptions to production schedules. In terms of cash flow, we continue to anticipate relatively low working capital usage over the course of the full fiscal year; and as a result, the normal working capital deficit exhibited in this year's first half reverses in the second half of the year. As we foreshadowed in the past, we continue to expect a higher level of capital expenditure in fiscal 2021 to support the final phase of the build out of our technical broadcast facility in Arizona and the upgrade of some of our local station facilities. With the majority of our full year advertising revenue already earned in the first half, a very light slate of affiliate renewals and a working capital tailwind that will build on our already ample liquidity, we approach the second half of this fiscal year from a position of financial strength. Assuming the continuation of a constructive macroeconomic environment, we intend to continue to both to deploy capital towards share repurchases and at targeting an additional $550 million in our fiscal second half to reach $1 billion in total buyback volume this fiscal year. To sum this all up, the results of our first two fiscal quarters demonstrate the strength of our underlying business. Its operating momentum combined with the benefits of strong free cash flow and liquidity and moderate leverage, position us particularly well for the future. And with that, I will now turn the call back to Joe. Yes. So, Doug, just in terms of the other question, in terms of margin development as we get to that $1 billion, we aren't going to put a target out there obviously. But I think the way you should think about it is, in the near-term, if you look back over the last six months, Tubi has actually been P&L neutral for us, up from a bottom line perspective. We would expect that to change over the course of the second half as we continue to invest in the growth. And then over time as we take our foot off the gas in terms of investing in growth, you'd see some pretty good conversion of revenue into bottom line margin as this business gets to scale, so. And when you look at that revenue development in the near-term, Lachlan is absolutely right in terms of where CPMs are. The way where we see a lot of headroom, where we've gotten a lot of growth from in the initial phase has just been fill rate. And so, there's still plenty of headroom to take that further north. Yes, Alexia, just in terms of the improvement in sub-decline, if I look where we were like six months ago, I think what we've seen is continued growth of the virtual MVPD is for sure. But we've also seen a bit more balance coming. We've actually seen the traditionals, their sub decline has moderated a touch. So, coming from both sides of that equation."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the conference over to Chief Investor Relations Officer and the Executive Vice President of Corporate Initiatives, Mr. Joe Dorrego. Please go ahead, sir.\nJoe Dorrego: Thank you, Greg. Hello, and welcome to our fiscal 2021 first quarter earnings call. Joining me on the call today are Lachlan Murdoch, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Nallen, Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Tomsic, our Chief Financial Officer. First, Lachlan and Steve will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter, and then we'll take questions from the investment community. Please note that this call may include forward-looking statements regarding Fox Corporation's financial performance and operating results. These statements are based on management's current expectations, and actual results could differ from what is stated as a result of certain factors identified on today's call and in the company's SEC filings. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA or EBITDA, as we refer to it on this call. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and our SEC filings, which are available in the Investor Relations section of the Web site. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Lachlan.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks, Joe. Good morning and thank you all for joining us to discuss our first quarter results. Today is a big day for Fox, and not just because we get to brag about our strong financial performance, continued operating momentum, and burgeoning digital assets, such as FOX Bet and Tubi, but because every four years we have the privilege and the responsibility of reporting on a U.S. presidential election. This very moment, as we speak, our viewers are starting their election day turning on their TV sets to where they left them last night, the FOX News channel, or opening their web browsers to FOXNews.com, or checking the FOXNews app for the latest report. Throughout the day, tens of millions of Americans around the country will turn to FOX to follow our coverage of the presidential election as well as senate, state, and local races. They do this because they trust us, and our legion of hardworking and diligent news professionals. Hours ago, our studios across the country were lit for today's coverage, and anchors, producers, camera operators, engineers, news editors, reporters, and more all got ready for a long day and night ahead, but are real preparation for today began years ago. In fact, it is over 12 months since we launched our Democracy 2020 campaign. This intentional, careful planning has served us well. The energy and excitement are palpable in the newsrooms of our local Fox television stations and at FOX News, where Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum will be live from Studio F in just a few hours. The news teams at the Fox television stations and FOX News have done a superb job throughout this election season, and viewers from across the political spectrum have been turning to us in record numbers as a result. FOX News finished September as the first cable network to lead all broadcast networks in weekday con with total viewers for the full quarter. In fact, FOX News has been the most watched network in all of television, from Memorial Day through Election Day. We achieved ratings growth in total day and primetime throughout the first quarter. FOX News total day ratings were up 28% in total viewers, and 31% among adults 25 to 54 years old. Primetime ratings increased even more substantially, up 43% in total viewers, and up 54% among adults 25 to 54 years old. This demo is sought out by advertisers, making these gains particularly impactful. Already in the second quarter, the rate of growth in both total viewers and in the 25 to 54 demo has accelerated from last quarter. Just one recent example, last Tuesday, October 27, Tucker Carlson Tonight, on the FOX News channel had more total viewers than the season premier of NBC's This Is Us, that same night, and while our linear platform is remarkably strong, our audience is also increasingly accessing our digital products to connect with us. FOX News Digital ended their first quarter with record engagement. More than 11.5 billion total video views. Total minutes watched clocked in at 14.2 billion, and unique visitors jumps to 115 million per month. FOX News not only draws large audiences nationally, it also draws a more politically diverse audience in more strategically important states than any other cable news network. According to Nielsen, FOX News dominates share of viewing in swing states and key blue states. FOX News accounts for 50% of total primetime viewership in swing states, compared to MSNBC with 28%, and CNN with 23%. This is only possible because we speak to the broadest audience of anyone in our competitive set. Our audience includes the greatest number of registered independent and likely voters of any cable news network. FOX News is relied on by 38% of registered independents. This speaks directly to the quality of our journalism and the balance of our reporting. People have noticed this year both presidential candidates and the pack supporting them have turned to FOX News to reach our large, engaged, and diverse audience. In fact, 28 different political candidates or groups advertised on FOX News during the month of October. Additionally, we have shattered the record for political advertising at our local stations, surpassing the previous high set during the 2018 midterms. The geographical mix of our stations includes both the largest DMAs, and locations that are longstanding and newly emerging swing states. This allows us to capture a significant share of local political ad spend. Since I spoke to you in August, we've gained increased visibility into local advertising pacing. Last quarter, our local stations were experiencing a year-over-year decrease in our base ad market of approximately 40%. Compare that to this first quarter, where our core stations were down approximately 20%. Including the benefit of political and station acquisitions, we are now pacing ahead of the same time last year. Looking at it slightly differently, at the beginning of COVID our stations were pacing down nearly 50% compared to the prior year. Today, they are pacing ahead. This is a tremendous return to strength in a remarkably short period of time. All of our stations also play an important role in connecting audiences in key sports markets with football, baseball, and other FOX Sports programming. We have stations in nearly all NFC markets, including our recent additions in Seattle and Milwaukee. While overall NFL viewership has seen year-to-year declines across all of its partners, Fox's America's Game of the Week is well on its way to a 12th consecutive season as TV's most watched show. America's Game of the Week is averaging over 24 million viewers, up slightly over last year. We used this, our 27th season of NFL on Fox to accelerate awareness and use of the free-to-play FOX Bet Super 6 app. By week five of the NFL, we signed up more than 1.3 million new users, meaningfully surpassing our estimates and increasing total installed users to over 2.9 million. More than 1.2 million people played in our November 1st NFL Super 6 game. By promoting the FOX Bet Super 6 app across our entire portfolio, we have greatly expanded its user base. Expect more sports and non-sports games and promotions across our platforms given the results we are seeing. One week ago Sunday, the Super 6 app was number six in the entire iOS App Store, only behind apps like Facebook and Snapchat, and Super 6 is consistently at or above the top of the sports category in iOS and/or downloads. Drafting after success of Super 6, FOX Bet, our sports betting app is also energizing users. The app which is currently available in Colorado, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania has been the third most downloaded sportsbook app for the past two consecutive weeks. That will only increase as we launch in new states. We anticipate our next launch will be in Michigan early next year. All of our Fox businesses are committed to our partnership with Flutter, and propelling this growth of the Super 6 and FOX Bet platforms. Each week, we are driving over 100 million media impressions across our portfolio of owned-and-operated Fox assets. Another important digital expansion for the company, our ad-supported streaming platform Tubi is thriving. Let me start with the astronomical growth we've seen this quarter. In August, Tubi reported 33 million monthly active users, representing a 65% year-over-year jump. More importantly, since acquisition, Tubi has average approximately 100% increase year-over-year in Total View Time, the most meaningful method when measuring the performance of any AVOD service. This is due in part to more than 41 Fox titles currently available on Tubi including The Masked Singer, Gordon Ramsay's 24 Hours to Hell and Back and LEGO Masters. When Tubi began streaming The Masked Singer, the show quickly became Tubi's number one television series overall. We use the show to increase viewers to Tubi, and we are also driving them to the platform through marketing across our networks, including the FOX Network and FOX News. Most recently, Tubi sponsored the post-game show during the Major League playoffs, and the World Series on Fox. Using these internal Fox marketing opportunities will increase consumer awareness of Tubi which will drive exploration and viewing. We are also using our television stations to promote and differentiate Tubi. As part of Tubi's News on Tubi launch on Roku and Amazon Fire in October, viewers now have access to live feeds from 18 Fox owned-and-operated stations in top markets, including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Dallas. The News on Tubi offering also includes content from third parties, including Bloomberg TV, and NBC News NOW. News on Tubi serves several important objectives. It provides viewers with the best and local news, and further leverages the access of Fox, also expanding consumers' understanding of what Tubi offers. With News on Tubi, the platform is for the first time providing live viewing opportunities, and we are now monetizing this new content, and our impressive viewership gains. We are including Tubi in all of our ad sales discussions. The power of the Fox and Tubi partnership is evident. Since September 1, Tubi has achieved 45 of the top 50 revenue days in its history. With a median age of 34, Tubi's audience is young, diverse and in demand for many brands. The leading Fox entertainment programs that feed Tubi are in important synergy that we will continue to capitalize on with new and returning shows. All FOX Entertainment's returning shows including the 9-1-1 franchise, Prodigal Son, The Resident, and Last Man Standing, are back in production with scheduled return dates in early January. As in previous years, Fox will launch robust and strong slate of shows mid season utilizing the end of the NFL season and NFC championship as a springboard. Despite pandemic related production halts in the summer that impacted its fall lineup, FOX Entertainment had a successful premier week this television season. For premier week which is the week of September 21, Fox was the number one network for entertainment program. Fox also kicked off the 2020\u20132021 fall television season with a number one new series, the number one comedy, and the number one drama, and Fox has continued that leadership position, ranking as the number one network for the week of October 19. Each of our core brands is a powerhouse distinctly positioned to differentiate itself from competitors and appeal to viewers. The power of our total portfolio though is even greater than some of its parts. Look at the share of voice recently achieved by the FOX Network and the FOX News channel on Thursday, October 29. Together these networks made up 65% of TV total viewer share compared to the rest of broadcast. The reliable content strength of FOX News in combination with NFL on Fox captured nearly two-thirds of all viewers watching broadcast television that evening. On several October evenings, our leadership brands accounted for at least half of all viewers watching broadcast television, and that occurs with sports on the network and also when we air one of our entertainment hits. The power of our brand is not only recognized by our audiences and advertisers, it is also valued by our distribution partners. In the first quarter, we saw affiliate revenues grow by 10% driven by healthy rate increases. While we did continue to see decline subscriber volume, that trend is improving. This past quarter, we saw industry subscribers decline around 6% which is an approximately 50 basis point improvement from what we experienced last quarter, and our recent agreements coupled with updates we heard during the recent earnings calls in October from AT&T, Comcast, and Charter give us an encouraging look into the December quarter. Our networks and content continue to be essential to the services offered by traditional and virtual MVPDs. We are sustaining our momentum and building on our strengths. With increased visibility to the market and resumption of sports and entertainment production, we are optimistic about and excited for the remainder of the fiscal year. And now, Steve will take us through the details of the quarter.\nSteve Tomsic: Thanks, Lachlan, and good morning. It's a busy day, so let's get straight to our results. The company delivered total revenues of $2.72 billion, up 2% over the comparative period in fiscal 2020 led by affiliate revenues that grew 10%, once again demonstrating the strength of our brand and our focused portfolio of channels. From an advertising revenue perspective, we continued to face strong growth of FOX News media and record political revenue source returned to growth at our FOX television station. The underlying and sustained strength resulted by COVID-19 related supply side factors that saw the postponement of live sports event and key scripted entertainment content at the FOX Network. Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $1.17 billion, up $310 million over the comparative period in fiscal '20 due to the top line increases in revenue and the timing of programming expenses as a result of COVID-19. This improvement in EBITDA flowed through to the bottom-line when net income attributable to stockholders of $1.11 billion or $1.83 per share was higher than the $499 million or $0.80 per share in the prior year quarter. This increase included a onetime gain recognized in other net associated with the reimbursement of the cash tax prepayment from Disney following the disposition of certain 21st Century Fox assets. Excluding the impact of the Disney reimbursement and other non-core items, adjusted EPS of $1.18 was up 42% compared to last year's $0.83 per share primarily reflecting revenue and EBITDA growth. Turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter with cable network's EBITDA $781 million was up 14% on revenue growth of 3%. Cable affiliate revenue increased 4% supported by higher average rates partially offset by net decrease pay television subscribers of 6%. Cable advertising revenues increase 18% led by another quarter of impressive linear and digital growth of FOX News media partially offset by the postponement of live sporting events namely Big Ten and Pac-12 football at our cable Sports Net. Cable other revenues decreased by $39 million due to the absence of sports sub-licensing revenues which in turn are broadly offset by commensurate reduction in rights cost. EBITDA at our cable segment increased $97 million over the prior year period. This reflects a revenue growth that I just noted as well as low sports programming rights amortization and production costs, principally due to the postponement of live events as a result of COVID-19. Partially offsetting these lower costs of FOX Sports were increased expenses of FOX News media due to the coverage of breaking news including the presidential election and continued investment in our digital news initiatives. The Television segment reported EBITDA of $457 million, an increase of $206 million while revenues were essentially in line with the prior year quarter. Television affiliate revenues increased 23% in the period reflecting double digit increases for both our programming fees from non-owned station affiliates and direct re-transmission revenues at our owned and operated stations. From a television advertising perspective, our local TV stations generated record political advertising revenues in the quarter reversing the COVID driven trend of the June quarter to be up versus prior year. This coupled with the addition of revenues from the fast growing TV was more than offset in the segment by COVID related postponements of college football and key scripted entertainment program along with comparability item, most notably two full NFL regular season broadcast windows and our broadcast of the Emmy Awards in the prior year period. EBITDA at our television segment increased $206 million over the prior year period on the back of lower operating expenses. The decrease in expenses was driven by lower programming rights amortization and production cost of FOX Sports including fewer NFL broadcast windows. Additionally there were five field college football games in the quarter. FOX Entertainment also saw lower programming rights amortization due to delayed productions of key scripted titles as a result of COVID in the current year quarter and the broadcast of the Emmy Awards in the prior year quarter. Turning now to free cash flow, which we calculate as net cash provided by operating activities plus cash investment in property, plant, and equipment, in the quarter, we generated $150 million of free cash flow which is entirely consistent with the seasonality of working capital in our business. Reflecting both our confidence in the business and our balanced approach to capital allocation, so far this fiscal year we have deployed $305 million of capital to repurchase approximately $8 million class A shares and $3 million class B shares. Against our buyback authorization of $2 billion, we have now cumulatively repurchased just over $900 million representing approximately 4.5% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in November. From balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $5.1 billion in cash and $7.9 billion in debt. Looking through the second quarter, the strong advertising momentum at news and local television station and Tubi have all carried forward into the first month of this current quarter. We anticipate that these practice coupled with a heavy schedules of sports events will translate into a return to growth in overall net advertising revenue in the fiscal second quarter, notwithstanding what remains a midseason-focused entertainment slate with the return of our key scripted shows in the new calendar year. Meanwhile, from a cost perspective, we anticipate that the timing benefits seen in our first quarter content costs from sport events and entertainment slate postponements will begin to unwind in the second quarter through the remainder of the fiscal year. In terms of cash flow, we continue to anticipate relatively low working capital usage over the course of the full fiscal year, with our normal working capital patterns, with a first-half deficit, that largely reverses in the second-half. As we have foreshadowed in the past, we continue to expect a high level of capital expenditure in fiscal '21 to support the final phases of the build-outs of our technical broadcast facility, in Arizona, and the upgraded sum of our station facilities. All of this, of course, assumes that the COVID-driven disruptions to major sports and the production delays to our key entertainment properties are behind us. As our first quarter results demonstrate, we have seen a meaningful recovery in our underlying business. This operating momentum combined with the benefits of strong free cash flow and liquidity, moderate leverage, and the absence of any debt maturity until early 2022 position us particularly well for the future. And with that, I'll now turn the call back to Joe.\nJoe Dorrego: Thank you, Steve, and now, we'd be happy to take a few questions from the investment community.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thanks so much. Lachlan, I think maybe the obvious question is, I know you like to have some walking-around money. With $5 billion of cash on the balance sheet are you seeing a lot of interesting activity in the M&A market, when you think about the increased visibility that you just talked about on this call, relative to what we had three months ago or six months. Does that change your focus in terms of your appetite for buying back stock? How are you thinking about deploying that capital over time? And if you don't mind, one quick follow-up, are you willing to give us what the total viewing time is for Tubi? I know you noted that it was up 100%. Thanks so much.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks, Doug. It's good to hear your voice. I hope you're well. First of all, on the -- thank you for also pointing out our $5.1 billion of cash and our really superb balance sheet position, we've worked hard to create the position we're in, and I think we are, looking forward, and as I sort f alluded to in my prepared comments, we are now coming through a period of uncertainty for all businesses, [either period or week] [ph] we are seeing greatly improved visibility going forward. So I think that means is though we have a good idea of what our future capital needs are, we're deeply confident in our underlying business and cash generation. So, as we look at our cash on the balance sheet we really think about balancing how to deploy that towards acquisitions, organic investments in our business, and capital returns to our shareholders. We don't have a formula in terms of how we would allocate between those categories, but we have, to date, bought back $900 million worth of our stock, which leaves us with $1.1 billion of capacity under our buyback authorization, which we fully intend to complete. To your second question, the Tubi total time spent viewing, in September alone was 220 million hours viewed. Thanks, Doug.\nJoe Dorrego: We can go to the next question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you very much. You've made -- you really hit some impressive milestones at Tubi, and I think a lot more new content. I'm curious when we may get maybe some more information or a bigger update on your long-term DTC strategy, and then just a quick follow-up, any color you can share on the NFL negotiations and how important maybe Thursday Night versus Sunday Afternoon is to you?\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks, Alexia. Let me address the second question first. Obviously we're not going to get into the detail of our NFL negotiation, but as I previously mentioned, the NFL, and on earlier earnings calls as well. The NFL along with, obviously, Major League Baseball, remains amongst our very top priorities, and really our number one programming partner. It's been a partnership that's gone back 27 years. We look forward to continuing that partnership, and you can see it in our ratings. While NFL ratings have been soft this year because of a number of factors which we believe are unique to this particular year with sports -- premium sports moving all to the fall, creating a more crowded marketplace for sports fans. And also with, frankly, the news cycle, where we've seen news viewing, you have to remember that the news audience and the sports audience, particularly the NFL audience has a tremendous overlap. Cable news viewing I think is up 46% during this NFL season. So we think some of the softness in the ratings is unique to this season, and because of that we're confident in the partnership -- in our partnership with the NFL going forward. In terms of Tubi, as you see fragmentation in the linear television market, particularly in linear entertainment. Tubi is the beneficiary of that. Tubi sits on the other side of that ledger, which is gaining audience and users from linear television markets. So think Tubi has a lot of tailwinds behind it, and we're excited to report on its milestones as they are achieved, and going forward.\nJoe Dorrego: We can go to the next question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Morris from Guggenheim. Please go ahead.\nMichael Morris: Hi, thank you. Good morning. One question on expenses, can you share what expense growth would have looked like excluding the programming disruptions that we've experienced. I think your operating expense, looks like it's down about 14% in the quarter, and Steve, you referenced sort of an unwind of that going forward. So I'm curious how much of that does unwind, and whether this disruption has impacted how you think strategically about that mix of investment in scripted programming versus sports and news? And then one other, just real quick, if I could, I'm curious of you can share any thoughts on how the outcome of today's presidential election may impact FOX News going forward? Do you think ratings can vary based on an outcome? And also, the president has in the past referenced perhaps starting a news network, and how you would think about that competitively.\nLachlan Murdoch: So, Steve, I should answer the first question, you can answer the\u2026\nSteve Tomsic: Let me, Michael, just in terms of expenses, listen, the impact of COVID is getting harder and harder to split out because you just don't know where the advertising would have -- it can affect you on the advertising, but if I just look at expenses and really just try and isolate for things that have been scheduled out of Q1 into Q2, Q3, Q4, I'd say that we benefited from about $270 million -- $280 million of expenses in Q1 that will shift into the back-half or the back three quarters of the year. You'll have a reasonable concentration of that hit Q2 because it's when you'll have a heavy concentration of both NFL and college football, and then we'll see the entertainment hit, largely, Q3 and to Q4.\nLachlan Murdoch: And then to your second question, Michael, as far as the impact on FOX News of the presidential election, of course it's been a, to date, an incredible news cycle throughout the election, but also through the other incredible news stores and massive news stories throughout the year, obviously COVID being the main one. We see as we -- and by the way, that's driven ratings, it's driven revenue. I think FOX News advertising revenue is up 36%, which is a tremendous result, but as you look at our audience, and you look at our ratings you have to look at -- and this is true for the whole news ecosystem, you have to look at it in two different ways. One is the total news audience and the appetite for news and the second is share. The first, the appetite for the news and the news cycles, the news stories that are out are sort of out of our control, and I would expect as we enter a more normal news cycle, which has to happen eventually, that appetite for news will shift back to appetite for the great American pastimes of watching football, and watching baseball, and watching The Masked Singer, or I Can See Your Voice, and we look forward to that shift. Having said that, what we can control within the news ecosystem, what we aim to control is share, and I strongly believe, and we've seen this through I think now 18 years, off the top of my head, of different administrations and different political cycles, we've maintained our number one position through all of that. So I think that answers the first part of your question or give you some insight on how we're thinking about the first part of your question. So the news cycle will moderate. We fully expect to be number one, and maintain share through that. I think the second part of your question, Michael, was around new entrants and competition into the news environment. We love competition. We have always thrived with competition, and we have strong competition now. I would say the only difference today versus some years ago, as our audience has grown and our reach has grown, we see our competition as no longer only cable news providers, but also as the traditional broadcast networks, and as you know, FOX News has been the number one network, including broadcast networks now, as I mentioned, through from Labor Day through to Election Day.\nJoe Dorrego: We can go to the next question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nMichael Nathanson: Yes, thanks. I have one for Lachlan and one for Steve. Lachlan, on sports gambling, I believe you have an option to buy 18.5% of FanDuel next year, in '21. I wonder how do you think about that, and just given how the market is valuing sports gambling how are you thinking about putting excess capital into that business? And then for Steve, we always ask you about affiliate fees when people are disappointed. This quarter, you're surprisingly upside; you've given us the update on subscriber trends. Is anything else coming on, a little bit of new pricing; perhaps some new deals came through? So any more color on the acceleration in affiliate fees would be helpful. Thanks.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thank you. Thanks very much. So our FanDuel option this is an easy answer and a quick one. We have a 10-year option to acquire 18.5% of FanDuel. We think it's a huge opportunity. We think that option today has tremendous value, and we work on literally a daily basis with Flutter to both increase the value of FanDuel and also increase the value of FOX Bet and Super 6, our 50-50 joint venture with them. So our excitement about the space in sports wagering is unabated, but with the nature of a long-term option, we would wait until an appropriate time to exercise that option, and you wouldn't expect us to do that in the near-term.\nSteve Tomsic: Hi, Michael, it's Steve. In terms of the affiliate, if I look at it sequentially the biggest driver was just the subs were a little bit better versus Q4. So, Q4 as Lachlan mentioned versus Q1 this year with 50 basis points to the better. There's a couple of small things in it, we are lapping -- last quarter where we were out there with these personal period of time. This quarter, we had no Keep Americans Connected sort of accrual in the numbers. It's more underlined than it is any particular one-offs.\nJoe Dorrego: We can go to the next question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Ehrlich from Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you. I also have a question on sports gambling and one quick follow-up. So, Lachlan, you launched FOX Bet I guess over a year ago. Has stay-at-home changed consumer behavior or your expectations for the long-term opportunity? And maybe you can frame the long-term opportunity of your various pieces, and what led to the partnership that you recently signed with the Philadelphia Eagles where you're incorporating bricks-and-mortar strategy into your approach with the FOX Bet studio and lounge that's being built at Lincoln Field, and then, just a quick follow-up on Tubi, what was the advertising contribution this quarter? Can you frame what advertising change would have been without Tubi? Thank you.\nLachlan Murdoch: Sure. So, first on Fox Bet, I think I know wagering has exploded during COVID and stay-at-home. People who -- and particularly as -- well, while sports was in a hiatus, gaming was growing strongly, and as sports came back, sports wagering grew tremendously. So, if you look at the trajectory of where that industry is going and particularly as states incrementally or consecutively open up to wagering, this business remains a larger, and larger opportunity for us. However, Jessica, as you'll remember, the structure of our partnership with Flutter is that they control the FOX Bet business today, and they fund the FOX Bet business today as Fox Corporation is not a licensed entity. Having said that, we work with them incredibly closely in terms of the promotion of FOX Bet in order to grow the value within that joint venture. The second part of your question on Tubi, we are now -- and we have now for several months selling Tubi -- and I should have actually also spoken to this with Alexia's question, we are selling Tubi in every single one of our conversations with our advertising partners. Tubi increases Fox's reach by over 20% and it's a young and diverse audience which is unduplicated, or largely unduplicated part of the Fox audience. So, every time I talk to Farhad, which is very regularly, there's a new daily revenue record that he hits, which is tremendous to see, and look, to be honest, we're only at the beginning. So, when we think of both the key metrics of time spent viewing, total users, and as importantly or maybe most importantly, revenue, Tubi consistently and continually is exceeding every expectation in our acquisition case.\nJoe Dorrego: Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Okay. That question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBen Swinburne: Thanks. Good morning. Steve, you mentioned record political, I'm wondering if you could size that in this -- at the stations, either this quarter or for the cycle, so we think about the contribution from political in the television segment over the six month period or so accurately, and then, maybe I'll just ask about Sunday Ticket in the NFL for Lachlan or whoever wants to take it, there were some press reports overnight that the AT&T is probably not going to retain that package. I'm just wondering as you guys think about the NFL landscape, is that a package that could be interesting to FOX maybe over a Tubi-like platform, or are you concerned that that may go wider than the satellite distribution model we've seen in the past impacting potentially the local broadcast ratings? I'm just curious if you have a perspective on the outcome there.\nSteve Tomsic: Hey Ben, I'll take the political advertisement. It's been a month to quarter and a month to half quarter. The good thing about this cycle is it's not just been a local story; we've been looking significant amount of national political revenue. So, for the quarter, we did a shade under 100 million across the group of which 70% of that was local, and then, when we look at it across the first-half, so July 1 through to today, we have plenty of skills under the next earnings call, we'll push close to $300 million of ad revenue, political ad revenue for the full six months, of which about just north of 200 will be local. So, it's been an enormous quarter-and-a-half for us.\nLachlan Murdoch: And then, just before I touch on Sunday Ticket, I think one of the unique elements of this political cycle Ben is the growth in national political advertising as Steve mentioned. In prior years, political advertising has been almost entirely local, and the growth in national political advertising, particularly on FOX News but also importantly in sports, has been a new and I think a -- very positive development, and it goes obviously also to the quality of our audience. That also by the way has the impact usually on -- I think usually -- Jessica asked the question about the advertising market, but -- I suppose there were more important things to discuss, but what the robustness of the political market has really done is really drive our scatter pricing up. As advertisers have scrambled to find time, scatter advertising across local stations, across sports, across news and across entertainment is up strongly. We took the strategic decision to hold back a little bit more time than we normally would in our upfront negotiations, about roughly 5% more time we held back for scatter, and that bet is paying off handsomely. As we move on to Sunday Ticket, Sunday Ticket is a tremendous consumer offering. It doesn't work I think without a subscription, under anything other than a subscription model. So, it's not really something that we would consider or have the business model to monetize, but thank you for the question, Ben.\nJoe Dorrego: At this point, we're out of time, but if you have any further questions, please give me or Dan Carey a call. Thank you all once again for joining today's call.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation, and for using AT&T teleconference. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Lachlan Murdoch",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe. Good morning and thank you all for joining us to discuss our first quarter results. Today is a big day for Fox, and not just because we get to brag about our strong financial performance, continued operating momentum, and burgeoning digital assets, such as FOX Bet and Tubi, but because every four years we have the privilege and the responsibility of reporting on a U.S. presidential election. This very moment, as we speak, our viewers are starting their election day turning on their TV sets to where they left them last night, the FOX News channel, or opening their web browsers to FOXNews.com, or checking the FOXNews app for the latest report. Throughout the day, tens of millions of Americans around the country will turn to FOX to follow our coverage of the presidential election as well as senate, state, and local races. They do this because they trust us, and our legion of hardworking and diligent news professionals. Hours ago, our studios across the country were lit for today's coverage, and anchors, producers, camera operators, engineers, news editors, reporters, and more all got ready for a long day and night ahead, but are real preparation for today began years ago. In fact, it is over 12 months since we launched our Democracy 2020 campaign. This intentional, careful planning has served us well. The energy and excitement are palpable in the newsrooms of our local Fox television stations and at FOX News, where Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum will be live from Studio F in just a few hours. The news teams at the Fox television stations and FOX News have done a superb job throughout this election season, and viewers from across the political spectrum have been turning to us in record numbers as a result. FOX News finished September as the first cable network to lead all broadcast networks in weekday con with total viewers for the full quarter. In fact, FOX News has been the most watched network in all of television, from Memorial Day through Election Day. We achieved ratings growth in total day and primetime throughout the first quarter. FOX News total day ratings were up 28% in total viewers, and 31% among adults 25 to 54 years old. Primetime ratings increased even more substantially, up 43% in total viewers, and up 54% among adults 25 to 54 years old. This demo is sought out by advertisers, making these gains particularly impactful. Already in the second quarter, the rate of growth in both total viewers and in the 25 to 54 demo has accelerated from last quarter. Just one recent example, last Tuesday, October 27, Tucker Carlson Tonight, on the FOX News channel had more total viewers than the season premier of NBC's This Is Us, that same night, and while our linear platform is remarkably strong, our audience is also increasingly accessing our digital products to connect with us. FOX News Digital ended their first quarter with record engagement. More than 11.5 billion total video views. Total minutes watched clocked in at 14.2 billion, and unique visitors jumps to 115 million per month. FOX News not only draws large audiences nationally, it also draws a more politically diverse audience in more strategically important states than any other cable news network. According to Nielsen, FOX News dominates share of viewing in swing states and key blue states. FOX News accounts for 50% of total primetime viewership in swing states, compared to MSNBC with 28%, and CNN with 23%. This is only possible because we speak to the broadest audience of anyone in our competitive set. Our audience includes the greatest number of registered independent and likely voters of any cable news network. FOX News is relied on by 38% of registered independents. This speaks directly to the quality of our journalism and the balance of our reporting. People have noticed this year both presidential candidates and the pack supporting them have turned to FOX News to reach our large, engaged, and diverse audience. In fact, 28 different political candidates or groups advertised on FOX News during the month of October. Additionally, we have shattered the record for political advertising at our local stations, surpassing the previous high set during the 2018 midterms. The geographical mix of our stations includes both the largest DMAs, and locations that are longstanding and newly emerging swing states. This allows us to capture a significant share of local political ad spend. Since I spoke to you in August, we've gained increased visibility into local advertising pacing. Last quarter, our local stations were experiencing a year-over-year decrease in our base ad market of approximately 40%. Compare that to this first quarter, where our core stations were down approximately 20%. Including the benefit of political and station acquisitions, we are now pacing ahead of the same time last year. Looking at it slightly differently, at the beginning of COVID our stations were pacing down nearly 50% compared to the prior year. Today, they are pacing ahead. This is a tremendous return to strength in a remarkably short period of time. All of our stations also play an important role in connecting audiences in key sports markets with football, baseball, and other FOX Sports programming. We have stations in nearly all NFC markets, including our recent additions in Seattle and Milwaukee. While overall NFL viewership has seen year-to-year declines across all of its partners, Fox's America's Game of the Week is well on its way to a 12th consecutive season as TV's most watched show. America's Game of the Week is averaging over 24 million viewers, up slightly over last year. We used this, our 27th season of NFL on Fox to accelerate awareness and use of the free-to-play FOX Bet Super 6 app. By week five of the NFL, we signed up more than 1.3 million new users, meaningfully surpassing our estimates and increasing total installed users to over 2.9 million. More than 1.2 million people played in our November 1st NFL Super 6 game. By promoting the FOX Bet Super 6 app across our entire portfolio, we have greatly expanded its user base. Expect more sports and non-sports games and promotions across our platforms given the results we are seeing. One week ago Sunday, the Super 6 app was number six in the entire iOS App Store, only behind apps like Facebook and Snapchat, and Super 6 is consistently at or above the top of the sports category in iOS and/or downloads. Drafting after success of Super 6, FOX Bet, our sports betting app is also energizing users. The app which is currently available in Colorado, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania has been the third most downloaded sportsbook app for the past two consecutive weeks. That will only increase as we launch in new states. We anticipate our next launch will be in Michigan early next year. All of our Fox businesses are committed to our partnership with Flutter, and propelling this growth of the Super 6 and FOX Bet platforms. Each week, we are driving over 100 million media impressions across our portfolio of owned-and-operated Fox assets. Another important digital expansion for the company, our ad-supported streaming platform Tubi is thriving. Let me start with the astronomical growth we've seen this quarter. In August, Tubi reported 33 million monthly active users, representing a 65% year-over-year jump. More importantly, since acquisition, Tubi has average approximately 100% increase year-over-year in Total View Time, the most meaningful method when measuring the performance of any AVOD service. This is due in part to more than 41 Fox titles currently available on Tubi including The Masked Singer, Gordon Ramsay's 24 Hours to Hell and Back and LEGO Masters. When Tubi began streaming The Masked Singer, the show quickly became Tubi's number one television series overall. We use the show to increase viewers to Tubi, and we are also driving them to the platform through marketing across our networks, including the FOX Network and FOX News. Most recently, Tubi sponsored the post-game show during the Major League playoffs, and the World Series on Fox. Using these internal Fox marketing opportunities will increase consumer awareness of Tubi which will drive exploration and viewing. We are also using our television stations to promote and differentiate Tubi. As part of Tubi's News on Tubi launch on Roku and Amazon Fire in October, viewers now have access to live feeds from 18 Fox owned-and-operated stations in top markets, including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Dallas. The News on Tubi offering also includes content from third parties, including Bloomberg TV, and NBC News NOW. News on Tubi serves several important objectives. It provides viewers with the best and local news, and further leverages the access of Fox, also expanding consumers' understanding of what Tubi offers. With News on Tubi, the platform is for the first time providing live viewing opportunities, and we are now monetizing this new content, and our impressive viewership gains. We are including Tubi in all of our ad sales discussions. The power of the Fox and Tubi partnership is evident. Since September 1, Tubi has achieved 45 of the top 50 revenue days in its history. With a median age of 34, Tubi's audience is young, diverse and in demand for many brands. The leading Fox entertainment programs that feed Tubi are in important synergy that we will continue to capitalize on with new and returning shows. All FOX Entertainment's returning shows including the 9-1-1 franchise, Prodigal Son, The Resident, and Last Man Standing, are back in production with scheduled return dates in early January. As in previous years, Fox will launch robust and strong slate of shows mid season utilizing the end of the NFL season and NFC championship as a springboard. Despite pandemic related production halts in the summer that impacted its fall lineup, FOX Entertainment had a successful premier week this television season. For premier week which is the week of September 21, Fox was the number one network for entertainment program. Fox also kicked off the 2020\u20132021 fall television season with a number one new series, the number one comedy, and the number one drama, and Fox has continued that leadership position, ranking as the number one network for the week of October 19. Each of our core brands is a powerhouse distinctly positioned to differentiate itself from competitors and appeal to viewers. The power of our total portfolio though is even greater than some of its parts. Look at the share of voice recently achieved by the FOX Network and the FOX News channel on Thursday, October 29. Together these networks made up 65% of TV total viewer share compared to the rest of broadcast. The reliable content strength of FOX News in combination with NFL on Fox captured nearly two-thirds of all viewers watching broadcast television that evening. On several October evenings, our leadership brands accounted for at least half of all viewers watching broadcast television, and that occurs with sports on the network and also when we air one of our entertainment hits. The power of our brand is not only recognized by our audiences and advertisers, it is also valued by our distribution partners. In the first quarter, we saw affiliate revenues grow by 10% driven by healthy rate increases. While we did continue to see decline subscriber volume, that trend is improving. This past quarter, we saw industry subscribers decline around 6% which is an approximately 50 basis point improvement from what we experienced last quarter, and our recent agreements coupled with updates we heard during the recent earnings calls in October from AT&T, Comcast, and Charter give us an encouraging look into the December quarter. Our networks and content continue to be essential to the services offered by traditional and virtual MVPDs. We are sustaining our momentum and building on our strengths. With increased visibility to the market and resumption of sports and entertainment production, we are optimistic about and excited for the remainder of the fiscal year. And now, Steve will take us through the details of the quarter. Thanks, Doug. It's good to hear your voice. I hope you're well. First of all, on the -- thank you for also pointing out our $5.1 billion of cash and our really superb balance sheet position, we've worked hard to create the position we're in, and I think we are, looking forward, and as I sort f alluded to in my prepared comments, we are now coming through a period of uncertainty for all businesses, [either period or week] [ph] we are seeing greatly improved visibility going forward. So I think that means is though we have a good idea of what our future capital needs are, we're deeply confident in our underlying business and cash generation. So, as we look at our cash on the balance sheet we really think about balancing how to deploy that towards acquisitions, organic investments in our business, and capital returns to our shareholders. We don't have a formula in terms of how we would allocate between those categories, but we have, to date, bought back $900 million worth of our stock, which leaves us with $1.1 billion of capacity under our buyback authorization, which we fully intend to complete. To your second question, the Tubi total time spent viewing, in September alone was 220 million hours viewed. Thanks, Doug. Thanks, Alexia. Let me address the second question first. Obviously we're not going to get into the detail of our NFL negotiation, but as I previously mentioned, the NFL, and on earlier earnings calls as well. The NFL along with, obviously, Major League Baseball, remains amongst our very top priorities, and really our number one programming partner. It's been a partnership that's gone back 27 years. We look forward to continuing that partnership, and you can see it in our ratings. While NFL ratings have been soft this year because of a number of factors which we believe are unique to this particular year with sports -- premium sports moving all to the fall, creating a more crowded marketplace for sports fans. And also with, frankly, the news cycle, where we've seen news viewing, you have to remember that the news audience and the sports audience, particularly the NFL audience has a tremendous overlap. Cable news viewing I think is up 46% during this NFL season. So we think some of the softness in the ratings is unique to this season, and because of that we're confident in the partnership -- in our partnership with the NFL going forward. In terms of Tubi, as you see fragmentation in the linear television market, particularly in linear entertainment. Tubi is the beneficiary of that. Tubi sits on the other side of that ledger, which is gaining audience and users from linear television markets. So think Tubi has a lot of tailwinds behind it, and we're excited to report on its milestones as they are achieved, and going forward. So, Steve, I should answer the first question, you can answer the... And then to your second question, Michael, as far as the impact on FOX News of the presidential election, of course it's been a, to date, an incredible news cycle throughout the election, but also through the other incredible news stores and massive news stories throughout the year, obviously COVID being the main one. We see as we -- and by the way, that's driven ratings, it's driven revenue. I think FOX News advertising revenue is up 36%, which is a tremendous result, but as you look at our audience, and you look at our ratings you have to look at -- and this is true for the whole news ecosystem, you have to look at it in two different ways. One is the total news audience and the appetite for news and the second is share. The first, the appetite for the news and the news cycles, the news stories that are out are sort of out of our control, and I would expect as we enter a more normal news cycle, which has to happen eventually, that appetite for news will shift back to appetite for the great American pastimes of watching football, and watching baseball, and watching The Masked Singer, or I Can See Your Voice, and we look forward to that shift. Having said that, what we can control within the news ecosystem, what we aim to control is share, and I strongly believe, and we've seen this through I think now 18 years, off the top of my head, of different administrations and different political cycles, we've maintained our number one position through all of that. So I think that answers the first part of your question or give you some insight on how we're thinking about the first part of your question. So the news cycle will moderate. We fully expect to be number one, and maintain share through that. I think the second part of your question, Michael, was around new entrants and competition into the news environment. We love competition. We have always thrived with competition, and we have strong competition now. I would say the only difference today versus some years ago, as our audience has grown and our reach has grown, we see our competition as no longer only cable news providers, but also as the traditional broadcast networks, and as you know, FOX News has been the number one network, including broadcast networks now, as I mentioned, through from Labor Day through to Election Day. Thank you. Thanks very much. So our FanDuel option this is an easy answer and a quick one. We have a 10-year option to acquire 18.5% of FanDuel. We think it's a huge opportunity. We think that option today has tremendous value, and we work on literally a daily basis with Flutter to both increase the value of FanDuel and also increase the value of FOX Bet and Super 6, our 50-50 joint venture with them. So our excitement about the space in sports wagering is unabated, but with the nature of a long-term option, we would wait until an appropriate time to exercise that option, and you wouldn't expect us to do that in the near-term. Sure. So, first on Fox Bet, I think I know wagering has exploded during COVID and stay-at-home. People who -- and particularly as -- well, while sports was in a hiatus, gaming was growing strongly, and as sports came back, sports wagering grew tremendously. So, if you look at the trajectory of where that industry is going and particularly as states incrementally or consecutively open up to wagering, this business remains a larger, and larger opportunity for us. However, Jessica, as you'll remember, the structure of our partnership with Flutter is that they control the FOX Bet business today, and they fund the FOX Bet business today as Fox Corporation is not a licensed entity. Having said that, we work with them incredibly closely in terms of the promotion of FOX Bet in order to grow the value within that joint venture. The second part of your question on Tubi, we are now -- and we have now for several months selling Tubi -- and I should have actually also spoken to this with Alexia's question, we are selling Tubi in every single one of our conversations with our advertising partners. Tubi increases Fox's reach by over 20% and it's a young and diverse audience which is unduplicated, or largely unduplicated part of the Fox audience. So, every time I talk to Farhad, which is very regularly, there's a new daily revenue record that he hits, which is tremendous to see, and look, to be honest, we're only at the beginning. So, when we think of both the key metrics of time spent viewing, total users, and as importantly or maybe most importantly, revenue, Tubi consistently and continually is exceeding every expectation in our acquisition case. And then, just before I touch on Sunday Ticket, I think one of the unique elements of this political cycle Ben is the growth in national political advertising as Steve mentioned. In prior years, political advertising has been almost entirely local, and the growth in national political advertising, particularly on FOX News but also importantly in sports, has been a new and I think a -- very positive development, and it goes obviously also to the quality of our audience. That also by the way has the impact usually on -- I think usually -- Jessica asked the question about the advertising market, but -- I suppose there were more important things to discuss, but what the robustness of the political market has really done is really drive our scatter pricing up. As advertisers have scrambled to find time, scatter advertising across local stations, across sports, across news and across entertainment is up strongly. We took the strategic decision to hold back a little bit more time than we normally would in our upfront negotiations, about roughly 5% more time we held back for scatter, and that bet is paying off handsomely. As we move on to Sunday Ticket, Sunday Ticket is a tremendous consumer offering. It doesn't work I think without a subscription, under anything other than a subscription model. So, it's not really something that we would consider or have the business model to monetize, but thank you for the question, Ben. Thanks, everyone."

            "name": "Steve Tomsic",
            "content": "Thanks, Lachlan, and good morning. It's a busy day, so let's get straight to our results. The company delivered total revenues of $2.72 billion, up 2% over the comparative period in fiscal 2020 led by affiliate revenues that grew 10%, once again demonstrating the strength of our brand and our focused portfolio of channels. From an advertising revenue perspective, we continued to face strong growth of FOX News media and record political revenue source returned to growth at our FOX television station. The underlying and sustained strength resulted by COVID-19 related supply side factors that saw the postponement of live sports event and key scripted entertainment content at the FOX Network. Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $1.17 billion, up $310 million over the comparative period in fiscal '20 due to the top line increases in revenue and the timing of programming expenses as a result of COVID-19. This improvement in EBITDA flowed through to the bottom-line when net income attributable to stockholders of $1.11 billion or $1.83 per share was higher than the $499 million or $0.80 per share in the prior year quarter. This increase included a onetime gain recognized in other net associated with the reimbursement of the cash tax prepayment from Disney following the disposition of certain 21st Century Fox assets. Excluding the impact of the Disney reimbursement and other non-core items, adjusted EPS of $1.18 was up 42% compared to last year's $0.83 per share primarily reflecting revenue and EBITDA growth. Turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter with cable network's EBITDA $781 million was up 14% on revenue growth of 3%. Cable affiliate revenue increased 4% supported by higher average rates partially offset by net decrease pay television subscribers of 6%. Cable advertising revenues increase 18% led by another quarter of impressive linear and digital growth of FOX News media partially offset by the postponement of live sporting events namely Big Ten and Pac-12 football at our cable Sports Net. Cable other revenues decreased by $39 million due to the absence of sports sub-licensing revenues which in turn are broadly offset by commensurate reduction in rights cost. EBITDA at our cable segment increased $97 million over the prior year period. This reflects a revenue growth that I just noted as well as low sports programming rights amortization and production costs, principally due to the postponement of live events as a result of COVID-19. Partially offsetting these lower costs of FOX Sports were increased expenses of FOX News media due to the coverage of breaking news including the presidential election and continued investment in our digital news initiatives. The Television segment reported EBITDA of $457 million, an increase of $206 million while revenues were essentially in line with the prior year quarter. Television affiliate revenues increased 23% in the period reflecting double digit increases for both our programming fees from non-owned station affiliates and direct re-transmission revenues at our owned and operated stations. From a television advertising perspective, our local TV stations generated record political advertising revenues in the quarter reversing the COVID driven trend of the June quarter to be up versus prior year. This coupled with the addition of revenues from the fast growing TV was more than offset in the segment by COVID related postponements of college football and key scripted entertainment program along with comparability item, most notably two full NFL regular season broadcast windows and our broadcast of the Emmy Awards in the prior year period. EBITDA at our television segment increased $206 million over the prior year period on the back of lower operating expenses. The decrease in expenses was driven by lower programming rights amortization and production cost of FOX Sports including fewer NFL broadcast windows. Additionally there were five field college football games in the quarter. FOX Entertainment also saw lower programming rights amortization due to delayed productions of key scripted titles as a result of COVID in the current year quarter and the broadcast of the Emmy Awards in the prior year quarter. Turning now to free cash flow, which we calculate as net cash provided by operating activities plus cash investment in property, plant, and equipment, in the quarter, we generated $150 million of free cash flow which is entirely consistent with the seasonality of working capital in our business. Reflecting both our confidence in the business and our balanced approach to capital allocation, so far this fiscal year we have deployed $305 million of capital to repurchase approximately $8 million class A shares and $3 million class B shares. Against our buyback authorization of $2 billion, we have now cumulatively repurchased just over $900 million representing approximately 4.5% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in November. From balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $5.1 billion in cash and $7.9 billion in debt. Looking through the second quarter, the strong advertising momentum at news and local television station and Tubi have all carried forward into the first month of this current quarter. We anticipate that these practice coupled with a heavy schedules of sports events will translate into a return to growth in overall net advertising revenue in the fiscal second quarter, notwithstanding what remains a midseason-focused entertainment slate with the return of our key scripted shows in the new calendar year. Meanwhile, from a cost perspective, we anticipate that the timing benefits seen in our first quarter content costs from sport events and entertainment slate postponements will begin to unwind in the second quarter through the remainder of the fiscal year. In terms of cash flow, we continue to anticipate relatively low working capital usage over the course of the full fiscal year, with our normal working capital patterns, with a first-half deficit, that largely reverses in the second-half. As we have foreshadowed in the past, we continue to expect a high level of capital expenditure in fiscal '21 to support the final phases of the build-outs of our technical broadcast facility, in Arizona, and the upgraded sum of our station facilities. All of this, of course, assumes that the COVID-driven disruptions to major sports and the production delays to our key entertainment properties are behind us. As our first quarter results demonstrate, we have seen a meaningful recovery in our underlying business. This operating momentum combined with the benefits of strong free cash flow and liquidity, moderate leverage, and the absence of any debt maturity until early 2022 position us particularly well for the future. And with that, I'll now turn the call back to Joe. Let me, Michael, just in terms of expenses, listen, the impact of COVID is getting harder and harder to split out because you just don't know where the advertising would have -- it can affect you on the advertising, but if I just look at expenses and really just try and isolate for things that have been scheduled out of Q1 into Q2, Q3, Q4, I'd say that we benefited from about $270 million -- $280 million of expenses in Q1 that will shift into the back-half or the back three quarters of the year. You'll have a reasonable concentration of that hit Q2 because it's when you'll have a heavy concentration of both NFL and college football, and then we'll see the entertainment hit, largely, Q3 and to Q4. Hi, Michael, it's Steve. In terms of the affiliate, if I look at it sequentially the biggest driver was just the subs were a little bit better versus Q4. So, Q4 as Lachlan mentioned versus Q1 this year with 50 basis points to the better. There's a couple of small things in it, we are lapping -- last quarter where we were out there with these personal period of time. This quarter, we had no Keep Americans Connected sort of accrual in the numbers. It's more underlined than it is any particular one-offs. Hey Ben, I'll take the political advertisement. It's been a month to quarter and a month to half quarter. The good thing about this cycle is it's not just been a local story; we've been looking significant amount of national political revenue. So, for the quarter, we did a shade under 100 million across the group of which 70% of that was local, and then, when we look at it across the first-half, so July 1 through to today, we have plenty of skills under the next earnings call, we'll push close to $300 million of ad revenue, political ad revenue for the full six months, of which about just north of 200 will be local. So, it's been an enormous quarter-and-a-half for us."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Fox Corporation Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct the question-and-answer session. I would like to emphasize that functionality for the question-and-answer queue will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the conference over to Chief Investor Relations Officer, Ms. Gabrielle Brown. Please, go ahead, Ms. Brown.\nGabrielle Brown: Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome to our fiscal 2022 fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me on the call today are Lachlan Murdoch, Executive Chair and Chief Executive Officer; John Nallen, Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Tomsic, our Chief Financial Officer. First, Lachlan and Steve will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter and then we'll take questions from the investment community. Please note that this call may include forward-looking statements regarding Fox Corporation's financial performance and operating results. These statements are based on management's current expectations and actual results could differ from what is stated as a result of certain factors identified on today's call and in the company's SEC filings. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA, or EBITDA, as we refer to it on this call. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and our SEC filings, which are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Lachlan. \nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks very much, Gabby, and welcome aboard. Well, we have concluded another successful fiscal year, achieving both the financial and operational goals we set ourselves with a relentless focus on strengthening our core brands, while investing in our high-growth digital initiatives. Over the year, we delivered 8% total company revenue growth, including 7% affiliate revenue growth, notably, without the benefit of any meaningful renewals and 9% advertising revenue growth, despite the record political revenues we saw in the prior fiscal. Those of you on this call, who were at our 2019 Investor Day, will remember our commitment to you that we would have achieved $1 billion of incremental Television segment affiliate revenue by the end of calendar 2022. I'm more than pleased to confirm that we have achieved that $1 billion target in this past quarter a full six months ahead of schedule. As anticipated, our EBITDA was down modestly, as we continued our investment in Tubi and the FOX News Media digital properties, including FOX Nation and FOX Weather and with the launch of the USFL this past spring. Most importantly, Fox continues to stand apart in a crowded media ecosystem, delivering a consistent operating performance and a robust free cash flow profile alongside an enviable balance sheet. Our leadership position was again evident during the recent upfront advertising sales cycle, in which we booked volume commitments approximately 15% above last year's upfront, with nearly 25% of our current year commitments across our growing digital properties. We achieved pricing increases in the high single to low double digits, as compared to last year's upfront. Sports led the upfront market, illustrated by the fact that we sold more NFL Sunday advertising in the current upfront market than we did across Sunday and Thursday combined in the prior year's market. This excludes advertising commitments for the upcoming Super Bowl, where we are pacing well ahead of schedule and seeing very robust demand at record pricing levels. Our success in the upfront spanned our entire portfolio. We were able to achieved broadcast level pricing increases at FOX News, boosted sellout at FOX Entertainment and importantly, drove significantly more incremental ad dollars into Tubi. We are, of course, aware of the chatter around advertising headwinds. And of course, we will be prepared if the market turns downward. But let me be clear, we are currently not seeing an adverse advertising impact on our business. This speaks to the unique positioning and strength of our core platforms. Over two-thirds of our fiscal 2022 advertising revenue was generated by live content with sports and news, delivering 40% and 30% respectively. Locally, base market advertising sales have been stable. In fact, we are currently seeing a return to growth in the auto category for the first time in a couple of years. This stability in the base market provides a good foundation for the upcoming political cycle where the outlook is remarkably strong. On a comparable basis, our June quarter political advertising revenues were roughly three times larger than those of the fiscal fourth quarter of the last presidential election, which turned out to be an all-time record political cycle for the company. With the combination of political races and ballot issues across our markets, we continue to expect this election to deliver another record midterm cycle. In fact, excluding the impact of the Georgia runoffs in the last cycle, this midterm cycle looks certain to surpass the 2020 presidential cycle at our local stations. There are US center races in 13 of our 18 markets, including what we expect to be heavy political spending in Arizona, Florida and Georgia. Additionally, there are gubernatorial races in 17 of our 18 markets, where we expect heavy spending in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Texas and Wisconsin. Add to that the issue money in a few key markets and we are seeing an unprecedented wave of political spending which accelerates as we head towards November. At the national level, we believe that we achieved the highest upfront pricing increases in cable news history at FOX News, which to a certain extent is to be expected, as the FOX News channel again closed the year, as cable's most watched network in prime time in total day and continues to generate audiences on par with those of the Big 4 broadcast networks. FOX News was the only cable news network to post viewership gains in the fiscal year in the key adult 25 to 54 demo and total viewers, while extending its streak to 16 consecutive months beating CNN and MSNBC combined in prime and total day for both the key demo and total viewers. For over two decades, FOX News has been the highest-rated cable news channel in prime time. Notably, FOX News just finished the month of July as the third most viewed network in weekday prime in all of television, trailing only CBS and NBC. I've spoken about the political diversity of the FOX News audience previously, specifically about the fact that we have more independents and Democrats watching us than watch CNN or MSNBC, but the diversity of our audience extends beyond political affiliation. In July, the Fox News Channel was the most viewed cable network with Asian and Hispanic viewers. In fact, in that month viewing among Hispanic households was up 38% and among Asian households, up 43%. Elsewhere news, the FOX Nation platform increased its subscriber base by approximately 80% over the past fiscal year, supported by sustained and high conversion rates of trialists to paid subscribers and retention rates well above industry averages. At FOX Sports, live event viewing was up 5% through the first half of the calendar year led by our NASCAR schedule, which generated viewership up a solid 10% over 2021. This spring was busy for FOX Sports, as we launched the inagural season of the USFL. The USFL averaged over one million viewers on FOX, at least 20% higher than the EPL on NBC and regular season NHL broadcast on ABC and more than twice the viewership of MLS on FOX. In its first season, the USFL clearly delivered on its most essential goal, which was to demonstrate that the league belongs alongside other long-established spring sports properties. And as you know, we have an incredibly strong year ahead in sports which includes the FIFA Men's World Cup beginning this November and the Super Bowl next February. At FOX Entertainment, our content strategy is focused on ad-supported multi-platform television that can thrive both creatively and financially well into the future. We look to use our broadcast network to build and support businesses beyond our linear air. An example of this approach is Next Level Chef which was the number one new broadcast entertainment program this past season and FOX' first owned production inside our partnership with Gordon Ramsay, whereas we used only to license Gordon's product from third parties, we now license hits like Next Level Chef to third parties and we have done so with the sale of the format to ITV in the UK. Another example of how we extend and monetize our IP is the just launch of Gordon Ramsay FAST Channel on Tubi. And speaking of Tubi one year ago -- one year into our focused investment cycle at Tubi, the platform generated TVT growth of nearly 40% and revenue growth of 45% across the fiscal year with both metrics coming in better than planned and reinforcing our decision to invest in this strategic asset.  During the June quarter 34% growth in TVT helped drive revenue growth in the low double digits, despite a more difficult prior year comparison when we began our ramped content and monetization strategy. In the quarter, we launched 25 linear channels, grew our VOD library to over 45,000 titles and premiered 13 efficient Tubi Originals. We will continue to invest judiciously in Tubi with our sights set on achieving $1 billion in revenue run rate in the next couple of years. As you know, our affiliate renewal cycle begins in earnest this new fiscal year and we are again looking forward to industry-leading gains from the superior value of our channels and services. With some early meaningful station and affiliate deals already completed including the recently closed Verizon deal, we go into this renewal cycle with confidence the market appreciates the value of our brands. In aggregate, these financial and operating achievements again highlight the fact that the FOX story is one of strength, one of focus and one of stability. We will see how the macroeconomic environment evolves during the months ahead. But as we have demonstrated over the course of the last few years, FOX is well positioned to outperform. We remain encouraged by the FOX specific trends that I've highlighted and that we're observing in real-time, underpinned by the best balance sheet in the business the same solid balance sheet that helped us thrive, despite the challenges of COVID and that will continue to support our investments for long-term growth and shareholder returns.  And with that I will turn you over to Steve. \nSteve Tomsic: Thanks Lachlan and good morning, everyone. We ended our third full fiscal year with total company revenue growth of 8% and topline growth across all of our operating segments in every quarter of fiscal '22. Even in a year that for us was light on major sports events and was an off-cycle political year, total company advertising revenues led this growth with a 9% increase over fiscal 2021.  Cable segment advertising revenues were up 9% and primarily benefited from higher pricing across our news and sports networks. Television segment advertising revenues were up 8% on the back of increased engagement of Tubi, as well as higher pricing and the normalization of live event programming at the FOX Network, following COVID-related disruptions last year. These gains were partially offset by the absence of the prior year's record political revenues and lower ratings of FOX Entertainment. Total company affiliate revenues increased 7% led by 10% growth at the Television segment and 5% at the Cable segment. Total company other revenues increased 15%, driven by higher sports sublicensing revenues as compared to prior year pandemic-related disruptions, growth in FOX Nation subscription revenues and the consolidation of TMZ MarVista and Studio Ramsay Global.  This growth in other revenues was partially offset by the impact of the divestiture of the company's sports marketing businesses last fiscal year. We also delivered sustained momentum in our consolidated digital revenues with a nearly 30% increase year-over-year. This digital growth was supported by the organic investments across our digital portfolio that we articulated at the outset of the fiscal year.  These investments the establishment of USFL and higher programming rights amortization associated with the normalized sports and entertainment schedules contributed to a modest decrease in our full year adjusted EBITDA which came in at $2.96 billion.  Full year net income attributable to stockholders was $1.21 billion or $2.11 per share, while adjusted EPS was $2.79, down modestly against the $2.88 billion \u2013 sorry, the $2.88 reported last year primarily due to the impacts on EBITDA I just mentioned. Turning to the quarter, we delivered total company revenues of $3.03 billion, up 5% over the same period in 2021. This growth was led by a 7% increase in total company advertising revenues, highlighted by the strength of FOX News, record June quarter political revenues at FOX Television stations, and continued growth of TUBI. Total company affiliate revenues grew 4%, with 7% growth at the Television segment, and 2% growth at the Cable segment. Once again this distribution revenue growth was driven by rate increases, as the rate of subscriber declines increased modestly in the quarter, with trailing 12-month industry sub losses running in the high 5% range. Total company other revenues increased 4% as the consolidation of our entertainment production companies and continued momentum at FOX Nation, were partially offset by the timing of sports sublicensing revenues, which were impacted by COVID in the prior year. Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $770 million, up 7% over the comparative period in fiscal 2021, as our revenue growth was partially offset by higher expenses, including the impact of the anticipated digital investments of FOX News Media and TUBI, and the first year deficit associated with the launch of the USFL. Net income attributable to stockholders of $306 million, or $0.55 per share, was higher than the $253 million or $0.43 per share in the prior year quarter. This variance reflects the EBITDA movement I just described, along with the mark-to-market adjustments associated with the company's investments recognized in other than that. Excluding non-core items, adjusted EPS in the June quarter of $0.74, was up 14% over last year's $0.65. It is worth noting, our effective income tax rate was higher for both the quarter, and the full year, primarily due to a $30 million re-measurement of our net deferred tax assets, associated with changes in the mix of our jurisdictional earnings. This had no impact on our cash taxes. Now, let's turn to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter, starting with Cable Networks, which reported a 4% increase in revenues. This was led by a 14% increase in cable advertising revenues, driven by strong gains in both pricing and audience at FOX News, notwithstanding slightly higher levels of preemptions associated with our breaking news coverage. Also, contributing to the overall segment revenue growth was a 2% increase in affiliate revenues, once again due to the healthy pricing gains across all of our networks. Cable other revenues were unchanged compared to the prior year, as the continued subscription momentum at FOX Nation, and the addition of the USFL were offset by the impact of the timing of sports sublicensing revenues as a result of COVID in the prior year. EBITDA at our Cable segment was down 7% against the prior year as these revenue increases were more than offset by increased expenses, including the planned digital investment and higher programming costs, including those associated with breaking news coverage at Fox News Media, as well as the launch of the USFL. Our television segment reported a 5% increase in quarterly revenues. This was led by a 7% increase in television affiliate revenues, reflecting increases for both direct retransmission revenues at our owned and operated stations, and our programming fees from non-owned station affiliates. Our Television segment delivered 4% growth in advertising revenues, driven by higher political advertising at the FOX Television stations, continued growth at TUBI, and the introduction of the USFL, partially offset by lower ratings of FOX Entertainment. Other revenues at television increased 3% in the quarter, primarily due to the impact of the acquisitions of TMZ and MarVista Entertainment, and the consolidation of our stake in Studio Ramsay Global, partially offset by the timing of deliveries at Bento Box. EBITDA at our Television segment increased over 50% as expenses were flat against the prior year quarter. Here, we saw an accelerated digital investment at TUBI, and the consolidation of the entertainment production assets offset by the timing of programming costs at FOX Entertainment. During the full year, we generated free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx of $1.6 billion. Over the course of fiscal 2022, we returned $1 billion of capital through the repurchase of 18.7 million Class A shares and 8.7 million Class B shares. This was supplemented by over $270 million in dividend payments and underlining our continued commitment to shareholder returns, today we announced an increase in our semi-annual dividend to $0.25 per share. With the payment of this dividend, we will have cumulatively returned over $3.75 billion of capital to our shareholders since the formation of FOX. This includes share repurchases totaling over $2.65 billion against our buyback authorization of $4 billion. From our balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $5.2 billion in cash and approximately $7.2 billion in debt. Our fiscal 2022 financial performance along with the progress we have made on our strategic priorities provide a strong foundation for us to springboard into fiscal 2023 where the setup is incredibly favorable. We remain confident that collectively the financial tailwinds from Super Bowl 57, the early exit of Thursday Night Football, the momentum heading into November's midterm elections, and the start of our next major distribution cycle will deliver record revenues and EBITDA in fiscal 2023. As we've highlighted previously, our plans for fiscal 2023 incorporate maintaining our current level of investment in our digital growth initiatives. From an affiliate revenue perspective as you would expect, we make no predictions on industry subscriber volumes. However, from a rate perspective given the timing and nature of our affiliate renewals, you should expect to see the financial benefit of these renewals skewed to the second half of the fiscal year and concentrated toward our Television segment. Our focused strategy and operational execution continue to distinguish us. Together, they have delivered sustained financial outperformance since the establishment of FOX and will be showcased with a banner year of events in fiscal 2023. This momentum supported by the most robust balance sheet in the industry position us well to navigate the broader macroeconomic turbulence while creating value for our shareholders. And with that, Gabby, let's now open it up for Q&A. \nGabrielle Brown: Thank you, Steve. And now we will be happy to take questions from the investment community.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We have a question from John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.\nJohn Hodulik: Okay, great. Thanks guys. Two quick ones if I could. First of all on the Verizon renewal, anything you could tell us about pricing you got with that deal and how that positions you for the sort of upcoming renewal cycle? And then looking out into 2023 given the cash balance and sort of all these sort of EBITDA drivers, how should we think about capital return and the buyback? And do we have to wait for a resolution to the FanDuel situation, or how should we think about just sort of giving all the cash on the books and which you'll generate this year? Thanks.\nLachlan Murdoch: Hey John, good morning. I'll start. I'll answer the Verizon renewal question and I'll let Steve answer the fun question about our cash on the books. So -- and he's got the keys. So, that's the important answer. The -- like on the Verizon renewal, I'm obviously not going to give you a specific exact pricing, but it's absolutely in line with what our forecast and sort of long-term plan suggested. We're very happy with our partnership with Verizon. And I think it's fair to say that we achieved industry-leading pricing increases for really are the best brands in the business between our local stations and retransmission renewals and the really incredible strength of FOX News and the loyalty and engagement of the FOX News audience, we're able to drive this industry leading pricing increases. Just one added element to that, which I think is important for us, is we're also able to achieved distribution for FOX Weather, which will continue to include in our future upcoming renewals. And also, we expanded our relationship with Verizon to include distribution of TUBI. So overall, we are very pleased with that renewal and we think it sets us up well for the next two years, but we have two-thirds of our distribution coming up. So we're very pleased and we appreciate the partnership with Verizon. Steve?\nSteven Tomsic: Yes, hi John. So, yes you're right. Listen, we've got a really strong balance sheet. We ended the year with a little over $5 billion in cash and we -- as the opening remarks indicate, we're really bullish about going into fiscal '23 from a revenue, EBITDA and cash flow perspective. But this now story remains consistent. We're going to continue to -- our biggest use of cash since the inception of FOX from a capital perspective is to be -- is to actually return it to shareholders and in my opening remarks, I talked about the volume that we have returned to shareholders and we continue to remain committed to that. We have $4 billion authorization. We have $1.35 billion of headroom left in that. But we're going to remain open to investing both organically and inorganically in the business. We're going to be balanced about that as we see opportunities on the horizon. So, a remarkably consistent story on our capital allocation.\nGabrielle Brown: Operator, we can go to the next question.\nOperator: And that is from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nPhil Cusick: Thank you, very much. Good morning. One quick follow-up on your comments on the ad market. Any sort of thing you're seeing overall in the macro environment, whether it's your own deals or not that we should be aware of? And then second, I wonder if you can talk about -- you mentioned, I think it was high 5s of industry declines. I'm curious, if FOX affiliate customer accounts reflect that acceleration in the video industry decline or if maybe you're seeing a little bit less, given your different customer base? Thank you.\nLachlan Murdoch: So, on the advertising market -- and good morning, Phil, I'll give you a little bit of color. I might jump around a little bit. But as I mentioned, for us, one of the most sort of pleasing things that we're seeing is actually in the local stations our base markets. So ex-political, the base market is very stable. And as I mentioned in my remarks, particularly the return to growth for the auto category is -- it's obviously something that's concerned us over the last couple of years with COVID and the softness in the auto category, the return of growth in the auto category is a really strong indicator of things to come. We are seeing locally two verticals or two categories that are soft. One is the local wagering sort of betting category soft. But that's really what we're seeing there. I think it's pretty interesting and perhaps predictable a shift of that business going to national. So where we're seeing softness in local for wagering, we're seeing strength in national for the betting market. I think that's the purpose or the reason for that is obviously as more states become legalized in the national platform is particularly national sports is an efficient and a good buy for the betting businesses. And then we're seeing some softness in government spending that was really COVID health spending over the last couple of years, which obviously is not there anymore. But that's being more than made up across our other strength in our other categories. So, two areas of weakness locally in betting and government, but it's more than made up by strength in other categories. In terms of the scatter market, we're actually seeing a -- scatter for us before we get into the fall sports cycle is a quiet. The summer is a quiet period for us or it has been. So we actually don't have a lot of scatter avails, but scatter pricing is up in the low double digits which is good to see that strength. And then from a macro environment point of view, again, we're seeing no impact in our advertising across our businesses with the exception of softness in, which I think has been well reported in other areas, some softness in programmatic advertising. For us, that's sort of 10% of our advertising business. So it's not having a significant or meaningful impact on us at all and that 10% is really due to programmatic advertising into TUBI and into our FOX News Media digital platforms. Steve, do you want to answer the second part of the question? \nSteve Tomsic: Yes. So Phil, just on the rate of subscriber erosion I think with our channels \u2013 our must-carry channels. So I think we're best positioned to buffer any sort of weakness in the subscriber universe. I think where people find it challenging to reconcile between sort of how we report numbers and how \u2013 where you see numbers from the Street, there's a couple of things. One is we're in a two-month delay versus what's being reported by the distributors. And the other piece is there's a fair amount of opacity around some of the platforms that don't report. So you got the \u2013 many of the virtual MVPDs don't break out their numbers and DIRECTV no longer breaks out its numbers. And so that's probably where you're seeing the sort of friction between the reported numbers.\nGabrielle Brown: Operator, we go to the next question, please.\nOperator: That's the line of Robert Fishman with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nRobert Fishman: Good morning, everyone. There's lots of chatter right now around the Big Ten renewal in the marketplace. Just wondering if there's anything you can share specifically on those rights or maybe bigger picture of how FOX is positioned to renew key sports rights with your current portfolio of assets compared to either some of the pure digital companies or other media companies with SVOD services? And then how do you think about the ROI of the sports rights investments going forward? \nLachlan Murdoch: Hey, good morning, Robert. So, overall I mean I'll talk overall then I can come down to drill down to Big Ten. We're always going to look at sports rights as they become available. I think we've been very disciplined in terms of how we analyze and how we think about acquiring any additional incremental sports rights. We look at it both obviously from what any individual sport can achieve both in terms of an audience and advertising revenue we can attach to that. We specifically also drill down into what we can see from our subscriber what we can attribute to our affiliation agreement with a distributor in terms of subscription revenue. So we do take a pretty scientific and I think a very disciplined approach to how we view sports rights, but we do look at all the sports across the marketplace and see what would fit within FOX Sports. I think the \u2013 if you look past \u2013 over the past years the store hasn't been written is the sports rights that we pass on right that we decide are too expensive or won't add any incremental revenue to our business. So \u2013 and that continues to be the way we look at it. As regards to Big Ten, Big Ten Network is a key strategic partner of ours. We've had a great relationship with them. And we look forward to renewing those rights potentially with some new broadcast partners within the mix. That will be an announcement the Big Ten will make we expect in the near-term, but it's one that we will leave for them to make. But we're looking forward to our continued long-term and profitable relationship with them.\nGabrielle Brown: Operator, we go to the next question, please.\nOperator: That is the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBen Swinburne: Hey. Good morning guys. Two questions, one, I think there's been a lot of enthusiasm over the past couple of years about Fox's opportunity in sports betting. I think it's gotten a little quieter on that front at least in terms of the market discussion. Could you guys update us on, what you see ahead of the company there both directly with FOX Bet? And is there any timing on something with Flutter, and also just sort of the benefits to the broader business? And then I just wanted to clarify, Steve you said you expect to maintain the current investment level in fiscal 2023 versus 2022. Is that a comment on just the amount of capital you're deploying, or is that sort of an EBITDA net impact on EBITDA, just to make sure we understood the comment there? Thanks.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks Ben. So look, we continue to have beliefs or have a fundamentally strong belief in the sports betting business. We think it's a huge opportunity in the marketplace, specifically in its association with the FOX Sports brand. We drive the largest sports audiences in this country. And no other broadcaster can achieve kind of the reach and engagement that we deliver, during the -- certainly during the autumn and the fall on a weekly basis. And so, we've proven this last couple of years with FOX Bet's, Super 6 which really taking our sports audiences. And I know we've talked about it, before then by taking our sports audiences from television into FOX Bet Super 6 provide a tremendous funnel, which FOX Bet is the ultimate beneficiary of. That continues to be our strategy and it continues to be very successful. As regards to, Flutter we're still in our arbitration process with them. We look forward to the clarity of getting through that process, which we expect to be in the next couple of months certainly sort of by the beginning of the autumn. But once that situation is clarified and also in early September as you see the NFL season kick off again, you'll see a lot more activity around FOX Bet and FOX Bet Super 6.\nSteve Tomsic: Hey Ben just picking up on your question around organic investment. So the way we define -- we had -- we called out $200 million to $300 million of net EBITDA of our investment for fiscal 2022. So put another way our fiscal 2022 EBITDA would have be $200 million to $300 million higher than what it was had we not made those investments. We don't -- we anticipate maintaining that level of investment meaning that when you compare 2023 to 2022 you will not have that drag on the results. So that explains that for you.\nGabrielle Brown: Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Very good. That's the line of Doug Mitchelson with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thanks so much. If I could get a clarification on the Big Ten, you have digital rights for Big Ten games and you'll maintain those in any new deal that you're looking at? Another clarification, I'm wondering if you have upfront volumes ex-Super Bowl and ex-FIFA. I'm just trying to get an ex-unusual, how strong are your upfront volumes? And then, lastly Steve, any swing factors in that free cash flow outlook for fiscal 2023 that we should be thinking about working capital or CapEx or anything like that? And good morning everybody. Thank you.\nLachlan Murdoch: Hi, good morning, Doug. And hope you\u2019re well. So on -- we have a Big Ten digital rights and we will keep those in the new deal. So I hope that clarifies, that again I don't want to say too much because it's really -- it's for the Big Ten to announce their new agreements. In terms of upfront volumes ex, I think your question was what are they ex-Super Bowl. Obviously, we look at everything ex-Super Bowl, because it's obviously such a huge year for us. We're looking forward to we're getting record pricing for Super Bowl, and we're well ahead of plan in terms of selling our Super Bowl position. But ex-Super Bowl upfront volumes were about 15% higher than the last upfront. I think one of the -- and that's across entertainment sports and news. I think the important thing to note there, though is that the upfront volumes to some degree, are a metric that we control. We chose a very purposefully and I think in a very disciplined and hopefully, a judicious way to sell more volume into this upfront, because we felt it was a period where having certainty around or the highest level of certainty we can around, our sales and our inventory was important. So for instance, in years where we would -- in the past years where we would sell in the mid-70s percent of our kind of available ad impressions. We announced we sold in this upfront, in the low to mid-80s. And I think that was sort of a smart decision and one that we felt was appropriate, given any uncertainty around the economy of the advertising market going forward. \nSteve Tomsic: Doug, it's Steve. Just on the free cash flow. I think from a working capital perspective a big swing factors, I think from an accounting version of working capital, remember, that going into we're into a Super Bowl year. So therefore, we amort a ton of the NFL costs in a Super Bowl year, so it has an impact on our working capital. Our CapEx was down to a touch over $300 million this year, which was down from a touch north of $480 million. The year before, you should expect the $300 million to go up a touch. But the rest of it is, I think really pretty much stock in trade in terms of, cash flow swings. There's nothing particularly unique about next year apart from, the tailwinds that we have going into it from an operating perspective. \nGabrielle Brown: Great. At this point, we are out of time. But if you have any further questions, please give me or Dan Carey, a call. Thank you once again for joining today's call. \nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks everyone. \nSteve Tomsic: Thank you. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Yes, hi John. So, yes you're right. Listen, we've got a really strong balance sheet. We ended the year with a little over $5 billion in cash and we -- as the opening remarks indicate, we're really bullish about going into fiscal '23 from a revenue, EBITDA and cash flow perspective. But this now story remains consistent. We're going to continue to -- our biggest use of cash since the inception of FOX from a capital perspective is to be -- is to actually return it to shareholders and in my opening remarks, I talked about the volume that we have returned to shareholders and we continue to remain committed to that. We have $4 billion authorization. We have $1.35 billion of headroom left in that. But we're going to remain open to investing both organically and inorganically in the business. We're going to be balanced about that as we see opportunities on the horizon. So, a remarkably consistent story on our capital allocation."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Lachlan Murdoch",
            "content": "Thanks very much, Gabby, and welcome aboard. Well, we have concluded another successful fiscal year, achieving both the financial and operational goals we set ourselves with a relentless focus on strengthening our core brands, while investing in our high-growth digital initiatives. Over the year, we delivered 8% total company revenue growth, including 7% affiliate revenue growth, notably, without the benefit of any meaningful renewals and 9% advertising revenue growth, despite the record political revenues we saw in the prior fiscal. Those of you on this call, who were at our 2019 Investor Day, will remember our commitment to you that we would have achieved $1 billion of incremental Television segment affiliate revenue by the end of calendar 2022. I'm more than pleased to confirm that we have achieved that $1 billion target in this past quarter a full six months ahead of schedule. As anticipated, our EBITDA was down modestly, as we continued our investment in Tubi and the FOX News Media digital properties, including FOX Nation and FOX Weather and with the launch of the USFL this past spring. Most importantly, Fox continues to stand apart in a crowded media ecosystem, delivering a consistent operating performance and a robust free cash flow profile alongside an enviable balance sheet. Our leadership position was again evident during the recent upfront advertising sales cycle, in which we booked volume commitments approximately 15% above last year's upfront, with nearly 25% of our current year commitments across our growing digital properties. We achieved pricing increases in the high single to low double digits, as compared to last year's upfront. Sports led the upfront market, illustrated by the fact that we sold more NFL Sunday advertising in the current upfront market than we did across Sunday and Thursday combined in the prior year's market. This excludes advertising commitments for the upcoming Super Bowl, where we are pacing well ahead of schedule and seeing very robust demand at record pricing levels. Our success in the upfront spanned our entire portfolio. We were able to achieved broadcast level pricing increases at FOX News, boosted sellout at FOX Entertainment and importantly, drove significantly more incremental ad dollars into Tubi. We are, of course, aware of the chatter around advertising headwinds. And of course, we will be prepared if the market turns downward. But let me be clear, we are currently not seeing an adverse advertising impact on our business. This speaks to the unique positioning and strength of our core platforms. Over two-thirds of our fiscal 2022 advertising revenue was generated by live content with sports and news, delivering 40% and 30% respectively. Locally, base market advertising sales have been stable. In fact, we are currently seeing a return to growth in the auto category for the first time in a couple of years. This stability in the base market provides a good foundation for the upcoming political cycle where the outlook is remarkably strong. On a comparable basis, our June quarter political advertising revenues were roughly three times larger than those of the fiscal fourth quarter of the last presidential election, which turned out to be an all-time record political cycle for the company. With the combination of political races and ballot issues across our markets, we continue to expect this election to deliver another record midterm cycle. In fact, excluding the impact of the Georgia runoffs in the last cycle, this midterm cycle looks certain to surpass the 2020 presidential cycle at our local stations. There are US center races in 13 of our 18 markets, including what we expect to be heavy political spending in Arizona, Florida and Georgia. Additionally, there are gubernatorial races in 17 of our 18 markets, where we expect heavy spending in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Texas and Wisconsin. Add to that the issue money in a few key markets and we are seeing an unprecedented wave of political spending which accelerates as we head towards November. At the national level, we believe that we achieved the highest upfront pricing increases in cable news history at FOX News, which to a certain extent is to be expected, as the FOX News channel again closed the year, as cable's most watched network in prime time in total day and continues to generate audiences on par with those of the Big 4 broadcast networks. FOX News was the only cable news network to post viewership gains in the fiscal year in the key adult 25 to 54 demo and total viewers, while extending its streak to 16 consecutive months beating CNN and MSNBC combined in prime and total day for both the key demo and total viewers. For over two decades, FOX News has been the highest-rated cable news channel in prime time. Notably, FOX News just finished the month of July as the third most viewed network in weekday prime in all of television, trailing only CBS and NBC. I've spoken about the political diversity of the FOX News audience previously, specifically about the fact that we have more independents and Democrats watching us than watch CNN or MSNBC, but the diversity of our audience extends beyond political affiliation. In July, the Fox News Channel was the most viewed cable network with Asian and Hispanic viewers. In fact, in that month viewing among Hispanic households was up 38% and among Asian households, up 43%. Elsewhere news, the FOX Nation platform increased its subscriber base by approximately 80% over the past fiscal year, supported by sustained and high conversion rates of trialists to paid subscribers and retention rates well above industry averages. At FOX Sports, live event viewing was up 5% through the first half of the calendar year led by our NASCAR schedule, which generated viewership up a solid 10% over 2021. This spring was busy for FOX Sports, as we launched the inagural season of the USFL. The USFL averaged over one million viewers on FOX, at least 20% higher than the EPL on NBC and regular season NHL broadcast on ABC and more than twice the viewership of MLS on FOX. In its first season, the USFL clearly delivered on its most essential goal, which was to demonstrate that the league belongs alongside other long-established spring sports properties. And as you know, we have an incredibly strong year ahead in sports which includes the FIFA Men's World Cup beginning this November and the Super Bowl next February. At FOX Entertainment, our content strategy is focused on ad-supported multi-platform television that can thrive both creatively and financially well into the future. We look to use our broadcast network to build and support businesses beyond our linear air. An example of this approach is Next Level Chef which was the number one new broadcast entertainment program this past season and FOX' first owned production inside our partnership with Gordon Ramsay, whereas we used only to license Gordon's product from third parties, we now license hits like Next Level Chef to third parties and we have done so with the sale of the format to ITV in the UK. Another example of how we extend and monetize our IP is the just launch of Gordon Ramsay FAST Channel on Tubi. And speaking of Tubi one year ago -- one year into our focused investment cycle at Tubi, the platform generated TVT growth of nearly 40% and revenue growth of 45% across the fiscal year with both metrics coming in better than planned and reinforcing our decision to invest in this strategic asset.  During the June quarter 34% growth in TVT helped drive revenue growth in the low double digits, despite a more difficult prior year comparison when we began our ramped content and monetization strategy. In the quarter, we launched 25 linear channels, grew our VOD library to over 45,000 titles and premiered 13 efficient Tubi Originals. We will continue to invest judiciously in Tubi with our sights set on achieving $1 billion in revenue run rate in the next couple of years. As you know, our affiliate renewal cycle begins in earnest this new fiscal year and we are again looking forward to industry-leading gains from the superior value of our channels and services. With some early meaningful station and affiliate deals already completed including the recently closed Verizon deal, we go into this renewal cycle with confidence the market appreciates the value of our brands. In aggregate, these financial and operating achievements again highlight the fact that the FOX story is one of strength, one of focus and one of stability. We will see how the macroeconomic environment evolves during the months ahead. But as we have demonstrated over the course of the last few years, FOX is well positioned to outperform. We remain encouraged by the FOX specific trends that I've highlighted and that we're observing in real-time, underpinned by the best balance sheet in the business the same solid balance sheet that helped us thrive, despite the challenges of COVID and that will continue to support our investments for long-term growth and shareholder returns.  And with that I will turn you over to Steve. Hey John, good morning. I'll start. I'll answer the Verizon renewal question and I'll let Steve answer the fun question about our cash on the books. So -- and he's got the keys. So, that's the important answer. The -- like on the Verizon renewal, I'm obviously not going to give you a specific exact pricing, but it's absolutely in line with what our forecast and sort of long-term plan suggested. We're very happy with our partnership with Verizon. And I think it's fair to say that we achieved industry-leading pricing increases for really are the best brands in the business between our local stations and retransmission renewals and the really incredible strength of FOX News and the loyalty and engagement of the FOX News audience, we're able to drive this industry leading pricing increases. Just one added element to that, which I think is important for us, is we're also able to achieved distribution for FOX Weather, which will continue to include in our future upcoming renewals. And also, we expanded our relationship with Verizon to include distribution of TUBI. So overall, we are very pleased with that renewal and we think it sets us up well for the next two years, but we have two-thirds of our distribution coming up. So we're very pleased and we appreciate the partnership with Verizon. Steve? So, on the advertising market -- and good morning, Phil, I'll give you a little bit of color. I might jump around a little bit. But as I mentioned, for us, one of the most sort of pleasing things that we're seeing is actually in the local stations our base markets. So ex-political, the base market is very stable. And as I mentioned in my remarks, particularly the return to growth for the auto category is -- it's obviously something that's concerned us over the last couple of years with COVID and the softness in the auto category, the return of growth in the auto category is a really strong indicator of things to come. We are seeing locally two verticals or two categories that are soft. One is the local wagering sort of betting category soft. But that's really what we're seeing there. I think it's pretty interesting and perhaps predictable a shift of that business going to national. So where we're seeing softness in local for wagering, we're seeing strength in national for the betting market. I think that's the purpose or the reason for that is obviously as more states become legalized in the national platform is particularly national sports is an efficient and a good buy for the betting businesses. And then we're seeing some softness in government spending that was really COVID health spending over the last couple of years, which obviously is not there anymore. But that's being more than made up across our other strength in our other categories. So, two areas of weakness locally in betting and government, but it's more than made up by strength in other categories. In terms of the scatter market, we're actually seeing a -- scatter for us before we get into the fall sports cycle is a quiet. The summer is a quiet period for us or it has been. So we actually don't have a lot of scatter avails, but scatter pricing is up in the low double digits which is good to see that strength. And then from a macro environment point of view, again, we're seeing no impact in our advertising across our businesses with the exception of softness in, which I think has been well reported in other areas, some softness in programmatic advertising. For us, that's sort of 10% of our advertising business. So it's not having a significant or meaningful impact on us at all and that 10% is really due to programmatic advertising into TUBI and into our FOX News Media digital platforms. Steve, do you want to answer the second part of the question? Hey, good morning, Robert. So, overall I mean I'll talk overall then I can come down to drill down to Big Ten. We're always going to look at sports rights as they become available. I think we've been very disciplined in terms of how we analyze and how we think about acquiring any additional incremental sports rights. We look at it both obviously from what any individual sport can achieve both in terms of an audience and advertising revenue we can attach to that. We specifically also drill down into what we can see from our subscriber what we can attribute to our affiliation agreement with a distributor in terms of subscription revenue. So we do take a pretty scientific and I think a very disciplined approach to how we view sports rights, but we do look at all the sports across the marketplace and see what would fit within FOX Sports. I think the \u2013 if you look past \u2013 over the past years the store hasn't been written is the sports rights that we pass on right that we decide are too expensive or won't add any incremental revenue to our business. So \u2013 and that continues to be the way we look at it. As regards to Big Ten, Big Ten Network is a key strategic partner of ours. We've had a great relationship with them. And we look forward to renewing those rights potentially with some new broadcast partners within the mix. That will be an announcement the Big Ten will make we expect in the near-term, but it's one that we will leave for them to make. But we're looking forward to our continued long-term and profitable relationship with them. Thanks Ben. So look, we continue to have beliefs or have a fundamentally strong belief in the sports betting business. We think it's a huge opportunity in the marketplace, specifically in its association with the FOX Sports brand. We drive the largest sports audiences in this country. And no other broadcaster can achieve kind of the reach and engagement that we deliver, during the -- certainly during the autumn and the fall on a weekly basis. And so, we've proven this last couple of years with FOX Bet's, Super 6 which really taking our sports audiences. And I know we've talked about it, before then by taking our sports audiences from television into FOX Bet Super 6 provide a tremendous funnel, which FOX Bet is the ultimate beneficiary of. That continues to be our strategy and it continues to be very successful. As regards to, Flutter we're still in our arbitration process with them. We look forward to the clarity of getting through that process, which we expect to be in the next couple of months certainly sort of by the beginning of the autumn. But once that situation is clarified and also in early September as you see the NFL season kick off again, you'll see a lot more activity around FOX Bet and FOX Bet Super 6. Hi, good morning, Doug. And hope you're well. So on -- we have a Big Ten digital rights and we will keep those in the new deal. So I hope that clarifies, that again I don't want to say too much because it's really -- it's for the Big Ten to announce their new agreements. In terms of upfront volumes ex, I think your question was what are they ex-Super Bowl. Obviously, we look at everything ex-Super Bowl, because it's obviously such a huge year for us. We're looking forward to we're getting record pricing for Super Bowl, and we're well ahead of plan in terms of selling our Super Bowl position. But ex-Super Bowl upfront volumes were about 15% higher than the last upfront. I think one of the -- and that's across entertainment sports and news.

            "name": "Steve Tomsic",
            "content": "Thanks Lachlan and good morning, everyone. We ended our third full fiscal year with total company revenue growth of 8% and topline growth across all of our operating segments in every quarter of fiscal '22. Even in a year that for us was light on major sports events and was an off-cycle political year, total company advertising revenues led this growth with a 9% increase over fiscal 2021.  Cable segment advertising revenues were up 9% and primarily benefited from higher pricing across our news and sports networks. Television segment advertising revenues were up 8% on the back of increased engagement of Tubi, as well as higher pricing and the normalization of live event programming at the FOX Network, following COVID-related disruptions last year. These gains were partially offset by the absence of the prior year's record political revenues and lower ratings of FOX Entertainment. Total company affiliate revenues increased 7% led by 10% growth at the Television segment and 5% at the Cable segment. Total company other revenues increased 15%, driven by higher sports sublicensing revenues as compared to prior year pandemic-related disruptions, growth in FOX Nation subscription revenues and the consolidation of TMZ MarVista and Studio Ramsay Global.  This growth in other revenues was partially offset by the impact of the divestiture of the company's sports marketing businesses last fiscal year. We also delivered sustained momentum in our consolidated digital revenues with a nearly 30% increase year-over-year. This digital growth was supported by the organic investments across our digital portfolio that we articulated at the outset of the fiscal year.  These investments the establishment of USFL and higher programming rights amortization associated with the normalized sports and entertainment schedules contributed to a modest decrease in our full year adjusted EBITDA which came in at $2.96 billion.  Full year net income attributable to stockholders was $1.21 billion or $2.11 per share, while adjusted EPS was $2.79, down modestly against the $2.88 billion \u2013 sorry, the $2.88 reported last year primarily due to the impacts on EBITDA I just mentioned. Turning to the quarter, we delivered total company revenues of $3.03 billion, up 5% over the same period in 2021. This growth was led by a 7% increase in total company advertising revenues, highlighted by the strength of FOX News, record June quarter political revenues at FOX Television stations, and continued growth of TUBI. Total company affiliate revenues grew 4%, with 7% growth at the Television segment, and 2% growth at the Cable segment. Once again this distribution revenue growth was driven by rate increases, as the rate of subscriber declines increased modestly in the quarter, with trailing 12-month industry sub losses running in the high 5% range. Total company other revenues increased 4% as the consolidation of our entertainment production companies and continued momentum at FOX Nation, were partially offset by the timing of sports sublicensing revenues, which were impacted by COVID in the prior year. Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $770 million, up 7% over the comparative period in fiscal 2021, as our revenue growth was partially offset by higher expenses, including the impact of the anticipated digital investments of FOX News Media and TUBI, and the first year deficit associated with the launch of the USFL. Net income attributable to stockholders of $306 million, or $0.55 per share, was higher than the $253 million or $0.43 per share in the prior year quarter. This variance reflects the EBITDA movement I just described, along with the mark-to-market adjustments associated with the company's investments recognized in other than that. Excluding non-core items, adjusted EPS in the June quarter of $0.74, was up 14% over last year's $0.65. It is worth noting, our effective income tax rate was higher for both the quarter, and the full year, primarily due to a $30 million re-measurement of our net deferred tax assets, associated with changes in the mix of our jurisdictional earnings. This had no impact on our cash taxes. Now, let's turn to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter, starting with Cable Networks, which reported a 4% increase in revenues. This was led by a 14% increase in cable advertising revenues, driven by strong gains in both pricing and audience at FOX News, notwithstanding slightly higher levels of preemptions associated with our breaking news coverage. Also, contributing to the overall segment revenue growth was a 2% increase in affiliate revenues, once again due to the healthy pricing gains across all of our networks. Cable other revenues were unchanged compared to the prior year, as the continued subscription momentum at FOX Nation, and the addition of the USFL were offset by the impact of the timing of sports sublicensing revenues as a result of COVID in the prior year. EBITDA at our Cable segment was down 7% against the prior year as these revenue increases were more than offset by increased expenses, including the planned digital investment and higher programming costs, including those associated with breaking news coverage at Fox News Media, as well as the launch of the USFL. Our television segment reported a 5% increase in quarterly revenues. This was led by a 7% increase in television affiliate revenues, reflecting increases for both direct retransmission revenues at our owned and operated stations, and our programming fees from non-owned station affiliates. Our Television segment delivered 4% growth in advertising revenues, driven by higher political advertising at the FOX Television stations, continued growth at TUBI, and the introduction of the USFL, partially offset by lower ratings of FOX Entertainment. Other revenues at television increased 3% in the quarter, primarily due to the impact of the acquisitions of TMZ and MarVista Entertainment, and the consolidation of our stake in Studio Ramsay Global, partially offset by the timing of deliveries at Bento Box. EBITDA at our Television segment increased over 50% as expenses were flat against the prior year quarter. Here, we saw an accelerated digital investment at TUBI, and the consolidation of the entertainment production assets offset by the timing of programming costs at FOX Entertainment. During the full year, we generated free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx of $1.6 billion. Over the course of fiscal 2022, we returned $1 billion of capital through the repurchase of 18.7 million Class A shares and 8.7 million Class B shares. This was supplemented by over $270 million in dividend payments and underlining our continued commitment to shareholder returns, today we announced an increase in our semi-annual dividend to $0.25 per share. With the payment of this dividend, we will have cumulatively returned over $3.75 billion of capital to our shareholders since the formation of FOX. This includes share repurchases totaling over $2.65 billion against our buyback authorization of $4 billion. From our balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $5.2 billion in cash and approximately $7.2 billion in debt. Our fiscal 2022 financial performance along with the progress we have made on our strategic priorities provide a strong foundation for us to springboard into fiscal 2023 where the setup is incredibly favorable. We remain confident that collectively the financial tailwinds from Super Bowl 57, the early exit of Thursday Night Football, the momentum heading into November's midterm elections, and the start of our next major distribution cycle will deliver record revenues and EBITDA in fiscal 2023. As we've highlighted previously, our plans for fiscal 2023 incorporate maintaining our current level of investment in our digital growth initiatives. From an affiliate revenue perspective as you would expect, we make no predictions on industry subscriber volumes. However, from a rate perspective given the timing and nature of our affiliate renewals, you should expect to see the financial benefit of these renewals skewed to the second half of the fiscal year and concentrated toward our Television segment. Our focused strategy and operational execution continue to distinguish us. Together, they have delivered sustained financial outperformance since the establishment of FOX and will be showcased with a banner year of events in fiscal 2023. This momentum supported by the most robust balance sheet in the industry position us well to navigate the broader macroeconomic turbulence while creating value for our shareholders. And with that, Gabby, let's now open it up for Q&A. Yes. So Phil, just on the rate of subscriber erosion I think with our channels \u2013 our must-carry channels. So I think we're best positioned to buffer any sort of weakness in the subscriber universe. I think where people find it challenging to reconcile between sort of how we report numbers and how \u2013 where you see numbers from the Street, there's a couple of things. One is we're in a two-month delay versus what's being reported by the distributors. And the other piece is there's a fair amount of opacity around some of the platforms that don't report. So you got the \u2013 many of the virtual MVPDs don't break out their numbers and DIRECTV no longer breaks out its numbers. And so that's probably where you're seeing the sort of friction between the reported numbers. Hey Ben just picking up on your question around organic investment. So the way we define -- we had -- we called out $200 million to $300 million of net EBITDA of our investment for fiscal 2022. So put another way our fiscal 2022 EBITDA would have be $200 million to $300 million higher than what it was had we not made those investments. We don't -- we anticipate maintaining that level of investment meaning that when you compare 2023 to 2022 you will not have that drag on the results. So that explains that for you. Doug, it's Steve. Just on the free cash flow. I think from a working capital perspective a big swing factors, I think from an accounting version of working capital, remember, that going into we're into a Super Bowl year. So therefore, we amort a ton of the NFL costs in a Super Bowl year, so it has an impact on our working capital. Our CapEx was down to a touch over $300 million this year, which was down from a touch north of $480 million. The year before, you should expect the $300 million to go up a touch. But the rest of it is, I think really pretty much stock in trade in terms of, cash flow swings. There's nothing particularly unique about next year apart from, the tailwinds that we have going into it from an operating perspective. Thank you."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we\u2019ll conduct a question and answer session. I would like to emphasize that that functionality for the question and answer queue will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to our Chief Investor Relations Officer, Mr. Joe Dorrego. Please go ahead, sir.\nJoe Dorrego: Thank you, Operator. Good morning and welcome to our Fiscal 2022 Third Quarter Earnings Call. Joining me on the call today are Lachlan Murdoch, Executive Chair and Chief Executive Officer; John Nallen, Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Tomsic, our Chief Financial Officer. First, Lachlan and Steve will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter, and then we'll take questions from the investment community. Please note that this call may include forward-looking statements regarding Fox Corporation's financial performance and operating results. These statements are based on management's current expectations and actual results could differ from what is stated as a result of certain factors identified on today's call, and in the Company's SEC filings. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA or EBITDA as we refer to it on this call. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and our SEC filings, which are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Lachlan.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks, Joe and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on this call. I don\u2019t know about everyone else but I often find early mornings after a coffee or two or three to be good time to reflect on the progress we are making and to plan the days or weeks ahead.  Sitting here on the FOX lot with my colleagues, I can recall our investors that when we saw all of you or most of you in person and kicked off the new FOX, now already a few years ago, some of you\u2019ve asked then correctly, could the new streamlined FOX aggressively grow its top-line revenues? And what we committed to you then that we would add $1 billion of television distribution revenue by calendar of 2022, we all knew that proof would be in the pudding.  So what\u2019s pleasing that this quarter, we again delivered healthy distribution and advertising revenue growth across our brands and complemented by further stellar growth at Tubi. Overall, we delivered 7% revenue growth led by 9% advertising growth and 5% growth in our distribution revenues. As a reminder, this 5% growth in distribution revenues does not include the benefit of any material renewals this fiscal year. Those renewals start next year and our advertising growth was notably broad based.  Cable Advertising grew by 20% in the quarter. This growth was driven by FOX News as its pricing and ratings trends more than offset the elevated level of preemptions due to the coverage of the war of in Ukraine. Television advertising grew by 6% in the quarter. This increase was led by Tubi, which saw its advertising growth accelerate from approximately 40% in the December quarter to 50% on the back of increased engagement.  In addition, continued strong demand for sports drove overall growth at the FOX network and at the local level, advertising revenues increased, despite continued supply chain and other economic headwinds. As we look to our upfront next Monday, we are encouraged by the early momentum in the market and we believe that our focus on lives including the must have events of the coming year such as the Super Bowl, the World Cup and even the mid-term political cycle puts us firmly in the lead with our advertising partners as upfront deals are made. And, as we established last year, Tubi will continue to play a leading integrated role in our upfront efforts.  We are in this enviable position due to the execution of our strategy by our core business units. It\u2019s hard work, but it pays off. FOX News channel finished the first quarter of calendar 2022 as Cable\u2019s most watched network in prime time and total day viewers. In fact, FOX News was the only Cable News network to post gains versus the prior year quarter in total viewers and the key demographic are adults 25 to 54.  FOX News now beat CNN and MSN we see combined in total day and with both total viewers and the key demo for nine consecutive months and with a total base share of 54% across both demos. These achievements reflect the growing breadth and depth of our programming slide. Notably, The Five was the most watched program in Cable News for the second consecutive quarter.  Meanwhile, Gutfeld delivered its highest graded quarter while Jesse Watters Primetime, which launched in late January is averaging over 3 million viewers in the 7 PM time slot. Broadcasting 97 of the top 100 most watched cable news telecast this past quarter FOX News continues to attract the most politically diverse audience in its peer group watched by more democrats and independents than MSNBC and CNN in total day and primetime.  Meanwhile, our sustained and disciplined investment continues to drive subscriber growth and engagement at FOX Nation. The FOX Nation subscriber base has more than tripled in less than 18 months, driving engagement levels to new heights in each quarter. The average FOX News fans have clearly embraced the FOX Nation platform as demonstrated by its consistently high conversion rate or trial us to paid subscribers and retention rates well above in industry averages.  Momentum also continued at FOX Weather, which benefited from expanded distribution on Roku, YouTube TV, and Amazon resulting in sequential growth in total view time across each month of the quarter.  At FOX Sports, the USFL is off to an encouraging start. Through its first three weeks, nearly 20 million people have watched the USFL on TV and games on FOX and NBC are averaging 1.5 million viewers. That compares favorably to well-established spring sports properties like, The NHL, Formula 1, The EPL and MLS, all properties which either earn sizable rights increases or expected to do so soon.  We are clearly establishing that USFL belongs in this competitive set, which is our primary goal in this first season. At the NFL, we are pleased to announce that we have reached agreement that carry an incremental game this coming year on Christmas Day. As a reminder, last year\u2019s Christmas Day game on FOX delivered over 28 million viewers. We look forward to the release of the full NFL schedule expected later this week.  Elsewhere, our NASCAR season is off to a strong start. Though we are early, the low -teens gains we are seeing in viewership would represent one of the more meaningful single season improvements across the 22 year history of NASCAR on FOX. And we couldn\u2019t be more excited about the upcoming 2022 FIFA World Cup on FOX Sports with the qualifications of the U.S. men\u2019s team and its blockbuster match against England on Friday, November the 25th.  This match will contribute to an unprecedented Thanksgiving weekend of Sports on FOX, book ended by the Dallas Cowboys on Thanksgiving Day and the Michigan, Ohio State rivalry on Saturday. That\u2019s likely to add up to most watched NFL game over the regular season, the most watched U.S. men\u2019s national soccer team match as ever and the most watched College Football Game in the season, all during the busiest consumer shopping weekend of the year. This speaks to the power of our platforms and the prudence of our strategy.  Of course, our linear businesses are complemented by Tubi, where total view time increased 50% propelled by record quarterly viewership. In fact, Tubi delivered 18 of its top-20 Tubi key days in its history this past quarter, a period where there is traditionally some softer seasonality in the AVOD market.  Meanwhile, Tubi expanded its industry-leading library and now accounts more than 42,000 titles in its portfolio. Importantly, Tubi also renewed key distribution deals including its Amazon partnership, and signed its first custom deal for Samsung\u2019s smart TVs.  In the third quarter, we continued to invest in the future of Tubi, which we believe will be a strong growth engine for the company for years to come. We have also invested in FOX Weather, which is now available ubiquitously in every broadband home across the country and provides our clients with a new, very broad advertising platform.  And finally, FOX Nation goes from strength-to-strength as it builds upon the engagement between FOX News and our most ardent fans. These initiatives illustrate the entrepreneurial nature of FOX endowed with America\u2019s strongest media brands and most enviable balance sheet. Before handing over to Steve, I'd just like to acknowledge the incredible bravery, sacrifice and professionalism of the entire FOX News reporting team in covering the war in Ukraine. Journalism is rarely easy, and often, it is very hard.  Bearing light on the horrors of this war and the resulting refugee and humanitarian crisis, it is born. It's probably the hardest assignment we can give. I am, we all are, deeply grateful for the tremendous work and extraordinary journalism that Trey Yingst, Jennifer Griffin, Steve Harrigan, Jeff Palcott, Ben Hall and many more excellent reporters have provided our audience. Tragically, two of our journalists were killed in Kyiv and Ben Hall remains in treatment for his serious injuries. Our thoughts and the thoughts of the whole FOX family are with them and their families.  With that, I\u2019ll hand over to Steve. \nSteve Tomsic: Thank you, Lachlan, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results once again reflect the strength of our leadership brands and the continued growth of our digital businesses. We achieved total company revenue growth of 7% year-over-year delivering top-line growth across all of our operating for the fourth consecutive quarter.  Total company affiliate revenues increased 5% despite the fact that only 5% of our total company distribution revenues have been up for renewal this fiscal year. Meanwhile, the rate of industry subscriber declines remained steady in the quarter with trailing 12-month sub losses running below 5%. Total company advertising revenues grew 9% as our leadership brands once again delivered premium pricing, coupled with continued strong momentum at Tubi. Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $811 million, down 10% over the comparative period last year as the revenue growth was more than offset by higher expenses.  As we\u2019ve foreshadowed on prior calls, the increase in expenses was mainly driven by the anticipated increase in digital investments including FOX News Media and Tubi. Additionally, we saw high programming rights amortization and production cost at FOX Sports and we\u2019re impacted by an approximately $30 million write-down of certain scripted programming at FOX Entertainment. Net Income attributable to stockholders was $283 million or $0.50 per share compared to the $567 million or $0.96 per share we reported in the prior year quarter. As we have seen in recent quarters, this below the line variance was primarily due to the change in fair value of the company\u2019s investment in Flutter which we recognized in Other net. Excluding this impact and other non-core items, adjusted EPS was $0.81 per share, compared to last year's $0.88, primarily reflecting the movement in EBITDA. Now let's turn to our business segment results starting with Cable Networks, which reported an 8% in revenues. The strong revenue delivery was underpinned by significant gains in cable advertising revenues which grew 20% in the quarter.  Notwithstanding slightly higher levels of preemptions associated with our breaking news coverage of the war in Ukraine, FOX News was the engine of this advertising revenue growth with strong gains in both audience and pricing.  Cable affiliate revenues increased 3% over the prior year period, a result of healthy pricing gains across all of our networks. Cable other revenues increased 23%, led by the timing of sports sub-licensing revenues which were impacted by COVID last year, as well as continued subscription momentum at FOX Nation. This growth was partially offset by the disposition of our sports marketing businesses, which was sold in March of last year. EBITDA at our Cable segment increased by $14 million over the prior year period as these revenue increases were partially offset by higher expenses related to the digital investments of FOX News Media and the timing of programming amortization and production costs at the Cable Sports Networks following the COVID-related disruptions of the prior year Almost matching the strong revenue growth in cable, our Television segment delivered a 7% increase in revenue. This was led by an 8% increase in television affiliate revenues over the prior year quarter, reflecting increases for both our direct retransmission revenues at our owned and operated stations and for our programming fees from non-owned station affiliates.  This runrate orbit assures achievement of our target of $1 billion of incremental television affiliate revenue this calendar year that we announced at our Investor Day back in 2019. Our Television segment also delivered 6% advertising revenue growth, reflecting strong linear pricing at the FOX Network and continued growth at Tubi, partially offset by lower impressions of FOX Entertainment.  At FOX Sports, the impact of the additional week to the NFL regular season was offset by the absence of the rotating NFL divisional playoff game this year. And at the FOX Television stations, notwithstanding the ongoing supply chain-related challenges to the auto category, we continued to grow advertising revenues supported by gains from our digital sales efforts and continued demand from the sports betting category. Other revenues at our Television segment increased 17%, primarily due to the impact of the acquisitions of MarVista Entertainment and TMZ and the consolidation of our stake in Studio Ramsay Global. Television EBITDA was lower by $100 million against the prior year period, as its healthy revenue growth was more than offset by the planned digital investment at Tubi, higher sports programming amortization and production costs at FOX Sports and an approximately $30 million write-down of certain scripted programming at FOX Entertainment. Turning now to cash flow, we generated strong free cash flow of $1.54 billion in the quarter, reflecting our normal seasonal cycle of collecting advertising revenues from our old programming and the result of our sports rights payments being concentrated in the first half of our fiscal year.  Our share repurchases since the commencement of the quarter have totaled $300 million and fiscal year-to-date, we have now returned over $1 billion of capital to shareholders. This is comprised of approximately $275 million in the form of our semi-annual dividend payments and a further $800 million in share buybacks. We remain committed to utilizing our full buyback authorization of $4 billion and have now cumulatively repurchased approximately $2.4 billion, representing over 11% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in November 2019. We continue to maintain a very strong balance sheet, ending the quarter with $4.6 billion in cash and $7.2 billion in debt. So as we look forward, the setup for fiscal 2023 remains incredibly strong with the financial tailwinds from Super Bowl 57, the early exit of Thursday Night Football, November's mid-term elections and the start of our next major distribution renewal cycle. So with that, I'll now turn the call back to Lachlan.\nLachlan Murdoch : Thank you very much, Steve. As you know, we usually, after Steve's comments, we go straight to Joe and start the questions. But we have a breaking news, which I am in the spirit of being always open and giving our investors and our shareholders the latest news in the company. I'll go straight to this. I mean, literally, this is happening in real-time. We are pleased to announce that immediately following his playing career, whenever that may be, seven-time Super Bowl winner Tom Brady will be joining us at FOX Sports as our lead analyst. Over the course of this long-term agreement, Tom will not only call our biggest NFL games with Kevin Burkhart, but will also serve as an ambassador for us, particularly with the client and promotional initiatives.  We are delighted that Tom has committed to joining the FOX team, and we wish him all the best during this upcoming season. I am sure everyone joins me in warmly welcoming Tom Brady on board. Thank you very much. And with that, I'll hand over to Joe\nJoe Dorrego : Thanks, Lachlan. And now we'd be happy to take questions from the investment community. .\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We have a question from the line of Ben Swinburne. Please go ahead. \nBen Swinburne : Well, I want to ask when Tom Brady is actually going to stop playing, but I'll save that for an off-line conversation. Congrats on that deal. I wanted to ask you guys about Tubi heading into fiscal 2023. Could you talk a little bit, Lachlan, about how you plan to position that business in the upfront to the extent you can share any goals in terms of how much of that business may actually be sold in the upfront?  And how are you guys thinking about investments relative to letting that business start to generate some profits next year as you continue to obviously see a lot of top-line growth? Thanks. \nLachlan Murdoch : Thank you, very much, Ben. Look, I can tell you on the first part of your question that, like I said, we're incredibly excited to have Tom joining us. It's entirely up to him for when he chooses to retire and move into his, what will be exciting and stellar sort of television career, but that's up to him to make that choice when he sees fit. In regards to Tubi and the upfronts and how that plays into sort of how we position the Tubi business going forward and to when it returns to profitability, it's important to note that on Monday, when we are engaged in our upfront presentations, we've already spent several weeks engaging with clients and advertisers on upfront negotiations and Tubi has been at the forefront of all of those conversations.  I think our clients can see both the shift to AVOD and the streaming advertising. At the same time, they see the strength of where Tubi is positioned as a leader in that market. And then we're constantly on a regular sort of daily basis, balancing carefully the ad load in Tubi and the fill rate of that \u2013 of those advertising slots.  And as you know, Tubi has an incredibly intelligent ad tech that can do that dynamically viewer-to-viewer, customer-to-customer. We can dial that up or dial it down really as we see fit, but we think it's important that this early life cycle of advertising video-on-demand services to maintain the highest sort of quality viewer experience and kind of consumer experience on the service. So we're pleased with where that is. But really, it would be up to us to be able to increase that ad load and drive revenue and bring it back to profitability, which, as you know, Tubi has been profitable in past quarters. But as of today, the right strategy and the right way forward is to continue to carefully and deliberately invest in the growth of Tubi, which I am \u2013 which we think is going to really be the leader in advertising video-on-demand certainly in this country.\nJoe Dorrego : Operator, we can go to the next question. .\nOperator: We have a question from Jessica Reif Ehrlich, Bank of America. Please go ahead. \nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you. Trying to think of how I make this one question. So your two key drivers are obviously advertising and distribution revenue. And in the advertising, you're incredibly well positioned going into the upfront, given as you highlighted your incredible array of marquee sports. You'll also have USFL coming in and news couldn't be more dominant.  So just, can you give us color on expectations for, I mean, your positioning is great, but expectations for your performance in the upfront market and the health of the overall industry? And on the Pay TV side, while your - again, outperformance in news and other areas is very strong, Pay TV market has been shrinking. You seem pretty confident about the affiliate renewal cycles coming up. So, can you give us color on that and how you offset the shrinking universe?\nLachlan Murdoch : Sure. Thank you, Jessica. I am not sure if there was two questions or seven, but they are always good questions. So, thank you very much. \nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you.\nLachlan Murdoch : On the outlook, so I think I'll remember to advertise \u2013 to answer most of them as I go through this answer, but from a advertising perspective and particularly heading into these upfront negotiations, we're already in the upfront season, but as we get to the pointy end of that that season, we're seeing really solid demand across our businesses. In pricing, entertainments seeing pricing in the sort of high-single-digit, mid to high-single-digit sort of range above last year. But in Sports News, as you said, we are very well positioned. We are seeing sort of our pricing in sort of mid-double digits. So sort of the mid- to high teens pricing increase is driven by demand across some live sports and live news. So, as we \u2013 that gives us a great deal of confidence as we move into these upfront negotiations. You add to that, obviously, the inclusion of Tubi with 50% growth in DVT time and engagement. It's a really strong position to be in. Our sports properties are driving and that our must-have sports tent poles this year are really driving a lot of interest from our clients. If I could give one word of advice, which I wouldn't do, but if I can give one word of advice to our clients and advertising partners, it's getting in early because these \u2013 some of these key events are selling extremely well already. So, we fully expect to see sort of continued advertising strength. That's without even talking about the mid-term election cycle, which by all estimates will be a record mid-term cycle for us. We keep a close eye on the races in all of our markets and it's pretty amazing to see where we have not only tight races, but also contested primaries pretty much across the majority of our owned and owned stations. So, we think the coming mid-term elections will be \u2013 will really be an advertising boon for us, as well Moving on to Pay TV pricing, well, from \u2013 frankly, from both an advertising point of view, which is incredibly strong with the strength of FOX News, and I spoke about it a little bit in my in my earlier statements, the strength of FOX News, but also the strength of FOX News and the station group from our retransmission and distribution revenue point of view really has never been stronger.  FOX News is effectively competing with the free-to-air broadcasters in terms of audiences. It's actually usually beating, many nights of the week sort of beating broadcast networks and we expect our pricing power to continue to strengthen with performance like that. So, yes, I think I've answered most of, if not all of your questions, Jessica. But in short from both from an advertising perspective and from a television distribution or retransmission revenue perspective, we think we're well positioned, particularly in a year or a cycle where we're coming up to, I think, over the next two years, two-thirds of our distribution revenue coming up for renewals.\nJoe Dorrego : Operator, we can go to the next question.\nOperator: We have a question from Robert Fishman of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. \nRobert Fishman : Good morning. A question on television profitability. Given the $30 million write-down of the scripted programming at FOX Entertainment in the quarter and then as we get closer to fiscal 2023 when Thursday night football losses go away, can you just help frame the other swing factors that could impact a big increase in television EBITDA next year?  And maybe any early look into incremental digital investments and how you are thinking about the general entertainment programming spend to help fill that Thursday Night programming gap? Thank you.\nLachlan Murdoch : So, hey, Robert, how are you? The \u2013 one of the pieces of work that the entertainment network has sort of undertook over last year, but it's our \u2013 it\u2019s earlier than that is really the ability to kind of transform that business to where it can tightly control its programming costs in a way that really has them at a level that really hasn't been achievable before.  This goes to the acquisition a few years ago of Bento Box, so we can control more of our animation costs. It goes to the acquisition of TMZ, so we can really control, sort of high-quality factual content and specials that we put on the network and other things such as MarVista. MarVista is focused a bit more on Tubi.  So the work in the background of being able to own and control, I should also mention, by the way, I apologize for not, very importantly, the joint venture with Gordon Ramsay Productions, that's incredibly exciting.  Gordon has been a key partner of ours for many, many years and his plans for the growth of that business, not just in the U.S., but what we can do with the IP, Gordon Ramsay's IP around the world is really exciting to see. So we have high expectations for that partnership. So all of that really feeds into the network's really ability to control its programming across multiple lots. As you know, the FOX network is only two hours a night in primetime, and so it's an easier volume of hours to digest and the program towards. What was the last part of the question? \nSteve Tomsic : Yes. So, Robert, just in terms of the swing factors, listen, there's a ton of tailwind behind the TV segment going into next year. So you called out Tuesday night football dropping off. So that, I think we've said in the past, that release is around $350 million to $400 million to the bottom-line for us, net-net-net. But then you've got all the other things that play into next year for us.  So you've got Super Bowl, political, and you've got the FIFA World Cup, and then you've got Tubi with the momentum that's showing top-line. So, we couldn't be better positioned for fiscal 2023 from a Television segment perspective.\nLachlan Murdoch : You can stay more pleased. Steve is very careful.\nRobert Fishman : Thank you.\nJoe Dorrego : Operator, we can go to the next question.\nOperator: We have a question from Doug Mitchelson of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. \nDoug Mitchelson : Hi, Lachlan and team. Thank you for taking the question. Should investors expect fiscal 2023 to see operating leverage against your digital investments, revenue growing faster than OpEx with those? And Lachlan, I am not sure if you're prepared to give any sort of update on ambitions for Tubi, but it's been growing rapidly, you're investing a lot in it.  And FOX has been in kind of the interesting investment in that not making a strong pivot to streaming to some of your peers, but yet Tubi is an interesting investment opportunity that's impacting margins this year. So just kind of understand where you think that asset could go and what the investment cycle looks like would be helpful I think? Thanks so much. \nLachlan Murdoch : Thank you very much, Doug. So look, we see the level of investment this year in our digital properties, and that's Tubi, but it also includes FOX Weather and FOX Nation and some other smaller \u2013 small elements. We see the current level of investment at the appropriate level, going forward. So that's in that that we've guided the market between $200 million and $300 million that we're putting back into investing, into growing those businesses.  And we would not expect any kind of significant level above that on sort of our current plans. And we think that level is a right amount, particularly with an asset like Tubi that there really is really going to be the future of how people watch television in this country. We think, when you look at Tubi, it's interesting, I looked this up the other day.  But Farhad really began Tubi or the early version of what ultimately became Tubi with an ad tech business over 11 or 12 years ago. And that ultimately evolved into Tubi as he understood the value of taking his intelligent ad tech business and then \u2013 and actually licensing programming along with that to monetize that programming most efficiently.  And as I said before, it's great to have the Tubi team as a company really focused on the technology side of this business and understand how they drive engagement and drive viewing, which is very different from what an older sort of media model or viewer of it would be. So, because of that and because of the long track record, the lead time they have, the fact that they've been doing this a long time, we think it's really poised to continue to win in the market and that level of investment is the right level to help it as you've been.\nJoe Dorrego : Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Our last question will come from the line of Steven Cahall of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. \nSteven Cahall : Yes. Thanks very much. Good morning. Maybe first, I am sorry if I missed this, but I think you maybe indicated that you could be at an end of arbitration by June. So I just wanted to see if that timing is still correct? And would love to know if you have any metrics to update us on for FOX Bet and how that's continued to grow? And how you kind of feel about the relationship with Flutter and some of your strategic opportunities there? And then also, as we think about long-term sports rights, you've got a lot of rights, especially digital rights. Do you see those as largely staying inside the linear ecosystem? Or do you think there is an opportunity to sub-license some of those to some of your peers who are spending a lot on their a la carte streaming products? Thank you.\nLachlan Murdoch : Thanks very much Steven. So, in terms of our sports wagering strategy and business, we are \u2013 we remain in arbitration. And we expect in the summer that that arbitration to be resolved if not sooner and there is not much more we can say about it. But it's been, as you know, a long and sometimes arduous process. But the most important thing to remember, I suppose is the value of the business that we've created and the value of that sort of top of the funnel with FOX Bet.  Super 6 in particular, a free game with $6.6 million, I believe, now and we're in a traditionally, a quiet period for sports rate and particularly around, obviously, with no football. And so, the FOX Bet businesses continue to do incredibly well and continues to be able to drive wagering customers into paying games. So, we're incredibly pleased with how we've delivered operationally on our side of the partnership. So we look forward to the end of arbitration and moving forward with our wagering strategy. In terms of sports rights and whether we would \u2013 whether they remain on linear, our own sort of owned sort of linear platforms, absolutely. We think that our key rights deserve the right, the ability to stay on our broadcast and cable networks exclusively. This is very important to us. It both gives our league partners the most breadth and reach that they can achieve in viewership for their fans, but also it's really key to our distribution strategy.  It's how we will deliver industry-leading distribution revenue gains by keeping the highest quality exclusive content within our platforms, as I said, exclusively. And sub-licensing those to others or to put behind a struggling payroll would not be the right strategy.\nJoe Dorrego : At this point, we are out of time. But if you have any further questions, please give me or Dan Carey a call. Thank you once again for joining today's call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Lachlan Murdoch",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on this call. I don't know about everyone else but I often find early mornings after a coffee or two or three to be good time to reflect on the progress we are making and to plan the days or weeks ahead.  Sitting here on the FOX lot with my colleagues, I can recall our investors that when we saw all of you or most of you in person and kicked off the new FOX, now already a few years ago, some of you've asked then correctly, could the new streamlined FOX aggressively grow its top-line revenues? And what we committed to you then that we would add $1 billion of television distribution revenue by calendar of 2022, we all knew that proof would be in the pudding.  So what's pleasing that this quarter, we again delivered healthy distribution and advertising revenue growth across our brands and complemented by further stellar growth at Tubi. Overall, we delivered 7% revenue growth led by 9% advertising growth and 5% growth in our distribution revenues. As a reminder, this 5% growth in distribution revenues does not include the benefit of any material renewals this fiscal year. Those renewals start next year and our advertising growth was notably broad based.  Cable Advertising grew by 20% in the quarter. This growth was driven by FOX News as its pricing and ratings trends more than offset the elevated level of preemptions due to the coverage of the war of in Ukraine. Television advertising grew by 6% in the quarter. This increase was led by Tubi, which saw its advertising growth accelerate from approximately 40% in the December quarter to 50% on the back of increased engagement.  In addition, continued strong demand for sports drove overall growth at the FOX network and at the local level, advertising revenues increased, despite continued supply chain and other economic headwinds. As we look to our upfront next Monday, we are encouraged by the early momentum in the market and we believe that our focus on lives including the must have events of the coming year such as the Super Bowl, the World Cup and even the mid-term political cycle puts us firmly in the lead with our advertising partners as upfront deals are made. And, as we established last year, Tubi will continue to play a leading integrated role in our upfront efforts.  We are in this enviable position due to the execution of our strategy by our core business units. It's hard work, but it pays off. FOX News channel finished the first quarter of calendar 2022 as Cable's most watched network in prime time and total day viewers. In fact, FOX News was the only Cable News network to post gains versus the prior year quarter in total viewers and the key demographic are adults 25 to 54.  FOX News now beat CNN and MSN we see combined in total day and with both total viewers and the key demo for nine consecutive months and with a total base share of 54% across both demos. These achievements reflect the growing breadth and depth of our programming slide. Notably, The Five was the most watched program in Cable News for the second consecutive quarter.  Meanwhile, Gutfeld delivered its highest graded quarter while Jesse Watters Primetime, which launched in late January is averaging over 3 million viewers in the 7 PM time slot. Broadcasting 97 of the top 100 most watched cable news telecast this past quarter FOX News continues to attract the most politically diverse audience in its peer group watched by more democrats and independents than MSNBC and CNN in total day and primetime.  Meanwhile, our sustained and disciplined investment continues to drive subscriber growth and engagement at FOX Nation. The FOX Nation subscriber base has more than tripled in less than 18 months, driving engagement levels to new heights in each quarter. The average FOX News fans have clearly embraced the FOX Nation platform as demonstrated by its consistently high conversion rate or trial us to paid subscribers and retention rates well above in industry averages.  Momentum also continued at FOX Weather, which benefited from expanded distribution on Roku, YouTube TV, and Amazon resulting in sequential growth in total view time across each month of the quarter.  At FOX Sports, the USFL is off to an encouraging start. Through its first three weeks, nearly 20 million people have watched the USFL on TV and games on FOX and NBC are averaging 1.5 million viewers. That compares favorably to well-established spring sports properties like, The NHL, Formula 1, The EPL and MLS, all properties which either earn sizable rights increases or expected to do so soon.  We are clearly establishing that USFL belongs in this competitive set, which is our primary goal in this first season. At the NFL, we are pleased to announce that we have reached agreement that carry an incremental game this coming year on Christmas Day. As a reminder, last year's Christmas Day game on FOX delivered over 28 million viewers. We look forward to the release of the full NFL schedule expected later this week.  Elsewhere, our NASCAR season is off to a strong start. Though we are early, the low -teens gains we are seeing in viewership would represent one of the more meaningful single season improvements across the 22 year history of NASCAR on FOX. And we couldn't be more excited about the upcoming 2022 FIFA World Cup on FOX Sports with the qualifications of the U.S. men's team and its blockbuster match against England on Friday, November the 25th.  This match will contribute to an unprecedented Thanksgiving weekend of Sports on FOX, book ended by the Dallas Cowboys on Thanksgiving Day and the Michigan, Ohio State rivalry on Saturday. That's likely to add up to most watched NFL game over the regular season, the most watched U.S. men's national soccer team match as ever and the most watched College Football Game in the season, all during the busiest consumer shopping weekend of the year. This speaks to the power of our platforms and the prudence of our strategy.  Of course, our linear businesses are complemented by Tubi, where total view time increased 50% propelled by record quarterly viewership. In fact, Tubi delivered 18 of its top-20 Tubi key days in its history this past quarter, a period where there is traditionally some softer seasonality in the AVOD market.  Meanwhile, Tubi expanded its industry-leading library and now accounts more than 42,000 titles in its portfolio. Importantly, Tubi also renewed key distribution deals including its Amazon partnership, and signed its first custom deal for Samsung's smart TVs.  In the third quarter, we continued to invest in the future of Tubi, which we believe will be a strong growth engine for the company for years to come. We have also invested in FOX Weather, which is now available ubiquitously in every broadband home across the country and provides our clients with a new, very broad advertising platform.  And finally, FOX Nation goes from strength-to-strength as it builds upon the engagement between FOX News and our most ardent fans. These initiatives illustrate the entrepreneurial nature of FOX endowed with America's strongest media brands and most enviable balance sheet. Before handing over to Steve, I'd just like to acknowledge the incredible bravery, sacrifice and professionalism of the entire FOX News reporting team in covering the war in Ukraine. Journalism is rarely easy, and often, it is very hard.  Bearing light on the horrors of this war and the resulting refugee and humanitarian crisis, it is born. It's probably the hardest assignment we can give. I am, we all are, deeply grateful for the tremendous work and extraordinary journalism that Trey Yingst, Jennifer Griffin, Steve Harrigan, Jeff Palcott, Ben Hall and many more excellent reporters have provided our audience. Tragically, two of our journalists were killed in Kyiv and Ben Hall remains in treatment for his serious injuries. Our thoughts and the thoughts of the whole FOX family are with them and their families.  With that, I'll hand over to Steve. Thank you very much, Steve. As you know, we usually, after Steve's comments, we go straight to Joe and start the questions. But we have a breaking news, which I am in the spirit of being always open and giving our investors and our shareholders the latest news in the company. I'll go straight to this. I mean, literally, this is happening in real-time. We are pleased to announce that immediately following his playing career, whenever that may be, seven-time Super Bowl winner Tom Brady will be joining us at FOX Sports as our lead analyst. Over the course of this long-term agreement, Tom will not only call our biggest NFL games with Kevin Burkhart, but will also serve as an ambassador for us, particularly with the client and promotional initiatives.  We are delighted that Tom has committed to joining the FOX team, and we wish him all the best during this upcoming season. I am sure everyone joins me in warmly welcoming Tom Brady on board. Thank you very much. And with that, I'll hand over to Joe Thank you, very much, Ben. Look, I can tell you on the first part of your question that, like I said, we're incredibly excited to have Tom joining us. It's entirely up to him for when he chooses to retire and move into his, what will be exciting and stellar sort of television career, but that's up to him to make that choice when he sees fit. In regards to Tubi and the upfronts and how that plays into sort of how we position the Tubi business going forward and to when it returns to profitability, it's important to note that on Monday, when we are engaged in our upfront presentations, we've already spent several weeks engaging with clients and advertisers on upfront negotiations and Tubi has been at the forefront of all of those conversations.  I think our clients can see both the shift to AVOD and the streaming advertising. At the same time, they see the strength of where Tubi is positioned as a leader in that market. And then we're constantly on a regular sort of daily basis, balancing carefully the ad load in Tubi and the fill rate of that \u2013 of those advertising slots.  And as you know, Tubi has an incredibly intelligent ad tech that can do that dynamically viewer-to-viewer, customer-to-customer. We can dial that up or dial it down really as we see fit, but we think it's important that this early life cycle of advertising video-on-demand services to maintain the highest sort of quality viewer experience and kind of consumer experience on the service. So we're pleased with where that is. But really, it would be up to us to be able to increase that ad load and drive revenue and bring it back to profitability, which, as you know, Tubi has been profitable in past quarters. But as of today, the right strategy and the right way forward is to continue to carefully and deliberately invest in the growth of Tubi, which I am \u2013 which we think is going to really be the leader in advertising video-on-demand certainly in this country. Sure. Thank you, Jessica. I am not sure if there was two questions or seven, but they are always good questions. So, thank you very much. On the outlook, so I think I'll remember to advertise \u2013 to answer most of them as I go through this answer, but from a advertising perspective and particularly heading into these upfront negotiations, we're already in the upfront season, but as we get to the pointy end of that that season, we're seeing really solid demand across our businesses. In pricing, entertainments seeing pricing in the sort of high-single-digit, mid to high-single-digit sort of range above last year. But in Sports News, as you said, we are very well positioned. We are seeing sort of our pricing in sort of mid-double digits. So sort of the mid- to high teens pricing increase is driven by demand across some live sports and live news. So, as we \u2013 that gives us a great deal of confidence as we move into these upfront negotiations. You add to that, obviously, the inclusion of Tubi with 50% growth in DVT time and engagement. It's a really strong position to be in. Our sports properties are driving and that our must-have sports tent poles this year are really driving a lot of interest from our clients. If I could give one word of advice, which I wouldn't do, but if I can give one word of advice to our clients and advertising partners, it's getting in early because these \u2013 some of these key events are selling extremely well already. So, we fully expect to see sort of continued advertising strength. That's without even talking about the mid-term election cycle, which by all estimates will be a record mid-term cycle for us. We keep a close eye on the races in all of our markets and it's pretty amazing to see where we have not only tight races, but also contested primaries pretty much across the majority of our owned and owned stations. So, we think the coming mid-term elections will be \u2013 will really be an advertising boon for us, as well Moving on to Pay TV pricing, well, from \u2013 frankly, from both an advertising point of view, which is incredibly strong with the strength of FOX News, and I spoke about it a little bit in my in my earlier statements, the strength of FOX News, but also the strength of FOX News and the station group from our retransmission and distribution revenue point of view really has never been stronger.  FOX News is effectively competing with the free-to-air broadcasters in terms of audiences. It's actually usually beating, many nights of the week sort of beating broadcast networks and we expect our pricing power to continue to strengthen with performance like that. So, yes, I think I've answered most of, if not all of your questions, Jessica. But in short from both from an advertising perspective and from a television distribution or retransmission revenue perspective, we think we're well positioned, particularly in a year or a cycle where we're coming up to, I think, over the next two years, two-thirds of our distribution revenue coming up for renewals. So, hey, Robert, how are you? The \u2013 one of the pieces of work that the entertainment network has sort of undertook over last year, but it's our \u2013 it's earlier than that is really the ability to kind of transform that business to where it can tightly control its programming costs in a way that really has them at a level that really hasn't been achievable before.  This goes to the acquisition a few years ago of Bento Box, so we can control more of our animation costs. It goes to the acquisition of TMZ, so we can really control, sort of high-quality factual content and specials that we put on the network and other things such as MarVista. MarVista is focused a bit more on Tubi.  So the work in the background of being able to own and control, I should also mention, by the way, I apologize for not, very importantly, the joint venture with Gordon Ramsay Productions, that's incredibly exciting.  Gordon has been a key partner of ours for many, many years and his plans for the growth of that business, not just in the U.S., but what we can do with the IP, Gordon Ramsay's IP around the world is really exciting to see. So we have high expectations for that partnership. So all of that really feeds into the network's really ability to control its programming across multiple lots. As you know, the FOX network is only two hours a night in primetime, and so it's an easier volume of hours to digest and the program towards. What was the last part of the question? You can stay more pleased. Steve is very careful. Thank you very much, Doug. So look, we see the level of investment this year in our digital properties, and that's Tubi, but it also includes FOX Weather and FOX Nation and some other smaller \u2013 small elements. We see the current level of investment at the appropriate level, going forward. So that's in that that we've guided the market between $200 million and $300 million that we're putting back into investing, into growing those businesses.  And we would not expect any kind of significant level above that on sort of our current plans. And we think that level is a right amount, particularly with an asset like Tubi that there really is really going to be the future of how people watch television in this country. We think, when you look at Tubi, it's interesting, I looked this up the other day.  But Farhad really began Tubi or the early version of what ultimately became Tubi with an ad tech business over 11 or 12 years ago. And that ultimately evolved into Tubi as he understood the value of taking his intelligent ad tech business and then \u2013 and actually licensing programming along with that to monetize that programming most efficiently.  And as I said before, it's great to have the Tubi team as a company really focused on the technology side of this business and understand how they drive engagement and drive viewing, which is very different from what an older sort of media model or viewer of it would be. So, because of that and because of the long track record, the lead time they have, the fact that they've been doing this a long time, we think it's really poised to continue to win in the market and that level of investment is the right level to help it as you've been. Thanks very much Steven. So, in terms of our sports wagering strategy and business, we are \u2013 we remain in arbitration. And we expect in the summer that that arbitration to be resolved if not sooner and there is not much more we can say about it. But it's been, as you know, a long and sometimes arduous process. But the most important thing to remember, I suppose is the value of the business that we've created and the value of that sort of top of the funnel with FOX Bet.  Super 6 in particular, a free game with $6.6 million, I believe, now and we're in a traditionally, a quiet period for sports rate and particularly around, obviously, with no football. And so, the FOX Bet businesses continue to do incredibly well and continues to be able to drive wagering customers into paying games. So, we're incredibly pleased with how we've delivered operationally on our side of the partnership. So we look forward to the end of arbitration and moving forward with our wagering strategy. In terms of sports rights and whether we would \u2013 whether they remain on linear, our own sort of owned sort of linear platforms, absolutely. We think that our key rights deserve the right, the ability to stay on our broadcast and cable networks exclusively. This is very important to us. It both gives our league partners the most breadth and reach that they can achieve in viewership for their fans, but also it's really key to our distribution strategy.  It's how we will deliver industry-leading distribution revenue gains by keeping the highest quality exclusive content within our platforms, as I said, exclusively. And sub-licensing those to others or to put behind a struggling payroll would not be the right strategy."

            "name": "Steve Tomsic",
            "content": "Thank you, Lachlan, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results once again reflect the strength of our leadership brands and the continued growth of our digital businesses. We achieved total company revenue growth of 7% year-over-year delivering top-line growth across all of our operating for the fourth consecutive quarter.  Total company affiliate revenues increased 5% despite the fact that only 5% of our total company distribution revenues have been up for renewal this fiscal year. Meanwhile, the rate of industry subscriber declines remained steady in the quarter with trailing 12-month sub losses running below 5%. Total company advertising revenues grew 9% as our leadership brands once again delivered premium pricing, coupled with continued strong momentum at Tubi. Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $811 million, down 10% over the comparative period last year as the revenue growth was more than offset by higher expenses.  As we've foreshadowed on prior calls, the increase in expenses was mainly driven by the anticipated increase in digital investments including FOX News Media and Tubi. Additionally, we saw high programming rights amortization and production cost at FOX Sports and we're impacted by an approximately $30 million write-down of certain scripted programming at FOX Entertainment. Net Income attributable to stockholders was $283 million or $0.50 per share compared to the $567 million or $0.96 per share we reported in the prior year quarter. As we have seen in recent quarters, this below the line variance was primarily due to the change in fair value of the company's investment in Flutter which we recognized in Other net. Excluding this impact and other non-core items, adjusted EPS was $0.81 per share, compared to last year's $0.88, primarily reflecting the movement in EBITDA. Now let's turn to our business segment results starting with Cable Networks, which reported an 8% in revenues. The strong revenue delivery was underpinned by significant gains in cable advertising revenues which grew 20% in the quarter.  Notwithstanding slightly higher levels of preemptions associated with our breaking news coverage of the war in Ukraine, FOX News was the engine of this advertising revenue growth with strong gains in both audience and pricing.  Cable affiliate revenues increased 3% over the prior year period, a result of healthy pricing gains across all of our networks. Cable other revenues increased 23%, led by the timing of sports sub-licensing revenues which were impacted by COVID last year, as well as continued subscription momentum at FOX Nation. This growth was partially offset by the disposition of our sports marketing businesses, which was sold in March of last year. EBITDA at our Cable segment increased by $14 million over the prior year period as these revenue increases were partially offset by higher expenses related to the digital investments of FOX News Media and the timing of programming amortization and production costs at the Cable Sports Networks following the COVID-related disruptions of the prior year Almost matching the strong revenue growth in cable, our Television segment delivered a 7% increase in revenue. This was led by an 8% increase in television affiliate revenues over the prior year quarter, reflecting increases for both our direct retransmission revenues at our owned and operated stations and for our programming fees from non-owned station affiliates.  This runrate orbit assures achievement of our target of $1 billion of incremental television affiliate revenue this calendar year that we announced at our Investor Day back in 2019. Our Television segment also delivered 6% advertising revenue growth, reflecting strong linear pricing at the FOX Network and continued growth at Tubi, partially offset by lower impressions of FOX Entertainment.  At FOX Sports, the impact of the additional week to the NFL regular season was offset by the absence of the rotating NFL divisional playoff game this year. And at the FOX Television stations, notwithstanding the ongoing supply chain-related challenges to the auto category, we continued to grow advertising revenues supported by gains from our digital sales efforts and continued demand from the sports betting category. Other revenues at our Television segment increased 17%, primarily due to the impact of the acquisitions of MarVista Entertainment and TMZ and the consolidation of our stake in Studio Ramsay Global. Television EBITDA was lower by $100 million against the prior year period, as its healthy revenue growth was more than offset by the planned digital investment at Tubi, higher sports programming amortization and production costs at FOX Sports and an approximately $30 million write-down of certain scripted programming at FOX Entertainment. Turning now to cash flow, we generated strong free cash flow of $1.54 billion in the quarter, reflecting our normal seasonal cycle of collecting advertising revenues from our old programming and the result of our sports rights payments being concentrated in the first half of our fiscal year.  Our share repurchases since the commencement of the quarter have totaled $300 million and fiscal year-to-date, we have now returned over $1 billion of capital to shareholders. This is comprised of approximately $275 million in the form of our semi-annual dividend payments and a further $800 million in share buybacks. We remain committed to utilizing our full buyback authorization of $4 billion and have now cumulatively repurchased approximately $2.4 billion, representing over 11% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in November 2019. We continue to maintain a very strong balance sheet, ending the quarter with $4.6 billion in cash and $7.2 billion in debt. So as we look forward, the setup for fiscal 2023 remains incredibly strong with the financial tailwinds from Super Bowl 57, the early exit of Thursday Night Football, November's mid-term elections and the start of our next major distribution renewal cycle. So with that, I'll now turn the call back to Lachlan. Yes. So, Robert, just in terms of the swing factors, listen, there's a ton of tailwind behind the TV segment going into next year. So you called out Tuesday night football dropping off. So that, I think we've said in the past, that release is around $350 million to $400 million to the bottom-line for us, net-net-net. But then you've got all the other things that play into next year for us.  So you've got Super Bowl, political, and you've got the FIFA World Cup, and then you've got Tubi with the momentum that's showing top-line. So, we couldn't be better positioned for fiscal 2023 from a Television segment perspective."

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Chief Investor Relations Officer, Mr. Joe Dorrego. Please go ahead, sir.\nJoe Dorrego: Thank you, Operator. Good morning and welcome to our fiscal 2022 second quarter earnings call. Joining me on the call today are Lachlan Murdoch, Executive Chair and Chief Executive Officer; John Nallen, Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Tomsic, our Chief Financial Officer. First, Lachlan and Steve will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter, and then we'll take questions from the investment community. Please note that this call may include forward-looking statements regarding Fox Corporation's financial performance and operating results. These statements are based on management's current expectations and actual results could differ from what is stated as a result of certain factors identified on today's call, and in the Company's SEC filings. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA or EBITDA as we referred to it on this call. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and our SEC filings, which are available in the Investor Relations section of our Web site. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Lachlan.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to be with you today to discuss another really, truly remarkable quarter for Fox Corporation. In our fiscal second quarter, we delivered 9% revenue growth and 2% EBITDA growth, even while continuing to invest in our digital initiatives. These results demonstrate our ability to expand our emerging digital businesses, while focusing on delivering overall growth for our shareholders. This strategy has been unwavering and disciplined, and we have not been convinced to deviate into areas where we cannot be a leader. Our financial results in the quarter benefited from healthy affiliate revenue growth, and what continues to be, at least for FOX, a robust advertising marketplace. Our advertising revenue grew 6% versus the prior year quarter, which is notable when you consider that last year included a record net political advertising revenue of nearly $250 million. From a national advertising sales perspective, we have seen robust CPM growth and broad-based demand across most advertiser categories. This is clear evidence that our portfolio of leadership brands, which over index in sports and news continues to deliver the live audiences at scale that our advertising partners seek. To understand the scale of our reach across the U.S., you only need to look to our NFC Championship game a week ago where at peak, we had 55 million viewers tuned into the game. The overall market trends and local advertising also remain positive for us, as we achieved double-digit base advertising revenue growth in the quarter when excluding political revenue. Perhaps even more important to note, our local advertising revenues have now fully recovered from the impact of COVID and are up over pre-pandemic levels. While we continue to see softness in the local automotive category caused by the ongoing supply chain delays, this has been more than offset by growth in nearly all other categories, led by sports betting. We have already written over 50% more local sports betting revenue at this point of the fiscal year than we did across all at fiscal '21. We have seen the same local trends continuing thus far into the third quarter. Overall, our operating businesses are performing well, underscoring our unique strategy and differentiated position. Let me touch on some of the highlights. The FOX News Channel celebrated its 25th anniversary this past October by reinforcing its exceptional ratings leadership. On the same call last year, we were fielding questions about whether FOX News had peaked. For the 20th consecutive year, FOX News is the leader in cable news across the board in total viewers and the 25 to 54 demographic for both total day and primetime. Calendar '21 also marked the 6th consecutive year FOX News led all of basic cable in total day and primetime viewership. FOX News leads by wide margin, commanding a 55% share of total day cable news viewership this past quarter. FOX News's share of the younger demographic was even higher at 57%, marking its second highest quarterly share of the younger demo on record. FOX News's audience was also the most politically diverse with more Independents and Democrats tuning into the network than to our competitors. Our unmatched programming lineup continues to drive these great ratings results and bring a blue-chip roster of advertisers to the channel and its digital extensions. For example, in the aggregate across all of cable news, this past quarter FOX News delivered 14 of the top 15 programs. We simply could not be better placed as we look forward to the mid-term election cycle later this year. Meanwhile, the momentum continued at FOX Nation, which increased its net subscribers in the quarter by over 30% versus the September quarter, supported by strong fresh content to help drive higher subscriber numbers and very low churn. Additionally, FOX Weather, which is breaking through a crowded field of established incumbents is off to a great start. And its growth will continue in the current quarter as we expand the distribution of the FOX Weather live video streams across multiple platforms, including YouTube TV, Amazon news, Roku and Fubo. At FOX Sports, we also had a strong quarter led by our NFL and College Football coverage. Over the last 12 months, FOX Sports had more telecasts across the top 100 programs than any other network, let alone any other network sports division. And of the total minutes of NFL and College Football that Americans watch during the 2021 regular season, about a third were viewed on FOX. I commented on the postseason a moment ago, and by any measure, it was a great series of games for us and for the NFL. Audiences and advertisers embrace the postseason, which kept a record setting revenue full season for us at FOX and a non-Superbowl year. Demonstrating that growth and the demand, we had 21 advertisers placed in this year's NFC Championship game that were not present a year ago. The results from this season underscore the value and importance of our long-term partnership with the NFL, that will continue for at least the next 12 years. College Football, an equally impressive results. FOX's BIG NOON SATURDAY window grew by 15% over to an order [ph] 2019 season, and with an average viewership of over 5.8 million has become the number one window in all of College Football. To put the success of our College Football strategy in a proper context, in 2016 FOX's last season, prior to having the Big Ten rights, our share of College Football viewership was just 7%. Today, we have grown this threefold to a 22% share. We continue to leverage our leading sports franchises into adjacent opportunities and are pleased with progress at FOX Sports Super 6, which ended the year with more than 6 million users, up more than 20% over the prior year. In addition, this coming April, we will launch the USFL, a new innovative spring football league, which FOX will control. And again, our strategy to invest in our flagship brands and serve our loyal audiences has enabled us to realize new and exciting digital growth opportunities, and nowhere is this more apparent than at Tubi. While some companies are focused on multibillion dollar content investments in search of streaming subscription growth, to be continued its unrelenting focus on advertising video on demand with a strategic and measured investment approach. This approach has yielded solid momentum across all key revenue and performance indicators. Q2 represented to be the best performing quarter ever, and December its best performing month in the quarter alone to be achieved 54 of its top 100 revenue days, 55 of its top 100 Viewer days, and 50 of its top 100 total view time, or TVT days. Tubi exceeded 3.6 billion hours streamed in calendar 2021, marking a 40% increase in TVT over the prior year, due in large part to the breadth of its library, now at more than 41,000 titles, a quickly expanding linear news and sports offering with more than 100 channels, it's high return on investment in licensed content and original releases and its world-class technology. We chose to acquire and now operate Tubi with a single goal of winning in AVOD. There are no competing priorities internally, and no revenue transfer from other assets in our portfolio. That is to say, Tubi revenue is truly incremental to us. As Steve will discuss in a moment, our focus portfolio of leadership assets and emerging digital businesses is delivering consistent growth in a thoughtful and disciplined manner. Taken as a whole, we have the most valuable news franchise in the country, if not the world, the leading live sports franchise, and a top broadcast network reinforced by a strategic portfolio of local stations, all of which have digital extensions to their businesses. And in the 3 years since we formed Fox Corporation, we have used this collective platform to develop a rapidly growing Eva streaming business and create optionality within the sports betting ecosystem. We feel we are in a strong position and could not be more excited for the months ahead as we prepare for what should be an active and exceptional fiscal 2023 for FOX. With that, I will turn it over to Steve to take you through the quarter in more detail.\nSteve Tomsic: Thanks, Lachlan, and good morning, everyone. We delivered another strong quarter with total company revenues growing 9% year-over-year, once again highlighted by revenue growth across all of our operating segments. Total company affiliate revenues grew 11% against the prior quarter, reflecting healthy increases with the FOX Cable Networks and Television segments. The rate of subscriber declines held steady in the quarter with trailing 12-month industry sub losses continuing to run below 5%. Notwithstanding the tough comparison against our record political advertising revenues in the prior quarter, our total company advertising revenues grew by 6%. As Lachlan mentioned, we've benefited from the premium pricing our core brands were able to extract from a healthy marketplace, continued growth at Tubi and a full season of College Football following the disruptions caused by COVID in the prior year. Taking a step back from the comparability challenges versus fiscal '21, FOX's total advertising revenues are now running a healthy 12% ahead of Q2 fiscal '20, which was pre-COVID and unaffected by political advertising revenues. This is before taking into account the contribution of Tubi to our current day advertising revenues, which take the reported growth rate up to 20%. Meanwhile, total company other revenues increased 20% supported by full College Football season that drove higher sports sublicensing revenues at the Cable segment, following the disruptions caused by COVID last year. Adjusted EBITDA increased 2% to $310 million, as the revenue increases were partially offset by higher operating expenses associated with normalized sports and entertainment programming schedules, contractual sports rights escalators, and the digital investments we quote out on previous calls at FOX News Media and Tubi. The net loss attributable to stockholders of $85 million or $0.15 per share varies from the net income attributable to stockholders of $224 million or $0.37 per share in the prior year quarter, primarily due to the change in fair value of the company's investments in Flutter, which we recognize another net. Excluding the impact of this and other non-core items, adjusted EPS of $0.13 in the current year quarter was down modestly when compared to the $0.16 reported in the prior quarter, primarily due to the high depreciation and amortization, resulting from our new broadcast facility coming online late last fiscal year. Now let's turn to our business segment results, beginning with Cable Networks. Cable revenues increased 10% year-over-year with 12% growth in cable affiliate revenues. As a reminder, the reported 12% growth includes the impact of distribution credits we accrued for last year as a result of cancelled College Football games due to COVID. Excluding the impact of the distribution credits, underlying cable affiliate revenues increased low single digits in the December quarter, reflecting contractual pricing gains across our portfolio of networks, even without the benefit of any meaningful renewals this year. Cable advertising revenues grew 3%, primarily as a result of continued pricing strength across the portfolio, led by FOX News Media and additional MLB playoff games at the National Sports Networks. Despite the difficult comparison to last year's election cycle, FOX News Media actually expanded its linear advertising revenues in the quarter, a testament to the clear leadership position of the channel. Cable other revenues increased by $26 million led by higher sports sublicensing revenues, which were impacted by COVID last year, as well as continued subscription momentum at FOX Nation. Cable EBITDA increased 17% over the prior year, reflecting healthy revenue growth, partially offset by higher programming costs associated with contractual rights escalators and normalized schedules at the National Sports Networks. We also increased our digital investment at FOX News Media, including expanded programming and marketing at FOX Nation and the launch of FOX Weather. At Television we delivered 8% revenue growth in the quarter. This was led by a 10% increase in television affiliate revenues, reflecting double-digit rate increases for both our direct retransmission revenues at our owned and operated stations, and programming fees from non-owned station affiliates. We also delivered advertising revenue growth of 6% despite the absence of the record political advertising revenues we generated in the prior year. This growth reflects continued pricing strength at the FOX Network, where our FOX Sports lineup led by the NFL, College Football and the World Series delivered record Q2 advertising revenues for our network sports business. We also continue to see strong momentum at Tubi with revenues up by over 40% in the quarter, and a meaningful rebound in the base market at the FOX Television stations. As Lachlan mentioned, supply chain constraints had no real observable impact on our portfolio, with softness in the local [indiscernible] demand, more than offset by the growth in other categories, including sports betting. Television other revenues increased $31 million, primarily reflecting higher content revenues of FOX Entertainment as well as the acquisitions of MarVista and TMZ. EBITDA at our Television segment was down $88 million against the prior period, primarily as a result of higher programming costs associated with a normalized entertainment schedule, and sports price escalators at the FOX Network, and the planned ramp up of digital investment at Tubi. Turning now to free cash flow, where we recorded a deficit in the quarter of $753 million, which reflects the normal working capital cycle of the business with the concentration of payments for sports rights, and the buildup of advertising related receivables in the first half of our fiscal year. We continue to be active with respect to capital returns to our shareholders, with a further $300 million of additional buybacks since the start of the December quarter. We remain committed to utilizing our full buyback authorization of $4 billion, of which we have now cumulatively repurchased $2.15 billion, representing over 10% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in November 2019. From a balance sheet perspective, we finished the quarter with $4.26 billion in cash and $7.95 billion in debt. Subsequent to quarter end, we use cash on hand to repay a $750 million January bond to maturity. Our ability to deliver another successful quarter despite the continued uncertainty of COVID and difficult comparisons against the prior year political cycle, gives us confidence in the remainder of our fiscal '22. As previously discussed, with only approximately 5% of our total company affiliate revenues up for renewal this fiscal year, we expect affiliate revenue growth will moderate in the back half of the year. However, the demonstrated strength of our focus portfolio positions us well for our next major renewal cycle, which begins in fiscal '23 and where we have approximately 70% of our total company affiliate revenues due for renewal across fiscal '23 and '24. We plan to continue invest -- to invest in our digital assets given our success today. Now that we are at the midpoint of our fiscal year, we anticipate that these total net EBITDA and investment in our digital initiatives, along with the expected impact of the inaugural season of the USFL to land towards the lower end of the $200 million to $300 million range that we've previously outlined. As Lachlan mentioned, we anticipate a strong fiscal '23 with the financial tailwinds from Super Bowl 57, the early exit of Thursday Night Football, November's midterm elections and the start of our next major distribution renewal cycle. And with that, I'll hand it back to Joe.\nJoe Dorrego: Thank you, Steve. And now we'd be happy to take questions from the investment community.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Robert Fishman with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nRobert Fishman: Hi. Good morning. I've one or two quick ones on sports betting, if I can. As sports betting continues to be legalized across more states, can you just discuss how you're thinking about growing FOX Bet from here, while balancing the Flutter and FanDuel relationship? And then maybe if you can just expand on your prepared comments about the local advertising benefits as these states continue to be legalized, including maybe any early data after the January launch in New York. That'd be very helpful. Thank you.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks, Robert. So, obviously we're still -- engagements of our arbitration with -- really based around the structure of our option into FanDuel. So that -- and we expect that, that arbitration to sort of conclude through the middle of the calendar year, sort of in the summer, late summer. And we can't really say much more about that. But, overall, the operations of FOX Bet starting with -- as I talked a little bit about in my prepared comments, starting with FOX Bet Super 6, we've been incredibly pleased with our ability to drive our engagement with our sports viewers in FOX Sports, into FOX Bet Super 6 then ultimately into FOX Bet, where it's operational, it has been sort of proven as we continue to execute on that strategy. Our only frustration is that we've only been launched in four betting markets or four states, and obviously, we'd like to see that increase significantly as we roll out FOX Bet. Having said that on the other side -- on the other side of the ledger, in the traditional business in the local television stations, FOX Sports wagering revenue is our leading category of growth, and really is significantly driving the revenue increases across our station group, where wagering is legal. I think for the -- we're pacing up over 100% in the sports wagering category today. So, we're very pleased both on the FOX Bet side where we have operating betting businesses, but also on the advertising revenue side.\nJoe Dorrego: Thank you. Operator, we can go to the next question.\nOperator: We have a question from John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Great, thank you. Two quick ones. First on the -- could you give us a sense of where we are in the 200 million to 300 million in digital dilution for the year? I think you guys had said it would be more in the back end of the year. If you could give us a sense for where we are thus far would be great. And then any color you can give us on the recent licensing extension you guys did with Hulu, either magnitude or impact on the financials, or is there any more to come from that -- from [indiscernible] [2436] to expect?\nLachlan Murdoch: We're at the lower end of the range in the 200 million to 300 million, I'm going to let Steve answer that.\nSteve Tomsic: Yes. So, John, we said so far this halfway sort of approaching nine digits on that investment. So, we'd expect to have a little bit more back waded in the second half. But as I've sort of pointed out in the prepared remarks, I think, likely to be closer to 200 million and 300 million for the full year from a pricing perspective on those digital investments. Probably the most sort of the focus of that investment in the back half of the year will generally be around 2 weeks. So that's what you should expect to see that in the TV segment in the second half. And then in terms of Hulu Output deal, it's a good one, but it's relatively small. It's an Output deal for Hulu to stream out of season episodes of FOX unscripted and animated series. So, it's things like, I Can See Your Voice, The Masked Singer, The Masked Dancer, in case you missed that, and animated comedy from Bento Box HouseBroken. So, I think it's something we're very happy with and happy to continue our really positive relationship with Hulu. \nJoe Dorrego: Operator, we can go to the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thanks so much. Pretty healthy results this quarter. If I could ask a follow-up to the first question, it's going on 2 years since you started investing in sports wagering and Lachlan you mentioned optionality in sports betting in your prepared remarks. Under what circumstances would FOX increase its investment in sports betting? I mean, with $4.3 billion of cash in the balance sheet, right, I'm talking about increasing your investment by billions. So just as a follow-up to that first one, and then my question is regarding the upfront just curious, on your thoughts going into the upfront, I know you just said the ad market is strong. So, I'm sure you're feeling good. I'm curious, like how formerly integrated into ad sales is to be relative to FOX? And on the NFL, it was a good season for everybody. Others I think might have had a little bit better ratings growth than you do -- you had. Is that going to impact relative share when it comes to NFL advertising? So, anything on the up front would be helpful. Thanks so much.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks very much, Doug. So, on the first question, the way we look at sports betting is less about what always starts from a place and less about sort of investing in sports betting. And wagering and more about the value of our existing investment in sports broadcasting, right. When you have a business, which is the leading sports broadcasting business in this country, when you look at our new, 12-year agreement and deal with the NFL and the viewership that we know, we expect to be sort of guaranteed to engage with those fans for the next 12 years. We really think about what's the future monetization of that engagement with our viewers and sports fans. So that's where we begin. We already have a multibillion-dollar investment in engagement with sports fans. What will sports fans be doing with their time? What will they be doing with second screens? What will they be doing leading into a big sports weekend? Clearly as states open up to sports wagering, wagering is going to be a major part of that journey. And it's a part that we want to -- a journey, we want to embark with them, because we think it's a win-win, it'll make them more engaged, with us more engaged with their favorite teams, and ultimately watch more of FOX Sports. So, we see it as a win-win. So, when we think about that and when we look at the sports some sort of the wagering ecosystem, what we have already with our small ownership, but valuable ownership stakes in Flutter. When we look at our option into FanDuel and our joint venture in FOX Bet, and also critically, the top of the funnel, our very successful strategy with FOX Bet Super 6, we see ourselves continuing to improve and operate those and when the right opportunities emerge and come up to continue to invest in the space. On the -- Steve, do you want to add anything to that [multiple speakers]?\nSteve Tomsic: I think that in terms of deploying capital the optionality we have with the option structures gives us time to see how the markets develop their relationship with Flutter develops before we actually need to deploy that capital.\nLachlan Murdoch: Yes. Yes. And we are limited in structure to some extent because of the licensing rules. And I think I said in the last call, we're actively exploring, getting licensed, not to operate a book, but actually to potentially sort of maximize the value that we can capture in this space. So, it's something that we continue to explore. In terms of the upfront, as a -- as an overall comment, what you're seeing, I think across the marketplace is a softness in entertainment and scripted entertainment ratings, not just for us, but for all of the broadcasters. And you're seeing -- due to that softness, you're seeing major advertisers and marketers start to look at where they can capture their consumers in other places, and the -- where they're flowing to, where their dollars and marketing focus is moving towards, quite strongly is live news and live sport, and to a large extent digital, which we're utilizing to be extraordinarily well. So, when we think about the [indiscernible], when we think about that -- sort of selling season, it's early May, we leave the upfront. But between now and then we're having a majority of our conversations and with our partners will be selling as I think others will our entire portfolio of asset. So, we'll be selling the entertainment network, news, sports and Tubi in a very integrated fashion, really designed to capture our marketing partner serve money and the advertising dollars in the most efficient way. And I think we are uniquely positioned because of our leadership across new sports and digital with Tubi.\nJoe Dorrego: Operator, we can go to the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with BofA Securities. Please go ahead.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Hi, everybody. I have two questions. First on USFL. Can you give us some color on your rollout the cost, your partners like what will it look like over the next couple of years? And the second question is as great as the second quarter is or was, fiscal '23 looks even better. I mean, you've got clearly strong advertising with the Super Bowl political, Tubi is growing. You said you're going to renew affiliate cycle beginning next year, sports betting is growing and hopefully there'll be more states coming on. So, as the offset like digital investment peak this year or just peak next year? Are there other things we should be thinking about? Thanks.\nLachlan Murdoch: I don't know if I can -- hi, Jessica. I don't know if I can answer the second question as well as you did in your -- in the question. So, let me start with that. I think we are looking forward to fiscal '23. We have, I think over the 2 years, we have two-thirds of our affiliate renewals up obviously with the lesser or -- the smaller renewals we've had this year are setting a tremendous benchmark for what we expect coming in renewables over the next couple of years. So, we advertising revenue with the political cycle, we expect to hit new records. I think 4 years ago we did $180 million worth of political advertising. I think we will easily number on it, but I think we can't -- it would be a guess, but I think we'll easily exceed that and break new records in this mid-term election. So, we are well-positioned I think for a tremendous victory. I don't -- can't remember if you also mentioned it in your question, but obviously Thursday Night Football was a -- an investment for us and with releasing Thursday Night Football for Amazon, I think they'll do a great job with it. But obviously there's a savings -- a significant savings there for us not having Thursday Night Football. So, we are -- we had a great quarter, great year this year. I think next year will be even better. On the USFL, we are very much looking forward to the new league. I've got actually compliment the NFL for being great partners and for helping us think through how we structure the USFL. The rules of the play is closer to NFL than the College Football where we've changed the rules slightly, it really been for Television, and for -- and so to make the game as exciting and as close the matches as possible. So, we're very excited for launching the USFL. It's always something of a league that we will control. We control the digital rights, we control every part of the game. With us and NBC as broadcasters, we think it has the best opportunity for a broad platform and the most viewers at launch. We've -- by bringing in outside investors into the league, we've effectively underwritten the investment in the USFL I think for the next 2 or 3 years at least. So, from a risk perspective, I know I think we've done it in a ambitious, but disciplined way. So, anything else?\nSteve Tomsic: So, Jessica, as I've mentioned in the remarks, within the $200 million to $300 million that we called out the year, USFL will be part of that and it'll be a sort of low to mid tens of millions of dollars EBITDA negative for us this year.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thank you.\nJoe Dorrego: Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. That question will come from the line of Michael Morris with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.\nMichael Morris: Thank you. Good morning. Two questions for me. First, a bit more strategic, Lachlan. Do you see a path to perhaps a superfan streaming sports business that could complement the linear service that you have that features your Marquee games? Maybe something similar to ESPN with ESPN Plus, is that an approach that you would consider taking? Or do you feel it's already sort of an overdeveloped, or another reason not to do something like that? And then my second question, a bit more tactical, maybe looking at the TV segment, I believe last spring, you guys size the EBITDA drag from Thursday Night Football in the range of sort of $350 million to $400 million. Curious any updated thoughts on that estimate? How that savings may be redeployed versus falling to the bottom line in the near-term? And I guess bigger picture, I know that will go into the reup Sunday contract going forward. But you also have the renewal cycle coming. So, I guess maybe just thinking long-term, how do you expect that savings to impact the business? Thanks.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thank you, Michael. So, I'll let Steve answer the second question on the savings. But as regards to first question, we are today, this morning focused very much on broadcast television, and how we monetize our investment in sports and our sports partnerships, is really fundamentally through our partnerships with cable operators, satellite TV operators, and our local affiliates. And so, from a live sports broadcasting perspective, and it's different with some obviously, pinion [ph] and sort of shoulder programming, but from a live sports perspective, we see -- we continue to see the best way to monetize our investment in sports is clearly through our partnerships with our affiliates and our distributors. So that's our focus today. I'll let Steve answer the savings question.\nSteve Tomsic: Yes, Mike, so the $350 million to $400 million still a good number for us for next year in terms of net EBITA impact of losing Thursday Night Football, that includes the reinvestment in the slot. So, whatever we decide to put into that time, time slot in the schedule is in that $350 million to $400 million. So, it's a net to us, a net good guide to us next year. Obviously, part of that gets absorbed the following year with the increased [indiscernible], the new NFL contract. But all other things being equal, you should see that $350 million to $400 million flow to the bottom-line next year.\nJoe Dorrego: At this point, we're out of time. But if you have any further questions, please give me or Dan Carey a call. Thank you once again for joining today's call.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks, everyone.\nSteve Tomsic: Thank you.\nLachlan Murdoch: Take care. Bye.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. We thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Lachlan Murdoch",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to be with you today to discuss another really, truly remarkable quarter for Fox Corporation. In our fiscal second quarter, we delivered 9% revenue growth and 2% EBITDA growth, even while continuing to invest in our digital initiatives. These results demonstrate our ability to expand our emerging digital businesses, while focusing on delivering overall growth for our shareholders. This strategy has been unwavering and disciplined, and we have not been convinced to deviate into areas where we cannot be a leader. Our financial results in the quarter benefited from healthy affiliate revenue growth, and what continues to be, at least for FOX, a robust advertising marketplace. Our advertising revenue grew 6% versus the prior year quarter, which is notable when you consider that last year included a record net political advertising revenue of nearly $250 million. From a national advertising sales perspective, we have seen robust CPM growth and broad-based demand across most advertiser categories. This is clear evidence that our portfolio of leadership brands, which over index in sports and news continues to deliver the live audiences at scale that our advertising partners seek. To understand the scale of our reach across the U.S., you only need to look to our NFC Championship game a week ago where at peak, we had 55 million viewers tuned into the game. The overall market trends and local advertising also remain positive for us, as we achieved double-digit base advertising revenue growth in the quarter when excluding political revenue. Perhaps even more important to note, our local advertising revenues have now fully recovered from the impact of COVID and are up over pre-pandemic levels. While we continue to see softness in the local automotive category caused by the ongoing supply chain delays, this has been more than offset by growth in nearly all other categories, led by sports betting. We have already written over 50% more local sports betting revenue at this point of the fiscal year than we did across all at fiscal '21. We have seen the same local trends continuing thus far into the third quarter. Overall, our operating businesses are performing well, underscoring our unique strategy and differentiated position. Let me touch on some of the highlights. The FOX News Channel celebrated its 25th anniversary this past October by reinforcing its exceptional ratings leadership. On the same call last year, we were fielding questions about whether FOX News had peaked. For the 20th consecutive year, FOX News is the leader in cable news across the board in total viewers and the 25 to 54 demographic for both total day and primetime. Calendar '21 also marked the 6th consecutive year FOX News led all of basic cable in total day and primetime viewership. FOX News leads by wide margin, commanding a 55% share of total day cable news viewership this past quarter. FOX News's share of the younger demographic was even higher at 57%, marking its second highest quarterly share of the younger demo on record. FOX News's audience was also the most politically diverse with more Independents and Democrats tuning into the network than to our competitors. Our unmatched programming lineup continues to drive these great ratings results and bring a blue-chip roster of advertisers to the channel and its digital extensions. For example, in the aggregate across all of cable news, this past quarter FOX News delivered 14 of the top 15 programs. We simply could not be better placed as we look forward to the mid-term election cycle later this year. Meanwhile, the momentum continued at FOX Nation, which increased its net subscribers in the quarter by over 30% versus the September quarter, supported by strong fresh content to help drive higher subscriber numbers and very low churn. Additionally, FOX Weather, which is breaking through a crowded field of established incumbents is off to a great start. And its growth will continue in the current quarter as we expand the distribution of the FOX Weather live video streams across multiple platforms, including YouTube TV, Amazon news, Roku and Fubo. At FOX Sports, we also had a strong quarter led by our NFL and College Football coverage. Over the last 12 months, FOX Sports had more telecasts across the top 100 programs than any other network, let alone any other network sports division. And of the total minutes of NFL and College Football that Americans watch during the 2021 regular season, about a third were viewed on FOX. I commented on the postseason a moment ago, and by any measure, it was a great series of games for us and for the NFL. Audiences and advertisers embrace the postseason, which kept a record setting revenue full season for us at FOX and a non-Superbowl year. Demonstrating that growth and the demand, we had 21 advertisers placed in this year's NFC Championship game that were not present a year ago. The results from this season underscore the value and importance of our long-term partnership with the NFL, that will continue for at least the next 12 years. College Football, an equally impressive results. FOX's BIG NOON SATURDAY window grew by 15% over to an order [ph] 2019 season, and with an average viewership of over 5.8 million has become the number one window in all of College Football. To put the success of our College Football strategy in a proper context, in 2016 FOX's last season, prior to having the Big Ten rights, our share of College Football viewership was just 7%. Today, we have grown this threefold to a 22% share. We continue to leverage our leading sports franchises into adjacent opportunities and are pleased with progress at FOX Sports Super 6, which ended the year with more than 6 million users, up more than 20% over the prior year. In addition, this coming April, we will launch the USFL, a new innovative spring football league, which FOX will control. And again, our strategy to invest in our flagship brands and serve our loyal audiences has enabled us to realize new and exciting digital growth opportunities, and nowhere is this more apparent than at Tubi. While some companies are focused on multibillion dollar content investments in search of streaming subscription growth, to be continued its unrelenting focus on advertising video on demand with a strategic and measured investment approach. This approach has yielded solid momentum across all key revenue and performance indicators. Q2 represented to be the best performing quarter ever, and December its best performing month in the quarter alone to be achieved 54 of its top 100 revenue days, 55 of its top 100 Viewer days, and 50 of its top 100 total view time, or TVT days. Tubi exceeded 3.6 billion hours streamed in calendar 2021, marking a 40% increase in TVT over the prior year, due in large part to the breadth of its library, now at more than 41,000 titles, a quickly expanding linear news and sports offering with more than 100 channels, it's high return on investment in licensed content and original releases and its world-class technology. We chose to acquire and now operate Tubi with a single goal of winning in AVOD. There are no competing priorities internally, and no revenue transfer from other assets in our portfolio. That is to say, Tubi revenue is truly incremental to us. As Steve will discuss in a moment, our focus portfolio of leadership assets and emerging digital businesses is delivering consistent growth in a thoughtful and disciplined manner. Taken as a whole, we have the most valuable news franchise in the country, if not the world, the leading live sports franchise, and a top broadcast network reinforced by a strategic portfolio of local stations, all of which have digital extensions to their businesses. And in the 3 years since we formed Fox Corporation, we have used this collective platform to develop a rapidly growing Eva streaming business and create optionality within the sports betting ecosystem. We feel we are in a strong position and could not be more excited for the months ahead as we prepare for what should be an active and exceptional fiscal 2023 for FOX. With that, I will turn it over to Steve to take you through the quarter in more detail. Thanks, Robert. So, obviously we're still -- engagements of our arbitration with -- really based around the structure of our option into FanDuel. So that -- and we expect that, that arbitration to sort of conclude through the middle of the calendar year, sort of in the summer, late summer. And we can't really say much more about that. But, overall, the operations of FOX Bet starting with -- as I talked a little bit about in my prepared comments, starting with FOX Bet Super 6, we've been incredibly pleased with our ability to drive our engagement with our sports viewers in FOX Sports, into FOX Bet Super 6 then ultimately into FOX Bet, where it's operational, it has been sort of proven as we continue to execute on that strategy. Our only frustration is that we've only been launched in four betting markets or four states, and obviously, we'd like to see that increase significantly as we roll out FOX Bet. Having said that on the other side -- on the other side of the ledger, in the traditional business in the local television stations, FOX Sports wagering revenue is our leading category of growth, and really is significantly driving the revenue increases across our station group, where wagering is legal. I think for the -- we're pacing up over 100% in the sports wagering category today. So, we're very pleased both on the FOX Bet side where we have operating betting businesses, but also on the advertising revenue side. We're at the lower end of the range in the 200 million to 300 million, I'm going to let Steve answer that. Thanks very much, Doug. So, on the first question, the way we look at sports betting is less about what always starts from a place and less about sort of investing in sports betting. And wagering and more about the value of our existing investment in sports broadcasting, right. When you have a business, which is the leading sports broadcasting business in this country, when you look at our new, 12-year agreement and deal with the NFL and the viewership that we know, we expect to be sort of guaranteed to engage with those fans for the next 12 years.

We already have a multibillion-dollar investment in engagement with sports fans. What will sports fans be doing with their time? What will they be doing with second screens? What will they be doing leading into a big sports weekend? Clearly as states open up to sports wagering, wagering is going to be a major part of that journey. And it's a part that we want to -- a journey, we want to embark with them, because we think it's a win-win, it'll make them more engaged, with us more engaged with their favorite teams, and ultimately watch more of FOX Sports. So, we see it as a win-win. So, when we think about that and when we look at the sports some sort of the wagering ecosystem, what we have already with our small ownership, but valuable ownership stakes in Flutter. When we look at our option into FanDuel and our joint venture in FOX Bet, and also critically, the top of the funnel, our very successful strategy with FOX Bet Super 6, we see ourselves continuing to improve and operate those and when the right opportunities emerge and come up to continue to invest in the space. On the -- Steve, do you want to add anything to that [multiple speakers]? Yes. Yes. And we are limited in structure to some extent because of the licensing rules. And I think I said in the last call, we're actively exploring, getting licensed, not to operate a book, but actually to potentially sort of maximize the value that we can capture in this space. So, it's something that we continue to explore. In terms of the upfront, as a -- as an overall comment, what you're seeing, I think across the marketplace is a softness in entertainment and scripted entertainment ratings, not just for us, but for all of the broadcasters. And you're seeing -- due to that softness, you're seeing major advertisers and marketers start to look at where they can capture their consumers in other places, and the -- where they're flowing to, where their dollars and marketing focus is moving towards, quite strongly is live news and live sport, and to a large extent digital, which we're utilizing to be extraordinarily well. So, when we think about the [indiscernible], when we think about that -- sort of selling season, it's early May, we leave the upfront. But between now and then we're having a majority of our conversations and with our partners will be selling as I think others will our entire portfolio of asset. So, we'll be selling the entertainment network, news, sports and Tubi in a very integrated fashion, really designed to capture our marketing partner serve money and the advertising dollars in the most efficient way. And I think we are uniquely positioned because of our leadership across new sports and digital with Tubi. I don't know if I can -- hi, Jessica. I don't know if I can answer the second question as well as you did in your -- in the question. So, let me start with that. I think we are looking forward to fiscal '23. We have, I think over the 2 years, we have two-thirds of our affiliate renewals up obviously with the lesser or -- the smaller renewals we've had this year are setting a tremendous benchmark for what we expect coming in renewables over the next couple of years. So, we advertising revenue with the political cycle, we expect to hit new records. I think 4 years ago we did $180 million worth of political advertising. I think we will easily number on it, but I think we can't -- it would be a guess, but I think we'll easily exceed that and break new records in this mid-term election. So, we are well-positioned I think for a tremendous victory. I don't -- can't remember if you also mentioned it in your question, but obviously Thursday Night Football was a -- an investment for us and with releasing Thursday Night Football for Amazon, I think they'll do a great job with it. But obviously there's a savings -- a significant savings there for us not having Thursday Night Football. So, we are -- we had a great quarter, great year this year. I think next year will be even better. On the USFL, we are very much looking forward to the new league. I've got actually compliment the NFL for being great partners and for helping us think through how we structure the USFL. The rules of the play is closer to NFL than the College Football where we've changed the rules slightly, it really been for Television, and for -- and so to make the game as exciting and as close the matches as possible. So, we're very excited for launching the USFL. It's always something of a league that we will control. We control the digital rights, we control every part of the game. With us and NBC as broadcasters, we think it has the best opportunity for a broad platform and the most viewers at launch. We've -- by bringing in outside investors into the league, we've effectively underwritten the investment in the USFL I think for the next 2 or 3 years at least. So, from a risk perspective, I know I think we've done it in a ambitious, but disciplined way. So, anything else? Thank you. Thank you, Michael. So, I'll let Steve answer the second question on the savings. But as regards to first question, we are today, this morning focused very much on broadcast television, and how we monetize our investment in sports and our sports partnerships, is really fundamentally through our partnerships with cable operators, satellite TV operators, and our local affiliates. And so, from a live sports broadcasting perspective, and it's different with some obviously, pinion [ph] and sort of shoulder programming, but from a live sports perspective, we see -- we continue to see the best way to monetize our investment in sports is clearly through our partnerships with our affiliates and our distributors. So that's our focus today. I'll let Steve answer the savings question. Thanks, everyone. Take care. Bye."

            "name": "Steve Tomsic",
            "content": "Thanks, Lachlan, and good morning, everyone. We delivered another strong quarter with total company revenues growing 9% year-over-year, once again highlighted by revenue growth across all of our operating segments. Total company affiliate revenues grew 11% against the prior quarter, reflecting healthy increases with the FOX Cable Networks and Television segments. The rate of subscriber declines held steady in the quarter with trailing 12-month industry sub losses continuing to run below 5%. Notwithstanding the tough comparison against our record political advertising revenues in the prior quarter, our total company advertising revenues grew by 6%. As Lachlan mentioned, we've benefited from the premium pricing our core brands were able to extract from a healthy marketplace, continued growth at Tubi and a full season of College Football following the disruptions caused by COVID in the prior year. Taking a step back from the comparability challenges versus fiscal '21, FOX's total advertising revenues are now running a healthy 12% ahead of Q2 fiscal '20, which was pre-COVID and unaffected by political advertising revenues. This is before taking into account the contribution of Tubi to our current day advertising revenues, which take the reported growth rate up to 20%. Meanwhile, total company other revenues increased 20% supported by full College Football season that drove higher sports sublicensing revenues at the Cable segment, following the disruptions caused by COVID last year. Adjusted EBITDA increased 2% to $310 million, as the revenue increases were partially offset by higher operating expenses associated with normalized sports and entertainment programming schedules, contractual sports rights escalators, and the digital investments we quote out on previous calls at FOX News Media and Tubi. The net loss attributable to stockholders of $85 million or $0.15 per share varies from the net income attributable to stockholders of $224 million or $0.37 per share in the prior year quarter, primarily due to the change in fair value of the company's investments in Flutter, which we recognize another net. Excluding the impact of this and other non-core items, adjusted EPS of $0.13 in the current year quarter was down modestly when compared to the $0.16 reported in the prior quarter, primarily due to the high depreciation and amortization, resulting from our new broadcast facility coming online late last fiscal year. Now let's turn to our business segment results, beginning with Cable Networks. Cable revenues increased 10% year-over-year with 12% growth in cable affiliate revenues. As a reminder, the reported 12% growth includes the impact of distribution credits we accrued for last year as a result of cancelled College Football games due to COVID. Excluding the impact of the distribution credits, underlying cable affiliate revenues increased low single digits in the December quarter, reflecting contractual pricing gains across our portfolio of networks, even without the benefit of any meaningful renewals this year. Cable advertising revenues grew 3%, primarily as a result of continued pricing strength across the portfolio, led by FOX News Media and additional MLB playoff games at the National Sports Networks. Despite the difficult comparison to last year's election cycle, FOX News Media actually expanded its linear advertising revenues in the quarter, a testament to the clear leadership position of the channel. Cable other revenues increased by $26 million led by higher sports sublicensing revenues, which were impacted by COVID last year, as well as continued subscription momentum at FOX Nation. Cable EBITDA increased 17% over the prior year, reflecting healthy revenue growth, partially offset by higher programming costs associated with contractual rights escalators and normalized schedules at the National Sports Networks. We also increased our digital investment at FOX News Media, including expanded programming and marketing at FOX Nation and the launch of FOX Weather. At Television we delivered 8% revenue growth in the quarter. This was led by a 10% increase in television affiliate revenues, reflecting double-digit rate increases for both our direct retransmission revenues at our owned and operated stations, and programming fees from non-owned station affiliates. We also delivered advertising revenue growth of 6% despite the absence of the record political advertising revenues we generated in the prior year. This growth reflects continued pricing strength at the FOX Network, where our FOX Sports lineup led by the NFL, College Football and the World Series delivered record Q2 advertising revenues for our network sports business. We also continue to see strong momentum at Tubi with revenues up by over 40% in the quarter, and a meaningful rebound in the base market at the FOX Television stations. As Lachlan mentioned, supply chain constraints had no real observable impact on our portfolio, with softness in the local [indiscernible] demand, more than offset by the growth in other categories, including sports betting. Television other revenues increased $31 million, primarily reflecting higher content revenues of FOX Entertainment as well as the acquisitions of MarVista and TMZ. EBITDA at our Television segment was down $88 million against the prior period, primarily as a result of higher programming costs associated with a normalized entertainment schedule, and sports price escalators at the FOX Network, and the planned ramp up of digital investment at Tubi. Turning now to free cash flow, where we recorded a deficit in the quarter of $753 million, which reflects the normal working capital cycle of the business with the concentration of payments for sports rights, and the buildup of advertising related receivables in the first half of our fiscal year. We continue to be active with respect to capital returns to our shareholders, with a further $300 million of additional buybacks since the start of the December quarter. We remain committed to utilizing our full buyback authorization of $4 billion, of which we have now cumulatively repurchased $2.15 billion, representing over 10% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in November 2019. From a balance sheet perspective, we finished the quarter with $4.26 billion in cash and $7.95 billion in debt. Subsequent to quarter end, we use cash on hand to repay a $750 million January bond to maturity. Our ability to deliver another successful quarter despite the continued uncertainty of COVID and difficult comparisons against the prior year political cycle, gives us confidence in the remainder of our fiscal '22. As previously discussed, with only approximately 5% of our total company affiliate revenues up for renewal this fiscal year, we expect affiliate revenue growth will moderate in the back half of the year. However, the demonstrated strength of our focus portfolio positions us well for our next major renewal cycle, which begins in fiscal '23 and where we have approximately 70% of our total company affiliate revenues due for renewal across fiscal '23 and '24. We plan to continue invest -- to invest in our digital assets given our success today. Now that we are at the midpoint of our fiscal year, we anticipate that these total net EBITDA and investment in our digital initiatives, along with the expected impact of the inaugural season of the USFL to land towards the lower end of the $200 million to $300 million range that we've previously outlined. As Lachlan mentioned, we anticipate a strong fiscal '23 with the financial tailwinds from Super Bowl 57, the early exit of Thursday Night Football, November's midterm elections and the start of our next major distribution renewal cycle. And with that, I'll hand it back to Joe. Yes. So, John, we said so far this halfway sort of approaching nine digits on that investment. So, we'd expect to have a little bit more back waded in the second half. But as I've sort of pointed out in the prepared remarks, I think, likely to be closer to 200 million and 300 million for the full year from a pricing perspective on those digital investments. Probably the most sort of the focus of that investment in the back half of the year will generally be around 2 weeks. So that's what you should expect to see that in the TV segment in the second half. And then in terms of Hulu Output deal, it's a good one, but it's relatively small. It's an Output deal for Hulu to stream out of season episodes of FOX unscripted and animated series. So, it's things like, I Can See Your Voice, The Masked Singer, The Masked Dancer, in case you missed that, and animated comedy from Bento Box HouseBroken. So, I think it's something we're very happy with and happy to continue our really positive relationship with Hulu. I think that in terms of deploying capital the optionality we have with the option structures gives us time to see how the markets develop their relationship with Flutter develops before we actually need to deploy that capital. So, Jessica, as I've mentioned in the remarks, within the $200 million to $300 million that we called out the year, USFL will be part of that and it'll be a sort of low to mid tens of millions of dollars EBITDA negative for us this year. Yes, Mike, so the $350 million to $400 million still a good number for us for next year in terms of net EBITA impact of losing Thursday Night Football, that includes the reinvestment in the slot. So, whatever we decide to put into that time, time slot in the schedule is in that $350 million to $400 million. So, it's a net to us, a net good guide to us next year. Obviously, part of that gets absorbed the following year with the increased [indiscernible], the new NFL contract. But all other things being equal, you should see that $350 million to $400 million flow to the bottom-line next year. Thank you."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. I would like to emphasize that functionality for the question-and-answer queue will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Now I'll turn the conference over to Chief Investor Relations Officer, Mr. Joe Dorrego, please go ahead.\nJoe Dorrego: Thank you, Operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to our fiscal 2022 first quarter earnings call. Joining me on the call today are Lachlan Murdoch, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, John Nallen, Chief Operating Officer, and Steve Tomsic, our Chief Financial Officer. First, Lachlan and Steve will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter, and then we'll take questions from the investment community. Please note that this call may include forward-looking statements regarding Fox Corporation's financial performance and operating results.  These statements are based on management's current expectations and actual results could differ from what is stated as a result of certain factors identified on today's call, and in the Company's SEC filings. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA or EBITDA as we referred to it on this call. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and our SEC filings, which are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Lachlan.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our first quarter results. We started off the 2022 fiscal year strongly, supported by industry-leading affiliate revenue growth, and the healthiest ad market we have seen in some time. This momentum is clearly seen across our operating businesses, which includes the return to a full slate of live events at FOX Sports, the expansion of ratings leadership at FOX News, and continued exceptional growth from 2B. Audiences are migrating to live news, sports, and streaming underscoring the operational and financial pillars that have defined our short history as Fox Corporation.  This quarter continued to demonstrate the strength of our businesses, where we delivered 12% growth in top-line revenues, led by a 17% increase in advertising and near double-digit growth in affiliate revenues. On the advertising front, Fox is uniquely benefiting from a healthy national ad market where brands are increasingly seeking out engaged real-time audiences at scale that only live news and sports platforms deliver. This strong market is also benefiting Tubi and our Fox News digital assets, which provide targeted audiences to advertisers across many platforms.  And despite comparisons to a heavy political ad cycle last year, our local markets are also performing well. On the affiliate revenue side, we again have best-in-class growth reflective of the power that our core brands hold in the pay-tv universe. Our commitment to keeping our highest profile content, like the NFL, exclusive to our distribution partners, gives us confidence that the healthy annual price escalators we have commanded for our brands over the past renewal cycles, will carry over into the next.  While Steve will walk you through our financial performance in more detail shortly, I will now turn to the operating highlights across our businesses. You've heard it from me before, and all of our advertisers know well that Fox owns the fall through our football and baseball coverage at Fox Sports. And this fall is once again proof of that fact. NFL viewership is up across the industry. College football is back in full force. And we have just concluded a highly competitive Major League Baseball postseason.  And throughout it all, Fox Sports has been expanding its live coverage to deliver viewers more of the content that they want. The NFL is off to a great start, seeing solid growth in overall viewership through the first 8 weeks of the season. Excluding a rather complicated Week 1 comparison, Fox's NFL viewership is up 8% over last year and our schedule only gets better from here.  College football has also seen solid growth. By all measures, it's off to its best start in recent memory, Season to date, average viewership of our college football games on Fox is up nearly 20% over 2019. the most appropriate comparison given the postponements and cancellations that characterized last year's COVID-impacted schedule. Fox's Marquee, Big Noon Window, is averaging more than 5 million viewers, while our Saturday morning pregame show, Big Noon Kickoff, is also seeing viewership up nearly 20% over 2019 levels.  Moving from the football field to the baseball diamond, Major League Baseball has been a bright spot this year. The inaugural field of dreams games, again this summer was a great success, clocking nearly 6 million viewers, and delivering the most watched regular season baseball game in 16 years. It drew viewers and mass, notably women and teens. and from a business standpoint, was the highest revenue generating regular season game of all time.  This game was something that only the Fox Sports team could envision and produce, definitely tapping into the nation's desire for an uplifting event underpinned by nostalgia and optimism. We all look forward to returning to Iowa in August '22 for next season's Field of Dreams game. The momentum from the Major League Baseball regular season has translated into the post-season.  And what has been a superb World Series for Fox. In fact, the World Series is the only content this season outside of the NFL to average over 11 million viewers and will easily outright the NBA finals to rank as a number 2 championship event in professional sports this year. And today, we're happy to announce the expansion of our international soccer portfolio with a landmark rights agreement for the UEFA European Championship. We will have access to more than 1500 matches highlighted by the 2024 and 2028 Euros, along with the UEFA Nations League, World Cup, and Euro qualifiers, and international friendlies.  And this is on top of our existing international soccer portfolio, which as you know, already boost the FIFA Men's and Women's World Cups. Importantly, we've also acquired sports betting rights alongside our coverage of these UEFA competitions, including integration opportunities with Fox Bet and Fox Bet Super 6, which are already benefiting from our existing sports portfolio.  At the end of the quarter, the user base for Fox Bet Super 6 exceeded 5 million players, making it the biggest free-to-play sports betting game in the country. Beyond our direct investments and options in the wagering area, our national networks and local stations are benefiting from the legalization of gambling across the country. Take the Fox Television Stations as an example. Sports betting is only legalized in 6 of our 18 Fox markets, and yet we have already written approximately 20% more sports betting revenue at this early point of the fiscal year than we did across all of fiscal 2021 combined.  This implies that this new category will end the year as one of the largest in local advertising. Staying with local advertising, the overall market trends for us are quite positive with travel, entertainment, and pharmaceutical categories proving particularly robust. While we continue to observe some softness in automotive, this is being more than offset by growth in other areas including sports betting.  Excluding political spending, our core local advertising was up again this quarter. At Fox News Media, linear and digital segments are performing very well. The Fox News Channel has further solidified its leadership position in cable news, reaching market share levels that are now at multi-year highs. In both total day and prime time, the Fox News Channel accounted for over 50% of cable news viewership during the first quarter, more than CNN and MSNBC combined.  This momentum has accelerated into the current quarter, with Fox News Channel accounting for 55% of total day, and primetime cable news viewership in the month of October. And I should just state here as an aside, last night saw a viewership share of the Fox News channel of 65% of all of cable news of viewing, 65%. The first quarter also mark the seventh straight quarter of the Fox news channel was number 1 in all of basic cable for primetime.  And this ratings leadership continues even into the late-night hours. Gutfeld! regularly outpaces nearly all late-night programs on cable and broadcast television. Even besting the CBS Late Show with Stephen Colbert on selected nights. At Fox Nation, the complementary streaming service to Fox News, our total subscriber count was up nearly 25% compared to last quarter, and up over 130% compared to the same quarter last year.  Not only our new subscribers seeking our Fox Nation, they are also staying with the platform longer. The first quarter was Fox Nation 's highest quarter for engagement, and the best quarter for subscriber retention. The momentum at Fox Nation has continued into the current quarter with the addition of the iconic series Cops. This show, which was a staple of the Fox Network for so many years, launched on October 1st and has quickly become one of the most popular titles on the platform.  And we recently launched another digital product under the Fox News Media umbrella, Fox Weather. The Fox Weather app and it's 24/7 free ad-supported streaming service debuted last week as the most downloaded free app in the App Store ahead of TikTok, YouTube, and other social media platforms. Since launch, the Fox Weather app has been downloaded over 1 million times.  In just its first week of existence, users generated over 28 million-page views and spent over 42 million minutes engaging with the product. Using the strength of our national and local news operations, we are excited about the prospects for Fox Weather and our ability to be a leading player in the space, delivering compelling live content to viewers and serving as a desirable platform for advertisers to reach our valuable audiences.  The Fox Weather streaming service is currently available for free on all Fox News Media digital properties, as well as on Fox Now, the distribution and availability of Fox Weather will expand in the near term, with a launch later this month on Tubi, followed by YouTube TV, and the major streaming platforms, making Fox Weather ubiquitously available well before the end of our fiscal year.  Our digital strategy is focused and sets Fox apart from its media peers. Our strategy is deliberately less capital intensive than what others in the industry are currently pursuing. Our approach to investment is to develop businesses that are extensions of rather than replacements for our existing lines of business, thereby creating revenue streams that are truly incremental to Fox.  Tubi is a prime example of our unique approach to streaming compared to others in the media landscape. We program and monetize Tubi in distinct contrast to the SVOD approach of many other media companies, and we are more than pleased with the results. While others compete aggressively in the SVOD space, investing heavily in content and promotion, we identified the opportunity to be a leader in AVOD, a strategy which aligns with our advertiser and audience-focused approach Company-wide.  As SVOD platforms face the challenges of subscriber acquisition and retention and ever-increasing programming costs, Fox's carved out a differentiated and unique path. Tubi's measured investment in its content library and original programming is delivering solid returns. In addition to serving viewers with the content library of more than 35,000 titles, which is more than 5 times the size of Netflix's library, Tubi's unique original content strategy is already seeing early signs of success.  Out of the first 4 original films to be released this year, 2 of which have performed so well in the quarter that they have already generated advertising revenue well above their local production costs. Meaning, they're already generating a positive return on investment. Tubi's deep understanding of its audience is a key asset, as Tubi original movies outperformed blockbuster movies available on the platform. The growth at Tubi continues to exceed even our best expectations for the business when we acquired.  Tubi will generate significantly more revenue this fiscal year than our cost to purchase the platform in early 2020. In the first quarter of the fiscal year Tubi more than doubled its revenues year-over-year. And total view time on the platform, TVT, [Indiscernible] metric, continues to climb with 30% growth compared to last year. Fox 's content and reach have supercharged to recent revenue and audience. News on Tubi, at collection of 70 news channels, is anchored by live news from the Fox Television Stations and has drawn viewers for increasingly long periods of time.  Since launching last fall, News on Tubi viewership has grown over 130%, and Tubi continues to expand its linear offerings with our recent launch of Sports on Tubi, which further leverages Fox's content expertise with premium sports channels, including Fox Sports, the NFL Network, and the MLB network. Also, Fox Entertainment recently acquired TMZ. The acquisition of TMZ fits perfectly with our focus on live programming, and give us -- gives us an array of possibilities to rapidly expand our brand and platform that have long been one of the cornerstones of our local TV stations.  Fox Entertainment is focusing on bringing the TMZ brand to all parts of the Fox portfolio. including further monetizing the TMZ brand across the Fox TV Stations, developing TMZ branded content for Tubi and amplifying TMZ 's digital presence. Finally, and this is just a lot of fun, we are very pleased with the early results of our investment in Blockchain Creative Labs. Through this investment, we own a share of the underpinning marketplace and wallet technologies that power these next-generation experiences.  We recently launched the MaskVerse alongside the current season of The Masked Singer, in which fans of the show have downloaded over 120,000 NFT packs and created over 100,000 wallets on the platform. We look forward to the expansion of this business through our NFT partnership with the WWE. This further highlights the marketing power of the Fox broadcast network to drive new businesses and the creative and entrepreneurial spirit of all of us here at Fox.  Clearly, the fiscal year is off to an excellent start and we are encouraged by the outlook for the rest of the year. Our strategy to focus on the broadcast of live event programming that audiences crave, like sports and news, which coupled with the addition of Tubi, puts us in an enviable competitive position. This intentionally differentiated portfolio and approach will further propel our growth and drive exceptional value for shareholders. Now, Steve will take us through the financial details of the first quarter.\nSteve Tomsic: Thanks, Lachlan. And good afternoon. As strong operational execution across our businesses has led to another quarter of impressive financial results. Let me walk you through our start to the fiscal year, before providing some markers that will be helpful as we think through the quarters ahead. In the first quarter of fiscal '22, the Company reported total revenues of $3.05 billion up 12% over the first quarter of fiscal '21, reflecting revenue growth across all operating segments.  Total Company affiliate revenues increased 9% with 14% growth at the television segment and 5.5% growth at the cable segment. The rate of subscriber declines held steady in the quarter with trailing 12-month industry sub-losses, again running at approximately 4.5%. Total Company's advertising revenues increased 17%, reflecting strength in the national and local marketplaces, return of normalized programming schedules following the COVID-related postponements and cancellations last year, and continued strong growth of Tubi.  It is worth noting that this total Company growth was achieved despite the comparison to the prior year quarter when we generated nearly $100 million in net political advertising revenues relating into the presidential election. Total Company other revenues increased 15% in the quarter, primarily due to the return of sports sublicensing revenues and pay-per-view boxing at the cable segment.  Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $1.06 billion, down 9% against the comparative period in fiscal '21, reflecting higher operating expenses associated with the return of normalized sports and entertainment programming, and as we signaled on our fiscal '21 year-end call, increased digital investment at Fox News Media and Tubi. Net income attributable to stockholders of $701 million, or $1.21 per share was down the -- down versus the $1.11 billion or $1.83 per share in the prior-year quarter. This variance reflects the EBITDA movement I just described, along with the one-time gain recognized in other net in the prior-year quarter. This was associated with the reinvestment of cash text pre -payment completely in relation to its acquisition of 21st Century Fox, excluding the impact of non-core items, adjusted EPS of a $1.11 in the current year quarter was down modestly when compared to the $1.88 reported in the prior year quarter. Turning to the performance of our operating segments in the quarter, with cable networks reported a 7% increase in revenues. Cable affiliate revenues increased 5.5%, once again, led by double-digit pricing gains at Fox News.  Cable advertising revenues increased 4% supported by the return of a full-slate of College Football games at the national sports networks, following the COVID -related disruptions that occurred last year, as well as the addition of international soccer matches, including the Gold Cup. Cable advertising growth was also helped by double-digit digital revenue growth at Fox News Media. The partially offset by lower linear advertising revenues of the Fox News Channel due to the absence of the political cycle that we experienced in the prior year.  Cable other revenues increased by $26 million primarily due to the return of sports sublicensing revenues and pay-per-view boxing following the COVID disruption last year, as well as continued subscription maintained at Fox Nation. EBITDA at our cable segment was down $7 million versus the prior-year period, as these healthy revenue growths was offset by higher programming costs, the National Sports Networks, primarily due to the sports scheduling changes I just mentioned, and the anticipated increase in digital investment at Fox News Media, including costs associated with last week's launch of Fox Weather.  Now turning to Television, where we reported a 17% increase in revenues in the quarter. Television affiliate revenues increased 14%, reflecting double-digit increases for both our programming phase from non-owned station affiliates, and for our direct retransmission revenues at owned and operated stations.  This once again reaffirms we are well on track to achieve the Television affiliate revenue growth we outlined at our Investor Day. Television advertising revenues increased 22%, supported by strong ad marketplace, normalized schedules on the Fox network, and sustained momentum of Tubi. At Fox Sports, we benefited from a full slate of college football, the return of the MLB All-Star Game, and the inaugural World Cup of the field of dreams game, all of which were disrupted by COVID last year.  At Fox Entertainment, we resumed a more traditional full schedule, anchored by our primary scripted and unscripted heats. As compared to a schedule last year that was hampered by COVID-related production delays, which compromise the quality of the programming slate. At the Fox Television Stations, we continue to observe a meaningful rebound in the base market with our core ad revenues up high single-digits, which partially offset the absence of historic political advertising revenues that we experienced last year.  Rounding out the Television segment. As Lachlan mentioned, Tubi more than doubled its revenues against the prior year. The fact that growth in monetization is outpacing the significant growth in total view time is testament to the revenue synergies delivered from bringing Tubi into the Fox portfolio. Finally, EBITDA at our Television segment was down $98 million against the prior year period, as this healthy revenue growth was offset by higher programming costs primarily associated with normalized sports and entertainment schedules at the Fox network, and increased digital investment at Tubi.  Turning now to cash flow, where our free cash flow deficit of $24 million is consistent with the seasonality of our working capital cycle, with the first half of our fiscal year is characterized by a concentration of payments for sports rights, and the buildup of advertising related receivables, both of which reverse in the second half of our fiscal year. So far, this fiscal year, we have returned $440 million of capital to shareholders, comprising approximately $140 million in the form of our semi-annual dividend payment, and a further $300 million directed towards our ongoing share repurchase program.  Against our enhanced buyback authorization of $4 billion, we have now cumulatively repurchased approximately $1.9 billion representing over 9% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in November 2019. From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $5.4 billion in cash and $7.95 billion in debt. As we look out over the remainder of our fiscal year, we'd like to remind you of a handful of markets.  Firstly, at fiscal Q2 will comp against the heightened new cycle and record political revenues of nearly $250 million that we delivered across the Company in the December quarter of last year, most of which was ending our television segment. On our last call, we discussed our plans to invest $200 million to $300 million on a net EBITDA basis into the expansion and acceleration of our digital assets. With a relatively modest amount deployed today, the phasing of these investments will be skewed toward the final three quarters of the fiscal year. From an affiliate revenue perspective, there are at least two things worth calling out.  Firstly, you will recall that last year's college football season was shortened and included a number of game cancellations. As such, we will have the tailwind of comparing against an accrual for potential distribution credits booked at the National Sports Networks in the December quarter of last year. And secondly, as I mentioned on our last call, we have a live affiliate renewal cycle with only 5% of that total Company distribution revenues up for renewal this year.  As a result, we expect the growth in affiliate revenues to moderate over the course of this fiscal year, before we say the progress for more meaningful rate increases from the 70% of total Company affiliate revenues that comes year across our fiscal '23 and '24. In the start of our affiliate revenue cycle next year, it's just one pace of what should be an exceptional fiscal '23 for Fox, as we look ahead to Super Bowl 57, the FIFA World Cup, the exit of our Thursday night football deal, and November's midterm elections. And with that, I will now turn the call back to Joe.\nJoe Dorrego: Thank you, Steve. And now we'd be happy to take questions from the investment community.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to emphasize the functionality of the question-and-answer queue. [Operator Instructions]. It has been requested that you limit yourself to 1 question. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. My one question is, and maybe on the sports side. Can you talk a bit about how you can -- how you will -- your ability to leverage more your incredible brand you have in sports, and all the rights that you have in sports longer-term? Is there a consideration of a greater digital strategy beyond what you're already doing with Tubi?\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks, Alexia. Hi. Look, I think it's a two-fold for us. What we're currently focused on is obviously leveraging our sports brand and sports content through Fox Bet. First through Fox Bet Super 6, and then obviously as we drop sports wagers down into the wager insights at Fox Bet. So, we continue to like that business, we continue to really drive that business and spend a lot of time promoting and marketing it and really building value through our pretty unique sports wagering assets. That's number 1.  And number 2, and I think this is important for us, because obviously what drives the sports businesses is first and foremost live sports and live sports content. And so, we've taken a very clear and -- very clear strategy, and we've been very open about it and very vocal about it, is that we believe the best place for our premium sports is on our broadcast networks. That drives the most value for us, it drives the most value for our affiliates and for distributors that partner with us with retransmission fees. So, by really keeping our content exclusive with our partners, we think we drive a tremendous amount of value, not just for us, but for the whole ecosystem.\nJoe Dorrego: Operator, we can go to the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Q - Jessica Reif Ehrlich from Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Hi, I have one multipart question, of course.\nLachlan Murdoch: Hi, Jessica.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Hi. So, this is a news question. So, the 65% share late-night is pretty astounding. But even before that, the -- there's been a record amount of money raised from both parties before the election, and after yesterday is probably a lot more to come. So, I guess the question is, can you talk about monetization across your various assets, Fox News and TV. Does it -- the second part of that is just measurements been a real issue for everybody.  Does that affect your news, like how you monetize news? And then I was just -- since you brought up News on Tubi, and just on content in general, I guess. Can you just talk about your outlook for how Tubi's content profile will change in the coming year? Thank you.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks, Jessica. Let me share on News monetization and I think you connected us with some of the political revenues that we've seen over this past 12 months and what we're continuing to see. And we believe the mid-term elections and contest next year bode to be truly staggering. So, in a News monetization as you mentioned, the -- our share of audience is in-and-out 55% of cable news viewers is incredibly impressive.  It's a lot of hard work to build that share and maintain it. One of the [Indiscernible] things as a byproduct of that share is really the breadth of our audience as well. And then we have more independents watching Fox News than anyone else. And [Indiscernible] when we have just about an equal number of democrats watching Fox News as watch CNN according to Nielsen.  The breadth of the audience, the fact the audience is also demographically becoming broader is actually bringing in new advertisers and new categories of advertisers on to the news platform. So, it's incredibly pleasing to see. We're seeing scatter pricing for news well above upfronts and the market is strong. Obviously, local news is a big part of our news business as well. We now produce over 1,100 hours of local news per week. Many of our stations are now in -- if they weren't battleground states before, they're now -- after last night, they're now battleground states.  And we'd see a tremendous opportunity for them going forward in this -- as the next political cycle approaches. As far as Nielsen goes, I think Nielsen's all we know -- we like others believe that Nielsen data is imperfect. We'd like to see Nielsen invest further in their data gathering capabilities. I think it affects lower-rated, more fragmented sections of the market more than us, more than particularly in the mass scale of our news audiences and sports audiences. Lastly, Tubi, I want to get to your third question, Jessica. can't remember the specific question that was --\nSteve Tomsic: Billing of the Tubi content.\nLachlan Murdoch: Billing of the Tubi content. It's there's two elements of it. It's obviously the original content on Tubi. These, as you know, are very inexpensive Made-for-TV movies. As I mentioned, they are all designed to be profitable in the very short-term. Two of them were profitable within months, which was tremendous to see. And the second element of the strategy is streaming fast channels. Linear channels such as we have now with sports on Tubi and with news on Tubi, which are very low cost but help them drive the TVT.\nJoe Dorrego: Operator, we can go to the next question.\nOperator: Our next question come from the line of Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Thank you. Good afternoon. For any of you, there has been obviously a lot of focus on the ad market and the potential supply chain issues for some verticals. You guys didn't mention any of that, so I'm just wondering if you're seeing any softness in the television market sitting here as we head into the holidays. And I was just curious on Tubi, if you had international plans that you'd want to share with us on taking that platform overseas in a substantial way over the next couple of years.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks, Ben. Hope you're well. In terms of categories, we've seen softness in auto [Indiscernible] you specifically talked about sort of supply chain issues. I think if you look across a couple of categories, it's both supply chain, and I think in some it's shortage of staffing and employment. But where -- in auto being the key one and the largest of those where there continues to be some softness.  But these are more than made up for new categories, and growing categories that are coming into -- certainly onto our platforms. And the local the local side, clearly are wagering is -- mentioned it in my prepared comments, is booming across the local markets. Travel is also coming back and restaurants locally. So, these categories are more than making up for the softness in a couple of categories that are seeing some supply chain issues.  From a national point-of-view we continue to benefit from a very strong upfront and scatter pricing is averaging around 20% up above upfront pricing. Entertainment is a little higher than 20%, New is a little lower than 20%, Sports is about 25%, so it's averaging about 20 and nationally, there's some wavering money, not as much as local. But the crypto category, which is a brand-new category, particularly in sports, is booming as well as finance. And then Tubi International, Tubi currently, other than domestically in the U.S. is in Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. And our focus has been driving the U.S. business. But we do see international as a big opportunity.\nJoe Dorrego: We can go to the next question.\nOperator: Our next question come from the line of Robert Fishman from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nRobert Fishman: Hi. Good afternoon. If I can follow up on sports with your UEFA deal. Can you discuss how you see the ROI for incremental sports rights, and whether you plan to monetize UEFA on Tubi. And if not, how does your focus on keeping the rights exclusive to the pay TV ecosystem help with these negotiations or future negotiations.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks, Robert. So, you would -- with all -- as with all our sports rights, we studied very carefully to make sure we have a positive return on them and return on our capital with UEFA, as its 1,500 matches that we have available to us. The -- practically all of them will be on Fox Sports 1 and we will be the backbone of Fox Sports 1 through those summers where the Euros were held.  And so, you'll have the Euros on some summers, really being the backbone of our soccer -- summer soccer. And you'll have FIFA, the World Cups the other summers. So, we think it's a tremendous addition to -- for Fox Sports 1. We will have some games on Fox Broadcasting. We'll have about 4 times as many games as were previously aired on ABC, but that's only our 20 games versus the 5 that showed up on ABC when they had those rights. And we don't revisit putting Euro games live games on Tubi at this stage, although we could.\nJoe Dorrego: Operator, we can go to the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nDoug Mitchelson : Thanks so much. And good afternoon, everyone. I guess my question and my follow-ups, I'll just throw it away. Lachlan, how tough of funnel doing for Tubi versus that 30% growth in usage? I know you always highlight that it's growth in usage that really matters but the measure of the health, we still need to understand whether you're attracting new users of Tubi and what marketing and distribution levers are left to pull to continue to scale that business.  And then for John, we've talked in the past about visibility for core costs for the Company, and we've had obviously these huge pandemic swings. But I'm curious if you exclude investment spending and unusually like Super Bowl and Thursday Night Football exit. Can you help us understand what the core OpEx growth looks like for your linear network businesses, because I think we all have views as to what advertising affiliate revenue on a core basis will look like going forward? And then lastly for Steve, can you monetize these higher NFL ratings or was that all sold upfront. Thank you.\nLachlan Murdoch: I get the easy one. Now look, Tubi is growing both in users and engagement in TVT. One of the things that you do, you juggle or balanced probably better word than juggle, but then you balance is when you market for new users, you can, through in a digital acquisition tool. Very quickly, again, new users. And depending on how much you want to spend, you can toggle that up and down.  But that's a losing strategy if those users are not engaged and then spend only a short period of time on the platform and then you have to re-market to them, for instance. And so far ahead in the team are very scientific and very experienced and just balancing the new users that they acquire versus the quality of those users and how engaged they are. And it is really why the total view on time, which includes new viewers coming onto the platform really remains the best metric, because it includes all viewers as well as a measure of the engagement that they have.\nJohn Nallen: Hey, Doug. Yeah, well. Doug, I'll just comment on the cost overall and let Steve take some of the details. But the -- probably at the heart of your question is the visibility we have over our cost profile, our cost envelope. And\nJohn Nallen: If you look at what we've done over the last year or 2, particularly securing NFL for the next 12 years, having baseball contract that goes well into the next decade, today's announcement about where we're going to be with UEFA, it just gives us great confidence about the rest of the year in the future for us because we've got such great visibility over the cost envelope.  So, it's not like we're expecting great surprises coming out of any one of the areas. We had the stations, news division, sports, or entertainment. So again, it just brings confidence to us as to the outlook for the business.  Just the obvious -- to state the obvious, obviously within that overall cost envelope with saying, when you can pay a like-for-like schedules on the entertainment side, we'll look to moderate the cost there and make sure that that business delivers our ROI. But also, in that same segment, we've got Tubi which we're really leaning into from an investment and a cost basis and so you will say that come through in the numbers, particularly after the -- we're pretty light in terms of the amount of money that we put against Tubi from a net investment perspective over this quarter.  And you'll see that ramp with subscriber -- user acquisition costs and marketing costs over the next couple of quarters. From an NFL ratings perspective, we'll absolutely look to monetize with still selling scatter there as Lachlan mentioned. Scatter has been incredibly robust for us sports with 25% ahead of upfront or pricing premium to upfront. So, we will definitely look to monetize that over the course of the remainder of the season.\nJoe Dorrego: Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thanks. Your final question then will come from the line of Steven Cahall from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nSteven Cahall: Thanks. I just wanted to ask about Fox Bet and Super 6. Thanks for that data point on Super 6 with the $5 million. I was wondering if you could give us any metrics around Fox Bet. I know you seeing Super 6 act as a strong funnel for conversion from free-to-pay. And I know you are a passive, I guess, sort of participant in Fox Bet.  How should we think about you may be using your sports rights to make that more of a differentiated platform, or also taking more of an operational role so that it might start to show up in the financials at some point. Thank you.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thank you, Steven. Sure. I appreciate the question. I was surprised that it took 6 questions to get to Fox Bet and Super 6, as obviously, the business that are -- is very meaningful for us. So first of all, I'm not sure how much data I can give on Fox Bet itself. I understand that Flutter reported last night. And as the operator of this business, I don't want to give any information that are market sensitive or that they want to hold closer to the chess. But if you remember the structure of our joint venture, we have a Fox Bet Super 6 with over 5 million users as the number 1 national free-to-play game.  That drops people into Fox Bet. It's critical to realize though that Fox Bet includes in the joint venture and Fox Bet includes PokerStars and iCasino. And so over time as we monetize sports wagering, we also have the benefit of monetizing PokerStars and iCasino in Fox Bet. And what that means as we go through to really take full value and take full grasp of the opportunity fully, we are beginning to explore the process of getting licensed, wagering license, in order to fully capture the value of these tremendous assets for all of our shareholders.  So that's a process that we're just beginning. It's a complicated process because it's a go state-by-state in terms of where we would operate with our joint venture partner these assets. And so, it's probably a process that will take some time. Of course, we're also in our arbitration with Flutter under some of the elements of our options are 50% option of Fox Bet and are 18.6% option in FanDuel. And we expect that arbitration to be complete by June of next year. That's probably much that I can say on Fox Bet.\nJoe Dorrego: At this point, we're out of time. But if you have any further questions, please give me your [Indiscernible] carrier call. Thank you once again for joining today's call.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude your conference call for today. Thanks for using the AT&T Executive Teleconferencing. You may now disconnect.",

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Lachlan Murdoch",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our first quarter results. We started off the 2022 fiscal year strongly, supported by industry-leading affiliate revenue growth, and the healthiest ad market we have seen in some time. This momentum is clearly seen across our operating businesses, which includes the return to a full slate of live events at FOX Sports, the expansion of ratings leadership at FOX News, and continued exceptional growth from 2B. Audiences are migrating to live news, sports, and streaming underscoring the operational and financial pillars that have defined our short history as Fox Corporation.  This quarter continued to demonstrate the strength of our businesses, where we delivered 12% growth in top-line revenues, led by a 17% increase in advertising and near double-digit growth in affiliate revenues. On the advertising front, Fox is uniquely benefiting from a healthy national ad market where brands are increasingly seeking out engaged real-time audiences at scale that only live news and sports platforms deliver. This strong market is also benefiting Tubi and our Fox News digital assets, which provide targeted audiences to advertisers across many platforms.  And despite comparisons to a heavy political ad cycle last year, our local markets are also performing well. On the affiliate revenue side, we again have best-in-class growth reflective of the power that our core brands hold in the pay-tv universe. Our commitment to keeping our highest profile content, like the NFL, exclusive to our distribution partners, gives us confidence that the healthy annual price escalators we have commanded for our brands over the past renewal cycles, will carry over into the next.  While Steve will walk you through our financial performance in more detail shortly, I will now turn to the operating highlights across our businesses. You've heard it from me before, and all of our advertisers know well that Fox owns the fall through our football and baseball coverage at Fox Sports. And this fall is once again proof of that fact. NFL viewership is up across the industry. College football is back in full force. And we have just concluded a highly competitive Major League Baseball postseason.  And throughout it all, Fox Sports has been expanding its live coverage to deliver viewers more of the content that they want. The NFL is off to a great start, seeing solid growth in overall viewership through the first 8 weeks of the season. Excluding a rather complicated Week 1 comparison, Fox's NFL viewership is up 8% over last year and our schedule only gets better from here.  College football has also seen solid growth. By all measures, it's off to its best start in recent memory, Season to date, average viewership of our college football games on Fox is up nearly 20% over 2019. the most appropriate comparison given the postponements and cancellations that characterized last year's COVID-impacted schedule. Fox's Marquee, Big Noon Window, is averaging more than 5 million viewers, while our Saturday morning pregame show, Big Noon Kickoff, is also seeing viewership up nearly 20% over 2019 levels.  Moving from the football field to the baseball diamond, Major League Baseball has been a bright spot this year. The inaugural field of dreams games, again this summer was a great success, clocking nearly 6 million viewers, and delivering the most watched regular season baseball game in 16 years. It drew viewers and mass, notably women and teens. and from a business standpoint, was the highest revenue generating regular season game of all time.  This game was something that only the Fox Sports team could envision and produce, definitely tapping into the nation's desire for an uplifting event underpinned by nostalgia and optimism. We all look forward to returning to Iowa in August '22 for next season's Field of Dreams game. The momentum from the Major League Baseball regular season has translated into the post-season.  And what has been a superb World Series for Fox. In fact, the World Series is the only content this season outside of the NFL to average over 11 million viewers and will easily outright the NBA finals to rank as a number 2 championship event in professional sports this year. And today, we're happy to announce the expansion of our international soccer portfolio with a landmark rights agreement for the UEFA European Championship. We will have access to more than 1500 matches highlighted by the 2024 and 2028 Euros, along with the UEFA Nations League, World Cup, and Euro qualifiers, and international friendlies.  And this is on top of our existing international soccer portfolio, which as you know, already boost the FIFA Men's and Women's World Cups. Importantly, we've also acquired sports betting rights alongside our coverage of these UEFA competitions, including integration opportunities with Fox Bet and Fox Bet Super 6, which are already benefiting from our existing sports portfolio.  At the end of the quarter, the user base for Fox Bet Super 6 exceeded 5 million players, making it the biggest free-to-play sports betting game in the country. Beyond our direct investments and options in the wagering area, our national networks and local stations are benefiting from the legalization of gambling across the country. Take the Fox Television Stations as an example. Sports betting is only legalized in 6 of our 18 Fox markets, and yet we have already written approximately 20% more sports betting revenue at this early point of the fiscal year than we did across all of fiscal 2021 combined.  This implies that this new category will end the year as one of the largest in local advertising. Staying with local advertising, the overall market trends for us are quite positive with travel, entertainment, and pharmaceutical categories proving particularly robust. While we continue to observe some softness in automotive, this is being more than offset by growth in other areas including sports betting.  Excluding political spending, our core local advertising was up again this quarter. At Fox News Media, linear and digital segments are performing very well. The Fox News Channel has further solidified its leadership position in cable news, reaching market share levels that are now at multi-year highs. In both total day and prime time, the Fox News Channel accounted for over 50% of cable news viewership during the first quarter, more than CNN and MSNBC combined.  This momentum has accelerated into the current quarter, with Fox News Channel accounting for 55% of total day, and primetime cable news viewership in the month of October. And I should just state here as an aside, last night saw a viewership share of the Fox News channel of 65% of all of cable news of viewing, 65%. The first quarter also mark the seventh straight quarter of the Fox news channel was number 1 in all of basic cable for primetime.  And this ratings leadership continues even into the late-night hours. Gutfeld! regularly outpaces nearly all late-night programs on cable and broadcast television. Even besting the CBS Late Show with Stephen Colbert on selected nights. At Fox Nation, the complementary streaming service to Fox News, our total subscriber count was up nearly 25% compared to last quarter, and up over 130% compared to the same quarter last year.  Not only our new subscribers seeking our Fox Nation, they are also staying with the platform longer. The first quarter was Fox Nation 's highest quarter for engagement, and the best quarter for subscriber retention. The momentum at Fox Nation has continued into the current quarter with the addition of the iconic series Cops. This show, which was a staple of the Fox Network for so many years, launched on October 1st and has quickly become one of the most popular titles on the platform.  And we recently launched another digital product under the Fox News Media umbrella, Fox Weather. The Fox Weather app and it's 24/7 free ad-supported streaming service debuted last week as the most downloaded free app in the App Store ahead of TikTok, YouTube, and other social media platforms. Since launch, the Fox Weather app has been downloaded over 1 million times.  In just its first week of existence, users generated over 28 million-page views and spent over 42 million minutes engaging with the product. Using the strength of our national and local news operations, we are excited about the prospects for Fox Weather and our ability to be a leading player in the space, delivering compelling live content to viewers and serving as a desirable platform for advertisers to reach our valuable audiences.  The Fox Weather streaming service is currently available for free on all Fox News Media digital properties, as well as on Fox Now, the distribution and availability of Fox Weather will expand in the near term, with a launch later this month on Tubi, followed by YouTube TV, and the major streaming platforms, making Fox Weather ubiquitously available well before the end of our fiscal year.  Our digital strategy is focused and sets Fox apart from its media peers. Our strategy is deliberately less capital intensive than what others in the industry are currently pursuing. Our approach to investment is to develop businesses that are extensions of rather than replacements for our existing lines of business, thereby creating revenue streams that are truly incremental to Fox.  Tubi is a prime example of our unique approach to streaming compared to others in the media landscape. We program and monetize Tubi in distinct contrast to the SVOD approach of many other media companies, and we are more than pleased with the results. While others compete aggressively in the SVOD space, investing heavily in content and promotion, we identified the opportunity to be a leader in AVOD, a strategy which aligns with our advertiser and audience-focused approach Company-wide.  As SVOD platforms face the challenges of subscriber acquisition and retention and ever-increasing programming costs, Fox's carved out a differentiated and unique path. Tubi's measured investment in its content library and original programming is delivering solid returns. In addition to serving viewers with the content library of more than 35,000 titles, which is more than 5 times the size of Netflix's library, Tubi's unique original content strategy is already seeing early signs of success.  Out of the first 4 original films to be released this year, 2 of which have performed so well in the quarter that they have already generated advertising revenue well above their local production costs. Meaning, they're already generating a positive return on investment. Tubi's deep understanding of its audience is a key asset, as Tubi original movies outperformed blockbuster movies available on the platform. The growth at Tubi continues to exceed even our best expectations for the business when we acquired.  Tubi will generate significantly more revenue this fiscal year than our cost to purchase the platform in early 2020. In the first quarter of the fiscal year Tubi more than doubled its revenues year-over-year. And total view time on the platform, TVT, [Indiscernible] metric, continues to climb with 30% growth compared to last year. Fox 's content and reach have supercharged to recent revenue and audience. News on Tubi, at collection of 70 news channels, is anchored by live news from the Fox Television Stations and has drawn viewers for increasingly long periods of time.  Since launching last fall, News on Tubi viewership has grown over 130%, and Tubi continues to expand its linear offerings with our recent launch of Sports on Tubi, which further leverages Fox's content expertise with premium sports channels, including Fox Sports, the NFL Network, and the MLB network. Also, Fox Entertainment recently acquired TMZ. The acquisition of TMZ fits perfectly with our focus on live programming, and give us -- gives us an array of possibilities to rapidly expand our brand and platform that have long been one of the cornerstones of our local TV stations.  Fox Entertainment is focusing on bringing the TMZ brand to all parts of the Fox portfolio. including further monetizing the TMZ brand across the Fox TV Stations, developing TMZ branded content for Tubi and amplifying TMZ 's digital presence. Finally, and this is just a lot of fun, we are very pleased with the early results of our investment in Blockchain Creative Labs. Through this investment, we own a share of the underpinning marketplace and wallet technologies that power these next-generation experiences.  We recently launched the MaskVerse alongside the current season of The Masked Singer, in which fans of the show have downloaded over 120,000 NFT packs and created over 100,000 wallets on the platform. We look forward to the expansion of this business through our NFT partnership with the WWE. This further highlights the marketing power of the Fox broadcast network to drive new businesses and the creative and entrepreneurial spirit of all of us here at Fox.  Clearly, the fiscal year is off to an excellent start and we are encouraged by the outlook for the rest of the year. Our strategy to focus on the broadcast of live event programming that audiences crave, like sports and news, which coupled with the addition of Tubi, puts us in an enviable competitive position. This intentionally differentiated portfolio and approach will further propel our growth and drive exceptional value for shareholders. Now, Steve will take us through the financial details of the first quarter. Thanks, Alexia. Hi. Look, I think it's a two-fold for us. What we're currently focused on is obviously leveraging our sports brand and sports content through Fox Bet. First through Fox Bet Super 6, and then obviously as we drop sports wagers down into the wager insights at Fox Bet. So, we continue to like that business, we continue to really drive that business and spend a lot of time promoting and marketing it and really building value through our pretty unique sports wagering assets. That's number 1.  And number 2, and I think this is important for us, because obviously what drives the sports businesses is first and foremost live sports and live sports content. And so, we've taken a very clear and -- very clear strategy, and we've been very open about it and very vocal about it, is that we believe the best place for our premium sports is on our broadcast networks. That drives the most value for us, it drives the most value for our affiliates and for distributors that partner with us with retransmission fees. So, by really keeping our content exclusive with our partners, we think we drive a tremendous amount of value, not just for us, but for the whole ecosystem. Hi, Jessica. Thanks, Jessica. Let me share on News monetization and I think you connected us with some of the political revenues that we've seen over this past 12 months and what we're continuing to see. And we believe the mid-term elections and contest next year bode to be truly staggering. So, in a News monetization as you mentioned, the -- our share of audience is in-and-out 55% of cable news viewers is incredibly impressive.  It's a lot of hard work to build that share and maintain it. One of the [Indiscernible] things as a byproduct of that share is really the breadth of our audience as well. And then we have more independents watching Fox News than anyone else. And [Indiscernible] when we have just about an equal number of democrats watching Fox News as watch CNN according to Nielsen.  The breadth of the audience, the fact the audience is also demographically becoming broader is actually bringing in new advertisers and new categories of advertisers on to the news platform. So, it's incredibly pleasing to see. We're seeing scatter pricing for news well above upfronts and the market is strong. Obviously, local news is a big part of our news business as well. We now produce over 1,100 hours of local news per week. Many of our stations are now in -- if they weren't battleground states before, they're now -- after last night, they're now battleground states.  And we'd see a tremendous opportunity for them going forward in this -- as the next political cycle approaches. As far as Nielsen goes, I think Nielsen's all we know -- we like others believe that Nielsen data is imperfect. We'd like to see Nielsen invest further in their data gathering capabilities. I think it affects lower-rated, more fragmented sections of the market more than us, more than particularly in the mass scale of our news audiences and sports audiences. Lastly, Tubi, I want to get to your third question, Jessica. can't remember the specific question that was -- Billing of the Tubi content. It's there's two elements of it. It's obviously the original content on Tubi. These, as you know, are very inexpensive Made-for-TV movies. As I mentioned, they are all designed to be profitable in the very short-term. Two of them were profitable within months, which was tremendous to see. And the second element of the strategy is streaming fast channels. Linear channels such as we have now with sports on Tubi and with news on Tubi, which are very low cost but help them drive the TVT. Thanks, Ben. Hope you're well. In terms of categories, we've seen softness in auto [Indiscernible] you specifically talked about sort of supply chain issues. I think if you look across a couple of categories, it's both supply chain, and I think in some it's shortage of staffing and employment. But where -- in auto being the key one and the largest of those where there continues to be some softness.  But these are more than made up for new categories, and growing categories that are coming into -- certainly onto our platforms. And the local the local side, clearly are wagering is -- mentioned it in my prepared comments, is booming across the local markets. Travel is also coming back and restaurants locally. So, these categories are more than making up for the softness in a couple of categories that are seeing some supply chain issues.  From a national point-of-view we continue to benefit from a very strong upfront and scatter pricing is averaging around 20% up above upfront pricing. Entertainment is a little higher than 20%, New is a little lower than 20%, Sports is about 25%, so it's averaging about 20 and nationally, there's some wavering money, not as much as local. But the crypto category, which is a brand-new category, particularly in sports, is booming as well as finance. And then Tubi International, Tubi currently, other than domestically in the U.S. is in Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. And our focus has been driving the U.S. business. But we do see international as a big opportunity. Thanks, Robert. So, you would -- with all -- as with all our sports rights, we studied very carefully to make sure we have a positive return on them and return on our capital with UEFA, as its 1,500 matches that we have available to us. The -- practically all of them will be on Fox Sports 1 and we will be the backbone of Fox Sports 1 through those summers where the Euros were held.  And so, you'll have the Euros on some summers, really being the backbone of our soccer -- summer soccer. And you'll have FIFA, the World Cups the other summers. So, we think it's a tremendous addition to -- for Fox Sports 1. We will have some games on Fox Broadcasting. We'll have about 4 times as many games as were previously aired on ABC, but that's only our 20 games versus the 5 that showed up on ABC when they had those rights. And we don't revisit putting Euro games live games on Tubi at this stage, although we could. I get the easy one. Now look, Tubi is growing both in users and engagement in TVT. One of the things that you do, you juggle or balanced probably better word than juggle, but then you balance is when you market for new users, you can, through in a digital acquisition tool. Very quickly, again, new users. And depending on how much you want to spend, you can toggle that up and down.  But that's a losing strategy if those users are not engaged and then spend only a short period of time on the platform and then you have to re-market to them, for instance. And so far ahead in the team are very scientific and very experienced and just balancing the new users that they acquire versus the quality of those users and how engaged they are. And it is really why the total view on time, which includes new viewers coming onto the platform really remains the best metric, because it includes all viewers as well as a measure of the engagement that they have. Thank you, Steven. Sure. I appreciate the question. I was surprised that it took 6 questions to get to Fox Bet and Super 6, as obviously, the business that are -- is very meaningful for us. So first of all, I'm not sure how much data I can give on Fox Bet itself. I understand that Flutter reported last night. And as the operator of this business, I don't want to give any information that are market sensitive or that they want to hold closer to the chess. But if you remember the structure of our joint venture, we have a Fox Bet Super 6 with over 5 million users as the number 1 national free-to-play game.  That drops people into Fox Bet. It's critical to realize though that Fox Bet includes in the joint venture and Fox Bet includes PokerStars and iCasino. And so over time as we monetize sports wagering, we also have the benefit of monetizing PokerStars and iCasino in Fox Bet. And what that means as we go through to really take full value and take full grasp of the opportunity fully, we are beginning to explore the process of getting licensed, wagering license, in order to fully capture the value of these tremendous assets for all of our shareholders.  So that's a process that we're just beginning. It's a complicated process because it's a go state-by-state in terms of where we would operate with our joint venture partner these assets. And so, it's probably a process that will take some time. Of course, we're also in our arbitration with Flutter under some of the elements of our options are 50% option of Fox Bet and are 18.6% option in FanDuel. And we expect that arbitration to be complete by June of next year. That's probably much that I can say on Fox Bet."

            "name": "Steve Tomsic",
            "content": "Thanks, Lachlan. And good afternoon. As strong operational execution across our businesses has led to another quarter of impressive financial results. Let me walk you through our start to the fiscal year, before providing some markers that will be helpful as we think through the quarters ahead. In the first quarter of fiscal '22, the Company reported total revenues of $3.05 billion up 12% over the first quarter of fiscal '21, reflecting revenue growth across all operating segments.  Total Company affiliate revenues increased 9% with 14% growth at the television segment and 5.5% growth at the cable segment. The rate of subscriber declines held steady in the quarter with trailing 12-month industry sub-losses, again running at approximately 4.5%. Total Company's advertising revenues increased 17%, reflecting strength in the national and local marketplaces, return of normalized programming schedules following the COVID-related postponements and cancellations last year, and continued strong growth of Tubi.  It is worth noting that this total Company growth was achieved despite the comparison to the prior year quarter when we generated nearly $100 million in net political advertising revenues relating into the presidential election. Total Company other revenues increased 15% in the quarter, primarily due to the return of sports sublicensing revenues and pay-per-view boxing at the cable segment.  Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $1.06 billion, down 9% against the comparative period in fiscal '21, reflecting higher operating expenses associated with the return of normalized sports and entertainment programming, and as we signaled on our fiscal '21 year-end call, increased digital investment at Fox News Media and Tubi. Net income attributable to stockholders of $701 million, or $1.21 per share was down the -- down versus the $1.11 billion or $1.83 per share in the prior-year quarter. This variance reflects the EBITDA movement I just described, along with the one-time gain recognized in other net in the prior-year quarter. This was associated with the reinvestment of cash text pre -payment completely in relation to its acquisition of 21st Century Fox, excluding the impact of non-core items, adjusted EPS of a $1.11 in the current year quarter was down modestly when compared to the $1.88 reported in the prior year quarter. Turning to the performance of our operating segments in the quarter, with cable networks reported a 7% increase in revenues. Cable affiliate revenues increased 5.5%, once again, led by double-digit pricing gains at Fox News.  Cable advertising revenues increased 4% supported by the return of a full-slate of College Football games at the national sports networks, following the COVID -related disruptions that occurred last year, as well as the addition of international soccer matches, including the Gold Cup. Cable advertising growth was also helped by double-digit digital revenue growth at Fox News Media. The partially offset by lower linear advertising revenues of the Fox News Channel due to the absence of the political cycle that we experienced in the prior year.  Cable other revenues increased by $26 million primarily due to the return of sports sublicensing revenues and pay-per-view boxing following the COVID disruption last year, as well as continued subscription maintained at Fox Nation. EBITDA at our cable segment was down $7 million versus the prior-year period, as these healthy revenue growths was offset by higher programming costs, the National Sports Networks, primarily due to the sports scheduling changes I just mentioned, and the anticipated increase in digital investment at Fox News Media, including costs associated with last week's launch of Fox Weather.  Now turning to Television, where we reported a 17% increase in revenues in the quarter. Television affiliate revenues increased 14%, reflecting double-digit increases for both our programming phase from non-owned station affiliates, and for our direct retransmission revenues at owned and operated stations.  This once again reaffirms we are well on track to achieve the Television affiliate revenue growth we outlined at our Investor Day. Television advertising revenues increased 22%, supported by strong ad marketplace, normalized schedules on the Fox network, and sustained momentum of Tubi. At Fox Sports, we benefited from a full slate of college football, the return of the MLB All-Star Game, and the inaugural World Cup of the field of dreams game, all of which were disrupted by COVID last year.  At Fox Entertainment, we resumed a more traditional full schedule, anchored by our primary scripted and unscripted heats. As compared to a schedule last year that was hampered by COVID-related production delays, which compromise the quality of the programming slate. At the Fox Television Stations, we continue to observe a meaningful rebound in the base market with our core ad revenues up high single-digits, which partially offset the absence of historic political advertising revenues that we experienced last year.  Rounding out the Television segment. As Lachlan mentioned, Tubi more than doubled its revenues against the prior year. The fact that growth in monetization is outpacing the significant growth in total view time is testament to the revenue synergies delivered from bringing Tubi into the Fox portfolio. Finally, EBITDA at our Television segment was down $98 million against the prior year period, as this healthy revenue growth was offset by higher programming costs primarily associated with normalized sports and entertainment schedules at the Fox network, and increased digital investment at Tubi.  Turning now to cash flow, where our free cash flow deficit of $24 million is consistent with the seasonality of our working capital cycle, with the first half of our fiscal year is characterized by a concentration of payments for sports rights, and the buildup of advertising related receivables, both of which reverse in the second half of our fiscal year. So far, this fiscal year, we have returned $440 million of capital to shareholders, comprising approximately $140 million in the form of our semi-annual dividend payment, and a further $300 million directed towards our ongoing share repurchase program.  Against our enhanced buyback authorization of $4 billion, we have now cumulatively repurchased approximately $1.9 billion representing over 9% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in November 2019. From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $5.4 billion in cash and $7.95 billion in debt. As we look out over the remainder of our fiscal year, we'd like to remind you of a handful of markets.  Firstly, at fiscal Q2 will comp against the heightened new cycle and record political revenues of nearly $250 million that we delivered across the Company in the December quarter of last year, most of which was ending our television segment. On our last call, we discussed our plans to invest $200 million to $300 million on a net EBITDA basis into the expansion and acceleration of our digital assets. With a relatively modest amount deployed today, the phasing of these investments will be skewed toward the final three quarters of the fiscal year. From an affiliate revenue perspective, there are at least two things worth calling out.  Firstly, you will recall that last year's college football season was shortened and included a number of game cancellations. As such, we will have the tailwind of comparing against an accrual for potential distribution credits booked at the National Sports Networks in the December quarter of last year. And secondly, as I mentioned on our last call, we have a live affiliate renewal cycle with only 5% of that total Company distribution revenues up for renewal this year.  As a result, we expect the growth in affiliate revenues to moderate over the course of this fiscal year, before we say the progress for more meaningful rate increases from the 70% of total Company affiliate revenues that comes year across our fiscal '23 and '24. In the start of our affiliate revenue cycle next year, it's just one pace of what should be an exceptional fiscal '23 for Fox, as we look ahead to Super Bowl 57, the FIFA World Cup, the exit of our Thursday night football deal, and November's midterm elections. And with that, I will now turn the call back to Joe. Billing of the Tubi content."

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the conference over to Chief Investor Relations Officer, Ms. Gabrielle Brown. Please go ahead, Ms. Brown.\nGabrielle Brown: Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our fiscal 2023 fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me on the call today are Lachlan Murdoch, Executive Chair and Chief Executive Officer; John Nallen, Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Tomsic, our Chief Financial Officer. First, Lachlan and Steve will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter, and then we'll take questions from the investment community. Please note that this call may include forward-looking statements regarding FOX Corporation's financial performance and operating results. These statements are based on management's current expectations, and actual results could differ from what is stated as a result of certain factors identified on today's call and in the company's SEC filings. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA or EBITDA, as we refer to it on this call. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and our SEC filings, which are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Lachlan.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks, Gabby, and thanks everyone for joining us this morning. With this morning's earnings release, we closed out a very strong fiscal 2023, fueled by successes across every aspect of our business. While Steve will cover the details of the fourth quarter in just a moment, for the full year we generated record annual revenue and EBITDA. Notably, we reported revenue growth of 7%, including 12% advertising growth, supported by major tentpole events like the midterm election, Super Bowl LVII and the FIFA Men's World Cup, as well as outstanding growth of Tubi and 3% affiliate growth led by the first one-third of our distribution renewal cycle. These results demonstrate that FOX's differentiated strategy continues to deliver engaged audiences at scale for our advertising and distribution partners across our sports and news verticals, while also driving exceptional growth across our digital businesses. In a world of increasing audience fragmentation FOX's collective linear and digital viewership was up 8% year-over-year. The onscreen reflection of that strategy was clearly apparent throughout fiscal '23 across our networks and platforms. FOX's broadcast of Super Bowl LVII was the most watched TV show of all time. Our Thanksgiving Day game was the most watched NFL regular season game of all time and the US-England match was the most watched US Men's World Cup match of all time. FOX News maintained its lead as both a top-rated national cable news channel, as well as the top-rated network across the entire cable ecosystem and ranks as the number two national network in all of US Television. And on the streaming front, Tubi made its debut in Nielsen's The Gauge, growing total consumption in fiscal 2023 by 79%, making it the number one AVOD player with consumption levels equal to a top five cable network. Tubi's fiscal '23 was nothing short of spectacular, underpinned by growth in total view time which in turn powered revenue growth. It was a year of increased awareness and engagement for Tubi, whether that was being recognized by Nielsen as America's most watched AVOD service, it's expanding content library and TBT metrics or the five Cannes Lions awards bestowed upon Tubi's Super Bowl spot. Each quarter, during the year saw successive gains at Tubi and the fiscal fourth quarter was its most impressive of all, with revenue growth of 47%, driven by strong engagement with total viewer time growing by 65%. Each month of the quarter set new records from monthly viewers. With Tubi's revenue and engagement accelerating in fiscal '23, we are looking to further strengthen Tubi's position in fiscal '24. To that end, we are very excited to welcome Anjali Sud, as the new CEO of Tubi and look forward to seeing Tubi flourish further under her leadership. At FOX News Media, we continue to lead both in ratings and engagement. The FOX News Channel ended the fourth quarter as the most watched cable network in total day for the ninth consecutive quarter, while maintaining its lead as the most watch cable news network beating CNN and MSNBC in both total viewers in the demo for both prime time and total day. FOX News debuted its tweaked prime time lineup last month. We are pleased with the initial results and are confident that our deep bench of talent will continue to set the standard for all news services as we move towards the 2024 presidential election. This past year, FOX News' leadership position was never at risk. We sustained double-digit advantages in total viewership of our nearest competitors for the entire fiscal year even during the period where our prime time lineup was in transition. In fact, since its mid-July debut FOX News' new prime time lineup is up over 35% in total viewers and up over 40% in the 25 to 54 demographic versus the June schedule. Meanwhile the FOX Business Network ended the quarter as the most watched business cable news network beating CNBC and total viewers during the business day for the fifth consecutive quarter. Across at FOX Entertainment, we had a solid year notching multiple wins including the number one entertainment telecast with Next Level Chef, the number one new drama of 2023 with the Accused and the number one new unscripted series with Special Forces: World's Toughest Test. Our local TV stations have delivered a record midterm election sales cycle that was just shy of the last presidential cycle. We are very pleased with fiscal 2023 a year where FOX again delivered best-in-class results and further differentiated itself from its peers. We enter fiscal 2024 from a position of strength despite headwinds facing our industry and the lingering effect of some macroeconomic uncertainty. We will renew the next one-third of our distribution agreements and navigate a variable ad environment supported by solid results from the recent upfront for our unique content offering, which distinguishes itself in any marketplace. You've heard me say this many times, FOX's focus strategy is different from our peers. It's uniquely good. Nowhere is that more evident than in the current environment where FOX's leadership position is proven. In this year's upfront, we believe FOX led the market in both price and volume across our live sports and news offerings. While it's early in the quarter, underlying ad trends have shown signs of improvement over last quarter. We are seeing an uptick in scatter driven largely by sports and national news is solid. And at Tubi, we saw further momentum in both revenue and TBT growth in July. This promises to be another strong year for FOX as we wrap up the Women's World Cup in a few weeks with stellar advertising support before kicking off American football in early September with the Big Ten and the NFL. We're already seeing our live sporting events continue to break records with the Women's World Cup broadcast. The US versus the Netherlands on FOX was the most watched Women's World Cup group stage match ever on US English language television. We'll also broadcast our first UEFA European soccer championship later this year. Further, we expect that our relaunch news lineup will continue its momentum as we head into the presidential election cycle, which will also be a boon to our local stations. And, of course, we expect Tubi's growth and scale to extend even further. Underpinning all of this, we can't forget our balance sheet, which remains robust even after this year's legal costs. We ended the quarter with $4.3 billion in cash and approximately $7.2 billion in debt, giving us a net leverage ratio of roughly one-time, the best balance sheet in the business. We have said it time and time again, our mix of assets puts us in a uniquely stronger position than our peers. With this strength and our relentless focus on our core business, we are committed to delivering value for our shareholders in a thoughtful and disciplined manner as we look forward to 2024. And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve to take you through the operating details of the quarter and full year. \nSteve Tomsic: Thanks, Lachlan, and good morning, everyone. Fox delivered strong financial results for fiscal 2023 with total company revenue growth of 7% and record EBITDA. Advertising revenues across the company were up 12% led by a 17% increase in our television segment, made all the more impressive when comparing against revenues generated from last year's broadcast to Thursday night football. This growth was driven by a banner year of events including the record-breaking Super Bowl LVII, FIFA Men's World Cup and the midterm election cycle along with the considerable momentum we are driving at Tubi. We completed approximately one-third of our distribution renewals this year, supporting the lift in our total company affiliate fee revenues of 3%. As signaled previously, the impact from these initial renewals primarily benefited our television segment leading to an 8% increase year-over-year. Total company other revenues saw a 5% increase, the result of the full year impact of MarVista, TMZ and Studio Ramsay Global which were acquired in fiscal 2022 along with the higher FOX Nation subscription revenues. From a bottom line perspective, this robust company-wide revenue growth was the key driver of the 8% increase in full year EBITDA to $3.19 billion. Net income attributable to stockholders was $1.24 billion or $2.33 per share, up versus $1.21 billion or $2.11 per share reported in fiscal 2022. As you may recall, other net was impacted this year by charges associated with the FOX News Media litigation and the gain associated with the change in fair value of the company's investment in Flutter. Excluding this impact and other non-core items, full year adjusted net income increased 17% to $1.87 billion with adjusted EPS up 26% to $3.51 per share. Turning to our fiscal fourth quarter results, Fox delivered total company revenues of $3.03 billion which is consistent with the amount reported in Q4 fiscal 2022. Quarterly EBITDA was $735 million down from the $770 million in the prior year. This was largely due to the cyclical comparison with the prior year's midterm election and advertising impacts on our FOX News and FOX Entertainment businesses along with a modest increase in overall expenses. Total company affiliate revenues grew 3% in the quarter, as the pricing benefits from our recent renewals were partially offset by the impact of industry subscriber declines. Total company advertising revenues decreased 4%, which was primarily a result of lower political advertising revenues at our television stations, especially when compared to our June -- record June quarter last year, along with the impact of a softer direct response marketplace of FOX News Media. The momentum we have seen at Tubi throughout the fiscal year accelerated in our fourth quarter with revenue up 47% on the back of increased engagement and stable pricing. Total company other revenues were essentially unchanged from the prior year. Growth in total company expenses was a healthy 1% and includes investments at Tubi albeit at a slower rate than Tubi's revenue growth and the expansion of the USFL as well as higher programming rights amortization and production costs at FOX Sports. Net income attributable to stockholders of $375 million or $0.74 per share was up versus the $306 million or $0.55 per share reported in the prior year quarter. As the EBITDA movements just described along with the restructuring and other below-the-line costs were more than offset by the mark-to-market increases of our investment in Flutter. Excluding non-core items adjusted net income in the quarter increased to $443 million and adjusted EPS increased 19% to $0.88 per share. Now turning to the quarterly results of our main operating segments. At Cable networks, fourth quarter revenue saw a 3% decrease year-over-year. Cable affiliate fee revenues were down 2% in the quarter, as pricing gains from our affiliate renewals were more than offset by net subscriber declines of approximately 8%. Cable advertising revenues fell 11% largely on the back of the softer direct response marketplace at FOX News, while cable other revenues increased 7% led by revenues generated by the second season of the USFL. Quarterly adjusted EBITDA at cable was down 7% as these revenue impacts were partially offset by lower expenses, led by lower digital and use gathering costs at FOX News Media, partially offset by higher costs associated with the USFL. Our Television segment reported 4% growth in quarterly revenues. This was led by a 9% increase in Television affiliate fee revenues with healthy growth in pricing across Fox owned-and-operated and Fox-affiliated stations continued to outpace the impact from subscriber declines. Television advertising revenues fell 1% as the strong growth at Tubi was offset by lower off-cycle political revenues and a slower rebound in the base market of the FOX Television stations and lower ratings at FOX Entertainment. Television other revenues grew 8% in the quarter, primarily a result of increased activity at our entertainment production companies. Quarterly adjusted EBITDA at our Television segment remained flat compared to the prior year quarter as the increase in revenues was offset by higher expenses where we had higher programming rights amortization and production costs at FOX Sports. Costs at Tubi were also higher than the prior year however this was outpaced by the rate of revenue growth to deliver improved EBITDA in the quarter. During the full year, we generated free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx of $1.4 billion inclusive of legal settlement payments. Before we get to capital allocation and balance sheet, it is worth noting some key items for fiscal 2024. We will of course be comparing to the marquee events of fiscal 2023 including the Super Bowl and the midterm election cycle, as well as transitioning to the first year of our NFL rights renewal and broadcasting our first UEFA European Championship. At the cable sports networks, we expect margins to improve in fiscal 2024 reflecting our disciplined approach to college sports rights renewals net of sublicensing income. In terms of affiliate revenue we make no predictions on industry subscriber volumes. However, as we've previously indicated we have another third of our total company distribution revenues up for renewal this year and expect to see the benefit of those renewals towards the back half of the year and skewed towards our Television segment. We expect to continue to invest in our growth initiatives. Here Tubi will be the focus of investment spend with the collective portfolio expected to deliver EBITDA in line or better than fiscal 2023. And from a cash flow perspective, we expect Fox will be subject to the new corporate alternative minimum tax beginning this fiscal year. This will not impact our P&L tax provision but will likely elevate our cash taxes in the near-term. However, we still expect to realize the full benefit of our cash tax asset over time. Returning to capital allocation. Over the course of fiscal 2023, we returned $2 billion of capital through the repurchase of 46 million Class A shares and 7.5 million Class B shares. This includes the cash impact of our previously announced $1 billion accelerated share repurchase transaction. This buyback activity was supplemented by over $260 million in dividend payments in the year. And underlining our continued commitment to shareholder returns, today we announced an increase in our semiannual dividend to $0.26 per share. With the payment of this dividend, we will have cumulatively returned over $6 billion of capital to our shareholders since the spin in 2019. This includes over $4.6 billion of share repurchases including the ASR, representing over 22% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in November 2019. This is all supported by the strength of our balance sheet, where as Lachlan mentioned we ended the quarter with $4.3 billion in cash and approximately $7.2 billion in debt. Fiscal 2023 was another year of strategic focus and strong execution at Fox. That combined with the most robust balance sheet in the industry supports our ongoing commitment to capital returns as well as flexibility to pursue value accretive investment. And with that, let's turn the call back to Gabby to get started with Q&A.\nGabrielle Brown: Thank you, Steve. And now we would be happy to take questions from the investment community.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Phil Cusick from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. \nPhil Cusick: Hi, guys. A couple of quick ones, if I can. First, ESPN talking about looking for partners. Given your portfolio of sports rights, could a sports-centric JV makes sense for FOX? And alternatively would a league investment in a peer or competitor run into legal issues? And then second, can you just give us any update on the overall ad environment including demand for linear and -- versus digital? Thank you.\nLachlan Murdoch: Hi, Phil. Hi, good morning. Thanks for the questions. So as regards, FOX Sports and our sports portfolio and any sort of direct-to-consumer proposition I think the -- our business is fundamentally very similar to ESPN's. And so, we face the same strategic priorities as they do and probably looking at doing -- looking at similar paths forward, as we go forward with our portfolio. The thing that we put first and foremost is, really to protect our premium sports content and place it in front of consumers, wherever we can. At the moment, that premium content drives the most value from being behind a paywall, within the traditional cable and satellite pay-TV universe. And we think that pay-TV ecosystem, continues to be of tremendous value for our businesses and really drives the value of FOX Sports and that content, and will for a long time to come.  Having said that, as consumer demands change, consumer tastes change, we will endeavor to put our content and our brands in front of consumers in whichever manner, makes the most sense for them, provided that it remains behind a pay wall and we get full value for those rights and those brands. But it's very important to say, it's not an either-or proposition. It's not a -- we don't envision a moment, when you leave a pay-TV universe and quickly transition to a direct-to-consumer universe, we think you'll enter a phase where both are important. You're not choosing between one or the other or ultimately, the consumer might choose between one or the other, but we'll be well positioned in any distribution mechanism. So as -- I can't answer your question on the legal ramifications, of having league investors in AM in a platform. But I can give you an update, on the broader advertising environment. We're very pleased with our upfront from a national advertising perspective. Our upfront results, were very pleasing. We were able to drive both pricing and volume, across our key categories of news and sports. And obviously, you've heard about the tremendous growth at Tubi, this past quarter and in fact all year. Categories that really impacted the upfront, were like positive -- in August for national remaining with national auto mobiles, very strong category for us travel in the upfront very strong in pharmaceuticals. From a local perspective, if you look at a local pacing, ex-political obviously, we've got a year-on-year comparison with very strong political year, last year. Ex-political, we're pacing flat to slightly up. That includes some of the local digital revenues. And those categories similar auto was very strong. Financial service was strong. Health, but offset by softness in sort of retail telecom, and we know as we've talked about in past quarters our wagering. So overall, we're very pleased with where we are and we think we're going to have a pretty decent second half -- calendar second half. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif from Bank of America. Please go ahead. \nJessica Reif: Thank you. Just moving back to the balance sheet. I know, you've commented in your prepared remarks, but litigation aside, you really do have the strongest balance sheet. And at this point, it feels -- it seems like there are attractive assets possible, attractive assets at depressed multiples. Can you give us a little bit more of your thought process in terms of what you \u2013 what areas are interesting to you, or is it really just about returning capital to shareholders? And then on content, you mentioned the sports step-up with the NFL, but overall content spend like entertainment, are you rethinking, how you're spending on entertainment both overall content spend up or down in coming years?\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks very much, Jessica. On the balance sheet and Steve can chime in, but we continue to agree with you wholeheartedly, that I think we have the best balance sheet in the business. It gives us tremendous flexibility moving forward in both how we return capital to shareholders, whether it's through dividends or share repurchases. I think Steve mentioned in his remarks, I mean we repurchased $2 billion worth of shares this past year. That's probably an elevated level because as we look across the landscape, we didn't see any attractive M&A opportunities this past year that particularly caught our attention. We are always looking for businesses that fit our portfolio that will be attractive growth businesses for the business. But we take this with a \u2013 what's the word dispassion \u2013 dispassionate kind of view in terms of what's going to drive the best sort of long-term shareholder value. So we balance up return of capital and sort of accretive value opportunities on pretty much a daily basis. So Steve, do you want to add anything to that? \nSteve Tomsic: Yes. No, I think that's exactly right, Lachlan. The balance sheet that we've assembled gives us the flexibility to look at everything and we'll ultimately do what delivers ultimately the best value for shareholders. Jessica just on your content spend question. Next year is a bit of \u2013 the year-on-year change is heavily influenced by the fact that we don't have a Super Bowl running through the amortization line of our content costs. But if you look sort of through that, we would expect content spend to increase. We've got increasing rights amortization costs of the sports business. The entertainment business from a linear perspective probably holds steady, if you normalize for the strike. It will probably be down, given the strike. But then we're going to continue to invest in content at Tubi. Some of that is passive in the form of revenue share payments but we'll also be active in terms of production and licensing costs and use as a relatively sort of low growth but continued growth in increased spend in content. So hopefully, that gives you enough color there. \nGabrielle Brown: Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of John Hodulik from UBS. Please go ahead.\nJohn Hodulik: Thanks. You guys recently announced that you'll be winding down FOX Bet. So I guess three quick ones. Sort of first any financial implications to that? Has your view on the sort of sports betting opportunity in the US changed? And anything you could tell us about your sports betting strategy going forward? Thanks.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks, John. Why don't I start back to front with the strategy and the shuttering of FOX Bet, the joint venture at least end \u2013 and Steve can jump in on the financial implications. So yes, as we announced last week, it was announced last week, Flutter exercised its right to terminate the FOX Bet joint venture. They have every right to do this. They were the operator and really the entire funder of FOX Bet. And when they reached a certain benchmark investment, they had the right to cancel that joint venture and really chose to focus on their other brand FanDuel, which is America's number one sports wagering site. So while it's fair to say we were disappointed by this outcome, ultimately we aspire to be operators of a wagering \u2013 sports wagering business. Now we did anticipate it. And I can't stress more that we are extremely pleased with the financial outcome and the value creation through FOX Bet that we have generated for all of our shareholders. And to explain that, I should just step back a moment and remind everyone of a couple of things. FOX Bet, we didn't spend any capital in FOX Bet. That was entirely funded by Flutter. And we had the option to pick up 50% of FOX Bet upon licensing if we became a licensed betting operator in the United States. So while we didn't put any cash into the FOX Bet joint venture, I think, we've derived -- we were extremely successful and we derived significant value from it. One of the remaining elements of value coming out of FOX Bet is the brand of FOX Bet Super 6, which is the most successful free-to-play wagering business in the United States and offers a tremendous funnel for wagering sites going forward. And this is a brand and an operation that we continue -- we will continue to operate. Of course, we anticipated this potential outcome with -- started moving away from FOX Bet. So we were able to negotiate our 18.6% option in FanDuel as I mentioned the number one site in the United States. If you just look at the value of DraftKings -- the increasing value of DraftKings over recent times some people have put that value of our option in FanDuel of up to $2 billion. So we are very pleased with that outcome and we wish FanDuel every continued success. We also as part of this journey invested into the top co at Flutter purchasing 2.5% of the business for roughly $400 million. I think that investment now sits at a value of over $800 million. And importantly, now as we move forward we are now free to work with any of the other betting operators. Many of them have reached out to us already. So we feel our existing sort of performance in FOX Bet has been terrific. We've built a tremendous amount of value and we're really positioned well to continue to benefit from the emergence of sports wager in the United States. That gives you kind of an overview of where we are. It's an important time. But Steve do you want to mention any of the financial?\nSteve Tomsic: Yes. That's a pretty comprehensive overview and financial overview. So financially just to reiterate as Lachlan mentioned we weren't funding the business at all. So there's no change to us from that perspective. There were some pretty small, sort of, commercial payments between FOX Bet and Fox, which will be -- which are immaterial to us in the grand scheme of things and is potentially ameliorated by the fact that we're now sort of free to look at other partnerships. So from that perspective I think it's a bit of a push either way. And then as Lachlan mentioned we absolutely preserve the value of the FanDuel option which is very valuable to us as well as the value of our holding in the headstock. But, I think, Lachlan covered it pretty well in his opening remarks. \nGabrielle Brown: Operator next question please. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. \nBen Swinburne: Thanks. Good morning. Lachlan can you talk a little bit more about the long-term strategy around Tubi, particularly, on the programming side how you see that product evolving over a multiyear period? And I don't know if --I apologize if you guys have already talked about it but any sense of, sort of, the impact from EBITDA Tubi? Is that still in investment mode? Like when do you see that turning profitable? And I was just curious if you could talk about the Big Ten quickly with the additional expansion whether that's going to have a notable financial impact as you guys go into the season as the Big Ten becomes I think the Big 16 now? Thank you.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks, Ben. Look first on Tubi the \u2013 obviously, Anjali she starts September 1 and we're looking forward to her adding her expertise and experience to the business. And obviously with any incoming CEO, I'm sure you'll see it with fresh eyes and find fresh opportunities. If you look at the Tubi business today, the TBT growth has really been everything. It's grown tremendously rapidly and strongly. And then what that's done is then that's obviously driven advertising opportunities and revenue. TBT growth continues to grow at a faster pace than revenue. So you see fill rates not actually keeping up to pace with TBT growth, which is a good thing, because there's actually more opportunities to place our clients' advertising than we can fill at the moment and that's really driven by the strong viewership growth. I think over time, and I should also say with the viewership growth I think one of the key differentiators for Tubi, if you look across the AVOD market is that it's primarily built on an on-demand platform. So our viewers are actively -- proactively clicking on content to watch. And so we know, they're engaged and we know they're in front of their screens watching that content. This is very different from just a fast channel where someone might tune in the channel and then leave it on and it auto plays in the background. There's an absolute room and a place for fast channels. Tubi has a fast channel service within it. But I think 90% of his viewing is actually from video-on-demand people proactively clicking on that content and coming to us to watch that movie or that TV show. And the library of those movies and TV shows continues to grow. I think this time last quarter, we had 55,000 titles. We now have 60,000 titles which equates to roughly 200,000 hours of individual movies and TV shows for our consumers to enjoy. So that will continue. I think one of the areas that we'll be looking at is expanding the categories that we're strong in. There's certain sort of content categories and verticals that we are super serving and other ones that we can continue to -- there's some low-hanging fruit to continue to monetize. Steve, do you want to talk to the EBITDA investment? \nSteve Tomsic: Yeah. Sure. So Ben, I'm not sure, if you caught it in the opening remarks. In terms of Tubi the investment for the full year was sort of in the low to mid negative 200 range, which is similar to where we had it in fiscal 2022. The quarter we were actually better we were better by nearly $30 million. As we look to 2024 Tubi's an absolute shining light from our growth portfolio our digital portfolio. And given the momentum, we're seeing in the business, whether it be what we just saw in Q4 what we're seeing already in July, it sort of behooves us to continue to invest in that business. And so you should expect to see the same net investment level or even a bit more going into fiscal 2024, but that will be offset as we look at the broader growth portfolio by things like nation weather USFL sort of coming back a bit in terms of investment. So -- but we were pretty excited and sort of very convinced of Tubi so we're going to continue to maintain our leadership position there. \nLachlan Murdoch: And just finally on the Big Ten as regards to University of Oregon and University of Washington coming into the Big Ten conference, look, we just think these additions will only strengthen our call it football franchise across FOX Sports, but particularly our partnership and it is a partnership in the Big Ten Network. So we think it's very positive for us across the board.\nGabrielle Brown: Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Okay. That question comes from the line of Robert Fishman from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nRobert Fishman: Good evening. After seeing some of the news earlier this year with CBS and its affiliates negotiating with the vMVPDs can you just help us think about how Fox's relationship is with affiliates today? And with this backdrop, if you can talk about your confidence about continuing to grow affiliate fees despite the elevated levels of cord cutting? Thank you.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thank you very much, Robert. So look, our relation with affiliates is very strong. We catch up with them regularly. And we understand the headwinds facing broadcast television. And we're without -- in our station group right we see -- have all the same issues that they have. So we're simpatico with them in both the opportunities and the risk of the headwinds in that business. We are pretty -- what's the word vocal or proud of the fact that we've protected our key sports franchises for pay- TV environment, but also the -- for our affiliates, our distribution our most important distribution partners. We don't take our NFL games and put them anywhere else. We keep them exclusive for our distribution partners. And I think that's understood and very well received. And because of that, I think we will be able to continue to drive the sort of industry-leading pricing, both in a pay universe and free universe. And that pricing will certainly continue to ameliorate or balance any reduction in subscriber erosion and subscribers across the universe. So, that's where we feel we are with our affiliates. And I think, we're in a pretty good place for them.\nGabrielle Brown: Great. At this point we are out of time. But if you have any further questions, please give me or Dan Carey a call. Thank you once again for joining today's call.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Lachlan Murdoch",
            "content": "Thanks, Gabby, and thanks everyone for joining us this morning. With this morning's earnings release, we closed out a very strong fiscal 2023, fueled by successes across every aspect of our business. While Steve will cover the details of the fourth quarter in just a moment, for the full year we generated record annual revenue and EBITDA. Notably, we reported revenue growth of 7%, including 12% advertising growth, supported by major tentpole events like the midterm election, Super Bowl LVII and the FIFA Men's World Cup, as well as outstanding growth of Tubi and 3% affiliate growth led by the first one-third of our distribution renewal cycle. These results demonstrate that FOX's differentiated strategy continues to deliver engaged audiences at scale for our advertising and distribution partners across our sports and news verticals, while also driving exceptional growth across our digital businesses. In a world of increasing audience fragmentation FOX's collective linear and digital viewership was up 8% year-over-year. The onscreen reflection of that strategy was clearly apparent throughout fiscal '23 across our networks and platforms. FOX's broadcast of Super Bowl LVII was the most watched TV show of all time. Our Thanksgiving Day game was the most watched NFL regular season game of all time and the US-England match was the most watched US Men's World Cup match of all time. FOX News maintained its lead as both a top-rated national cable news channel, as well as the top-rated network across the entire cable ecosystem and ranks as the number two national network in all of US Television. And on the streaming front, Tubi made its debut in Nielsen's The Gauge, growing total consumption in fiscal 2023 by 79%, making it the number one AVOD player with consumption levels equal to a top five cable network. Tubi's fiscal '23 was nothing short of spectacular, underpinned by growth in total view time which in turn powered revenue growth. It was a year of increased awareness and engagement for Tubi, whether that was being recognized by Nielsen as America's most watched AVOD service, it's expanding content library and TBT metrics or the five Cannes Lions awards bestowed upon Tubi's Super Bowl spot. Each quarter, during the year saw successive gains at Tubi and the fiscal fourth quarter was its most impressive of all, with revenue growth of 47%, driven by strong engagement with total viewer time growing by 65%. Each month of the quarter set new records from monthly viewers. With Tubi's revenue and engagement accelerating in fiscal '23, we are looking to further strengthen Tubi's position in fiscal '24. To that end, we are very excited to welcome Anjali Sud, as the new CEO of Tubi and look forward to seeing Tubi flourish further under her leadership. At FOX News Media, we continue to lead both in ratings and engagement. The FOX News Channel ended the fourth quarter as the most watched cable network in total day for the ninth consecutive quarter, while maintaining its lead as the most watch cable news network beating CNN and MSNBC in both total viewers in the demo for both prime time and total day. FOX News debuted its tweaked prime time lineup last month. We are pleased with the initial results and are confident that our deep bench of talent will continue to set the standard for all news services as we move towards the 2024 presidential election. This past year, FOX News' leadership position was never at risk. We sustained double-digit advantages in total viewership of our nearest competitors for the entire fiscal year even during the period where our prime time lineup was in transition. In fact, since its mid-July debut FOX News' new prime time lineup is up over 35% in total viewers and up over 40% in the 25 to 54 demographic versus the June schedule. Meanwhile the FOX Business Network ended the quarter as the most watched business cable news network beating CNBC and total viewers during the business day for the fifth consecutive quarter. Across at FOX Entertainment, we had a solid year notching multiple wins including the number one entertainment telecast with Next Level Chef, the number one new drama of 2023 with the Accused and the number one new unscripted series with Special Forces: World's Toughest Test. Our local TV stations have delivered a record midterm election sales cycle that was just shy of the last presidential cycle. We are very pleased with fiscal 2023 a year where FOX again delivered best-in-class results and further differentiated itself from its peers. We enter fiscal 2024 from a position of strength despite headwinds facing our industry and the lingering effect of some macroeconomic uncertainty. We will renew the next one-third of our distribution agreements and navigate a variable ad environment supported by solid results from the recent upfront for our unique content offering, which distinguishes itself in any marketplace. You've heard me say this many times, FOX's focus strategy is different from our peers. It's uniquely good. Nowhere is that more evident than in the current environment where FOX's leadership position is proven. In this year's upfront, we believe FOX led the market in both price and volume across our live sports and news offerings. While it's early in the quarter, underlying ad trends have shown signs of improvement over last quarter. We are seeing an uptick in scatter driven largely by sports and national news is solid. And at Tubi, we saw further momentum in both revenue and TBT growth in July. This promises to be another strong year for FOX as we wrap up the Women's World Cup in a few weeks with stellar advertising support before kicking off American football in early September with the Big Ten and the NFL. We're already seeing our live sporting events continue to break records with the Women's World Cup broadcast. The US versus the Netherlands on FOX was the most watched Women's World Cup group stage match ever on US English language television. We'll also broadcast our first UEFA European soccer championship later this year. Further, we expect that our relaunch news lineup will continue its momentum as we head into the presidential election cycle, which will also be a boon to our local stations. And, of course, we expect Tubi's growth and scale to extend even further. Underpinning all of this, we can't forget our balance sheet, which remains robust even after this year's legal costs. We ended the quarter with $4.3 billion in cash and approximately $7.2 billion in debt, giving us a net leverage ratio of roughly one-time, the best balance sheet in the business. We have said it time and time again, our mix of assets puts us in a uniquely stronger position than our peers. With this strength and our relentless focus on our core business, we are committed to delivering value for our shareholders in a thoughtful and disciplined manner as we look forward to 2024. And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve to take you through the operating details of the quarter and full year. Hi, Phil. Hi, good morning. Thanks for the questions. So as regards, FOX Sports and our sports portfolio and any sort of direct-to-consumer proposition I think the -- our business is fundamentally very similar to ESPN's. And so, we face the same strategic priorities as they do and probably looking at doing -- looking at similar paths forward, as we go forward with our portfolio. The thing that we put first and foremost is, really to protect our premium sports content and place it in front of consumers, wherever we can. At the moment, that premium content drives the most value from being behind a paywall, within the traditional cable and satellite pay-TV universe. And we think that pay-TV ecosystem, continues to be of tremendous value for our businesses and really drives the value of FOX Sports and that content, and will for a long time to come.  Having said that, as consumer demands change, consumer tastes change, we will endeavor to put our content and our brands in front of consumers in whichever manner, makes the most sense for them, provided that it remains behind a pay wall and we get full value for those rights and those brands. But it's very important to say, it's not an either-or proposition. It's not a -- we don't envision a moment, when you leave a pay-TV universe and quickly transition to a direct-to-consumer universe, we think you'll enter a phase where both are important. You're not choosing between one or the other or ultimately, the consumer might choose between one or the other, but we'll be well positioned in any distribution mechanism. So as -- I can't answer your question on the legal ramifications, of having league investors in AM in a platform. But I can give you an update, on the broader advertising environment. We're very pleased with our upfront from a national advertising perspective. Our upfront results, were very pleasing. We were able to drive both pricing and volume, across our key categories of news and sports. And obviously, you've heard about the tremendous growth at Tubi, this past quarter and in fact all year. Categories that really impacted the upfront, were like positive -- in August for national remaining with national auto mobiles, very strong category for us travel in the upfront very strong in pharmaceuticals. From a local perspective, if you look at a local pacing, ex-political obviously, we've got a year-on-year comparison with very strong political year, last year. Ex-political, we're pacing flat to slightly up. That includes some of the local digital revenues. And those categories similar auto was very strong. Financial service was strong. Health, but offset by softness in sort of retail telecom, and we know as we've talked about in past quarters our wagering. So overall, we're very pleased with where we are and we think we're going to have a pretty decent second half -- calendar second half. Thanks very much, Jessica. On the balance sheet and Steve can chime in, but we continue to agree with you wholeheartedly, that I think we have the best balance sheet in the business. It gives us tremendous flexibility moving forward in both how we return capital to shareholders, whether it's through dividends or share repurchases. I think Steve mentioned in his remarks, I mean we repurchased $2 billion worth of shares this past year. That's probably an elevated level because as we look across the landscape, we didn't see any attractive M&A opportunities this past year that particularly caught our attention. We are always looking for businesses that fit our portfolio that will be attractive growth businesses for the business. But we take this with a \u2013 what's the word dispassion \u2013 dispassionate kind of view in terms of what's going to drive the best sort of long-term shareholder value. So we balance up return of capital and sort of accretive value opportunities on pretty much a daily basis. So Steve, do you want to add anything to that? Thanks, John. Why don't I start back to front with the strategy and the shuttering of FOX Bet, the joint venture at least end \u2013 and Steve can jump in on the financial implications. So yes, as we announced last week, it was announced last week, Flutter exercised its right to terminate the FOX Bet joint venture. They have every right to do this. They were the operator and really the entire funder of FOX Bet. And when they reached a certain benchmark investment, they had the right to cancel that joint venture and really chose to focus on their other brand FanDuel, which is America's number one sports wagering site. So while it's fair to say we were disappointed by this outcome, ultimately we aspire to be operators of a wagering \u2013 sports wagering business. Now we did anticipate it. And I can't stress more that we are extremely pleased with the financial outcome and the value creation through FOX Bet that we have generated for all of our shareholders. And to explain that, I should just step back a moment and remind everyone of a couple of things. FOX Bet, we didn't spend any capital in FOX Bet. That was entirely funded by Flutter. And we had the option to pick up 50% of FOX Bet upon licensing if we became a licensed betting operator in the United States. So while we didn't put any cash into the FOX Bet joint venture, I think, we've derived -- we were extremely successful and we derived significant value from it. One of the remaining elements of value coming out of FOX Bet is the brand of FOX Bet Super 6, which is the most successful free-to-play wagering business in the United States and offers a tremendous funnel for wagering sites going forward. And this is a brand and an operation that we continue -- we will continue to operate. Of course, we anticipated this potential outcome with -- started moving away from FOX Bet. So we were able to negotiate our 18.6% option in FanDuel as I mentioned the number one site in the United States. If you just look at the value of DraftKings -- the increasing value of DraftKings over recent times some people have put that value of our option in FanDuel of up to $2 billion. So we are very pleased with that outcome and we wish FanDuel every continued success. We also as part of this journey invested into the top co at Flutter purchasing 2.5% of the business for roughly $400 million. I think that investment now sits at a value of over $800 million. And importantly, now as we move forward we are now free to work with any of the other betting operators. Many of them have reached out to us already. So we feel our existing sort of performance in FOX Bet has been terrific. We've built a tremendous amount of value and we're really positioned well to continue to benefit from the emergence of sports wager in the United States. That gives you kind of an overview of where we are. It's an important time. But Steve do you want to mention any of the financial? Thanks, Ben. Look first on Tubi the \u2013 obviously, Anjali she starts September 1 and we're looking forward to her adding her expertise and experience to the business. And obviously with any incoming CEO, I'm sure you'll see it with fresh eyes and find fresh opportunities. If you look at the Tubi business today, the TBT growth has really been everything. It's grown tremendously rapidly and strongly. And then what that's done is then that's obviously driven advertising opportunities and revenue.

And the library of those movies and TV shows continues to grow. I think this time last quarter, we had 55,000 titles. We now have 60,000 titles which equates to roughly 200,000 hours of individual movies and TV shows for our consumers to enjoy. So that will continue. I think one of the areas that we'll be looking at is expanding the categories that we're strong in. There's certain sort of content categories and verticals that we are super serving and other ones that we can continue to -- there's some low-hanging fruit to continue to monetize. Steve, do you want to talk to the EBITDA investment? And just finally on the Big Ten as regards to University of Oregon and University of Washington coming into the Big Ten conference, look, we just think these additions will only strengthen our call it football franchise across FOX Sports, but particularly our partnership and it is a partnership in the Big Ten Network.

            "name": "Steve Tomsic",
            "content": "Thanks, Lachlan, and good morning, everyone. Fox delivered strong financial results for fiscal 2023 with total company revenue growth of 7% and record EBITDA. Advertising revenues across the company were up 12% led by a 17% increase in our television segment, made all the more impressive when comparing against revenues generated from last year's broadcast to Thursday night football. This growth was driven by a banner year of events including the record-breaking Super Bowl LVII, FIFA Men's World Cup and the midterm election cycle along with the considerable momentum we are driving at Tubi. We completed approximately one-third of our distribution renewals this year, supporting the lift in our total company affiliate fee revenues of 3%. As signaled previously, the impact from these initial renewals primarily benefited our television segment leading to an 8% increase year-over-year. Total company other revenues saw a 5% increase, the result of the full year impact of MarVista, TMZ and Studio Ramsay Global which were acquired in fiscal 2022 along with the higher FOX Nation subscription revenues. From a bottom line perspective, this robust company-wide revenue growth was the key driver of the 8% increase in full year EBITDA to $3.19 billion. Net income attributable to stockholders was $1.24 billion or $2.33 per share, up versus $1.21 billion or $2.11 per share reported in fiscal 2022. As you may recall, other net was impacted this year by charges associated with the FOX News Media litigation and the gain associated with the change in fair value of the company's investment in Flutter. Excluding this impact and other non-core items, full year adjusted net income increased 17% to $1.87 billion with adjusted EPS up 26% to $3.51 per share. Turning to our fiscal fourth quarter results, Fox delivered total company revenues of $3.03 billion which is consistent with the amount reported in Q4 fiscal 2022. Quarterly EBITDA was $735 million down from the $770 million in the prior year. This was largely due to the cyclical comparison with the prior year's midterm election and advertising impacts on our FOX News and FOX Entertainment businesses along with a modest increase in overall expenses. Total company affiliate revenues grew 3% in the quarter, as the pricing benefits from our recent renewals were partially offset by the impact of industry subscriber declines. Total company advertising revenues decreased 4%, which was primarily a result of lower political advertising revenues at our television stations, especially when compared to our June -- record June quarter last year, along with the impact of a softer direct response marketplace of FOX News Media. The momentum we have seen at Tubi throughout the fiscal year accelerated in our fourth quarter with revenue up 47% on the back of increased engagement and stable pricing. Total company other revenues were essentially unchanged from the prior year. Growth in total company expenses was a healthy 1% and includes investments at Tubi albeit at a slower rate than Tubi's revenue growth and the expansion of the USFL as well as higher programming rights amortization and production costs at FOX Sports. Net income attributable to stockholders of $375 million or $0.74 per share was up versus the $306 million or $0.55 per share reported in the prior year quarter. As the EBITDA movements just described along with the restructuring and other below-the-line costs were more than offset by the mark-to-market increases of our investment in Flutter. Excluding non-core items adjusted net income in the quarter increased to $443 million and adjusted EPS increased 19% to $0.88 per share. Now turning to the quarterly results of our main operating segments. At Cable networks, fourth quarter revenue saw a 3% decrease year-over-year. Cable affiliate fee revenues were down 2% in the quarter, as pricing gains from our affiliate renewals were more than offset by net subscriber declines of approximately 8%. Cable advertising revenues fell 11% largely on the back of the softer direct response marketplace at FOX News, while cable other revenues increased 7% led by revenues generated by the second season of the USFL. Quarterly adjusted EBITDA at cable was down 7% as these revenue impacts were partially offset by lower expenses, led by lower digital and use gathering costs at FOX News Media, partially offset by higher costs associated with the USFL. Our Television segment reported 4% growth in quarterly revenues. This was led by a 9% increase in Television affiliate fee revenues with healthy growth in pricing across Fox owned-and-operated and Fox-affiliated stations continued to outpace the impact from subscriber declines. Television advertising revenues fell 1% as the strong growth at Tubi was offset by lower off-cycle political revenues and a slower rebound in the base market of the FOX Television stations and lower ratings at FOX Entertainment. Television other revenues grew 8% in the quarter, primarily a result of increased activity at our entertainment production companies. Quarterly adjusted EBITDA at our Television segment remained flat compared to the prior year quarter as the increase in revenues was offset by higher expenses where we had higher programming rights amortization and production costs at FOX Sports. Costs at Tubi were also higher than the prior year however this was outpaced by the rate of revenue growth to deliver improved EBITDA in the quarter. During the full year, we generated free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx of $1.4 billion inclusive of legal settlement payments. Before we get to capital allocation and balance sheet, it is worth noting some key items for fiscal 2024. We will of course be comparing to the marquee events of fiscal 2023 including the Super Bowl and the midterm election cycle, as well as transitioning to the first year of our NFL rights renewal and broadcasting our first UEFA European Championship. At the cable sports networks, we expect margins to improve in fiscal 2024 reflecting our disciplined approach to college sports rights renewals net of sublicensing income. In terms of affiliate revenue we make no predictions on industry subscriber volumes. However, as we've previously indicated we have another third of our total company distribution revenues up for renewal this year and expect to see the benefit of those renewals towards the back half of the year and skewed towards our Television segment. We expect to continue to invest in our growth initiatives. Here Tubi will be the focus of investment spend with the collective portfolio expected to deliver EBITDA in line or better than fiscal 2023. And from a cash flow perspective, we expect Fox will be subject to the new corporate alternative minimum tax beginning this fiscal year. This will not impact our P&L tax provision but will likely elevate our cash taxes in the near-term. However, we still expect to realize the full benefit of our cash tax asset over time. Returning to capital allocation. Over the course of fiscal 2023, we returned $2 billion of capital through the repurchase of 46 million Class A shares and 7.5 million Class B shares. This includes the cash impact of our previously announced $1 billion accelerated share repurchase transaction. This buyback activity was supplemented by over $260 million in dividend payments in the year. And underlining our continued commitment to shareholder returns, today we announced an increase in our semiannual dividend to $0.26 per share. With the payment of this dividend, we will have cumulatively returned over $6 billion of capital to our shareholders since the spin in 2019. This includes over $4.6 billion of share repurchases including the ASR, representing over 22% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in November 2019. This is all supported by the strength of our balance sheet, where as Lachlan mentioned we ended the quarter with $4.3 billion in cash and approximately $7.2 billion in debt. Fiscal 2023 was another year of strategic focus and strong execution at Fox. That combined with the most robust balance sheet in the industry supports our ongoing commitment to capital returns as well as flexibility to pursue value accretive investment. And with that, let's turn the call back to Gabby to get started with Q&A. Yes. No, I think that's exactly right, Lachlan. The balance sheet that we've assembled gives us the flexibility to look at everything and we'll ultimately do what delivers ultimately the best value for shareholders. Jessica just on your content spend question. Next year is a bit of \u2013 the year-on-year change is heavily influenced by the fact that we don't have a Super Bowl running through the amortization line of our content costs. But if you look sort of through that, we would expect content spend to increase. We've got increasing rights amortization costs of the sports business. The entertainment business from a linear perspective probably holds steady, if you normalize for the strike. It will probably be down, given the strike. But then we're going to continue to invest in content at Tubi. Some of that is passive in the form of revenue share payments but we'll also be active in terms of production and licensing costs and use as a relatively sort of low growth but continued growth in increased spend in content. So hopefully, that gives you enough color there. Yes. That's a pretty comprehensive overview and financial overview. So financially just to reiterate as Lachlan mentioned we weren't funding the business at all. So there's no change to us from that perspective. There were some pretty small, sort of, commercial payments between FOX Bet and Fox, which will be -- which are immaterial to us in the grand scheme of things and is potentially ameliorated by the fact that we're now sort of free to look at other partnerships. So from that perspective I think it's a bit of a push either way. And then as Lachlan mentioned we absolutely preserve the value of the FanDuel option which is very valuable to us as well as the value of our holding in the headstock. But, I think, Lachlan covered it pretty well in his opening remarks. Yeah. Sure. So Ben, I'm not sure, if you caught it in the opening remarks. In terms of Tubi the investment for the full year was sort of in the low to mid negative 200 range, which is similar to where we had it in fiscal 2022. The quarter we were actually better we were better by nearly $30 million. As we look to 2024 Tubi's an absolute shining light from our growth portfolio our digital portfolio. And given the momentum, we're seeing in the business, whether it be what we just saw in Q4 what we're seeing already in July, it sort of behooves us to continue to invest in that business. And so you should expect to see the same net investment level or even a bit more going into fiscal 2024, but that will be offset as we look at the broader growth portfolio by things like nation weather USFL sort of coming back a bit in terms of investment. So -- but we were pretty excited and sort of very convinced of Tubi so we're going to continue to maintain our leadership position there."

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the conference over to Chief Investor Relations Officer, Gabrielle Brown. Please go ahead, Ms. Brown.\nGabrielle Brown: Thank you, Kiley. Good morning, and welcome to our fiscal 2023 third quarter earnings call. Joining me on the call today are Lachlan Murdoch, Executive Chair and Chief Executive Officer; John Nallen, Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Tomsic, our Chief Financial Officer. First, Lachlan and Steve will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter, and then we'll take questions from the investment community. Please note that this call may include forward-looking statements regarding FOX Corporation's financial performance and operating results. These statements are based on management's current expectations, and actual results could differ from what is stated as a result of certain factors identified on today's call and in the company's SEC filings. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA or EBITDA, as we refer to it on this call. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and our SEC filings, which are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Lachlan.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thank you, Gabby, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. FOX's strong fiscal third quarter operating results once again demonstrate the power of our content and the brands it underpins and the repeated capability of our focused strategy to deliver solid financial results. In the quarter, we grew top line revenue by 18%, led by the remarkable 43% growth in advertising and a solid 3% growth in affiliate revenue. Underpinning this performance was a record Super Bowl LVII on the FOX Broadcast Network which generated approximately $650 million of gross advertising revenue across our businesses and was the key driver of our 61% advertising revenue growth at our Television segment. This year's Super Bowl matchup between Kansas City and Philadelphia delivered 115 million viewers across FOX platforms, making Super Bowl LVII the most watched program in U.S. television history and the pinnacle of an extraordinary year for FOX Sports. The strong lineup of programming and advertising demand for FOX Sports continues into our fourth quarter, which includes the return of NASCAR the second season of the USFL, the start of Major League Baseball's 2023 season, the finals of the UEFA Nations League and a first for FOX the Belmont Stakes. Leveraging the reach of a Super Bowl lead-in, we launched the second season of Next Level Chef, which promises to be the next big lifestyle franchise from our Studio Ramsay partnership. Our entertainment business also found success with the number one new series and new drama over the year in Accused and the number one new unscripted series in Special Forces: World's Toughest Test. FOX has now debuted the top new unscripted series for 5 consecutive seasons. In fact, the combined power of our sports and entertainment programming places FOX at number one amongst broadcast network season to date in the key 18 to 49 demo. Our strong sports calendar also had a halo effect at the FOX Television stations, which saw many local advertising verticals higher in the quarter. In what continues to be mixed local advertising market conditions, we are encouraged by growth in categories, including auto, restaurants and entertainment, but are watchful across other categories, including bedding, retail and telecom. Meanwhile, Tubi's performance in the third quarter was nothing short of stellar with revenue growth of 31% supported by sustained gains and engagement, where total view time increased 38% year-on-year. And while still early in the fourth quarter, the April results for Tubi show the momentum across the platform accelerating. Having recently marked the 3-year anniversary of our acquisition of Tubi, our progress over this longer-term time frame is just as impressive having grown quarterly TBT by over 200% and revenue by 400%. Just as importantly, the Tubi brand has asserted itself on the broader media landscape. Our viral Tubi spot in the Super Bowl, which received massive press coverage, had almost 7 billion impressions. And our strong growth and engagement has now led to Tubi's inclusion in Nielsen's The Gauge, marking the first time Tubi has reached 1% of total TV viewing minutes and making Tubi the most watched fast service in the United States. And just last month, we announced the formation of Tubi Media Group, under Paul Cheesbrough, which brings together our digital capabilities in a more formalized and coordinated way to help us better monetize our digital touch points across all our FOX properties. We thank Farhad for his entrepreneurial leadership at Tubi over the last 3 years and, of course, before he leaves the business in terrific shape with an outstanding team to drive continued strong growth. At FOX News Media, we retained our leadership position amongst our peers. The FOX News Channel ended the third quarter as the most watched cable network in total day and prime time while maintaining its lead as the most watched cable news network beating CNN and MSNBC combined. Also notably, the FOX Business Network ended the quarter as the most watched business cable network, leading CNBC in total viewers during the business day and market hours for the fourth consecutive quarter. Let me briefly address the settlement of our dispute with Dominion Voting Systems. We made the business decision to resolve this dispute and avoid the acrimony of a divisive trial and a multiyear appeal process. Our decision clearly in the best interest of the company and its shareholders. The settlement in no way alters FOX's commitment to the highest journalistic standards across our company or our passion for unabashedly reporting the news of the day. We're proud of our FOX News team, the exceptional quality of their journalism and their stewardship of the FOX News brand. Whether it be our coverage of politics and elections, world events such as the war in Ukraine or domestic issues, such as the crisis at the border, our journalists bring compelling news home to our viewers every day. The standards behind this reporting are not only what makes us the number one cable news network by the number one network in all of cable. In fact, in a recent poll, 41% of respondents chose FOX News as their most trusted network news. So as we look ahead, we are confident in the strength of the FOX brands and the strength of our balance sheet. And while we are not completely immune to the headwinds facing the broader industry and the general economy, we are well positioned given our areas of differentiation. Nonetheless, you can expect us to be even more focused on our cost base as we look to reinforce our strategy for future growth. We remain committed to driving long-term shareholder value creation through the thoughtful management of our existing business, the pursuit of new and exciting adjacencies and returning capital to our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Steve to take you through the details of the quarter.\nSteven Tomsic: Thanks, Lachlan, and good morning, everyone. FOX again delivered strong underlying financials in our fiscal third quarter with 18% revenue growth and 3% EBITDA growth, bolstered by a record-breaking Super Bowl LVII. Our advertising revenues increased 43%, led by the Super Bowl, along with the higher volume of NFL playoff windows and accelerating growth at Tubi. Meanwhile, our affiliate revenues grew 3% on the back of pricing benefits from recent renewals partially offset by trailing 12-month subscriber losses continuing to run in the 7% range. Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $833 million, up $22 million over the prior year quarter as these revenue increases were partially offset by higher expenses. This was primarily due to higher sports rights amortization and production costs associated with our NFL, Super Bowl and playoff schedule. The net loss attributable to stockholders was $54 million or negative $0.10 per share compared to net income of $283 million or $0.50 per share reported in the prior year period. The variance was primarily due to other net where we recognize charges associated with the FOX News Media litigation, partially offset by the gain associated with the change in fair value of the company's investments. Excluding these and other noncore items, earnings growth was strong with adjusted net income growing 8% to $494 million and adjusted EPS of $0.94 per share, up $0.13 against last year's $0.81 per share. Now turning to our segments, starting with Television, where revenue grew an impressive 36% in the quarter. Television advertising revenues led this growth with a 61% increase fueled by Super Bowl LVII, which, as Lachlan mentioned, generated over $650 million in gross revenue. We also benefited from 2 additional NFL playoff games, 1 divisional and 1 wildcard partially offset by the timing of 1 less regular season game. Momentum at Tubi remained strong with advertising revenues up 31% to $170 million on the back of increased engagement and stable pricing. These strong advertising tailwinds in the Television segment were partially offset by lower prime time ratings at the FOX Network and mixed base market conditions at our local stations when excluding the Super Bowl. Television affiliate fee revenues were up 9% and as healthy growth in pricing across FOX owned and operated and affiliated stations continued to outpace the impact from subscriber declines. Other revenues remained essentially unchanged from the prior year quarter. EBITDA at our Television segment was up $82 million to $117 million. Expenses increased in the quarter driven by higher costs related to the Super Bowl and a higher volume of NFL games. The increase in expenses was partially offset by lower costs at FOX Entertainment, including the absence of a write-down of certain scripted programming in the prior year quarter. Our net EBITDA investment in Tubi of approximately $60 million was broadly in line with the prior year quarter. At Cable, we saw revenues generally in line with the prior year. Cable advertising revenues were down 7% due to the impact of a softer direct response marketplace at FOX News Media, while being partially offset by the benefit of the World Baseball Classic on the national sports networks. Cable affiliate fee revenues were broadly flat, coming in at $1.1 billion with rate growth broadly offset by subscriber declines. Cable other revenues were up 10% in the quarter led by higher FOX Nation subscription revenues. EBITDA at our Cable segment was $792 million compared to the $864 million reported last year largely due to these revenue impacts along with elevated legal costs at FOX News Media and higher expenses associated with the second season of the USFL and the World Baseball Classic at FOX Sports. Now turning to cash flow where we generated strong free cash flow of $1.48 billion in the quarter, reflecting our normal seasonal cycle of collecting advertising revenues from our fall programming coupled with our major sports rights payments being concentrated in the first half of our fiscal year. From a share repurchase perspective, as we foreshowed on our last call, we continued with our normal cost buyback activity of $250 million in the quarter and deployed $1 billion of additional capital to an accelerated share repurchase transaction. We retired approximately 80% of the shares associated with the ASR in the March quarter and expect the remainder to settle in the coming months. We remain committed to fully utilizing our current $7 billion authorization, where we now cumulatively repurchased approximately $4.4 billion, representing 20% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in November 2019. These meaningful capital return measures are enabled by the strength of our financial position, where we closed the quarter with $4.1 billion in cash and $7.2 billion in debt. While this reported cash balance does not include the impact of the Dominion settlement, we continue to maintain a very robust balance sheet that supports our ongoing commitment to capital returns as well as flexibility to pursue value-accretive investment. And with that, let me turn it back to Gabby to open Q&A.\nGabrielle Brown: Thank you, Steve. And now we would be happy to take questions from the investment community.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go to the line of Robert Fishman with MoffettNathanson.\nRobert Fishman: I have a couple of related questions, if I can. Lachlan, after the Dominion settlement, is there anything that you can share to better understand the future settlement risk? And then related, can you discuss whether the departure of Tucker Carlson will lead to changes in the prime time programming strategy and then potential opportunities for more national advertising?  And then for John and Steve, just if you can expand on the early confidence you have from recent MVPD renewals? And after seeing the acceleration in retrains growth this quarter, any more insight on whether you can get better pricing to outpace the elevated levels of cord-cutting or just more economics from your affiliate partners?\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks, Robert. I don't know where to start. I'll talk about the 7 questions. So -- but thank you very much, and good to hear from you. On -- so let me start and hand over, I suppose, to Steve, for that -- the final questions. So I'm obviously limited about what I can say about any ongoing litigation, but I can make the following comments in regards to Dominion. And I referred to some of this in my prepared remarks. . Look, as we've stated many times, we always acted as a news organization reporting on the newsworthy events of the day. We certainly included allegations being made by the sitting President of the United States and his lawyers in the aftermath of a hotly-contested presidential election. Now we have been and remain confident in the merits of our position that the first amendment protects a news organization's reporting and allegations being made by a sitting President of the United States. However, the Delaware court severely limited our defenses and trial through pre-trial rulings, one example of being not being able to point to the newsworthy nature of the allegations. So we determined that the best course of action for the company and its shareholders was to settle instead of proceeding with a 6-week trial and potentially 2 or even 3 years of appeals. As you know, we have a pending case with Smartmatic, which is a fundamentally different case than Dominion and that all of our full complement of First Amendment defenses remain, and we'll be ready to defend this case surrounding extremely newsworthy events when it goes to trial, likely not until the calendar year 2025. As regards to our programming strategy in prime time, there's no change to our programming strategy at FOX News. It's obviously a successful strategy. And as always, we are adjusting our programming and our lineup, and that's what we continue to do. We are pleased with the strength of the advertising demand throughout our schedule, but particularly prime time.  Steve, do you want to talk to the MVPD?\nSteven Tomsic: Yes, sure, on the affiliate. So Robert, yes, listen, we're pleased with the way our affiliate negotiations are going. You know that this year, we had roughly 34% the total affiliate book up for renewal. We've been successful in generating and establishing new pricing benchmarks for the network in FOX Sports or retrains and Fox Sports in those negotiations. And so with another sort of 1/3 of our book due for renewal in fiscal '24 and a touch under 30% during fiscal '25, we feel pretty confident that we can continue to deliver pricing gains in subscribers. If the subscriber rate of attrition stays at the same level, we expect to post ongoing affiliate revenue growth for the company.\nOperator: And that will come from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.\nBen Swinburne: I just want to ask about advertising. As you guys look into the rest of the year and head into the upfront, does Tubi give you guys an advantage as you go in to what is, at least, I would describe it as a soft demand environment for advertising and trying to drive pricing kind of across your properties, particularly with the new Tubi Media Group, just wondering if you think that's going to matter enough this year for us to maybe notice as we head into the fall.  And then just on the direct response weakness at FOX News, do you guys have any visibility on sort of whether that's improving here in Q4 or what the drivers of that are? Any relationship to sort of some of the broader volatility around FOX News? Just wanted to get your updated thoughts on that.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks, Ben. I'm glad Robert left your question. But on advertising, look, we -- I think you've alluded to a softness in the market. We're really not seeing that across our major platforms. I'll give you a bit of the detail. The national market, the sports market for us is very strong, very robust. Obviously, as we enter the summer, it's a slower acquired, a quieter -- always is a quiet period for us until the fall when our key marquee sports programming is on air, but we are seeing pretty robust demand for time and availability in the sports market. So we're very confident with sports. In news, the direct response issues, which is a market issue, it's not a FOX News issue, has stabilized. So we're not seeing any more deterioration in direct response pricing. So we feel pretty confident in the stabilization of that piece of revenue. Again, that's really a product or a result of oversupply in -- with our competitors with direct response. It's not so much a FOX News issue, but it's something that certainly has affected our ability to achieve the premium pricing that we've been used to. But again, that issue has stabilized, and we think it offers us a pretty good platform going forward. Another thing to mention on news, which is just a small data point, we're seeing political revenue earlier than we've ever seen before. It's still small, but it's sort of unheard of to have it this early in the political cycle. So again, we think that bodes well for the fall and as we enter the more significant part of the political cycle. And then coming on to Tubi, the revenue is accelerating there. It's -- revenue is -- while it's accelerating pretty strongly -- Gabby doesn't want me to give the number. It would break most of your models. But it's not keeping pace with TBT. TBT continues to grow even faster, which is a great metric. So we have the avails. We're looking forward to Tubi being a central part of our upfront negotiations. It's clearly not only a strategic driver for us but have been an important driver going forward. Then when you get down to local base markets, that's where we're seeing more mixed results in the different kind of verticals of revenue. We're very pleased to see auto, again, continuing its rebound with strong growth in the auto category. The entertainment category, we're also seeing growth in and the restaurant category, where we're seeing growth in. But this is offset by weakness across other categories such as retail, telecom, and sports wagering and betting.  So the local market does feel -- overall. But again, we're looking forward for our businesses. Particularly in sports and news, we're looking forward to a strong -- a decent summer and a strong fall season. I think that's all the questions. Thanks, Ben.\nOperator: We'll go to the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.\nPhil Cusick: A couple of questions and then a quick one. On tub, it sounds like your TBT is still outgrowing revenue, but are you starting to unleash the revenue and profit there a little bit. And then on the legal side, any direction on legal expenses from here? And then one stand-alone, any thoughts on appropriate leverage and capital return from here? We appreciate the $1 billion, but how should we think about this? Are you still going to sit on the cash until we get to the next sort of legal view? Or should something happen between now and then?\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks very much, Phil. On -- let me start with Tubi and apologies, Steve, for the capital management element of the question. So on Tubi, we're going to continue to invest in Tubi. It's at the same levels. We've been investing over the last year or so. We just think it's a tremendous opportunity for us. As I mentioned in my comments, the fact that we're now -- Nielsen's Gauge now has us over 1% of the U.S. television viewing is a tremendous sort of benchmark to have hit, and I see continued growth there. So from a consumer aspect and from a marketer's aspect, Tubi is becoming more and more a central part of usage and sort of an opportunity. And this is really because the focus Tubi's had or not -- we think of it over the last 3 years with our involvement, but obviously, the team there has done a tremendous job not only over the last 3 years but before that in really sort of driving sort of the best-in-class personalized AVOD experience, building an incredible library with nearly 55,000 titles in the U.S. alone. And again, to put that in context, that's 5 times the size of the Netflix library and now really being able to monetize that viewing in a more efficient, better way. So we're incredibly optimistic. And I would say the results are -- and we're incredibly pleased with the performance of tb going forward, and we think it's an appropriate area for us to continue to invest in. On the -- I'll turn it over to Steve on the -- on sort of capital management. But just on it, I'll just start by saying, look, we have a $7 billion buyback authorization. I think we spent about $4.4 billion of that. So we've -- my math's incorrect this time of the morning, a $2.6 billion remaining of the authorization. We fully expect to deploy all of that capital back to shareholders through our buyback. And any litigation has no impact on that at all. Yes, Steve.\nSteven Tomsic: Thanks, Lachlan. So Phil, just to go back on legal costs, legal costs over the last two orthree3 quarters have been elevated. Obviously, we've been deep in the depositions and pretrial preparation for Dominion. So I'd expect that to subside over the next couple of quarters. And then to just pick up on Lachlan's point, listen, we -- the leverage is the debt we have, $7.2 billion, we've got a maturity in January, which we'll make a call on as to whether to repay or refinance. But the leverage feels about right where we are at the moment. And our cash position is strong. And so we would anticipate whatever happens with future litigation, we can continue to continue to go with our buyback pacing as it has been over the last couple of years now or a few years now as well as leaving us flexibility to invest in the business or take advantage of any inorganic opportunities, but we'll be balanced about it as we've been saying since the formation of the company.\nOperator: And that will come from the line of John Hodulik with UBS.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Maybe getting back to the sports theme, where viewership remains strong, I'd say, across the board. I mean First of all, how would you gauge the success of the USFL? Second, anything you could tell us about your appetite for additional sports rights, especially to fill in the summer months? And then how does the sort of relative weighting on sports versus entertainment programming position you guys given what could be a protracted writer strike?\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks, John. Look, USFL, it's still -- it's just the start of the second season. We're very pleased with it. We're pleased with both its ratings, the quality of the games, its performance on television and ratings. And also, frankly, it's a performance on the ground with ticket sales and engagement with football fans. So early days, but we couldn't be more happy with it -- with how it's tracking today. In terms of additional sports rights, we look across our portfolio of sports rights. We're constantly managing them. We look at sports rights as they come up. And we also look at them as they get renewed just to make sure that they are efficient for us and that we're paying a responsible and appropriate amount for those rights. So we're constantly adjusting, but we do it with, I think, a real commitment to discipline in terms of what rights we would acquire or dispose of. So it's a moving -- it's always a moving feast, but I wouldn't expect anything dramatic at all in that area. What was the last question? The writer strike. So thank you. On the writer strike, look, I think for us, we are well positioned for the writer strike. We think that with our strategic priorities and sort of strengths in sports but also in news, these are 2 areas that are not affected by the writer strike. And the audience will pivot on a -- when they're watching television to those categories. In entertainment, you have to remember as well, we only program 2 hours of entertainment at night. That's a mixture of both scripted and unscripted content. So we feel very well positioned there with that not to be affected by the writer strike really at all. There'll be some scheduling changes with some of this descriptive content, but it's not something that'll have a significant financial impact on us. \nOperator: And that last question will come from the line of Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America. \nJessica Reif Ehrlich : I just wanted to maybe follow-up on Lachlan's last point that you're not overly dependent on live and unscripted -- I mean, given you're live and unscripted, you're not overly dependent on the writers for entertainment. So given that, like, can you talk about your outlook for the upfront, also given macro, I mean, you seem to be in a very different position than most people, but the market is, most people say choppy, and then also given the decline in the paid TV universe. Can you just talk about how you see FOX News and sports transitioning over time? \nLachlan Murdoch : So look, I agree with you on the writer strike. I think for us, our focus on sort of live, live news, live sports, and frankly, the network a healthy balance of scripted and unscripted content on the network puts us in a tremendous position. I think what it -- the timing of the strike, obviously with the upfronts next week creates some what's the word I'm hesitancy of? It's hard to present an exact schedule, right? I you're only in entertainment, it's not if you're in news and sport. So I think it positions us very well in the upfront. And that's, of course, as I mentioned before not including the strength of Tubi going to this upfront as well. And Tubi will certainly be front and center in all of our upfront presentations, but also in our negotiations going forward. So, we feel very well positioned. It's early with the upfront, these negotiations will take time, but I think we're in a best position as we could, you know, possibly, hope for. In terms of the, you know, so the cable universe and what we plan to do with news and sport, you know, going forward in terms of any sort of a direct-to-consumer or alternative kind of distribution strategy. You know, as I think we've said before, you know, we are ready to go. We have the technology in place. I think we have the, you know, the teams and the people in place to go D2C when we deem that necessary or prudent. But, you know, for the moment we continue to drive industry leading pricing out of the MVPD and DMVPD universes.  Steve mentioned this before, our pricing has been, it's not theoretical. Our pricing has now been set in contracts, going forward. So for the -- we have a third of our distribution deals by third volume this year, this fiscal year, and another third, the next fiscal year. And we're very pleased with where we sit and where we've established a market price for our brands. The, -- and when you, just speaking of the brands, when you have, when you have the best sports business brand and the best news business and brand, these are products that ultimately right, will be part of any scaled platform, regardless of what technology is used to deliver that content and that platform. And so we see D2C in the future, and it will come eventually, as just one component of a broader distribution strategy. But it's certainly across any of those platforms or technologies, it's hard to see not having our sports and our news on those platforms. So, we feel pretty well positioned, Jessica,\nGabrielle Brown: At this point we are out of time, but if you have any further questions, please give me or Dan Carey a call. Thank you once again for joining today's call. \nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using ATT Executive teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Lachlan, and good morning, everyone. FOX again delivered strong underlying financials in our fiscal third quarter with 18% revenue growth and 3% EBITDA growth, bolstered by a record-breaking Super Bowl LVII. Our advertising revenues increased 43%, led by the Super Bowl, along with the higher volume of NFL playoff windows and accelerating growth at Tubi. Meanwhile, our affiliate revenues grew 3% on the back of pricing benefits from recent renewals partially offset by trailing 12-month subscriber losses continuing to run in the 7% range. Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $833 million, up $22 million over the prior year quarter as these revenue increases were partially offset by higher expenses. This was primarily due to higher sports rights amortization and production costs associated with our NFL, Super Bowl and playoff schedule. The net loss attributable to stockholders was $54 million or negative $0.10 per share compared to net income of $283 million or $0.50 per share reported in the prior year period. The variance was primarily due to other net where we recognize charges associated with the FOX News Media litigation, partially offset by the gain associated with the change in fair value of the company's investments. Excluding these and other noncore items, earnings growth was strong with adjusted net income growing 8% to $494 million and adjusted EPS of $0.94 per share, up $0.13 against last year's $0.81 per share. Now turning to our segments, starting with Television, where revenue grew an impressive 36% in the quarter. Television advertising revenues led this growth with a 61% increase fueled by Super Bowl LVII, which, as Lachlan mentioned, generated over $650 million in gross revenue. We also benefited from 2 additional NFL playoff games, 1 divisional and 1 wildcard partially offset by the timing of 1 less regular season game. Momentum at Tubi remained strong with advertising revenues up 31% to $170 million on the back of increased engagement and stable pricing. These strong advertising tailwinds in the Television segment were partially offset by lower prime time ratings at the FOX Network and mixed base market conditions at our local stations when excluding the Super Bowl. Television affiliate fee revenues were up 9% and as healthy growth in pricing across FOX owned and operated and affiliated stations continued to outpace the impact from subscriber declines. Other revenues remained essentially unchanged from the prior year quarter. EBITDA at our Television segment was up $82 million to $117 million. Expenses increased in the quarter driven by higher costs related to the Super Bowl and a higher volume of NFL games. The increase in expenses was partially offset by lower costs at FOX Entertainment, including the absence of a write-down of certain scripted programming in the prior year quarter. Our net EBITDA investment in Tubi of approximately $60 million was broadly in line with the prior year quarter. At Cable, we saw revenues generally in line with the prior year. Cable advertising revenues were down 7% due to the impact of a softer direct response marketplace at FOX News Media, while being partially offset by the benefit of the World Baseball Classic on the national sports networks. Cable affiliate fee revenues were broadly flat, coming in at $1.1 billion with rate growth broadly offset by subscriber declines. Cable other revenues were up 10% in the quarter led by higher FOX Nation subscription revenues. EBITDA at our Cable segment was $792 million compared to the $864 million reported last year largely due to these revenue impacts along with elevated legal costs at FOX News Media and higher expenses associated with the second season of the USFL and the World Baseball Classic at FOX Sports. Now turning to cash flow where we generated strong free cash flow of $1.48 billion in the quarter, reflecting our normal seasonal cycle of collecting advertising revenues from our fall programming coupled with our major sports rights payments being concentrated in the first half of our fiscal year. From a share repurchase perspective, as we foreshowed on our last call, we continued with our normal cost buyback activity of $250 million in the quarter and deployed $1 billion of additional capital to an accelerated share repurchase transaction. We retired approximately 80% of the shares associated with the ASR in the March quarter and expect the remainder to settle in the coming months. We remain committed to fully utilizing our current $7 billion authorization, where we now cumulatively repurchased approximately $4.4 billion, representing 20% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in November 2019. These meaningful capital return measures are enabled by the strength of our financial position, where we closed the quarter with $4.1 billion in cash and $7.2 billion in debt. While this reported cash balance does not include the impact of the Dominion settlement, we continue to maintain a very robust balance sheet that supports our ongoing commitment to capital returns as well as flexibility to pursue value-accretive investment. And with that, let me turn it back to Gabby to open Q&A. Yes, sure, on the affiliate. So Robert, yes, listen, we're pleased with the way our affiliate negotiations are going. You know that this year, we had roughly 34% the total affiliate book up for renewal. We've been successful in generating and establishing new pricing benchmarks for the network in FOX Sports or retrains and Fox Sports in those negotiations. And so with another sort of 1/3 of our book due for renewal in fiscal '24 and a touch under 30% during fiscal '25, we feel pretty confident that we can continue to deliver pricing gains in subscribers. If the subscriber rate of attrition stays at the same level, we expect to post ongoing affiliate revenue growth for the company. Thanks, Lachlan. So Phil, just to go back on legal costs, legal costs over the last two orthree3 quarters have been elevated. Obviously, we've been deep in the depositions and pretrial preparation for Dominion. So I'd expect that to subside over the next couple of quarters. And then to just pick up on Lachlan's point, listen, we -- the leverage is the debt we have, $7.2 billion, we've got a maturity in January, which we'll make a call on as to whether to repay or refinance. But the leverage feels about right where we are at the moment. And our cash position is strong. And so we would anticipate whatever happens with future litigation, we can continue to continue to go with our buyback pacing as it has been over the last couple of years now or a few years now as well as leaving us flexibility to invest in the business or take advantage of any inorganic opportunities, but we'll be balanced about it as we've been saying since the formation of the company."

            "name": "Lachlan Murdoch",
            "content": "Thank you, Gabby, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. FOX's strong fiscal third quarter operating results once again demonstrate the power of our content and the brands it underpins and the repeated capability of our focused strategy to deliver solid financial results. In the quarter, we grew top line revenue by 18%, led by the remarkable 43% growth in advertising and a solid 3% growth in affiliate revenue. Underpinning this performance was a record Super Bowl LVII on the FOX Broadcast Network which generated approximately $650 million of gross advertising revenue across our businesses and was the key driver of our 61% advertising revenue growth at our Television segment. This year's Super Bowl matchup between Kansas City and Philadelphia delivered 115 million viewers across FOX platforms, making Super Bowl LVII the most watched program in U.S. television history and the pinnacle of an extraordinary year for FOX Sports. The strong lineup of programming and advertising demand for FOX Sports continues into our fourth quarter, which includes the return of NASCAR the second season of the USFL, the start of Major League Baseball's 2023 season, the finals of the UEFA Nations League and a first for FOX the Belmont Stakes. Leveraging the reach of a Super Bowl lead-in, we launched the second season of Next Level Chef, which promises to be the next big lifestyle franchise from our Studio Ramsay partnership. Our entertainment business also found success with the number one new series and new drama over the year in Accused and the number one new unscripted series in Special Forces: World's Toughest Test. FOX has now debuted the top new unscripted series for 5 consecutive seasons. In fact, the combined power of our sports and entertainment programming places FOX at number one amongst broadcast network season to date in the key 18 to 49 demo. Our strong sports calendar also had a halo effect at the FOX Television stations, which saw many local advertising verticals higher in the quarter. In what continues to be mixed local advertising market conditions, we are encouraged by growth in categories, including auto, restaurants and entertainment, but are watchful across other categories, including bedding, retail and telecom. Meanwhile, Tubi's performance in the third quarter was nothing short of stellar with revenue growth of 31% supported by sustained gains and engagement, where total view time increased 38% year-on-year. And while still early in the fourth quarter, the April results for Tubi show the momentum across the platform accelerating. Having recently marked the 3-year anniversary of our acquisition of Tubi, our progress over this longer-term time frame is just as impressive having grown quarterly TBT by over 200% and revenue by 400%. Just as importantly, the Tubi brand has asserted itself on the broader media landscape. Our viral Tubi spot in the Super Bowl, which received massive press coverage, had almost 7 billion impressions. And our strong growth and engagement has now led to Tubi's inclusion in Nielsen's The Gauge, marking the first time Tubi has reached 1% of total TV viewing minutes and making Tubi the most watched fast service in the United States. And just last month, we announced the formation of Tubi Media Group, under Paul Cheesbrough, which brings together our digital capabilities in a more formalized and coordinated way to help us better monetize our digital touch points across all our FOX properties. We thank Farhad for his entrepreneurial leadership at Tubi over the last 3 years and, of course, before he leaves the business in terrific shape with an outstanding team to drive continued strong growth. At FOX News Media, we retained our leadership position amongst our peers. The FOX News Channel ended the third quarter as the most watched cable network in total day and prime time while maintaining its lead as the most watched cable news network beating CNN and MSNBC combined. Also notably, the FOX Business Network ended the quarter as the most watched business cable network, leading CNBC in total viewers during the business day and market hours for the fourth consecutive quarter. Let me briefly address the settlement of our dispute with Dominion Voting Systems. We made the business decision to resolve this dispute and avoid the acrimony of a divisive trial and a multiyear appeal process. Our decision clearly in the best interest of the company and its shareholders. The settlement in no way alters FOX's commitment to the highest journalistic standards across our company or our passion for unabashedly reporting the news of the day. We're proud of our FOX News team, the exceptional quality of their journalism and their stewardship of the FOX News brand. Whether it be our coverage of politics and elections, world events such as the war in Ukraine or domestic issues, such as the crisis at the border, our journalists bring compelling news home to our viewers every day. The standards behind this reporting are not only what makes us the number one cable news network by the number one network in all of cable. In fact, in a recent poll, 41% of respondents chose FOX News as their most trusted network news. So as we look ahead, we are confident in the strength of the FOX brands and the strength of our balance sheet. And while we are not completely immune to the headwinds facing the broader industry and the general economy, we are well positioned given our areas of differentiation. Nonetheless, you can expect us to be even more focused on our cost base as we look to reinforce our strategy for future growth. We remain committed to driving long-term shareholder value creation through the thoughtful management of our existing business, the pursuit of new and exciting adjacencies and returning capital to our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Steve to take you through the details of the quarter. Thanks, Robert. I don't know where to start. I'll talk about the 7 questions. So -- but thank you very much, and good to hear from you. On -- so let me start and hand over, I suppose, to Steve, for that -- the final questions. So I'm obviously limited about what I can say about any ongoing litigation, but I can make the following comments in regards to Dominion. And I referred to some of this in my prepared remarks. . Look, as we've stated many times, we always acted as a news organization reporting on the newsworthy events of the day. We certainly included allegations being made by the sitting President of the United States and his lawyers in the aftermath of a hotly-contested presidential election. Now we have been and remain confident in the merits of our position that the first amendment protects a news organization's reporting and allegations being made by a sitting President of the United States. However, the Delaware court severely limited our defenses and trial through pre-trial rulings, one example of being not being able to point to the newsworthy nature of the allegations. So we determined that the best course of action for the company and its shareholders was to settle instead of proceeding with a 6-week trial and potentially 2 or even 3 years of appeals. As you know, we have a pending case with Smartmatic, which is a fundamentally different case than Dominion and that all of our full complement of First Amendment defenses remain, and we'll be ready to defend this case surrounding extremely newsworthy events when it goes to trial, likely not until the calendar year 2025. As regards to our programming strategy in prime time, there's no change to our programming strategy at FOX News. It's obviously a successful strategy. And as always, we are adjusting our programming and our lineup, and that's what we continue to do. We are pleased with the strength of the advertising demand throughout our schedule, but particularly prime time.  Steve, do you want to talk to the MVPD? Thanks, Ben. I'm glad Robert left your question. But on advertising, look, we -- I think you've alluded to a softness in the market. We're really not seeing that across our major platforms. I'll give you a bit of the detail. The national market, the sports market for us is very strong, very robust. Obviously, as we enter the summer, it's a slower acquired, a quieter -- always is a quiet period for us until the fall when our key marquee sports programming is on air, but we are seeing pretty robust demand for time and availability in the sports market. So we're very confident with sports. In news, the direct response issues, which is a market issue, it's not a FOX News issue, has stabilized. So we're not seeing any more deterioration in direct response pricing. So we feel pretty confident in the stabilization of that piece of revenue. Again, that's really a product or a result of oversupply in -- with our competitors with direct response. It's not so much a FOX News issue, but it's something that certainly has affected our ability to achieve the premium pricing that we've been used to. But again, that issue has stabilized, and we think it offers us a pretty good platform going forward. Another thing to mention on news, which is just a small data point, we're seeing political revenue earlier than we've ever seen before. It's still small, but it's sort of unheard of to have it this early in the political cycle. So again, we think that bodes well for the fall and as we enter the more significant part of the political cycle. And then coming on to Tubi, the revenue is accelerating there. It's -- revenue is -- while it's accelerating pretty strongly -- Gabby doesn't want me to give the number. It would break most of your models. But it's not keeping pace with TBT. TBT continues to grow even faster, which is a great metric. So we have the avails. We're looking forward to Tubi being a central part of our upfront negotiations. It's clearly not only a strategic driver for us but have been an important driver going forward. Then when you get down to local base markets, that's where we're seeing more mixed results in the different kind of verticals of revenue. We're very pleased to see auto, again, continuing its rebound with strong growth in the auto category. The entertainment category, we're also seeing growth in and the restaurant category, where we're seeing growth in. But this is offset by weakness across other categories such as retail, telecom, and sports wagering and betting.  So the local market does feel -- overall. But again, we're looking forward for our businesses. Particularly in sports and news, we're looking forward to a strong -- a decent summer and a strong fall season. I think that's all the questions. Thanks, Ben. Thanks very much, Phil. On -- let me start with Tubi and apologies, Steve, for the capital management element of the question. So on Tubi, we're going to continue to invest in Tubi. It's at the same levels. We've been investing over the last year or so. We just think it's a tremendous opportunity for us. As I mentioned in my comments, the fact that we're now -- Nielsen's Gauge now has us over 1% of the U.S. television viewing is a tremendous sort of benchmark to have hit, and I see continued growth there. So from a consumer aspect and from a marketer's aspect, Tubi is becoming more and more a central part of usage and sort of an opportunity. And this is really because the focus Tubi's had or not -- we think of it over the last 3 years with our involvement, but obviously, the team there has done a tremendous job not only over the last 3 years but before that in really sort of driving sort of the best-in-class personalized AVOD experience, building an incredible library with nearly 55,000 titles in the U.S. alone. And again, to put that in context, that's 5 times the size of the Netflix library and now really being able to monetize that viewing in a more efficient, better way. So we're incredibly optimistic. And I would say the results are -- and we're incredibly pleased with the performance of tb going forward, and we think it's an appropriate area for us to continue to invest in. On the -- I'll turn it over to Steve on the -- on sort of capital management. But just on it, I'll just start by saying, look, we have a $7 billion buyback authorization. I think we spent about $4.4 billion of that. So we've -- my math's incorrect this time of the morning, a $2.6 billion remaining of the authorization. We fully expect to deploy all of that capital back to shareholders through our buyback. And any litigation has no impact on that at all. Yes, Steve. Thanks, John. Look, USFL, it's still -- it's just the start of the second season. We're very pleased with it. We're pleased with both its ratings, the quality of the games, its performance on television and ratings. And also, frankly, it's a performance on the ground with ticket sales and engagement with football fans. So early days, but we couldn't be more happy with it -- with how it's tracking today. In terms of additional sports rights, we look across our portfolio of sports rights. We're constantly managing them. We look at sports rights as they come up. And we also look at them as they get renewed just to make sure that they are efficient for us and that we're paying a responsible and appropriate amount for those rights. So we're constantly adjusting, but we do it with, I think, a real commitment to discipline in terms of what rights we would acquire or dispose of. So it's a moving -- it's always a moving feast, but I wouldn't expect anything dramatic at all in that area. What was the last question? The writer strike. So thank you. On the writer strike, look, I think for us, we are well positioned for the writer strike. We think that with our strategic priorities and sort of strengths in sports but also in news, these are 2 areas that are not affected by the writer strike. And the audience will pivot on a -- when they're watching television to those categories. In entertainment, you have to remember as well, we only program 2 hours of entertainment at night. That's a mixture of both scripted and unscripted content. So we feel very well positioned there with that not to be affected by the writer strike really at all. There'll be some scheduling changes with some of this descriptive content, but it's not something that'll have a significant financial impact on us. So look, I agree with you on the writer strike. I think for us, our focus on sort of live, live news, live sports, and frankly, the network a healthy balance of scripted and unscripted content on the network puts us in a tremendous position. I think what it -- the timing of the strike, obviously with the upfronts next week creates some what's the word I'm hesitancy of? It's hard to present an exact schedule, right? I you're only in entertainment, it's not if you're in news and sport. So I think it positions us very well in the upfront. And that's, of course, as I mentioned before not including the strength of Tubi going to this upfront as well. And Tubi will certainly be front and center in all of our upfront presentations, but also in our negotiations going forward. So, we feel very well positioned. It's early with the upfront, these negotiations will take time, but I think we're in a best position as we could, you know, possibly, hope for. In terms of the, you know, so the cable universe and what we plan to do with news and sport, you know, going forward in terms of any sort of a direct-to-consumer or alternative kind of distribution strategy. You know, as I think we've said before, you know, we are ready to go. We have the technology in place. I think we have the, you know, the teams and the people in place to go D2C when we deem that necessary or prudent. But, you know, for the moment we continue to drive industry leading pricing out of the MVPD and DMVPD universes.  Steve mentioned this before, our pricing has been, it's not theoretical. Our pricing has now been set in contracts, going forward. So for the -- we have a third of our distribution deals by third volume this year, this fiscal year, and another third, the next fiscal year. And we're very pleased with where we sit and where we've established a market price for our brands. The, -- and when you, just speaking of the brands, when you have, when you have the best sports business brand and the best news business and brand, these are products that ultimately right, will be part of any scaled platform, regardless of what technology is used to deliver that content and that platform. And so we see D2C in the future, and it will come eventually, as just one component of a broader distribution strategy. But it's certainly across any of those platforms or technologies, it's hard to see not having our sports and our news on those platforms. So, we feel pretty well positioned, Jessica,"

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I would like to emphasize that the functionality for the question-and-answer queue will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the conference over to Chief Investor Relations Officer, Ms. Gabrielle Brown. Please go ahead, Ms. Brown.\nGabrielle Brown: Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome to our fiscal 2023 second quarter earnings call. Joining me on the call today are Lachlan Murdoch, Executive Chair and Chief Executive Officer; John Nallen, Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Tomsic, our Chief Financial Officer. First, Lachlan and Steve will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter and then we'll take questions from the investment community. Please note that this call may include forward-looking statements regarding Fox Corporation's financial performance and operating results. These statements are based on management's current expectations and actual results could differ from what is stated as a result of certain factors identified on today's call and in the company's SEC filings. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA or EBITDA as we refer to it on this call. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and on our SEC filings, which are available in the Investor Relations section of our Web site. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Lachlan.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks, Gabby, and thank you all for joining us this morning to discuss our second quarter results. Our fiscal second quarter continued to build upon the strength of the first quarter to deliver record first half ratings and revenue at Fox. Financially, we delivered a 4% increase in our top line, including a 4% advertising revenue growth. Our EBITDA grew a massive 71%, principally due to strong advertising results from sports and political as well as the impact of exiting Thursday Night Football.  Our television segment led this growth and had a truly stellar performance. The station's group posted another record political midterm cycle, with approximately $250 million booked during the first half of our fiscal year. This is higher than our previous midterm record and just shy of our fiscal '21 presidential year record. These are impressive numbers and reinforce the strength and breadth of our station group.  FOX Sports was also a key growth driver this past quarter where advertising, pricing and demand remains solid on the back of viewership records for the NFL and for the World Cup. By every measure, FOX Sports is having an extraordinary year. Fox's domination of the fall was led by four of our most prominent rights packages, the NFL, the Big Ten network, Major League Baseball and FIFA, all coming together to produce a truly powerful schedule.  For the fourth straight calendar year, FOX Sports is the industry leader in live events, with some notable achievements that bode well for our future, including the current NFL regular season on FOX averaged over 19 million viewers and finished as the number one NFL package on television. America's Game of the Week averaged just over 24 million viewers and is projected to be the most watched program of all of television for the 14th straight year. And our Thanksgiving game this year was the most watched regular season game ever on any network, delivering 42 million viewers.  College Football had its most watched season ever on Fox, led by Big Noon Saturday, which was the most watched college football window for the second straight year, while the annual Ohio State-Michigan rivalry was the most watched regular season college game on any network in 11 years. And, of course, the 2022 Men's World Cup exceeded our expectations with average viewership of over the tournament up 30% from the 2018 matches. We can't wait for the Women's World Cup this summer, and we're already getting ready for the 2026 Men's World Cup here in North America.  Of course, the strength of the FOX Sports portfolio was on full display this past Thanksgiving, with our traditional Thanksgiving NFL game, USA versus England in the World Cup, a huge college football game and America's Game of the Week, all spread over just four days. The ratings were impressive, but the revenue we generated was even better. We wrote just shy of $250 million over the long weekend. And the strength of FOX Sports has continued into the current quarter on the back of exciting player football and what will be a record sold out Super Bowl this coming Sunday.  At Tubi, we had another strong quarter where ad revenues grew by 25% over last year, as we continue to outperform our peers. We have seen increases in almost every major KPI of Tubi, including CPMs, TVT and engagement. In fact, Tubi had its highest quarterly viewership in this fiscal second quarter, with total viewing time up 41% year-on-year, while December alone was the highest TVT and highest user month ever. These trends have continued early into the third quarter as Tubi add viewers and content to the platform.  At FOX Entertainment, Rob Wade has settled into his new role as CEO and has already launched two of the season's biggest hits; Accused, ranked as the most watched debut on any broadcast or cable network in two years; and Special Forces: World's Toughest Test is this season's number one unscripted program. Further, FOX Entertainment recently announced a multiyear extension with Hulu of our longstanding content licensing agreement, which bolsters Fox's streaming audience and provides Hulu with a key point of differentiation in a crowded streaming world. Turning to FOX News media, the FOX News channel ended the second quarter as the most watched cable network in total day and in primetime, while maintaining its lead as the most watched cable news network, beating CNN and MSNBC combined in both total viewers and demo in the quarter for both prime and total day. And the FOX Business Network ended the quarter as the most watched business cable network, beating CNBC in total viewers during the business day and market hours for the third consecutive quarter.  FOX Nation accelerated subscriber growth over the last quarter and last year and had the best quarter ever for engagement in terms of hours viewed, no doubt driven by brilliant fresh content like Yellowstone: One-Fifty. Looking at the distribution side of our business, we have now completed most of the deals expiring in the first year of our multiyear affiliate renewal cycle. So far the results confirm the confidence we have in monetizing our leading brands and content, and we are pleased that the market recognizes the value that Fox delivers to their offerings. It has been a truly strong quarter, one that showcased the very best of Fox and has shown that the underlying performance of Fox is exceptionally healthy. Looking ahead into this third fiscal quarter, our top line will, of course, be aided by a record Super Bowl. But we are still seeing solid national demand for our news and sports platforms, growth in the Tubi KPIs and we are encouraged to see multiple ad categories pacing strongly positive at our local stations.  Before handing the call over to Steve, I want to add some perspective to the Fox story. In the almost four years since the spin, Fox has grown and flourished while pursuing a simple strategy, a core business of trusted brands that delivers consistent and substantial audiences and a portfolio of digital growth initiatives that scale over time. With our focused sports and news franchises, we have taken a differentiated approach, choosing to serve our audience primarily through the pay TV ecosystem, which optimizes the delivery and value of live programming.  Our ability to drive our business and execute our strategy is underpinned by a number of accomplishments. For example, our affiliate and advertising revenue growth is driven by our pricing power, reinforced by regularly delivering large scale audiences and uniquely providing exclusive content to our pay TV distributors. This approach has led to nearly $2 billion in affiliate revenue growth and over 1.3 billion in advertising revenue growth since the spin in 2019.  By focusing on live content, our core Fox brands have been able to run sharply counter to the broader trend of linear TV. We can see this by looking at consumption trends. Over the past 10 years, consumption of FOX Sports events is up 18% and consumption of FOX News is up 28%. Our portfolio of sports rights is secure and is the best out there, with the vast majority of them locked up for the foreseeable future. Our NFL rights, the single best package in all of television, extends to the 2033 season. We just completed the first year of our Major League Baseball extension and renewed our Big Ten rights, which each takes us out through the end of the decade. We have the European Championships through 2028 and another cycle with our FIFA World Cup rights. These long-term rights provide us the visibility and necessary flexibility to plan our businesses and pursue growth opportunities moving forward.  On the digital side, we have made calculated investments in areas where we believe we can add significant value. Sports wagering and advertising video-on-demand are the two best examples of this. We have a firm footing in the sports gambling space. We were the first among U.S. media companies to strike a partnership with a betting operator because we see the potential for sports betting to drive engagement, enhance the viewing experience, and keep viewers coming back to FOX Sports linear and digital platforms.  The various financial options and investments we have reflect our view that sports gambling is a long-term play and we are focused on cementing our leadership in this rapidly evolving and high growth sector. Tubi, the number one AVOD player, leads our streaming strategy and with minimal investment when compared to our peers. Revenue and engagement KPIs at Tubi have far exceeded our expectations and are consistently growing in the healthy double digit range since we acquired it almost three years ago. The results at Tubi are proof that our strategy is working and we will continue investing in and growing this platform.  Finally, I'd like to address the recent announcement regarding News Corporation. As you know, my father and I reached the conclusion that exploring a combination with News Corp. is not optimal for shareholders of Fox or News Corp. at this time. As such, the special committees were disbanded and no further time or action is being taken on this topic. I've said in the past that I think scale provides flexibility and that it's important to be prepared when opportunities present themselves. The rationale behind considering accommodation with News Corp. was about that; scale, flexibility, synergies, opportunities, great IP and above all creating value for all shareholders. As a CEO of Fox, I have never felt more confident about our strategy, the quality of our assets and the strength of our financial position. This confidence is clearly demonstrated by this morning's announcement to increase our share repurchase authorization to $7 billion, with the immediate deployment of $1 billion of the expanded authorization toward an accelerated share repurchase transaction, while continuing our current in-market purchases. Consistent with our track record, we remain committed to delivering value for our shareholders in a thoughtful and disciplined manner. And we will continue to explore every opportunity to maximize that value over the long term.  And now, let me turn it over to Steve for more on the results.\nSteve Tomsic: Thanks, Lachlan, and good morning, everyone. Fox continued to deliver financially in the fiscal second quarter, with total company revenue growth of 4% and 71% growth in EBITDA. Notwithstanding the absence of Thursday Night Football, our overall revenue growth was led by a 4% increase in advertising revenues where in the quarter, we saw continued strength in political advertising of the stations, which when viewed across the full fiscal first half, nearly matched the political record set during the 2020 presidential cycle.  Additionally, our sports advertising was supported by a full roster of marquee events and Tubi continued to sustain its high growth trajectory. Our affiliate revenues increased by 1%, with limited renewal activity impacting the quarter and trailing 12 months subscriber losses remaining consistent at approximately 7%. Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $531 million, up $220 million over the prior year. In addition to our revenue growth, we also have benefited from lower expenses as a result of our early exit from the Thursday Night Football agreement.  Net income attributable to stockholders was $330 million, or $0.58 per share, up meaningfully against a net loss of $85 million, or negative $0.15 per share, reported in the prior year period. Alongside our growth in EBITDA, you'll recall that our GAAP P&L is regularly impacted by the change in fair value of the company's investment in Flutter, which we recognize in other net. Excluding this impact and other non-core items, growth was strong with adjusted EPS of $0.48 per share, up $0.35 against last year's $0.13 per share.  Turning to our segments. At television, we delivered 6% revenue growth, including a 5% increase in advertising revenues. As you know, our advertising revenues in the December quarter of last year benefited from our coverage of Thursday Night Football. Despite that comparable headwind, we delivered meaningful gains across the segment. This was led by the strong political cycle, the addition of the World Cup at FOX Sports and continued strong growth at Tubi.  On the NFL specifically, we also have benefited from strong pricing, a record-breaking Thanksgiving Day broadcast and the timing of Week 18 of the season sliding back into the December quarter. Meanwhile, advertising revenue growth at Tubi was up 25% in the quarter and exceeded $200 million on the back of record levels of engagement. In an uneven programmatic advertising marketplace, we're able to maintain CPMs and are well positioned to deploy more inventory as market conditions strengthen.  Television affiliate fee revenues were up 6% as healthy growth in pricing across all Fox affiliated stations continued to outpace the impact from subscriber declines. Other revenues increased 26% in the quarter, primarily reflecting the consolidation of the prior year acquisition of MarVista. EBITDA in our television segment was up $529 million to $256 million as we benefited from the strong political market and realized the anticipated financial benefit from the exit of our Thursday Night Football agreement.  These benefits were partially offset by higher costs from the World Cup and the annual growth in rights amortization we see across our sports portfolio. Similar to the levels reported in our fiscal first quarter, our net EBITDA investment in Tubi amounted to approximately $50 million in the December quarter. At cable, we saw revenues generally in line with the prior year. Cable advertising revenues were essentially flat. As Lachlan mentioned, we continue to see meaningful pricing gains in national advertising across our leadership brands.  Additionally, our national sports networks benefited from the broadcast of the World Cup in the quarter. However, this was offset by a softer direct response marketplace that impacted FOX News Media. Cable affiliate fee revenues were broadly flat coming in at $1.03 billion. As we have signaled previously, we are in the early days of our next distribution renewal cycle where we expect revenue gains to be skewed towards the television segment. Meanwhile, cable other revenues were up 7% in the quarter, once again led by higher FOX Nation subscription revenues.  EBITDA in our cable segment was $353 million compared to the $668 million reported last year, largely due to higher costs of the national sports networks led by the World Cup and postseason baseball. Expenses were also elevated at FOX News Media due to the digital investments at nation and weather and higher legal costs associated with ongoing litigation.  Now turning to cash flow, we're consistent with the normal seasonality of our working capital cycle. We recorded a free cash flow deficit of $610 million in the quarter. This typical first half trend reflects the concentration of payments for sports rights and the build-up of advertising related receivables, both of which reverse in the second half of our fiscal year.  From a capital deployment perspective, fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased $550 million by our share buyback program. This takes the total cumulative amount repurchased to $3.15 billion, representing 15% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the program in 2019. In addition, today, we declared a $0.25 semiannual dividend.  And as Lachlan mentioned, this morning, we also announced an incremental buyback authorization of $3 billion, taking our total authorization to $7 billion. We will immediately deploy $1 billion of this expanded authorization toward an accelerated share repurchase transaction, while concurrently continuing with our normal course buyback pacing which would see us repurchase $450 million in additional shares across the remainder of the fiscal year. These meaningful capital return measures are enabled by the strength of our financial position where we again closed the quarter with a very robust balance sheet, comprising $4 billion in cash and $7.2 billion in debt.  And with that, let me turn it back to Gabby.\nGabrielle Brown: Thank you, Steve. And now we would be happy to take questions from the investing community.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to emphasize the functionality for the question-and-answer queue. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Robert Fishman from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nRobert Fishman: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Lachlan, you've talked about the importance of scale in the media industry. So now that the News Corp. deal is no longer being explored, can you just help investors think about what the future of Fox is as a standalone entity in the coming years? And ultimately, do you think it will be better off combined with another strategic or financial partner?\nLachlan Murdoch: Hi. Good morning, Robert. Good to hear your voice. Thank you for the question. So I do think scale is important. And as we look at sort of our growth going forward and enhancing sort of our growth opportunities, I think scale is important, but equally important is the depth of our business. So we think about scale in terms of adding and broadening our sort of business lines, but also the depth of how we engage with our consumers, as we'll be investing I think probably equally in both. If we look at our strategy and how it's performing, I think you just have to look at our results. This quarter, our results have really been truly stellar. I think we stand out in the media landscape, certainly in this country, in terms of the health of our results and that goes to our strategy. We are very focused. We're focused on a core set of brands that are really must-have brands in the United States media landscape. So we like our strategy. We're absolutely focused on it, but we will pursue both scale and further investment in sort of the depth of our engagement with our consumers.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Ehrlich from Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you. Good morning. I guess two topics. But one, can you give us some color on the advertising outlook? Obviously, it will be a good, great quarter with the Super Bowl, but just besides that underneath that. And then Tubi, maybe talk a little bit more about the drivers of growth. I think you're adding one of Brothers Discovery fast channels. I think that Steve said that something that you held back advertising. What's going on with demand there? But how many minutes are you selling and how many can you go up to?\nLachlan Murdoch: Hi, Jessica. Good morning. So let me start with the advertising market. And as you mentioned, obviously, I don't believe I'll talk to the kind of the outlook. Advertising, like I know there's a lot of talk about advertising being soft in the market. We're really not seeing that. We're seeing advertising being sort of fluid and money coming in late. So it is different. It's a different environment than we were in a year ago or even a couple of quarters ago. But at the end of the day, we're still hitting our goals and achieving our revenue targets. It's just coming in late. And look, I think to be honest I think that goes to the strength of our portfolio, right? I think being in news and being in sports and the leader in those two categories, I think sets us apart in the advertising marketplace from a lot of our peers. So I don't want to say that that's our strength and certainly our relative strength in advertising is not indicative of the whole marketplace, but it's definitely indicative of our brands and our ability to achieve our revenue goals. So this Super Bowl to talk about some specifics. As I said, the money came in late. So we had some nervous moments. But we will right just shy of gross, about $600 million of revenue next Sunday. We are sold out. It will be a record Super Bowl for us, both in terms of total revenue and obviously in what we achieve for each spot. Ex the Super Bowl, if you back out of the Super Bowl, we are still up in national advertising revenue. And so I think that, again, bodes to certainly the strength of our brands and so the power of Fox. If I look at local stations, Jessica, categories, we're really happy to see a lot of categories back into robust growth. Auto is pacing up almost 30%; health, up 30%; pharmaceuticals, up 45%; travel, up 60%. And, of course, this is offset with categories like crypto money exchanges, I think down 97%. And so I'm still trying to find who the 3% less that's advertising. So there are some sort of swings and roundabouts, but the key categories are back in a very strong way. So that's probably more than you wanted on advertising, Jessica. On Tubi, look, all of our -- well, I'd say almost all of our KPIs are at record highs. I think December, the end of December was actually a particularly strong year in terms of TVT and engagement. And what we'll see is we'll see revenue. Revenue is up 25%, but I think what we're really pleased about is when your engagement and your total viewing time is up by more than that. As the market strengthens, we expect certainly more revenue to flow and follow that audience that we've garnered in Tubi. And all of the major studios continue to work with us. I think we're seeing benefit of people realizing that their libraries, they're sort of deep libraries, we can help them monetize those libraries. And so we're seeing -- you mentioned the Warner Brothers' deal, we're seeing everyone work with us, which is why Tubi has the biggest television movie library in streaming anywhere in the world. So we're really very, very pleased with it.\nGabrielle Brown: Next question, please, operator.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nPhil Cusick: Hi, guys. Thanks. I wonder if you could talk about wagering. Lachlan, you discussed cementing your leadership today. And last quarter, I think you discussed potential volatility in that market. Where do you see the market going at this point? And how ideally would you like to see Fox involved? Thanks.\nLachlan Murdoch: Look, I think we have a \u2013we\u2019ll talk about the market, we remain incredibly excited and optimistic about the wagering market going forward in this country. Obviously, it will take some more time for further states to be licensed and you'll start to see a shift from wagering advertising and marketing shift from local markets to national markets. We're obviously incredibly well-positioned on both sides to capture revenue from the wagering operators as they battle it out for us, supremacy in each of their markets. So we've done extremely well at the local stations and I think we'll see that shift to the national markets where obviously FOX Sports and to some extent FOX News and the entertainment network will continue to capture that revenue. So we are incredibly optimistic about it. I think from a corporate perspective, we're also the best positioned media brand to continue to partner with our wagering partners, particularly, obviously, the 18.6% option that we have in FanDuel is a fantastic position to be in. We have about a 10-year option. I think we have about eight years to go on the option. And Flutter will be our partner for a long time. So we feel very well in terms of where we're positioned.\nGabrielle Brown: Next question, please, operator.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBen Swinburne: Ask when Tom Brady is joining the Fox booth, so it might as well be me? And if you don't want to answer that one, maybe just a couple of strategic questions, picking up on Phil's. What do you guys think the value of FOX Bet is? And what could that business or that asset be over the longer term in sort of the bull case? And then you extended with Hulu not a huge shock, but just any comment on sort of whether that's enough of a needle mover financially or how robust the market was for that content because obviously that's a lot of licensing revenue potential. Just wondering if you could comment a little bit on how you approach that renewal and the outcome.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks, Ben. I'll answer the Tom Brady part of the question and maybe the Hulu part, I'll let Steve talk to the value of FOX Bet and importantly the -- obviously the Flutter or FanDuel option. I won't be the first to congratulate Tom on a stellar career and congratulate him on his retirement. The whole FOX Sports team and Fox Corporation overall is really excited to have Tom join the team here. That will be in the fall of next year, '24. He is going to take a little bit of time to decompress, which he well deserves after such a stellar career. Let me just quickly talk to Hulu. The Hulu renewal was very important to us and also very important to Hulu. The kind of symbiotic relationship that we have with Hulu, it grows in significance as viewers more and more watch our content on a sort of catch-up basis. So when we look at our hit shows, we're not monetizing them in the first window in the live or even live plus same day window, as you all know, in the same manner that we used to. And so being able to capture the engagement after live and same day or even live plus seven days is critically important. And our Hulu deal really allows us to do that. For Hulu, it gives them tremendous content the next day and they are able to, I'd say, sort of benefit from or piggyback on the marketing spend and the reach that we give all of our content as we push it out. So it works very well for Hulu and it works very well for us. Steve, do you want to talk to the FOX Bet value?\nSteve Tomsic: Yes. Ben, listen, on FOX Bet, I think we take a step back and just see how our betting in totality in terms of the investment. So FOX Bet is one component of it, and it's an important component. We'd like to see it in more states than the four states it's in at the moment. But it's being operated by Flutter who bear the investment cost of that asset. And so in some respects, we're behest in terms of how they develop that. But we look at it and it's a clear marker for success in terms of FOX Bet Super 6 for us in terms of the way we've developed that and cross promoted that with our stations. And also it's not just FOX Bet sports betting, but also includes the PokerStars non-sports betting assets. So it's an important asset. But when we look at the totality of our betting position, we increasingly think that the option that we have over FanDuel is the one that's really important for us. It's the leading market player. We have the opportunity over a long, long period of time to take a very, very new stake in a player that's sort of head and shoulders market leader right now.\nGabrielle Brown: Operator, we can go to the next question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thank you. Good morning, Lachlan. Where are you with the life cycle for your digital investments? I'm just sort of curious, when I think about Tubi, pretty consistently you've been talking about growth every quarter on these calls and engagement viewer and adding more content. How much more content is there to add? How much more growth is there to drive at Tubi? And same question on the Fox digital side. Thanks.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks, Doug. So in terms of the life cycle for sort of digital investments, I think the reality is there are teenagers that are putting on muscle and growing pretty spectacularly. So if I look at Tubi, as an example and you think about the key metrics we've talked about now for several quarters is the total viewing time, total viewing time is -- it's not equivalent, but it's like ratings. We continue to grow to total viewing time. The revenue that we're seeing follow that, and we have 25% up in this quarter, which I think is pretty fantastic. But the opportunity is much higher, right? Because the total viewing time has grown faster at a much bigger rate, a faster rate than the revenue has. So already within Tubi and when we look at these metrics, there's a ripeness for very significant revenue growth. So digital investments are adolescents, but they're a huge upside as they get older. And then when you talk about Fox digital, the digital assets, I was pretty amazed. We went through some numbers yesterday, just things like the local TV stations. The digital advertising business now at the local TV stations is really becoming quite significant. So when we look across our whole portfolio and we push further into our Web sites, our fast channels, our apps, this revenue is becoming very significant and even in parts of the company that you wouldn't expect. So we believe the future of our business is obviously digital and we're making that transition pretty rapidly and very robustly.\nGabrielle Brown: Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Okay. That question comes from the line of John Hodulik from UBS. Please go ahead.\nJohn Hodulik: First question on the balance sheet. Investors are definitely going to like the accelerated repurchase, but you still have $4 billion on the books, relatively low debt. Just maybe talk about sort of the usage of that cash? How much cash do you need on the books and maybe what the M&A environment looks like out there and what kind of opportunities do you see? And then on the affiliate line, you said you haven't seen the impact of the renewals and the [indiscernible] that you expect you'll see over the renewals you'll expect to do over the next couple of years. When do you expect to sort of get into the sort of the wheelhouse and see those lines really start to turn from the renewals? Thanks.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks, John. Steve jump in at any point. No, I'll start. Thanks, John. So first of all on the balance sheet, I think we do have an enviable balance sheet. We're going to deploy our capital as we have in a very disciplined manner and entirely focused on shareholder returns for all of our shareholders. That will be both as evidenced this morning with our accelerated share repurchase, which we think is a great sort of mechanism strategy to return some of this capital to our shareholders. But we will also, obviously, be looking at M&A and other opportunities to use to deploy our capital against. We don't have anything on the table today, but we are I think in a strong position to capture opportunities when they present themselves. And obviously, there are other companies in our sector that are not in a greater position and there will be things that we will I'm sure cast our eyes over. So we do expect the M&A will be part of -- a more important part of our toolkit as we deploy capital, but we have nothing on the table in front of us today. Before I go on affiliates, Steve, do you have anything to add there?\nSteve Tomsic: John, I think if you fast forward, like if you fast forward to the end of the fiscal based on the ASR and our regular share repurchases, we'll have done $4.6 billion in share repurchases by June 30, call it. You compare that against how much we've deployed in M&A, which on a gross basis is about 1.5 billion on a net basis after asset sales is probably $500 million, $600 million. So we've been super balanced, super disciplined on M&A. And if anything, the SKU so far in the life of Fox has been towards capital returns to shareholders. So we're going to continue to be thoughtful in the way we deploy capital.\nLachlan Murdoch: And then on the affiliate question, John, I think we are now through for this fiscal year, all of our significant -- maybe one, but all of our significant affiliate renewals will start again in the very beginning of the next fiscal year, this summer with some important renewals. But for this fiscal, we're through with them. What we've seen in the renewals this past year is the importance really of our Fox brands with our affiliate partners and the pricing power that we have with them. And I think that's been pretty, very evident in all of our renewals to date. More and more, like when you look at the split between our cable affiliate revenue and our television affiliate revenue, we really negotiate those together. So we've been focused on the television half of that ledger, but you have to think about the strength of these brands as a combined strength and where we in the marketplace find are kind of best ability to push rate is where we do, and that's been really on the television side, the retransmission side of that ledger. But it's the strength of the portfolio that allows us to do that. So yes, so we are looking forward to continued success in our affiliate renewals as we get into the next fiscal year.\nGabrielle Brown: At this point, we are out of time. But if you have any further questions, please give me or Dan Carey a call. Thank you again for joining us today.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thank you, everyone.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Lachlan Murdoch",
            "content": "Thanks, Gabby, and thank you all for joining us this morning to discuss our second quarter results. Our fiscal second quarter continued to build upon the strength of the first quarter to deliver record first half ratings and revenue at Fox. Financially, we delivered a 4% increase in our top line, including a 4% advertising revenue growth. Our EBITDA grew a massive 71%, principally due to strong advertising results from sports and political as well as the impact of exiting Thursday Night Football.  Our television segment led this growth and had a truly stellar performance. The station's group posted another record political midterm cycle, with approximately $250 million booked during the first half of our fiscal year. This is higher than our previous midterm record and just shy of our fiscal '21 presidential year record. These are impressive numbers and reinforce the strength and breadth of our station group.  FOX Sports was also a key growth driver this past quarter where advertising, pricing and demand remains solid on the back of viewership records for the NFL and for the World Cup. By every measure, FOX Sports is having an extraordinary year. Fox's domination of the fall was led by four of our most prominent rights packages, the NFL, the Big Ten network, Major League Baseball and FIFA, all coming together to produce a truly powerful schedule.  For the fourth straight calendar year, FOX Sports is the industry leader in live events, with some notable achievements that bode well for our future, including the current NFL regular season on FOX averaged over 19 million viewers and finished as the number one NFL package on television. America's Game of the Week averaged just over 24 million viewers and is projected to be the most watched program of all of television for the 14th straight year. And our Thanksgiving game this year was the most watched regular season game ever on any network, delivering 42 million viewers.  College Football had its most watched season ever on Fox, led by Big Noon Saturday, which was the most watched college football window for the second straight year, while the annual Ohio State-Michigan rivalry was the most watched regular season college game on any network in 11 years. And, of course, the 2022 Men's World Cup exceeded our expectations with average viewership of over the tournament up 30% from the 2018 matches. We can't wait for the Women's World Cup this summer, and we're already getting ready for the 2026 Men's World Cup here in North America.  Of course, the strength of the FOX Sports portfolio was on full display this past Thanksgiving, with our traditional Thanksgiving NFL game, USA versus England in the World Cup, a huge college football game and America's Game of the Week, all spread over just four days. The ratings were impressive, but the revenue we generated was even better. We wrote just shy of $250 million over the long weekend. And the strength of FOX Sports has continued into the current quarter on the back of exciting player football and what will be a record sold out Super Bowl this coming Sunday.  At Tubi, we had another strong quarter where ad revenues grew by 25% over last year, as we continue to outperform our peers. We have seen increases in almost every major KPI of Tubi, including CPMs, TVT and engagement. In fact, Tubi had its highest quarterly viewership in this fiscal second quarter, with total viewing time up 41% year-on-year, while December alone was the highest TVT and highest user month ever. These trends have continued early into the third quarter as Tubi add viewers and content to the platform.  At FOX Entertainment, Rob Wade has settled into his new role as CEO and has already launched two of the season's biggest hits; Accused, ranked as the most watched debut on any broadcast or cable network in two years; and Special Forces: World's Toughest Test is this season's number one unscripted program. Further, FOX Entertainment recently announced a multiyear extension with Hulu of our longstanding content licensing agreement, which bolsters Fox's streaming audience and provides Hulu with a key point of differentiation in a crowded streaming world. Turning to FOX News media, the FOX News channel ended the second quarter as the most watched cable network in total day and in primetime, while maintaining its lead as the most watched cable news network, beating CNN and MSNBC combined in both total viewers and demo in the quarter for both prime and total day. And the FOX Business Network ended the quarter as the most watched business cable network, beating CNBC in total viewers during the business day and market hours for the third consecutive quarter.  FOX Nation accelerated subscriber growth over the last quarter and last year and had the best quarter ever for engagement in terms of hours viewed, no doubt driven by brilliant fresh content like Yellowstone: One-Fifty. Looking at the distribution side of our business, we have now completed most of the deals expiring in the first year of our multiyear affiliate renewal cycle. So far the results confirm the confidence we have in monetizing our leading brands and content, and we are pleased that the market recognizes the value that Fox delivers to their offerings. It has been a truly strong quarter, one that showcased the very best of Fox and has shown that the underlying performance of Fox is exceptionally healthy. Looking ahead into this third fiscal quarter, our top line will, of course, be aided by a record Super Bowl. But we are still seeing solid national demand for our news and sports platforms, growth in the Tubi KPIs and we are encouraged to see multiple ad categories pacing strongly positive at our local stations.  Before handing the call over to Steve, I want to add some perspective to the Fox story. In the almost four years since the spin, Fox has grown and flourished while pursuing a simple strategy, a core business of trusted brands that delivers consistent and substantial audiences and a portfolio of digital growth initiatives that scale over time. With our focused sports and news franchises, we have taken a differentiated approach, choosing to serve our audience primarily through the pay TV ecosystem, which optimizes the delivery and value of live programming.  Our ability to drive our business and execute our strategy is underpinned by a number of accomplishments. For example, our affiliate and advertising revenue growth is driven by our pricing power, reinforced by regularly delivering large scale audiences and uniquely providing exclusive content to our pay TV distributors. This approach has led to nearly $2 billion in affiliate revenue growth and over 1.3 billion in advertising revenue growth since the spin in 2019.  By focusing on live content, our core Fox brands have been able to run sharply counter to the broader trend of linear TV. We can see this by looking at consumption trends. Over the past 10 years, consumption of FOX Sports events is up 18% and consumption of FOX News is up 28%. Our portfolio of sports rights is secure and is the best out there, with the vast majority of them locked up for the foreseeable future. Our NFL rights, the single best package in all of television, extends to the 2033 season. We just completed the first year of our Major League Baseball extension and renewed our Big Ten rights, which each takes us out through the end of the decade. We have the European Championships through 2028 and another cycle with our FIFA World Cup rights. These long-term rights provide us the visibility and necessary flexibility to plan our businesses and pursue growth opportunities moving forward.  On the digital side, we have made calculated investments in areas where we believe we can add significant value. Sports wagering and advertising video-on-demand are the two best examples of this. We have a firm footing in the sports gambling space. We were the first among U.S. media companies to strike a partnership with a betting operator because we see the potential for sports betting to drive engagement, enhance the viewing experience, and keep viewers coming back to FOX Sports linear and digital platforms.  The various financial options and investments we have reflect our view that sports gambling is a long-term play and we are focused on cementing our leadership in this rapidly evolving and high growth sector. Tubi, the number one AVOD player, leads our streaming strategy and with minimal investment when compared to our peers. Revenue and engagement KPIs at Tubi have far exceeded our expectations and are consistently growing in the healthy double digit range since we acquired it almost three years ago. The results at Tubi are proof that our strategy is working and we will continue investing in and growing this platform.  Finally, I'd like to address the recent announcement regarding News Corporation. As you know, my father and I reached the conclusion that exploring a combination with News Corp. is not optimal for shareholders of Fox or News Corp. at this time. As such, the special committees were disbanded and no further time or action is being taken on this topic. I've said in the past that I think scale provides flexibility and that it's important to be prepared when opportunities present themselves. The rationale behind considering accommodation with News Corp. was about that; scale, flexibility, synergies, opportunities, great IP and above all creating value for all shareholders. As a CEO of Fox, I have never felt more confident about our strategy, the quality of our assets and the strength of our financial position. This confidence is clearly demonstrated by this morning's announcement to increase our share repurchase authorization to $7 billion, with the immediate deployment of $1 billion of the expanded authorization toward an accelerated share repurchase transaction, while continuing our current in-market purchases. Consistent with our track record, we remain committed to delivering value for our shareholders in a thoughtful and disciplined manner. And we will continue to explore every opportunity to maximize that value over the long term.  And now, let me turn it over to Steve for more on the results. Hi. Good morning, Robert. Good to hear your voice. Thank you for the question. So I do think scale is important. And as we look at sort of our growth going forward and enhancing sort of our growth opportunities, I think scale is important, but equally important is the depth of our business. So we think about scale in terms of adding and broadening our sort of business lines, but also the depth of how we engage with our consumers, as we'll be investing I think probably equally in both. If we look at our strategy and how it's performing, I think you just have to look at our results. This quarter, our results have really been truly stellar. I think we stand out in the media landscape, certainly in this country, in terms of the health of our results and that goes to our strategy. We are very focused. We're focused on a core set of brands that are really must-have brands in the United States media landscape. So we like our strategy. We're absolutely focused on it, but we will pursue both scale and further investment in sort of the depth of our engagement with our consumers. Hi, Jessica. Good morning. So let me start with the advertising market. And as you mentioned, obviously, I don't believe I'll talk to the kind of the outlook. Advertising, like I know there's a lot of talk about advertising being soft in the market. We're really not seeing that. We're seeing advertising being sort of fluid and money coming in late. So it is different. It's a different environment than we were in a year ago or even a couple of quarters ago. But at the end of the day, we're still hitting our goals and achieving our revenue targets. It's just coming in late. And look, I think to be honest I think that goes to the strength of our portfolio, right? I think being in news and being in sports and the leader in those two categories, I think sets us apart in the advertising marketplace from a lot of our peers. So I don't want to say that that's our strength and certainly our relative strength in advertising is not indicative of the whole marketplace, but it's definitely indicative of our brands and our ability to achieve our revenue goals. So this Super Bowl to talk about some specifics. As I said, the money came in late. So we had some nervous moments. But we will right just shy of gross, about $600 million of revenue next Sunday. We are sold out. It will be a record Super Bowl for us, both in terms of total revenue and obviously in what we achieve for each spot. Ex the Super Bowl, if you back out of the Super Bowl, we are still up in national advertising revenue. And so I think that, again, bodes to certainly the strength of our brands and so the power of Fox. If I look at local stations, Jessica, categories, we're really happy to see a lot of categories back into robust growth. Auto is pacing up almost 30%; health, up 30%; pharmaceuticals, up 45%; travel, up 60%. And, of course, this is offset with categories like crypto money exchanges, I think down 97%. And so I'm still trying to find who the 3% less that's advertising. So there are some sort of swings and roundabouts, but the key categories are back in a very strong way. So that's probably more than you wanted on advertising, Jessica. On Tubi, look, all of our -- well, I'd say almost all of our KPIs are at record highs. I think December, the end of December was actually a particularly strong year in terms of TVT and engagement. And what we'll see is we'll see revenue. Revenue is up 25%, but I think what we're really pleased about is when your engagement and your total viewing time is up by more than that. As the market strengthens, we expect certainly more revenue to flow and follow that audience that we've garnered in Tubi. And all of the major studios continue to work with us. I think we're seeing benefit of people realizing that their libraries, they're sort of deep libraries, we can help them monetize those libraries. And so we're seeing -- you mentioned the Warner Brothers' deal, we're seeing everyone work with us, which is why Tubi has the biggest television movie library in streaming anywhere in the world. So we're really very, very pleased with it. Look, I think we have a \u2013we'll talk about the market, we remain incredibly excited and optimistic about the wagering market going forward in this country. Obviously, it will take some more time for further states to be licensed and you'll start to see a shift from wagering advertising and marketing shift from local markets to national markets. We're obviously incredibly well-positioned on both sides to capture revenue from the wagering operators as they battle it out for us, supremacy in each of their markets. So we've done extremely well at the local stations and I think we'll see that shift to the national markets where obviously FOX Sports and to some extent FOX News and the entertainment network will continue to capture that revenue. So we are incredibly optimistic about it. I think from a corporate perspective, we're also the best positioned media brand to continue to partner with our wagering partners, particularly, obviously, the 18.6% option that we have in FanDuel is a fantastic position to be in. We have about a 10-year option. I think we have about eight years to go on the option. And Flutter will be our partner for a long time. So we feel very well in terms of where we're positioned. Thanks, Ben. I'll answer the Tom Brady part of the question and maybe the Hulu part, I'll let Steve talk to the value of FOX Bet and importantly the -- obviously the Flutter or FanDuel option. I won't be the first to congratulate Tom on a stellar career and congratulate him on his retirement. The whole FOX Sports team and Fox Corporation overall is really excited to have Tom join the team here. That will be in the fall of next year, '24. He is going to take a little bit of time to decompress, which he well deserves after such a stellar career. Let me just quickly talk to Hulu. The Hulu renewal was very important to us and also very important to Hulu. The kind of symbiotic relationship that we have with Hulu, it grows in significance as viewers more and more watch our content on a sort of catch-up basis. So when we look at our hit shows, we're not monetizing them in the first window in the live or even live plus same day window, as you all know, in the same manner that we used to. And so being able to capture the engagement after live and same day or even live plus seven days is critically important. And our Hulu deal really allows us to do that. For Hulu, it gives them tremendous content the next day and they are able to, I'd say, sort of benefit from or piggyback on the marketing spend and the reach that we give all of our content as we push it out. So it works very well for Hulu and it works very well for us. Steve, do you want to talk to the FOX Bet value? Thanks, Doug. So in terms of the life cycle for sort of digital investments, I think the reality is there are teenagers that are putting on muscle and growing pretty spectacularly. So if I look at Tubi, as an example and you think about the key metrics we've talked about now for several quarters is the total viewing time, total viewing time is -- it's not equivalent, but it's like ratings. We continue to grow to total viewing time. The revenue that we're seeing follow that, and we have 25% up in this quarter, which I think is pretty fantastic. But the opportunity is much higher, right? Because the total viewing time has grown faster at a much bigger rate, a faster rate than the revenue has. So already within Tubi and when we look at these metrics, there's a ripeness for very significant revenue growth. So digital investments are adolescents, but they're a huge upside as they get older. And then when you talk about Fox digital, the digital assets, I was pretty amazed. We went through some numbers yesterday, just things like the local TV stations. The digital advertising business now at the local TV stations is really becoming quite significant. So when we look across our whole portfolio and we push further into our Web sites, our fast channels, our apps, this revenue is becoming very significant and even in parts of the company that you wouldn't expect. So we believe the future of our business is obviously digital and we're making that transition pretty rapidly and very robustly. Thanks, John. Steve jump in at any point. No, I'll start. Thanks, John. So first of all on the balance sheet, I think we do have an enviable balance sheet. We're going to deploy our capital as we have in a very disciplined manner and entirely focused on shareholder returns for all of our shareholders. That will be both as evidenced this morning with our accelerated share repurchase, which we think is a great sort of mechanism strategy to return some of this capital to our shareholders. But we will also, obviously, be looking at M&A and other opportunities to use to deploy our capital against. We don't have anything on the table today, but we are I think in a strong position to capture opportunities when they present themselves. And obviously, there are other companies in our sector that are not in a greater position and there will be things that we will I'm sure cast our eyes over. So we do expect the M&A will be part of -- a more important part of our toolkit as we deploy capital, but we have nothing on the table in front of us today. Before I go on affiliates, Steve, do you have anything to add there? And then on the affiliate question, John, I think we are now through for this fiscal year, all of our significant -- maybe one, but all of our significant affiliate renewals will start again in the very beginning of the next fiscal year, this summer with some important renewals. But for this fiscal, we're through with them. What we've seen in the renewals this past year is the importance really of our Fox brands with our affiliate partners and the pricing power that we have with them. And I think that's been pretty, very evident in all of our renewals to date. More and more, like when you look at the split between our cable affiliate revenue and our television affiliate revenue, we really negotiate those together. So we've been focused on the television half of that ledger, but you have to think about the strength of these brands as a combined strength and where we in the marketplace find are kind of best ability to push rate is where we do, and that's been really on the television side, the retransmission side of that ledger. But it's the strength of the portfolio that allows us to do that. So yes, so we are looking forward to continued success in our affiliate renewals as we get into the next fiscal year. Thank you, everyone."

            "name": "Steve Tomsic",
            "content": "Thanks, Lachlan, and good morning, everyone. Fox continued to deliver financially in the fiscal second quarter, with total company revenue growth of 4% and 71% growth in EBITDA. Notwithstanding the absence of Thursday Night Football, our overall revenue growth was led by a 4% increase in advertising revenues where in the quarter, we saw continued strength in political advertising of the stations, which when viewed across the full fiscal first half, nearly matched the political record set during the 2020 presidential cycle.  Additionally, our sports advertising was supported by a full roster of marquee events and Tubi continued to sustain its high growth trajectory. Our affiliate revenues increased by 1%, with limited renewal activity impacting the quarter and trailing 12 months subscriber losses remaining consistent at approximately 7%. Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $531 million, up $220 million over the prior year. In addition to our revenue growth, we also have benefited from lower expenses as a result of our early exit from the Thursday Night Football agreement.  Net income attributable to stockholders was $330 million, or $0.58 per share, up meaningfully against a net loss of $85 million, or negative $0.15 per share, reported in the prior year period. Alongside our growth in EBITDA, you'll recall that our GAAP P&L is regularly impacted by the change in fair value of the company's investment in Flutter, which we recognize in other net. Excluding this impact and other non-core items, growth was strong with adjusted EPS of $0.48 per share, up $0.35 against last year's $0.13 per share.  Turning to our segments. At television, we delivered 6% revenue growth, including a 5% increase in advertising revenues. As you know, our advertising revenues in the December quarter of last year benefited from our coverage of Thursday Night Football. Despite that comparable headwind, we delivered meaningful gains across the segment. This was led by the strong political cycle, the addition of the World Cup at FOX Sports and continued strong growth at Tubi.  On the NFL specifically, we also have benefited from strong pricing, a record-breaking Thanksgiving Day broadcast and the timing of Week 18 of the season sliding back into the December quarter. Meanwhile, advertising revenue growth at Tubi was up 25% in the quarter and exceeded $200 million on the back of record levels of engagement. In an uneven programmatic advertising marketplace, we're able to maintain CPMs and are well positioned to deploy more inventory as market conditions strengthen.  Television affiliate fee revenues were up 6% as healthy growth in pricing across all Fox affiliated stations continued to outpace the impact from subscriber declines. Other revenues increased 26% in the quarter, primarily reflecting the consolidation of the prior year acquisition of MarVista. EBITDA in our television segment was up $529 million to $256 million as we benefited from the strong political market and realized the anticipated financial benefit from the exit of our Thursday Night Football agreement.  These benefits were partially offset by higher costs from the World Cup and the annual growth in rights amortization we see across our sports portfolio. Similar to the levels reported in our fiscal first quarter, our net EBITDA investment in Tubi amounted to approximately $50 million in the December quarter. At cable, we saw revenues generally in line with the prior year. Cable advertising revenues were essentially flat. As Lachlan mentioned, we continue to see meaningful pricing gains in national advertising across our leadership brands.  Additionally, our national sports networks benefited from the broadcast of the World Cup in the quarter. However, this was offset by a softer direct response marketplace that impacted FOX News Media. Cable affiliate fee revenues were broadly flat coming in at $1.03 billion. As we have signaled previously, we are in the early days of our next distribution renewal cycle where we expect revenue gains to be skewed towards the television segment. Meanwhile, cable other revenues were up 7% in the quarter, once again led by higher FOX Nation subscription revenues.  EBITDA in our cable segment was $353 million compared to the $668 million reported last year, largely due to higher costs of the national sports networks led by the World Cup and postseason baseball. Expenses were also elevated at FOX News Media due to the digital investments at nation and weather and higher legal costs associated with ongoing litigation.  Now turning to cash flow, we're consistent with the normal seasonality of our working capital cycle. We recorded a free cash flow deficit of $610 million in the quarter. This typical first half trend reflects the concentration of payments for sports rights and the build-up of advertising related receivables, both of which reverse in the second half of our fiscal year.  From a capital deployment perspective, fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased $550 million by our share buyback program. This takes the total cumulative amount repurchased to $3.15 billion, representing 15% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the program in 2019. In addition, today, we declared a $0.25 semiannual dividend.  And as Lachlan mentioned, this morning, we also announced an incremental buyback authorization of $3 billion, taking our total authorization to $7 billion. We will immediately deploy $1 billion of this expanded authorization toward an accelerated share repurchase transaction, while concurrently continuing with our normal course buyback pacing which would see us repurchase $450 million in additional shares across the remainder of the fiscal year. These meaningful capital return measures are enabled by the strength of our financial position where we again closed the quarter with a very robust balance sheet, comprising $4 billion in cash and $7.2 billion in debt.  And with that, let me turn it back to Gabby. Yes. Ben, listen, on FOX Bet, I think we take a step back and just see how our betting in totality in terms of the investment. So FOX Bet is one component of it, and it's an important component. We'd like to see it in more states than the four states it's in at the moment. But it's being operated by Flutter who bear the investment cost of that asset. And so in some respects, we're behest in terms of how they develop that. But we look at it and it's a clear marker for success in terms of FOX Bet Super 6 for us in terms of the way we've developed that and cross promoted that with our stations. And also it's not just FOX Bet sports betting, but also includes the PokerStars non-sports betting assets. So it's an important asset. But when we look at the totality of our betting position, we increasingly think that the option that we have over FanDuel is the one that's really important for us. It's the leading market player. We have the opportunity over a long, long period of time to take a very, very new stake in a player that's sort of head and shoulders market leader right now. John, I think if you fast forward, like if you fast forward to the end of the fiscal based on the ASR and our regular share repurchases, we'll have done $4.6 billion in share repurchases by June 30, call it. You compare that against how much we've deployed in M&A, which on a gross basis is about 1.5 billion on a net basis after asset sales is probably $500 million, $600 million. So we've been super balanced, super disciplined on M&A. And if anything, the SKU so far in the life of Fox has been towards capital returns to shareholders. So we're going to continue to be thoughtful in the way we deploy capital."

Welcome to the FOX Corporation First Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I would like to emphasize that functionality for the question-and-answer queue will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the conference over to Chief Investor Relations Officer, Ms. Gabrielle Brown. Please, go ahead, Ms. Brown.\nGabrielle Brown: Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome to our fiscal 2023 first quarter earnings call. Joining me on the call today are Lachlan Murdoch, Executive Chair and Chief Executive Officer; John Nallen, Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Tomsic, our Chief Financial Officer. First, Lachlan and Steve will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter and then we'll take questions from the investment community. Please note that this call may include forward-looking statements regarding FOX Corporation's financial performance and operating results. These statements are based on management's current expectations and actual results could differ from what is stated as a result of certain factors identified on today's call and in the company's SEC filings. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA or EBITDA as we refer to it on this call. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and our SEC filings, which are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Lachlan.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks Gabby and thank you all for joining us this morning to discuss our first quarter results, and Happy Halloween everyone. I was trying to think of a Halloween reference or a joke, but in fact there's nothing scary in these results. Actually fiscal \u201823 has started off \u2013 by the way, that's called a dad joke in my household. Fiscal \u201823 has started off on a solid footing for us, supported by healthy viewership at sports and news, revenue growth across our platforms, and impressive momentum at TUBI. Financially we delivered 5% growth in our top line revenues, led by an 8% increase in advertising and 3% growth in affiliate revenues.  Our advertising growth in the quarter was driven by strong pricing at FOX News and FOX Sports. Record first quarter political revenues at the local stations, and in a quarter where industry-wide digital advertising revenues appear to have been under pressure, to be posted standout revenue growth of almost 30%.  These are great results for FOX. However, we recognize that there is a lot of commentary around advertising headwinds as the macro environment evolves. Yes, the broader national advertising market is looking more fluid compared to the time of our last earnings call. However, the macro impact is not uniform across our verticals.  We have observed some softness in the linear entertainment scatter marketplace. Remember that FOX does not over-index to network entertainment. So any impact there is nominal to us and has been more than offset by the digital entertainment strength delivered by TUBI.  Additionally, despite the economic headwinds, we are seeing continued strength across our linear news and sports portfolios, led by the pharmaceutical, restaurant and streaming categories. These dynamics underscore a flight to quality, and the importance of our focus on live content with over two-thirds of our advertising revenue generated by live sports and news.  At our local stations we've generated record political revenues for the September quarter. Second quarter to-date political revenues have also been very strong, given the combination of races and ballot issues across our markets. And I can confirm with a week still to go before Election Day, we have already beat our fiscal year 2021 record at the local stations excluding the Georgia runoffs.  Meanwhile, base market sales at the local stations were stable in the first quarter. It's still too early to gauge how much of an impact the macro uncertainty will have on local base market advertising in the December quarter, but we are encouraged by the continued positive growth we are seeing in the automotive category, recognized industry-specific dynamics that are impacting sectors such as wagering and government public health advertising.  On the distribution side of our business, we have completed the first rounds of our multi-year affiliate renewal cycle. So far the results are consistent with our expectations and we are pleased that the market recognizes the value of our brands as they deliver for their customers.  Turning to our business units, FOX News turned in another Stella performance, finishing the fiscal first quarter as the number one channel on cable and the third most viewed network in Weekday Prime in all of television, behind only NBC and CBS.  FOX Nation had a standout quarter for subscribers and engagement with total subscription growth north of 45% and total hours watched up almost 70% over last year, making our fiscal first quarter, FOX Nation\u2019s highest quarter ever for hours watched.  FOX Sports has had a very exciting calendar or has a very exciting calendar head of it this fall. The NFL on FOX is off to a great start and we're pleased to report that America's game of the week is averaging nearly 23 million viewers, up 9% over last year. The 2022 College Football season also got off to an outstanding start with 10.6 million viewers for Alabama, Texas in the season's first big Noon Saturday game.  It's no surprise that FOX\u2019s big news Saturday remains the number one window in college football with viewership up 15% over last year, and FOX continues to be the primary home for baseball's post season, where our coverage across FOX started in October and culminates with the world series throughout this week. As always, we're barracking for a tight seven game series. You know quite well that we have assembled an array of marquee sports rights and many of them will be on full display later this month during the Thanksgiving weekend, when FOX will play host to four of this year's biggest match-ups. The Giants versus Cowboys on Thanksgiving; the U.S. Men's Soccer Team versus England in the World Cup on Friday; Michigan and Ohio State on Saturday afternoon; and of course we\u2019ll present America's game of the week on Sunday afternoon, which is between the Rams and the Chief\u2019s; it'll be a terrific game. This extraordinary holiday weekend slate sets us up nicely as we prepare to broadcast Super Bowl 57 in February.  Elsewhere, the story at TUBI is breathtaking, with first quarter revenue growth reaccelerating to almost 30% over last year. This marks the first time that TUBI revenue has surpassed the advertising revenue generated by FOX Entertainment in a meaningful way. And in the December quarter for TUBI, it looks to be a continuation of that momentum with revenue growth, the revenue growth rate currently pacing ahead of the September quarter at nearly 40%.  Driving revenue at TUBI is strength across all major KPIs, particularly total viewing time, which was up over 50%. In fact, this was TUBIs highest quarterly viewership ever, with TVT reaching 1.3 billion hours. TUBIs impressive progress in growing the audience, engagement and monetization is indicating that our investment strategy and operational focus is working nicely.  At FOX Entertainment we saw some changes last month with Charlie Collier moving on to new challenges. We are happy that Rob Wade has stepped into the role of CEO of FOX Entertainment and those who know Rob will share my view that he will be a tremendous steward to our entertainment businesses.  Our fiscal year is off to quite a start. The September quarter results once again highlight the strength of our leadership brands, and we are just getting started on what promises to be a banner year for FOX. We are encouraged by the operating trends across the portfolio and the early returns on our digital investments. When paired with our strong balance sheet and low leverage, the FOX story remains a differentiated one amongst its media peers. And while we continue to be mindful of how the macroeconomic environment evolves during the months ahead, FOX remains well positioned to navigate and outperform through any potential uncertainty.  Finally, let me comment on the announcement we made earlier this month regarding a potential combination of FOX and News Corporation. As has been made public, both FOX and News Corporation have formed separate special committees to explore a potential combination following letters received from my father, Rupert Murdoch and the Murdoch Family Trust. For a combination transaction to proceed, it will need the approval of both special committees and a supportive vote by the majority of the minority non-affiliated shareholders of each company.  The special committee has not made any determination at this time and there can be no certainty that the company will engage in such a transaction. Given the importance of the work of the special committees, I'm not in a position to take any questions on the proposed transaction at this time.  And now Steve will take you through the financial highlights of the quarter. \nSteve Tomsic: Thanks Lachlan and good morning everyone. As Lachlan mentioned, we have made a solid start to fiscal 2023, delivering total company revenue growth of 5%. This top line momentum was led by 8% growth in our advertising revenues, where in the quarter we continued to see healthy scatter demand for our leading news and sports properties, and generated meaningful revenue reacceleration at TUBI. We also benefited from a record fiscal first quarter for political advertising revenues at our owned and operated television stations. Notably, we are able to drive 3% affiliate fee revenue growth without the benefit of any significant renewals impacting the quarter, and trailing 12 months subscriber losses running at approximately 7%. Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $1.09 billion, up 3% as our revenue growth was partially offset by higher expenses led by continued investment in our digital initiatives and increased rights amortization at FOX Sports.  Net income attributable to stockholders of $605 million or $1.10 per share, compares to the $701 million or $1.21 per share reported in the prior period. Once again, this was impacted by the change in fair value of the company's investment this quarter, which we recognize in other net.  Additionally, our effective tax rate was slightly higher in the quarter, primarily due to a re-measurement with our net deferred tax assets associated with the reduction in state taxes. This had no impact on our cash taxes in the quarter. Excluding this impact and other known core items, adjusted EPS was $1.21, up 9% over last year's $1.11.  Turning now to our segments starting with cable network programming. Cable advertising revenues were up 2% as our market leadership in news continue to drive linear pricing gains at the FOX News channel. This was partially offset by lower programmatic revenues at our digital news properties in the current period, as well as the impact of scheduling effects at our National Sports cable networks, where last year's revenues benefited from the Concacaf Gold Cup and Copa Am\u00e9rica Tournaments.  Cable affiliate fee revenues were consistent with the prior quarter. As we have signaled previously, we're in the early days of our next distribution renewal cycle and we are pleased with the outcomes of our earliest renewals, and we continue to expect to see these benefits take effect in the back half of our fiscal year and initially concentrated towards the television segment.  Cable and other revenues increased 9% in the quarter, primarily due to higher FOX Nation subscription revenues. EBITDA at our cable segment is $742 million compared to the $774 million reported in the prior year periods, and included the impact of elevated breaking news cost and the timing of digital investments at FOX News Media.  At Television, we delivered 8% revenue growth, led by an 11% increase in advertising revenues. Our television stations saw a record September quarter for political advertising revenues, while the FOX Network benefited from continued strength in pricing and additional MLB Broadcast of FOX Sports, partially offset by softer ratings.  Notably, we saw a sequential reacceleration of growth at TUBI, with revenues up 29% to approximately $165 million. This was on the back of a 53% increase in total view time and stable CTM\u2019s. Television affiliate fee revenues were up 6% as healthy growth in fees across all FOX affiliated stations more than offset any impact from subscribe declines. Other revenues increased 5% in the quarter, primarily reflecting the impact of the TMZ and MarVista acquisitions, partially offset by the timing of deliveries of Bento Box.  EBITDA at our Television segment was up 14% in the quarter, where we saw the typical seasonal increase in our marquee rights at costs at FOX Sports, including the impact of our MLB renewal, partially offset by lower marketing and programming expenses of FOX Entertainment.  We are clearly making strong progress in both audience growth and monetization at TUBI, which underscores our confidence in the long term value of this asset. So it is worth noting that the EBITDA we delivered in the quarter at the Television segment and FOX more broadly incorporates an approximately $50 million EBITDA investment in TUBI.  Now turning to cash flow where we generated $196 million of free cash flow in the quarter, consistent with the seasonality of our working capital cycle, where the first half of our fiscal year is characterized by a concentration of payments for sports rights and the build-up of advertising related receivables, both of which reversed in the second half of our fiscal year.  From a capital deployment perspective, fiscal year-to-date we have repurchased a further $300 million via our share buyback program. We remain committed to utilizing our full buyback authorization of $4 billion. Having now cumulatively repurchased $2.9 billion, representing approximately 14% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in 2019.  Finally, we continue to maintain a very robust balance sheet where we ended the quarter with approximately $5 billion in cash and $7.2 billion in debt. Fiscal 2023 is now well underway and with a strong program of showcase events still to come, coupled with the strongest balance sheet in the industry, FOX is uniquely placed to navigate any macro uncertainty and deliver value to our shareholders.  And with that, I'm happy to turn the call back over to Gabby. \nGabrielle brown : Thank you, Steve. And now we would be happy to take questions from the investment community. \nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] One moment please for the first question. That will come from the line of Jessica Reif Ehrlich of Bank of America Securities.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you. Good morning. One question. Okay, let me think about this. Well, first on the decline in the Pay TV Universe. Could you talk about how that impacts your affiliate discussions, both cable and retrans on the broadcast side, and how you're thinking about maybe hedging your reliance on the Pay TV bundle?  And then Lachlan I heard you say, you know you don't want to talk about News Corp, but obviously it's out there and maybe you can just talk a little bit about why now? What do you think the benefits are from the combination and the balance sheet, your balance sheet is so incredibly strong, but so is theirs. How do you think about using those balance sheets?\nLachlan Murdoch: Good morning, Jessica. Thank you very much and I appreciate keeping your questions short. A number of questions, so thank you. I know it's tough, cause there\u2019s a lot to talk about. But on the decline in the Pay TV universe as Steve called out, you know we've seen a decline of just about 7%. We're not seeing in sort of the most recent remiss that that decline is getting any worse, so it's obviously \u2013 the last year was 5% this time last year. This year we've seen this tick down to 7%, but it looks to have stabilized at 7%. And our focus is really in you know continuing to invest in our brands, particularly News and Sport, which are really essential to the Pay Television bundle.  So we're not in a position as I think a lot of the cable, general entertainment channels, which are \u2013 you know are more at risk to people going to SVOD services and streaming to get that type of content, whereas you know there's only one place you can get FOX News and there's only one place you can get FOX Sports. So our strategy is to continue to invest and be essential for all of our distributors for their Pay Television bundles.  And we've seen that play out through our renewals. We're at the beginning of our renewal cycle and so it's a massive three year cycle. I think in fiscal \u201923, 34% of our aggregate cable and television segment distribution revenue is up for renegotiation. The next fiscal year it's also 34% up for renegotiation and in fact fiscal \u201925 is still 28%. So we almost you know over the next three years, you know completely renew and refreshing and extend our cable distribution agreements.  You know we are well underway with the first \u2013 having completed the first round of those renewals and I have to say we are extremely pleased with the outcome of those renewals because our distribution partners do value what we bring to the bundle and our commitment to the bundle. So those renewals have gone very well and have met every expectation we've had for them. The split between cable affiliate revenue and television segment affiliate revenue will shift slightly. I think you'll see the television affiliate segment grow at a faster pace than the cable affiliate revenue, and that's just in terms of how we negotiate those agreements with the distributors. In terms of a potential recombination with news corporations, I really can't talk about it. It's actually an independent process going through with the independent committees and it's not for me to you know discuss the conversation. Well, I don't know the conversation they are having or nor can I discuss them, so sorry about that Jessica. \nGabrielle brown : Operator, next question please.\nOperator: We'll go to the line of Robert Fishman with MoffettNathanson.\nRobert Fishman: Hi! Good morning, everyone! Maybe just more broadly, can you discuss the importance of scale in the media industry or are there advantages to having a smaller portfolio where you can focus on the core of sports and news assets that you just started to talk about, especially when thinking about the cable network negotiations that you already alluded to. \nLachlan Murdoch: Good morning, Robert. How are you? Look, I think you know scale, it has to be focused right, and scale is important and what we've seen amongst our media peers over the last few years are our peers getting bigger through mergers and acquisitions, and so I think scale lends flexibility in many ways. So we continue to grow our business, we continue to look at M&A and be very disciplined in how we how we look at it, but we also do look at the importance of scale, particularly over the next couple of years when opportunities I think in the marketplace will emerge. They are having the scale be flexible and how we deal with them will be important. \nGabrielle brown : Operator, next question please. \nOperator: And that will come from the line of Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley. \nBen Swinburne : Thank you. Good morning. You guys may be the only ones to talk about revenue \u2013 advertising revenue growth accelerating into the December quarter during earnings, as particularly with your comments around TUBI. We've seen a lot of weakness in digital advertising broadly. Can you talk a little bit about the drivers there? I know you mentioned TBT, but are there other aspects to what TUBI is offering advertisers that explains you know the strong growth this quarter and what you're seeing into Q4.  And just to come back to capitol allocation if I can sneak one more in. I guess I'm a little surprised buyback isn't accelerating. Just your stocks got like a 15% plus free cash yield and you're sitting on cash, you know $5 billion earning, I don't know 2% or 3%. It seems given the position of the company's cash flow profile, like a pretty attractive opportunity to sort of increase the pace. So I don\u2019t know Steve, if you have anything you want to add in terms of just what you guys are waiting for, looking at to resolve itself to maybe get more aggressive or maybe the environment just means you want to be more conservative. I'd love to hear your thoughts there. Thank you guys. \nA - Lachlan Murdoch: Good morning, Ben. I'll start obviously with the TUBI and Steve, you can talk about the buyback and capital allocation. So to start with TUBI, you know if you look at TUBI as a business and what the team there have built is really a best-in-class AVOD service and they've had several years head start in this business. They are entirely focused on AVOD, but that's both from a \u2013 you know having established really a superior ad-tech stack and ad-tech team and also now combined with FOX, you know an advertising sales team with a proven track record.  You know you couple that with the largest library available in the United States with 48,000 titles, which you know by the way is 5x the Netflix library. The cross platform opportunities that we are executing on across Sports and News and entertainment, you know it really sort of provides you know a tremendous platform that's absolutely taking off. You know TBT was up 53%. That really drives you know a tremendous amount of the sort of monetization as it flows through. We hold our CPM rates are pretty steady at TUBI. So it's really \u2013 it's not pricing that is \u2013 pricing has increased, but it's not pricing that\u2019s accelerating. It's really the TBT time that's offering our clients and advertisers you know more opportunities on the platform. So we are tremendously excited about the future of TUBI as we sit here today. \nSteve Tomsic: Hey Ben! Its Steve. Just on the capital allocation, I think this environment obviously lends itself to being more conservative on balance sheet management, but it's our nature to be measured in the way we manage the balance sheet. If you look at what we\u2019ve done since the establishment of FOX and why capital has been directed, which sent $4 billion back to the shareholders, whether it be in the form of the $2.9 billion buybacks plus over $1 billion in dividends versus M&A which sits as \u2013 net M&A sits at below $1.5 billion. So I think the bias so far has been to return capital to shareholders where we haven't had other alternative uses for it, but right at the moment we feel like being measured is a touch more conservative, is the right place to be. \nGabrielle brown : Next question, please. \nOperator: We'll go to the line of Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. \nPhil Cusick : Hi! Thank you. First, a follow up on the TUBI data points. Those are helpful, thank you. Can you discuss the potential of that business to evolve maybe from what it looks like today and I know you're in, specifically in investment mode, but what does it take to get that EBITDA number to a positive over time. And then second, any sort of update on the Flutter negotiation or timing there? Thank you. \nLachlan Murdoch: So on TUBI, TUBI is being profitable in past quarters and we've made the proactive and I think prudent decision to use not this opportunity to invest in TUBI. Its modest investment compared to \u2013 very modest investment compared to what our peers are investing in their SVOD platforms, but we think it's a sage investment, because the opportunity to really lead in the in AVOD market is absolutely there for the taking. We are leading the AVOD market, but to sort of cement that lead and to win in the AVOD market is absolutely our goal.  So we'll continue to invest into the short to medium term in TUBI. I think particularly in an environment where there is potential sort of economic stress in households, having a free service is a great position to be in and I think TUBI will benefit from any \u2013 frankly from any economic chills that the people might feel. So it's the right time to invest this. It's the right time to extend our lead.\nSteve Tomsic: Flutter?\nLachlan Murdoch: Oh! And Flutter, we expect a decision in the Flutter arbitration imminently and you know once we have that handed down we'll assess our position, but we expect an imminent decision and we expect to be pleased by it, so. \nGabrielle brown : Next question please operator. \nOperator: That will come from the line of Steven Cahall of Wells Fargo. \nSteven Cahall : Thank you. I know you're not commenting on the merger itself, but I think you mentioned that a majority of independent shareholders need to approve it. So I was wondering if you could at least comment as to whether shareholders are going to be provided with some incremental information between now and I guess what will be a required shareholder vote.  And the reason I ask is I think that FOX in my opinion, is a great business. So I think shareholders are wondering why they want to mix a great business with just a different business. So if you could at least comment not specifically on the deal, but what that investor education is going to look like, I think that would help everybody envision what's going on. Thank you.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thank you very much. As I mentioned, I can't really comment on it, because we don't know if there is a deal or if there will be a deal, what that deal would look like. So it's hard to comment on anything or impossible to comment anything that doesn't exist today. So, we like you have to be patient, sorry, and wait to see what the special committees are \u2013 what the outcome of their discussions and processes is. \nGabrielle Brown : Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: And that will come from the line of John Hodulik of UBS.\nJohn Hodulik: Great! Thanks guys. Maybe first a couple of follow-ups on the TUBI data. I mean first and Lach, you may have covered this, but like what content is driving that 50% increase in TVT there? And then is the $50 million investment that we saw in the quarter, is that a good run rate going forward? And is that \u2013 I mean I would imagine that's not a \u2013 that doesn't constitute a change in the guidance for sort of flattish digital dilution in the quarter.  And then lastly, just back to the ad market. I mean anything you could say about sort of ad-trends, especially in the local TV market, ex-political as we head into the December quarter, because again you know there's been \u2013 apparently there\u2019s been a number of sources of weakness there and just wondering what you're seeing in that part of the market? Thanks. \nLachlan Murdoch: So, let me start on TUBI and Steve can talk about the run rate, and then I'll come back to the local ad market ex-political and with political as well. So look, the TVT growth across TUBI has really been across all genres. It's been pretty widespread. You know TUBI as we've discussed on previous calls, you know TUBI'S core proposition is video-on-demand. So it's their movies and their television series on demand. They have worked hard over the last year or so launching, I think it\u2019s now over 200 FAST Channels, which are a combination of both News, but also general Entertainment and Sports FAST Channels.  Those FAST Channels are doing very well and are growing rapidly, but are overall a smaller percentage of their TVT. But it's pleasing that this is \u2013 you know the growth has been really across the entire platform. Steve, do you want to talk about the run rate?\nSteve Tomsic: Just John, run rate for TUBI is at $50 million absolute EBITDA deficit in the quarter. Last year we sort of across - TUBI across the whole year was in the low 200\u2019s in terms of EBITDA deficit for the company. I would anticipate that the $50 million we saw last year, and I expect this to be the same case this year, where the second half of the year had relatively more investment than first half and so you should expect to see a relatively consistent pattern with that. And listen we \u2013 it doesn't change sort of our guidance in terms of the dilution around digital investments across the company, whether that includes TUBI, Nation, whether block-chain, the rest of the portfolio that remains intact as it is. But TUBI listen, as we see that business develop, we'll continue to invest in as we see that top line continue to grow, which is exceeding our expectations.\nLachlan Murdoch: And then on the advertising market, it's interesting as you sort of look at the, what\u2019s the word, the sort of ins-and-outs of the market. Like you know in some categories where local might have some softness or more fluidity in the market, you're seeing it being picked up in national advertising in the same category. So you know sectors that were strong in Local, now are strong in National. So there's some sort of swings and roundabouts there. But overall, the trend is really a flight to quality, particularly around our News and Sports brands and platforms.  So you know Nationally, I think I called out pharmaceutical is very strong. Restaurants, particularly quick service restaurants and even more particularly pizza category is doing very well. I know my household is \u2013 the advertising is working and media, really streaming, particularly as SVOD services are more and more competitive. They are spending a lot of money marketing themselves on our platforms.  On the soft side and we're seeing softness in wagering. Again, that's more of a local softness in wagering, but we're picking up a lot of that in national wagering, sort of betting spend and government health services, right. So this time last year there was still a lot of COVID-19 health advertising messaging from governments and obviously that's very significantly less this year around.  Locally, automotive remains very strong. Again, this is the first time in a couple of years that we've seen a local automotive advertising as strong as it is now. The other category locally that's very strong is general services, which is good to see, and any softness some elsewhere is more than made up by this record political year. I think you have to remember that in our markets, and we have a tremendous local station footprint, and there are Senate races in 13 out of our 18 markets and particularly the hard fall ones are Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, and we're certainly seeing a tremendous amount of political spending flow through those markets.  But also you know this year, gubernatorial races, we have I think 17 gubernatorial races in our 18 markets. So it's an incredibly busy time and we'll certainly see it flow through in our political revenues.\nGabrielle Brown : At this point we are out of time, but if you have any further questions, please give me or Dan Carey a call. Thank you once again for joining today's call everyone.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks everyone.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Lachlan Murdoch",
            "content": "Thanks Gabby and thank you all for joining us this morning to discuss our first quarter results, and Happy Halloween everyone. I was trying to think of a Halloween reference or a joke, but in fact there's nothing scary in these results. Actually fiscal \u201823 has started off \u2013 by the way, that's called a dad joke in my household. Fiscal \u201823 has started off on a solid footing for us, supported by healthy viewership at sports and news, revenue growth across our platforms, and impressive momentum at TUBI. Financially we delivered 5% growth in our top line revenues, led by an 8% increase in advertising and 3% growth in affiliate revenues.  Our advertising growth in the quarter was driven by strong pricing at FOX News and FOX Sports. Record first quarter political revenues at the local stations, and in a quarter where industry-wide digital advertising revenues appear to have been under pressure, to be posted standout revenue growth of almost 30%.  These are great results for FOX. However, we recognize that there is a lot of commentary around advertising headwinds as the macro environment evolves. Yes, the broader national advertising market is looking more fluid compared to the time of our last earnings call. However, the macro impact is not uniform across our verticals.  We have observed some softness in the linear entertainment scatter marketplace. Remember that FOX does not over-index to network entertainment. So any impact there is nominal to us and has been more than offset by the digital entertainment strength delivered by TUBI.  Additionally, despite the economic headwinds, we are seeing continued strength across our linear news and sports portfolios, led by the pharmaceutical, restaurant and streaming categories. These dynamics underscore a flight to quality, and the importance of our focus on live content with over two-thirds of our advertising revenue generated by live sports and news.  At our local stations we've generated record political revenues for the September quarter. Second quarter to-date political revenues have also been very strong, given the combination of races and ballot issues across our markets. And I can confirm with a week still to go before Election Day, we have already beat our fiscal year 2021 record at the local stations excluding the Georgia runoffs.  Meanwhile, base market sales at the local stations were stable in the first quarter. It's still too early to gauge how much of an impact the macro uncertainty will have on local base market advertising in the December quarter, but we are encouraged by the continued positive growth we are seeing in the automotive category, recognized industry-specific dynamics that are impacting sectors such as wagering and government public health advertising.  On the distribution side of our business, we have completed the first rounds of our multi-year affiliate renewal cycle. So far the results are consistent with our expectations and we are pleased that the market recognizes the value of our brands as they deliver for their customers.  Turning to our business units, FOX News turned in another Stella performance, finishing the fiscal first quarter as the number one channel on cable and the third most viewed network in Weekday Prime in all of television, behind only NBC and CBS.  FOX Nation had a standout quarter for subscribers and engagement with total subscription growth north of 45% and total hours watched up almost 70% over last year, making our fiscal first quarter, FOX Nation's highest quarter ever for hours watched.  FOX Sports has had a very exciting calendar or has a very exciting calendar head of it this fall. The NFL on FOX is off to a great start and we're pleased to report that America's game of the week is averaging nearly 23 million viewers, up 9% over last year. The 2022 College Football season also got off to an outstanding start with 10.6 million viewers for Alabama, Texas in the season's first big Noon Saturday game.  It's no surprise that FOX's big news Saturday remains the number one window in college football with viewership up 15% over last year, and FOX continues to be the primary home for baseball's post season, where our coverage across FOX started in October and culminates with the world series throughout this week. As always, we're barracking for a tight seven game series. You know quite well that we have assembled an array of marquee sports rights and many of them will be on full display later this month during the Thanksgiving weekend, when FOX will play host to four of this year's biggest match-ups. The Giants versus Cowboys on Thanksgiving; the U.S. Men's Soccer Team versus England in the World Cup on Friday; Michigan and Ohio State on Saturday afternoon; and of course we'll present America's game of the week on Sunday afternoon, which is between the Rams and the Chief's; it'll be a terrific game. This extraordinary holiday weekend slate sets us up nicely as we prepare to broadcast Super Bowl 57 in February.  Elsewhere, the story at TUBI is breathtaking, with first quarter revenue growth reaccelerating to almost 30% over last year. This marks the first time that TUBI revenue has surpassed the advertising revenue generated by FOX Entertainment in a meaningful way. And in the December quarter for TUBI, it looks to be a continuation of that momentum with revenue growth, the revenue growth rate currently pacing ahead of the September quarter at nearly 40%.  Driving revenue at TUBI is strength across all major KPIs, particularly total viewing time, which was up over 50%. In fact, this was TUBIs highest quarterly viewership ever, with TVT reaching 1.3 billion hours. TUBIs impressive progress in growing the audience, engagement and monetization is indicating that our investment strategy and operational focus is working nicely.  At FOX Entertainment we saw some changes last month with Charlie Collier moving on to new challenges. We are happy that Rob Wade has stepped into the role of CEO of FOX Entertainment and those who know Rob will share my view that he will be a tremendous steward to our entertainment businesses.  Our fiscal year is off to quite a start. The September quarter results once again highlight the strength of our leadership brands, and we are just getting started on what promises to be a banner year for FOX. We are encouraged by the operating trends across the portfolio and the early returns on our digital investments. When paired with our strong balance sheet and low leverage, the FOX story remains a differentiated one amongst its media peers. And while we continue to be mindful of how the macroeconomic environment evolves during the months ahead, FOX remains well positioned to navigate and outperform through any potential uncertainty.  Finally, let me comment on the announcement we made earlier this month regarding a potential combination of FOX and News Corporation. As has been made public, both FOX and News Corporation have formed separate special committees to explore a potential combination following letters received from my father, Rupert Murdoch and the Murdoch Family Trust. For a combination transaction to proceed, it will need the approval of both special committees and a supportive vote by the majority of the minority non-affiliated shareholders of each company.  The special committee has not made any determination at this time and there can be no certainty that the company will engage in such a transaction. Given the importance of the work of the special committees, I'm not in a position to take any questions on the proposed transaction at this time.  And now Steve will take you through the financial highlights of the quarter. Good morning, Jessica. Thank you very much and I appreciate keeping your questions short. A number of questions, so thank you. I know it's tough, cause there's a lot to talk about. But on the decline in the Pay TV universe as Steve called out, you know we've seen a decline of just about 7%. We're not seeing in sort of the most recent remiss that that decline is getting any worse, so it's obviously \u2013 the last year was 5% this time last year. This year we've seen this tick down to 7%, but it looks to have stabilized at 7%. And our focus is really in you know continuing to invest in our brands, particularly News and Sport, which are really essential to the Pay Television bundle.  So we're not in a position as I think a lot of the cable, general entertainment channels, which are \u2013 you know are more at risk to people going to SVOD services and streaming to get that type of content, whereas you know there's only one place you can get FOX News and there's only one place you can get FOX Sports. So our strategy is to continue to invest and be essential for all of our distributors for their Pay Television bundles.  And we've seen that play out through our renewals. We're at the beginning of our renewal cycle and so it's a massive three year cycle. I think in fiscal '23, 34% of our aggregate cable and television segment distribution revenue is up for renegotiation. The next fiscal year it's also 34% up for renegotiation and in fact fiscal '25 is still 28%. So we almost you know over the next three years, you know completely renew and refreshing and extend our cable distribution agreements.  You know we are well underway with the first \u2013 having completed the first round of those renewals and I have to say we are extremely pleased with the outcome of those renewals because our distribution partners do value what we bring to the bundle and our commitment to the bundle. So those renewals have gone very well and have met every expectation we've had for them. The split between cable affiliate revenue and television segment affiliate revenue will shift slightly. I think you'll see the television affiliate segment grow at a faster pace than the cable affiliate revenue, and that's just in terms of how we negotiate those agreements with the distributors. In terms of a potential recombination with news corporations, I really can't talk about it. It's actually an independent process going through with the independent committees and it's not for me to you know discuss the conversation. Well, I don't know the conversation they are having or nor can I discuss them, so sorry about that Jessica. Good morning, Robert. How are you? Look, I think you know scale, it has to be focused right, and scale is important and what we've seen amongst our media peers over the last few years are our peers getting bigger through mergers and acquisitions, and so I think scale lends flexibility in many ways. So we continue to grow our business, we continue to look at M&A and be very disciplined in how we how we look at it, but we also do look at the importance of scale, particularly over the next couple of years when opportunities I think in the marketplace will emerge. They are having the scale be flexible and how we deal with them will be important. So on TUBI, TUBI is being profitable in past quarters and we've made the proactive and I think prudent decision to use not this opportunity to invest in TUBI. Its modest investment compared to \u2013 very modest investment compared to what our peers are investing in their SVOD platforms, but we think it's a sage investment, because the opportunity to really lead in the in AVOD market is absolutely there for the taking. We are leading the AVOD market, but to sort of cement that lead and to win in the AVOD market is absolutely our goal.  So we'll continue to invest into the short to medium term in TUBI. I think particularly in an environment where there is potential sort of economic stress in households, having a free service is a great position to be in and I think TUBI will benefit from any \u2013 frankly from any economic chills that the people might feel. So it's the right time to invest this. It's the right time to extend our lead. Oh! And Flutter, we expect a decision in the Flutter arbitration imminently and you know once we have that handed down we'll assess our position, but we expect an imminent decision and we expect to be pleased by it, so. Thank you very much. As I mentioned, I can't really comment on it, because we don't know if there is a deal or if there will be a deal, what that deal would look like. So it's hard to comment on anything or impossible to comment anything that doesn't exist today. So, we like you have to be patient, sorry, and wait to see what the special committees are \u2013 what the outcome of their discussions and processes is.

            "name": "Steve Tomsic",
            "content": "Thanks Lachlan and good morning everyone. As Lachlan mentioned, we have made a solid start to fiscal 2023, delivering total company revenue growth of 5%. This top line momentum was led by 8% growth in our advertising revenues, where in the quarter we continued to see healthy scatter demand for our leading news and sports properties, and generated meaningful revenue reacceleration at TUBI. We also benefited from a record fiscal first quarter for political advertising revenues at our owned and operated television stations. Notably, we are able to drive 3% affiliate fee revenue growth without the benefit of any significant renewals impacting the quarter, and trailing 12 months subscriber losses running at approximately 7%. Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $1.09 billion, up 3% as our revenue growth was partially offset by higher expenses led by continued investment in our digital initiatives and increased rights amortization at FOX Sports.  Net income attributable to stockholders of $605 million or $1.10 per share, compares to the $701 million or $1.21 per share reported in the prior period. Once again, this was impacted by the change in fair value of the company's investment this quarter, which we recognize in other net.  Additionally, our effective tax rate was slightly higher in the quarter, primarily due to a re-measurement with our net deferred tax assets associated with the reduction in state taxes. This had no impact on our cash taxes in the quarter. Excluding this impact and other known core items, adjusted EPS was $1.21, up 9% over last year's $1.11.  Turning now to our segments starting with cable network programming. Cable advertising revenues were up 2% as our market leadership in news continue to drive linear pricing gains at the FOX News channel. This was partially offset by lower programmatic revenues at our digital news properties in the current period, as well as the impact of scheduling effects at our National Sports cable networks, where last year's revenues benefited from the Concacaf Gold Cup and Copa Ame\u0301rica Tournaments.  Cable affiliate fee revenues were consistent with the prior quarter. As we have signaled previously, we're in the early days of our next distribution renewal cycle and we are pleased with the outcomes of our earliest renewals, and we continue to expect to see these benefits take effect in the back half of our fiscal year and initially concentrated towards the television segment.  Cable and other revenues increased 9% in the quarter, primarily due to higher FOX Nation subscription revenues. EBITDA at our cable segment is $742 million compared to the $774 million reported in the prior year periods, and included the impact of elevated breaking news cost and the timing of digital investments at FOX News Media.  At Television, we delivered 8% revenue growth, led by an 11% increase in advertising revenues. Our television stations saw a record September quarter for political advertising revenues, while the FOX Network benefited from continued strength in pricing and additional MLB Broadcast of FOX Sports, partially offset by softer ratings.  Notably, we saw a sequential reacceleration of growth at TUBI, with revenues up 29% to approximately $165 million. This was on the back of a 53% increase in total view time and stable CTM's. Television affiliate fee revenues were up 6% as healthy growth in fees across all FOX affiliated stations more than offset any impact from subscribe declines. Other revenues increased 5% in the quarter, primarily reflecting the impact of the TMZ and MarVista acquisitions, partially offset by the timing of deliveries of Bento Box.  EBITDA at our Television segment was up 14% in the quarter, where we saw the typical seasonal increase in our marquee rights at costs at FOX Sports, including the impact of our MLB renewal, partially offset by lower marketing and programming expenses of FOX Entertainment.  We are clearly making strong progress in both audience growth and monetization at TUBI, which underscores our confidence in the long term value of this asset. So it is worth noting that the EBITDA we delivered in the quarter at the Television segment and FOX more broadly incorporates an approximately $50 million EBITDA investment in TUBI.  Now turning to cash flow where we generated $196 million of free cash flow in the quarter, consistent with the seasonality of our working capital cycle, where the first half of our fiscal year is characterized by a concentration of payments for sports rights and the build-up of advertising related receivables, both of which reversed in the second half of our fiscal year.  From a capital deployment perspective, fiscal year-to-date we have repurchased a further $300 million via our share buyback program. We remain committed to utilizing our full buyback authorization of $4 billion. Having now cumulatively repurchased $2.9 billion, representing approximately 14% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in 2019.  Finally, we continue to maintain a very robust balance sheet where we ended the quarter with approximately $5 billion in cash and $7.2 billion in debt. Fiscal 2023 is now well underway and with a strong program of showcase events still to come, coupled with the strongest balance sheet in the industry, FOX is uniquely placed to navigate any macro uncertainty and deliver value to our shareholders.  And with that, I'm happy to turn the call back over to Gabby. Hey Ben! Its Steve. Just on the capital allocation, I think this environment obviously lends itself to being more conservative on balance sheet management, but it's our nature to be measured in the way we manage the balance sheet. If you look at what we've done since the establishment of FOX and why capital has been directed, which sent $4 billion back to the shareholders, whether it be in the form of the $2.9 billion buybacks plus over $1 billion in dividends versus M&A which sits as \u2013 net M&A sits at below $1.5 billion. So I think the bias so far has been to return capital to shareholders where we haven't had other alternative uses for it, but right at the moment we feel like being measured is a touch more conservative, is the right place to be. Flutter? Just John, run rate for TUBI is at $50 million absolute EBITDA deficit in the quarter. Last year we sort of across - TUBI across the whole year was in the low 200's in terms of EBITDA deficit for the company. I would anticipate that the $50 million we saw last year, and I expect this to be the same case this year, where the second half of the year had relatively more investment than first half and so you should expect to see a relatively consistent pattern with that. And listen we \u2013 it doesn't change sort of our guidance in terms of the dilution around digital investments across the company, whether that includes TUBI, Nation, whether block-chain, the rest of the portfolio that remains intact as it is. But TUBI listen, as we see that business develop, we'll continue to invest in as we see that top line continue to grow, which is exceeding our expectations."

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the conference over to Chief Investor Relations Officer, Ms. Gabrielle Brown. Please go ahead, Ms. Brown.\nGabrielle Brown: Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our fiscal 2024 3rd quarter earnings call. Joining me on the call today are Lachlan Murdoch, Executive Chair and Chief Executive Officer; John Nallen, Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Tomsic, our Chief Financial Officer. First, Lachlan and Steve will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter, and then we'll take questions from the investment community. Please note that this call may include forward-looking statements regarding Fox Corporation's financial performance and operating results. These statements are based on management's current expectations, and actual results could differ from what is stated as a result of certain factors identified on today's call and in the company's SEC filings. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA or EBITDA, as we refer to it on this call. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and our SEC filings, which are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Lachlan.\nLachlan Murdoch : Thank you, Gabby, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. This quarter, FOX continued to distinguish itself from its peers delivering 7% EBITDA growth and demonstrating again the strength of our brands and the advantages of our strategy. This result is even more impressive when considering we are comping to last year's third quarter, which enjoyed a significant tailwind from Super Bowl 57. In the fiscal third quarter, total affiliate revenue fees grew 4% with positive growth at both our Television and Cable segments, driven by pricing benefits from our recent renewals. Headline advertising revenues were down during the quarter as expected, due to the absence of the Super Bowl and fewer NFL broadcast than in the prior year. If not for the difference in our NFL postseason schedule, our total advertising revenues would have increased a few percent. Overall, advertising trends at FOX are clearly moving in the right direction, both in the scatter market and in early upfront discussions. Demand for sports remains robust, while trends at FOX News are improving across the board, including the fact that we have now fully lapped the direct response market issue that had adversely impacted FOX News PR revenues. And while there wasn't much of a primary season this year, we do expect strong political advertising for national and local races as well as local ballot issues in the first half of our fiscal '25 which would largely benefit our station group. As we look to our annual upfront presentation next week, our focus on live content and must-watch events, such as the coming presidential election cycle and next year's Super Bowl combined with Tobi's position as the most watched free TV and movie streaming service will favor our enviable position with advertisers across the FOX portfolio. Operationally, FOX News again ended the third quarter as the most watched cable network in total day and primetime. FOX News also strengthened its leadership position inside the category gaining share again, commands 50% of total debuting. These gains are underpinned by a dedicated team of journalists and staff who are focused on delivering coverage and insights on current events most relevant to our viewers. Building from our strength in primetime, we are expanding our leadership across day parts, whether that be mornings with FOX & Friends, afternoons with The Five or late nights with Gutfeld. And we expect this momentum to continue as we ramp action coverage heading into the fall. Tubi ended the third quarter with 22% revenue growth driven by a 36% increase in total view time and 20% growth in monthly active users to just under 80 million MAUs. Our expansive content library and our differentiated user base have solidified Tubi's position as the most watched free TV and movie streaming service in the U.S. with 1.6% of total TV viewing, ahead of Peacock, MAX, The Roku Channel, Paramount+ and Pluto TV and only marginally behind Disney+. Paramount's debut on the Nielsen Gauge in February of '23 to the most recent gauge in March of '24 to be share of total U.S. TV view time grew 60%, which is faster than any other streaming service over that same period of time. Apart from just its growing scale to be also unique and uniquely valuable to advertisers through its reach and through its engagement. Over 60% of Tubi users are classified as cord cutters or cord nevers and 90% of those user time watching is proactively on demand as opposed to passively watching a fast channel. This positions to be very well as an important part of the growing digital streaming advertising marketplace. We look forward to showcasing Tubi's strengths at next week's upfront. FOX Sports had an impressive quarter with strength across all areas of our portfolio. We finished the 30th anniversary of the NFL on FOX on a high note with 3 NFC playoff games on FOX averaging an incredible 45 million viewers. This was capped with the NFC Championship game growing over 56 million viewers, which is 19% higher than last year's NFC Championship game and the most watched in over a decade. This season also reinforced FOX solid position in collar sports with strong viewers from both college football and college basketball. In fact, in the current academic year, FOX are the most watched college football, Men's College Basketball and women's college basketball games across the regular season. College Sports has grown to become the second biggest source of FOX viewership behind only the NFL. Total consumption of college sports on FOX has grown by over 40% through the last five years. And in the March quarter, we launched the UFL, United Football League, the result of the merger of the USFL and XFL. With this merger, the outlook for spring football is promising, and we are pleased with the results through the midpoint of the season. While the sports calendar in our upcoming fiscal fourth quarter tends to be quieter, FOX Sports is excited to present its summer of soccer, featuring over 200 hours of live soccer coverage across our platform starting with the UEFA European Football Championship on June 14 and Copa America on June 20. This summer will also feature a new schedule from FOX Entertainment, with returning favorites like Gordon Ramsay's Food Stars and exciting new shows like the 1%. This follows a successful spring slate that featured two of the top five new primetime series in Krapopolis and the floor. With Krapopolis, ranking as the number one new Primetime Entertainment Show and the floor as the number one game show season to date. Last quarter, we announced the formation of a new sports-focused digital distribution platform with our partners Disney and Warner Bros Discovery. We are happy to have hired truly a world-class CEO in Pete Distad and he is off to a flying start. In just several weeks, the JV now has over 150 engineers and executives dedicated to building a unique innovative product which focuses on sports fans outside of the traditional TV bundle. We've already launched an internal data service, which I have been trialing this past week, and I have to say it's an incredibly exciting product and we can't wait to launch it this fall. Today's media market is certainly dynamic, but the strength and leadership of our brands and their capacity to convert those strengths financially underscores our considered strategy. Underpinned by our best-in-class balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $3.8 billion in cash and just 1 time net leverage. We remain committed to driving long-term shareholder value creation through the thoughtful balance of managing our existing businesses, pursuing new adjacencies and returning capital to our shareholders. And with that, I'll hand it over to Steve.\nSteve Tomsic : Thanks, Lachlan, and good morning, everyone. FOX's strategy continues to deliver solid results. Even with the comparison to our blockbuster NFL schedule of the prior year, we posted total revenues of $3.45 billion and grew adjusted EBITDA by 7% to $891 million. Total company affiliate fee revenues grew 4% over the prior year with growth at both our Television and Cable segments, supported by a recent cycle of affiliate renewals. Reflecting the event-driven nature of our business, advertising revenues on a headline basis were down 34% as we compare against last year's broadcast of the Super Bowl, along with 2 less NFL playoff broadcasts in the current year quarter. As Lachlan just mentioned, if not for the impact of these NFL schedule items, total company advertising revenues would have grown low single digits. Total company other revenues were down 22% versus the prior year primarily the result of the timing of sports of licensing revenues, which were more weighted towards our fiscal second quarter this year. Total company expenses fell 21% year-over-year primarily a result of the NFL postseason schedule differences I just mentioned. Net income attributable to stockholders of $666 million or $1.40 per share compared to the net loss of $54 million or negative $0.10 per share reported in the prior year period. This year-over-year variance reflects the growth in EBITDA as well as the absence of last year's FOX News Media litigation charge and a current quarter book gain on the merger transaction of the USFL which is now being deconsolidated in connection with the formation of the United Football League. Excluding these and other non-core items, adjusted EPS was $1.09, up 16% against last year's $0.94. Now let's turn to our segment results. At Cable, revenues were $1.47 billion, down 6% from the prior year quarter, while EBITDA grew 3%. Cable affiliate fee revenues were up 1%, with growth in pricing from our distribution renewals outpacing the impact of -- from industry subscriber declines running in the mid-8% range. Cable advertising revenues fell by 6% or $20 million at the national sports networks, advertising revenues were down due to the absence of last year's Super Bowl-related programming, and the world baseball classic. At FOX News, ad revenues were impacted by moderating direct response pricing declines and lower digital traffic, partially offset by higher national pricing. Cable other revenues decreased $89 million, primarily a result of the timing of sports sublicensing revenues, which were more weighted towards our fiscal second quarter. Cable expenses were 16% lower than the prior year, primarily due to the timing of the associated sports sublicensing expenses, lower costs at FOX News and the deconsolidation of the USFR. All in and despite segment revenues being down 6%, quarterly adjusted EBITDA at Cable grew 3% over the prior year quarter to reach $819 million. Turning to our Television segment, where revenues were $1.94 billion, down 22% from the prior year, while EBITDA increased 24%. TV affiliate fee revenues grew 9% over the prior year as price increases across our owned and operated as well as 30 FOX-affiliated stations more than offset the impact from subscriber declines. As mentioned previously, TV advertising revenues were impacted this quarter by the composition of our post-season NFL schedule, namely the absence of last year's Super Bowl and 2 less NFL playoff games. As a result, on a headline basis, TV advertising revenues were down 40%. TV Other revenues increased $30 million, primarily the result of the timing of deliveries from our entertainment production companies. While total TV revenues were down versus the prior year, this was more than offset by a 24% decrease in TV expenses. Expenses were lower in the quarter, primarily due to the impact of the NFL schedule along with fewer hours of original drifted prime time content, including the impact of the industry labor disputes. All in, we delivered quarterly adjusted EBITDA at the TV segment of $145 million up 24% over the prior year quarter. Turning to cash flow, where we generated strong free cash flow of $1.39 billion in the quarter reflecting our normal seasonal cycle of collecting advertising revenues from our fall programming, coupled with our major sports rights payments being concentrated in the first half of our fiscal year. From a capital return perspective, from the commencement of the third quarter through today, we have repurchased $300 million under our share buyback program, along with returning nearly $125 million to our shareholders via our semiannual dividend payment. Our total cumulative buyback activity since the launch of the program in 2019 now amounts to $5.4 billion or 26% of our total shares outstanding and we remain committed to fully utilizing our current $7 billion authorization. These capital return measures are supported by our robust balance sheet, where we ended the quarter with $3.8 billion in cash and $7.2 billion in gross debt. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Gabby to open the Q&A.\nGabrielle Brown : Great. Thanks, Steve. And now we will be happy to take questions from the investment community.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of John Hodulik from UBS. Please go ahead.\nJohn Hodulik: Thank you, and good morning everyone. Strong growth again at Tubi. I guess a couple of questions on that. I mean, first, what's driving the growth in TVT? Any color you guys can provide on CPMs? Disney yesterday gave you a little color on some weakness in connected TV CPMs and then three, any color you can provide on dilution at Tubi and maybe how you guys view future profitability of that business? Thanks.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks very much, John. So, let me -- I'll start. I'm not quite sure what I understand what you mean by dilution at Tubi, but let me start with the other two. The growth of Tubi continues to be incredibly strong. I think TVT growth comes from both new subscribers or new viewers finding the platform. As you'd be aware, we've very efficiently be marketing the platform to bring more people to it, and it's becoming a wider and wider known and loved brand in the marketplace. And the reason for that is we have -- we've talked about it on calls before, with 250,000 movies and television series, on the platform. And now over 250 in fact, I think, around 270 live fast channels on the platform, it really does offer a tremendous product for everyone who's utilizing it. But it's very interesting because of all those fast channels and all those 2,000 movies and TV series, 90% of the viewing comes on demand. And this is very important because when the viewing comes on demand and it's proactively on demand as opposed to passively sort of sitting back and watching our fast channel, that's much more valuable to advertisers. And it certainly is something that we're going to make a big deal about at our upfront presentations next week. So, because of that, we are very confident we can hold our CPMs at Tubi. We're already very efficient with our CPMs. I think some of our competitors priced themselves when they entered the AVOD market over the past 12 months to 18 months are very high, and we're seeing the marketplace then having to drop CPMs as new entrants add supply to the market. So that's affecting the market overall. It certainly has an impact on the market for advertising for Tubi. But from a CPM point of view, it's not really going to be a big impact to us. I should just say, though, that next quarter, we are going to be facing difficult comps in the fourth quarter. I think if you remember, this time last year, Tubi was up 47%, in revenue, and that's going to be a very difficult comp for us next quarter. So, there will be some headwinds for the whole marketplace, but from a comp point of view for Tubi as well in the next quarter. So that's just a slight word of caution.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Fishman from Moffett. Please go ahead.\nRobert Fishman : Good morning, everyone. Given all the press about the NBA negotiations underway, just curious if you can think a little bit as far as your broader sports rights go? And how do you think about the value of FOX Broadcast Network as you negotiate those future sports, right? And then the flip side of that is you feel like you're at a competitive disadvantage without your own SVOD service to compete for future rights? And then if I can, just separately, given all the M&A discussion in the industry, what are your latest thoughts on monetizing some of your strategic noncore assets like your FanDuel option and Studio Lot? Thank you.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks, Roger. So, with the MBI, obviously, I can't sort of comment on other people's sort of negotiations and where that may or may end up. And in terms of how we think about it affecting the value of the FOX Network and our sports portfolio. We're very happy with our sports portfolio. We obviously look at -- but packages as they come up but we see them as a portfolio or a bouquet of sports rights that we have, and we feel very strong with the current portfolio that we have, which is one of the reasons why we didn't pursue the MBA in this round of negotiations. But I think it does go to the value of broadcast television because sports leagues still need reaches the -- is still incredibly important for them, for them to drive their fan bases, for them to get the maximum amount of viewership to their games and matches. And so, the value of the FOX Network and frankly, our strategically kind of our position station group to any sports league only increases over time is what we're seeing. And therefore, I don't think coming of second part of your question, I don't think we are strategically disadvantaged with not having a subscription video-on-demand service because we found in the past, we can partner with others. Well, frankly, the leagues to tend to partner with others, we can take the rights where we can broadcast to the most amount of Americans possible and they can allocate rights to SVODs as needed. But they're never going to be able to live entirely without a broadcast network and the broadcast distribution.\nSteve Tomsic : Yes. So, Robert, just in terms of the M&A picture, our posture on sort of what near-term noncore assets, like we're strong believers in the sports betting market in this country. We read with interest you all not to put $1 billion-dollar value on it. And so, it is now our intention is to see through and eventually exercise. And then the Studio Lot, we think, is a long-term asset for us. We have development plans for that. And so, we don't any change in posture around early monetization of those assets. We think they are incredibly valuable for the long term.\nLachlan Murdoch: And I'd just remind you, it's not only the value of the option, but also the equity that we have in Flutter, which is today worth over $900 million.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBen Swinburne : Thanks. Good morning. Just sort of a question around kind of your products coming to market, the streaming JV and also maybe how Tubi might fit in, any more you can share with us on sort of what you think is really differentiated about the product? We haven't seen it yet, you have. And I noticed in the Disney deck yesterday that it says that a definitive agreement hasn't been signed yet. So, I didn't know if there was something holding it up or if that meant anything or any update on sort of the go-forward plan and then I'm wondering Tubi with its reach as an app-based service, is that an opportunity for maybe bundling the JV product or merchandising and in some way, you have a pretty interesting direct customer relationship with Tubi. I know it's a different kind of product offering. But I was curious if you thought about leveraging that asset or those two assets together to create more value for the company.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks very much, Ben. So first of all, as I said, I've got actually in the room behind me, I've got the beta version of the streaming app and I don't think we've announced the name yet, so I won't inadvertently do it on this call. I hope not yet anyway. And -- but look, it's something that we've been able to engage with, and it is really looking tremendously exciting, as I said in my comments. It's very innovative. It's designed to be entirely focused on the cord nevers, cord cutters, people who are not in the cable bundle. And we frankly can't -- won't be able to compare it to a tier of live channels. It's a very different digital-first product which I'm -- when you eventually get it and get to enjoy it, you'll understand how groundbreaking certainly in this country, it really is. In terms of the speed, everyone are running at a sort of full pace to get the product finished and delivered. Obviously, there's the fun side of it, which is like the user interface and how you use it, which has been great to use, but there's a ton of work, obviously, in engineering behind that in ingesting content from multiple partners and being able to combine that into one sort of seamless platform. So, there's a tremendous amount of work that's being done to get them -- to get us over the line this autumn but we're incredibly excited. And so, there's no -- I wouldn't read anything into a final deal terms being signed. It's just a matter of everyone running on all cylinders to get this finished. So, on Tubi, sorry, the Tubi. We don't see Tubi is a very different product. We don't see an opportunity at this stage or we haven't contemplated an opportunity at this stage to bundle the sports service with Tubi. I think it makes potentially more sense to bundle sports with other SVOD services, which you'll likely see as we go forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jessica Ehrlich from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich : A couple of questions. First, on political advertising. Lachlan, you seem pretty confident that it will come back. But I guess the question is really -- will it come back to linear the way it has in the past and what's your overall outlook. Second, on M&A, you may have the strongest balance sheet in the industry. So, I was just wondering if you could explore what opportunities you see out there. There seems to be a lot of things going on in the industry. And then finally, just a follow-up on Tubi, which has I mean such incredible momentum you've really pulled away from certainly all the other fast channels and competing with the big SVOD channels or network platforms. What does it look like over the next three years or so?\nLachlan Murdoch: Great. Thanks, Jessica. So on -- let me start with political. We are confident -- obviously we're disappointed for multiple reasons that there wasn't a more competitive primary season. But we certainly know this is an election which both sides of politics or all sides of politics are very focused on, have raised a tremendous amount of money, and that money will flow ultimately to local television. And we are extremely confident of that. One of the reasons we're confident in addition to the amount of money that we know has been raised are just a position of our stations -- specific stations within the group and how that aligns with the political map. If you look at the tight -- so putting aside presidential election focused [ph] on a call to talk about sort of national trends and people focus on presidential. But you have to look below presidential and look at sort of Senate races. So, we have tight center races in key markets where we have big stations. And you have to remember, Jessica, these are big new stations, right? And political money tends to run alongside news on local news. And so, there's tight races in Arizona, in -- these are presented in Michigan, ceratin Pennsylvania and in Wisconsin. And also, of course, our DC station will benefit from tight race in Maryland. In addition, you've got a lot of issues on the ballot in different markets. So, Arizona, Florida, I think Maryland again all have a lot of issue money flowing into those onto the ballot. So, we think it's going to be an incredibly strong political season. We're just starting later than we had first expected. And then you traditionally have -- when you have a primary -- more contested primers. So, we'll start to see the benefit of that in the first half of our next fiscal '25 for us. The next question on M&A and the balance sheet, I agree wholeheartedly. I think we have the best balance sheet in the industry. So, I think that's the math. That's just a fact. And so, we continue to look for accretive opportunities that would align with our kind of strategic goals and initiatives and we'll continue to do that. We obviously don't want our balance sheet to go to waste but we haven't found anything yet that we're going to do or follow. So -- but it is something we are keeping a close eye on. And then on TV, what is -- how does Tubi look over the next three years? Well, Tubi continues to grow. Obviously, as you get to scale, the growth trajectory, which is just harder to comp with the growth that we've had over the last couple of years. But Tubi continues to grow. Money will continue to flow from linear entertainment television, particularly cable entertainment networks into streaming AVOD and SVOD with advertising supported SVOD services. That trend will not slow -- will be one of the main beneficiaries of that money flow. So, we're confident in the continued growth of Tubi. And under the leadership of Angele, it just goes from strength to strength.\nGabrielle Brown : Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Okay. That question comes from the line of Michael Morris from Guggenheim. Please go ahead.\nMichael Morris : Thank you. Good morning, guys. Two questions, if I could. The first one is on the JV and some of your existing distribution partners have brought up concerns. It's in some way unfair to them for you to have a sports-only JV. It seems that you would disagree by virtue of the fact that you're moving forward. So, I'd love if you could address those concerns and whether you think there will be changes in the marketplace or whether you think those concerns are unfounded. And the second question, a bit more on the model, perhaps for Steve, television profit was, I think, notably strong in the quarter, given that on a year-over-year basis, you did not have the Super Bowl or those extra playoff games. So, can you maybe unpack a little bit? We would think that those types of events would be uniquely profitable so to show profit growth as you comp those challenges. I'd be curious if you could talk about sort of the sustainability and whether maybe we're overestimating how profitable those games are. Thank you.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks, Mike. Well, let me start. So, on the sports joint venture and how we certainly view it and how we discuss it with our distribution partners. I think the first thing, and this is incredibly important to us is that we are wholly and fundamentally supportive of the traditional cable television bundle. It will continue to be, for a very long time, our number one revenue stream. And we are all in to support our distributors in every way we can in that bundle and supporting their subscribers and their business. So that's -- that is absolutely a fundamental fact for us. Having said that, we've always said it's important for us to put our brands where viewers are, right? And in the universe of sports fans that don't currently take a cable bundle, that is the universe that the sports joint venture will be entirely focused on and it's frankly important to us that because we are so invested in the Cable bundle, that the sports joint venture will be very targeted and very focused on the nontraditional Pay TV viewer universe. And we think we can very cleverly and very -- in a very targeted way market to those subscribers so that we minimize any cannibalization of the traditional subscribers. And so, we're very open with our distributors. We're very open with how important they are to us and also how -- because of that importance, how we can focus the sports joint venture and the errors that needs to be focused on.\nSteve Tomsic: Mike, it's Steve. Just in terms of television profitability. So, quarter-to-quarter, we were up close to $30 million. The way to think about it is the single biggest event was Super Bowl, which was a high tens of million dollars EBITDA contribution last year versus this year. But then you look at it this year to offset that, we grew affiliate fee in the segment by about $70 million. And so, one for the other basically is a push, TV was a push quarter-on-quarter in terms of EBITDA deficit there. And so, then what's left is the biggest EBITDA sort of driver of contribution when you look at it from a quarter-on-quarter perspective, is the change in entertainment programming costs, which was an ongoing push towards from scripted towards unscripted to get dollar cost per hour down without harming dealership as well as the impact of the strikes. And so that's -- there's a lot of other puts and takes in there, but there are sort of the big three things that driver.\nGabrielle Brown: At this point, we are out of time. But if you have any further questions, please give me or Charlie Costanzo a call. Thanks so much for joining us today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

FOX News also strengthened its leadership position inside the category gaining share again, commands 50% of total debuting. These gains are underpinned by a dedicated team of journalists and staff who are focused on delivering coverage and insights on current events most relevant to our viewers. Building from our strength in primetime, we are expanding our leadership across day parts, whether that be mornings with FOX & Friends, afternoons with The Five or late nights with Gutfeld. And we expect this momentum to continue as we ramp action coverage heading into the fall. Tubi ended the third quarter with 22% revenue growth driven by a 36% increase in total view time and 20% growth in monthly active users to just under 80 million MAUs. Our expansive content library and our differentiated user base have solidified Tubi's position as the most watched free TV and movie streaming service in the U.S. with 1.6% of total TV viewing, ahead of Peacock, MAX, The Roku Channel, Paramount+ and Pluto TV and only marginally behind Disney+. Paramount's debut on the Nielsen Gauge in February of '23 to the most recent gauge in March of '24 to be share of total U.S. TV view time grew 60%, which is faster than any other streaming service over that same period of time. Apart from just its growing scale to be also unique and uniquely valuable to advertisers through its reach and through its engagement. Over 60% of Tubi users are classified as cord cutters or cord nevers and 90% of those user time watching is proactively on demand as opposed to passively watching a fast channel. This positions to be very well as an important part of the growing digital streaming advertising marketplace. We look forward to showcasing Tubi's strengths at next week's upfront. FOX Sports had an impressive quarter with strength across all areas of our portfolio. We finished the 30th anniversary of the NFL on FOX on a high note with 3 NFC playoff games on FOX averaging an incredible 45 million viewers. This was capped with the NFC Championship game growing over 56 million viewers, which is 19% higher than last year's NFC Championship game and the most watched in over a decade. This season also reinforced FOX solid position in collar sports with strong viewers from both college football and college basketball. In fact, in the current academic year, FOX are the most watched college football, Men's College Basketball and women's college basketball games across the regular season. College Sports has grown to become the second biggest source of FOX viewership behind only the NFL. Total consumption of college sports on FOX has grown by over 40% through the last five years. And in the March quarter, we launched the UFL, United Football League, the result of the merger of the USFL and XFL. With this merger, the outlook for spring football is promising, and we are pleased with the results through the midpoint of the season. While the sports calendar in our upcoming fiscal fourth quarter tends to be quieter, FOX Sports is excited to present its summer of soccer, featuring over 200 hours of live soccer coverage across our platform starting with the UEFA European Football Championship on June 14 and Copa America on June 20. This summer will also feature a new schedule from FOX Entertainment, with returning favorites like Gordon Ramsay's Food Stars and exciting new shows like the 1%. This follows a successful spring slate that featured two of the top five new primetime series in Krapopolis and the floor. With Krapopolis, ranking as the number one new Primetime Entertainment Show and the floor as the number one game show season to date. Last quarter, we announced the formation of a new sports-focused digital distribution platform with our partners Disney and Warner Bros Discovery. We are happy to have hired truly a world-class CEO in Pete Distad and he is off to a flying start. In just several weeks, the JV now has over 150 engineers and executives dedicated to building a unique innovative product which focuses on sports fans outside of the traditional TV bundle. We've already launched an internal data service, which I have been trialing this past week, and I have to say it's an incredibly exciting product and we can't wait to launch it this fall. Today's media market is certainly dynamic, but the strength and leadership of our brands and their capacity to convert those strengths financially underscores our considered strategy. Underpinned by our best-in-class balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $3.8 billion in cash and just 1 time net leverage. We remain committed to driving long-term shareholder value creation through the thoughtful balance of managing our existing businesses, pursuing new adjacencies and returning capital to our shareholders. And with that, I'll hand it over to Steve. Thanks very much, John. So, let me -- I'll start. I'm not quite sure what I understand what you mean by dilution at Tubi, but let me start with the other two. The growth of Tubi continues to be incredibly strong. I think TVT growth comes from both new subscribers or new viewers finding the platform. As you'd be aware, we've very efficiently be marketing the platform to bring more people to it, and it's becoming a wider and wider known and loved brand in the marketplace. And the reason for that is we have -- we've talked about it on calls before, with 250,000 movies and television series, on the platform. And now over 250 in fact, I think, around 270 live fast channels on the platform, it really does offer a tremendous product for everyone who's utilizing it. But it's very interesting because of all those fast channels and all those 2,000 movies and TV series, 90% of the viewing comes on demand. And this is very important because when the viewing comes on demand and it's proactively on demand as opposed to passively sort of sitting back and watching our fast channel, that's much more valuable to advertisers. And it certainly is something that we're going to make a big deal about at our upfront presentations next week. So, because of that, we are very confident we can hold our CPMs at Tubi. We're already very efficient with our CPMs. I think some of our competitors priced themselves when they entered the AVOD market over the past 12 months to 18 months are very high, and we're seeing the marketplace then having to drop CPMs as new entrants add supply to the market. So that's affecting the market overall. It certainly has an impact on the market for advertising for Tubi. But from a CPM point of view, it's not really going to be a big impact to us. I should just say, though, that next quarter, we are going to be facing difficult comps in the fourth quarter. I think if you remember, this time last year, Tubi was up 47%, in revenue, and that's going to be a very difficult comp for us next quarter. So, there will be some headwinds for the whole marketplace, but from a comp point of view for Tubi as well in the next quarter. So that's just a slight word of caution. Thanks, Roger. So, with the MBI, obviously, I can't sort of comment on other people's sort of negotiations and where that may or may end up. And in terms of how we think about it affecting the value of the FOX Network and our sports portfolio. We're very happy with our sports portfolio. We obviously look at -- but packages as they come up but we see them as a portfolio or a bouquet of sports rights that we have, and we feel very strong with the current portfolio that we have, which is one of the reasons why we didn't pursue the MBA in this round of negotiations. But I think it does go to the value of broadcast television because sports leagues still need reaches the -- is still incredibly important for them, for them to drive their fan bases, for them to get the maximum amount of viewership to their games and matches. And so, the value of the FOX Network and frankly, our strategically kind of our position station group to any sports league only increases over time is what we're seeing. And therefore, I don't think coming of second part of your question, I don't think we are strategically disadvantaged with not having a subscription video-on-demand service because we found in the past, we can partner with others. Well, frankly, the leagues to tend to partner with others, we can take the rights where we can broadcast to the most amount of Americans possible and they can allocate rights to SVODs as needed. But they're never going to be able to live entirely without a broadcast network and the broadcast distribution. And I'd just remind you, it's not only the value of the option, but also the equity that we have in Flutter, which is today worth over $900 million. Thanks very much, Ben. So first of all, as I said, I've got actually in the room behind me, I've got the beta version of the streaming app and I don't think we've announced the name yet, so I won't inadvertently do it on this call. I hope not yet anyway. And -- but look, it's something that we've been able to engage with, and it is really looking tremendously exciting, as I said in my comments. It's very innovative. It's designed to be entirely focused on the cord nevers, cord cutters, people who are not in the cable bundle. And we frankly can't -- won't be able to compare it to a tier of live channels. It's a very different digital-first product which I'm -- when you eventually get it and get to enjoy it, you'll understand how groundbreaking certainly in this country, it really is. In terms of the speed, everyone are running at a sort of full pace to get the product finished and delivered. Obviously, there's the fun side of it, which is like the user interface and how you use it, which has been great to use, but there's a ton of work, obviously, in engineering behind that in ingesting content from multiple partners and being able to combine that into one sort of seamless platform. So, there's a tremendous amount of work that's being done to get them -- to get us over the line this autumn but we're incredibly excited. And so, there's no -- I wouldn't read anything into a final deal terms being signed. It's just a matter of everyone running on all cylinders to get this finished. So, on Tubi, sorry, the Tubi. We don't see Tubi is a very different product. We don't see an opportunity at this stage or we haven't contemplated an opportunity at this stage to bundle the sports service with Tubi. I think it makes potentially more sense to bundle sports with other SVOD services, which you'll likely see as we go forward. Great. Thanks, Jessica. So on -- let me start with political. We are confident -- obviously we're disappointed for multiple reasons that there wasn't a more competitive primary season. But we certainly know this is an election which both sides of politics or all sides of politics are very focused on, have raised a tremendous amount of money, and that money will flow ultimately to local television. And we are extremely confident of that. One of the reasons we're confident in addition to the amount of money that we know has been raised are just a position of our stations -- specific stations within the group and how that aligns with the political map. If you look at the tight -- so putting aside presidential election focused [ph] on a call to talk about sort of national trends and people focus on presidential. But you have to look below presidential and look at sort of Senate races. So, we have tight center races in key markets where we have big stations. And you have to remember, Jessica, these are big new stations, right? And political money tends to run alongside news on local news. And so, there's tight races in Arizona, in -- these are presented in Michigan, ceratin Pennsylvania and in Wisconsin. And also, of course, our DC station will benefit from tight race in Maryland. In addition, you've got a lot of issues on the ballot in different markets. So, Arizona, Florida, I think Maryland again all have a lot of issue money flowing into those onto the ballot. So, we think it's going to be an incredibly strong political season. We're just starting later than we had first expected. And then you traditionally have -- when you have a primary -- more contested primers. So, we'll start to see the benefit of that in the first half of our next fiscal '25 for us. The next question on M&A and the balance sheet, I agree wholeheartedly. I think we have the best balance sheet in the industry. So, I think that's the math. That's just a fact. And so, we continue to look for accretive opportunities that would align with our kind of strategic goals and initiatives and we'll continue to do that. We obviously don't want our balance sheet to go to waste but we haven't found anything yet that we're going to do or follow. So -- but it is something we are keeping a close eye on. And then on TV, what is -- how does Tubi look over the next three years? Well, Tubi continues to grow. Obviously, as you get to scale, the growth trajectory, which is just harder to comp with the growth that we've had over the last couple of years. But Tubi continues to grow. Money will continue to flow from linear entertainment television, particularly cable entertainment networks into streaming AVOD and SVOD with advertising supported SVOD services. That trend will not slow -- will be one of the main beneficiaries of that money flow. So, we're confident in the continued growth of Tubi. And under the leadership of Angele, it just goes from strength to strength. Thanks, Mike. Well, let me start. So, on the sports joint venture and how we certainly view it and how we discuss it with our distribution partners. I think the first thing, and this is incredibly important to us is that we are wholly and fundamentally supportive of the traditional cable television bundle. It will continue to be, for a very long time, our number one revenue stream. And we are all in to support our distributors in every way we can in that bundle and supporting their subscribers and their business. So that's -- that is absolutely a fundamental fact for us. Having said that, we've always said it's important for us to put our brands where viewers are, right? And in the universe of sports fans that don't currently take a cable bundle, that is the universe that the sports joint venture will be entirely focused on and it's frankly important to us that because we are so invested in the Cable bundle, that the sports joint venture will be very targeted and very focused on the nontraditional Pay TV viewer universe. And we think we can very cleverly and very -- in a very targeted way market to those subscribers so that we minimize any cannibalization of the traditional subscribers. And so, we're very open with our distributors. We're very open with how important they are to us and also how -- because of that importance, how we can focus the sports joint venture and the errors that needs to be focused on."

            "name": "Steve Tomsic",
            "content": "Thanks, Lachlan, and good morning, everyone. FOX's strategy continues to deliver solid results. Even with the comparison to our blockbuster NFL schedule of the prior year, we posted total revenues of $3.45 billion and grew adjusted EBITDA by 7% to $891 million. Total company affiliate fee revenues grew 4% over the prior year with growth at both our Television and Cable segments, supported by a recent cycle of affiliate renewals. Reflecting the event-driven nature of our business, advertising revenues on a headline basis were down 34% as we compare against last year's broadcast of the Super Bowl, along with 2 less NFL playoff broadcasts in the current year quarter. As Lachlan just mentioned, if not for the impact of these NFL schedule items, total company advertising revenues would have grown low single digits. Total company other revenues were down 22% versus the prior year primarily the result of the timing of sports of licensing revenues, which were more weighted towards our fiscal second quarter this year. Total company expenses fell 21% year-over-year primarily a result of the NFL postseason schedule differences I just mentioned. Net income attributable to stockholders of $666 million or $1.40 per share compared to the net loss of $54 million or negative $0.10 per share reported in the prior year period. This year-over-year variance reflects the growth in EBITDA as well as the absence of last year's FOX News Media litigation charge and a current quarter book gain on the merger transaction of the USFL which is now being deconsolidated in connection with the formation of the United Football League. Excluding these and other non-core items, adjusted EPS was $1.09, up 16% against last year's $0.94. Now let's turn to our segment results. At Cable, revenues were $1.47 billion, down 6% from the prior year quarter, while EBITDA grew 3%. Cable affiliate fee revenues were up 1%, with growth in pricing from our distribution renewals outpacing the impact of -- from industry subscriber declines running in the mid-8% range. Cable advertising revenues fell by 6% or $20 million at the national sports networks, advertising revenues were down due to the absence of last year's Super Bowl-related programming, and the world baseball classic. At FOX News, ad revenues were impacted by moderating direct response pricing declines and lower digital traffic, partially offset by higher national pricing. Cable other revenues decreased $89 million, primarily a result of the timing of sports sublicensing revenues, which were more weighted towards our fiscal second quarter. Cable expenses were 16% lower than the prior year, primarily due to the timing of the associated sports sublicensing expenses, lower costs at FOX News and the deconsolidation of the USFR. All in and despite segment revenues being down 6%, quarterly adjusted EBITDA at Cable grew 3% over the prior year quarter to reach $819 million. Turning to our Television segment, where revenues were $1.94 billion, down 22% from the prior year, while EBITDA increased 24%. TV affiliate fee revenues grew 9% over the prior year as price increases across our owned and operated as well as 30 FOX-affiliated stations more than offset the impact from subscriber declines. As mentioned previously, TV advertising revenues were impacted this quarter by the composition of our post-season NFL schedule, namely the absence of last year's Super Bowl and 2 less NFL playoff games. As a result, on a headline basis, TV advertising revenues were down 40%. TV Other revenues increased $30 million, primarily the result of the timing of deliveries from our entertainment production companies. While total TV revenues were down versus the prior year, this was more than offset by a 24% decrease in TV expenses. Expenses were lower in the quarter, primarily due to the impact of the NFL schedule along with fewer hours of original drifted prime time content, including the impact of the industry labor disputes. All in, we delivered quarterly adjusted EBITDA at the TV segment of $145 million up 24% over the prior year quarter. Turning to cash flow, where we generated strong free cash flow of $1.39 billion in the quarter reflecting our normal seasonal cycle of collecting advertising revenues from our fall programming, coupled with our major sports rights payments being concentrated in the first half of our fiscal year. From a capital return perspective, from the commencement of the third quarter through today, we have repurchased $300 million under our share buyback program, along with returning nearly $125 million to our shareholders via our semiannual dividend payment. Our total cumulative buyback activity since the launch of the program in 2019 now amounts to $5.4 billion or 26% of our total shares outstanding and we remain committed to fully utilizing our current $7 billion authorization. These capital return measures are supported by our robust balance sheet, where we ended the quarter with $3.8 billion in cash and $7.2 billion in gross debt. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Gabby to open the Q&A. Yes. So, Robert, just in terms of the M&A picture, our posture on sort of what near-term noncore assets, like we're strong believers in the sports betting market in this country. We read with interest you all not to put $1 billion-dollar value on it. And so, it is now our intention is to see through and eventually exercise. And then the Studio Lot, we think, is a long-term asset for us. We have development plans for that. And so, we don't any change in posture around early monetization of those assets. We think they are incredibly valuable for the long term. Mike, it's Steve. Just in terms of television profitability. So, quarter-to-quarter, we were up close to $30 million. The way to think about it is the single biggest event was Super Bowl, which was a high tens of million dollars EBITDA contribution last year versus this year. But then you look at it this year to offset that, we grew affiliate fee in the segment by about $70 million. And so, one for the other basically is a push, TV was a push quarter-on-quarter in terms of EBITDA deficit there. And so, then what's left is the biggest EBITDA sort of driver of contribution when you look at it from a quarter-on-quarter perspective, is the change in entertainment programming costs, which was an ongoing push towards from scripted towards unscripted to get dollar cost per hour down without harming dealership as well as the impact of the strikes. And so that's -- there's a lot of other puts and takes in there, but there are sort of the big three things that driver."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Fox Corporation Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Chief Investor Relations Officer, Ms. Gabrielle Brown. Please go ahead, Ms. Brown. \nGabrielle Brown: Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our fiscal 2024 second quarter earnings call. Joining me on the call today are Lachlan Murdoch, Executive Chair and Chief Executive Officer; John Nallen, Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Tomsic, our Chief Financial Officer. \n First, Lachlan and Steve will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter, and then we'll take questions from the investment community. Please note that this call may include forward-looking statements regarding Fox Corporation's financial performance and operating results. These statements are based on management's current expectations and actual results could differ from what is stated as a result of certain factors identified on today's call and in the company's SEC filings. \n Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA or EBITDA, as we refer to it on this call. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and our SEC filings, which are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Lachlan. \nLachlan Murdoch: Thank you, Gabby, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Against the backdrop of an active news cycle and another robust fall sports schedule, our fiscal second quarter, again illustrated the strength of FOX. The growth we delivered in affiliate fee revenues was the standout this quarter, with the Television segment growing by 10% and the Cable segment returning to growth, once again demonstrating the power of our brands and our programming.\n We've now largely completed our fiscal '24 affiliate renewal cycle, having achieved our commercial goals without disruption and setting a solid foundation for renewals in fiscal 2025 and beyond. As expected, advertising revenues in the quarter were down primarily due to comparisons to last year's major cyclical events, including the midterm elections at the TV stations and the broadcast of the Men's World Cup in the Cable and Television segments. \n Parsing through the cyclical comparisons, our concentration in news and sports, coupled with the outstanding performance of Tubi is clearly an advantage in a mixed advertising environment. More specifically, sports advertising was very healthy during the quarter, and we saw particularly strong demand for the NFL and College Football which continued into the NFL playoffs. \n At news, the second quarter was more nuanced. While preemptions and the direct response market adversely impacted quarterly growth, we sequentially narrowed the gap between the current and prior year in ratings and in pricing. We were also able to increase our viewing share over the previous quarter and the positive trends in share, ratings and pricing have carried over into the current quarter. \n Last week, I visited our bureau in Jerusalem. Met with our talented and dedicated staff there and saw firsthand the devastation wrought by Hamas on October 7. Our hearts, our thoughts and our prayers go out to the victims of that day, the innocents killed in Israel and in Gaza and the hostages still denied the embrace of their families and loved ones. The work our correspondents, our camera people and our producers do, reporting on these events is important, outstanding and deeply appreciated. \n Now on to sports. In calendar 2023, 96 of the year's 100 most watch telecasts were live sports. FOX was responsible for 29 of the year's 100 most watched shows, more than any other network. This marks the fifth straight year that FOX has topped the industry in live sports viewing and demonstrates the unparalleled reach and engagement our content achieves. The 30th NFL regular season on FOX concluded with an average of 19 million viewers across all games with America's Game of the Week averaging 25 million viewers, an 8-year high. And FOX NFL Sunday logged its 30th straight year as the #1 NFL Pregame Show. That strength continued into the post season with FOX's 3 post-season windows, delivering a best ever playoff average of almost 45 million viewers across the wildcard, divisional and championship games. \n In Digital, we saw a strong engagement at Tubi, which finished with a very impressive 62% growth in total view time and 17% growth in revenue. Tubi's library of over 240,000 movies and TV episodes, coupled with ubiquitous distribution drove engagement, helping Tubi reach 78 million monthly active users, logged almost 2.5 billion streaming hours in the quarter and set a new monthly record of 855 million total viewing hours in December alone. Tubi has consolidated its position in the streaming landscape ranking as the most watched free TV and movie streaming service in the United States according to Nielsen and surpassing Peacock, Max, Paramount+ and Pluto TV in view time for 7 consecutive months. \n At FOX Entertainment, the second quarter saw programming strength with FOX having the season's #1 new broadcast entertainment series in Krapopolis. Hats off to Dan Harmon, the #1 new game show debut in Snake Oil and the #1 cooking series in Hell's Kitchen. We're also pleased with the very strong start of our mid-season lineup and the early success of We Are Family and The Floor. \n Before I hand over to Steve, I'll comment on the sports platform we announced last night between FOX, Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery. This new and unique digital distribution platform is focused on sports fans outside of existing pay TV offerings. Upon launch in the fall of 2024, the platform will offer a broad suite of sports, including those from a combined 14 linear networks that broadcast sports today. The inclusion of our networks in the platform is consistent with our strategy, being proudly consumer-first and distribution agnostic. \n Across the distribution ecosystem, our traditional pay-TV market will remain our dominant customer base for some time to come. As such, we remain committed to our existing distribution partners, where our strong portfolio of leadership sports, news and entertainment brands thrive in their bundled offerings. This unique new platform opens up a new market for us. One that we at FOX have not accessed before, and they were excited to participate in. As always, we are focused on delivering value for our shareholders in a thoughtful and disciplined manner and we will continue to explore every opportunity to maximize that value over the long term. Let me now turn it over to Steve for his comments on the quarter's financial results. \nSteven Tomsic: Thanks, Lachlan, and good morning, everyone. With the vast majority of our fiscal 2024 affiliate renewals now successfully completed, FOX delivered 4% growth in total company affiliate fee revenues, led by 10% growth at Television and a return to growth at Cable. This growth reflects the must-have nature of our content and the value that our distribution partners place on it. \n Consistent with our expectations regarding event cycles, advertising revenues this quarter were impacted by the absence of the FIFA Men's World Cup at FOX Sports and midterm political revenues at the local television stations, along with lower advertising revenue at FOX News Media. Collectively, these factors contributed to a 20% decline in total company advertising revenues. Total company other revenues grew by 14%, driven by higher sports sublicensing revenues. All in, FOX reported total company revenues of $4.23 billion, down 8% from the prior year. \n Total company expenses decreased 5% over the prior year primarily due to the absence of the Men's World Cup at FOX Sports and fewer hours of original scripted programming of FOX Entertainment due to the strike. However, this was partially offset by the first year step-up under our new NFL rights agreement. \n Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $350 million as compared to the $531 million reported in the prior year quarter. Net income attributable to stockholders of $109 million or $0.23 per share compared to the $313 million or $0.58 per share reported in the prior year period, largely due to the EBITDA impact I just mentioned, along with the net changes in the fair value of the company's investments recognized in other net. \n Our effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 12%, reflecting a one-off remeasurement of our deferred tax assets as a result of changes in state tax laws. Excluding this impact and other noncore items, adjusted EPS was $0.34 per share versus last year's $0.48. \n Turning to our segments. Starting with Cable, which reported 2% growth in total quarterly revenues. Cable affiliate fee revenues increased by $5 million, with growth in pricing from our distribution renewals, outpacing the impact from industry subscriber declines running at approximately 8%. Cable other revenues increased $124 million, largely driven by higher sports sublicensing revenues associated with our college sports and international soccer agreements. This growth in affiliate and other revenues was partially offset by a 23% decline in cable advertising revenues. \n At FOX News Media, advertising revenues were impacted by softer direct response marketplace, low comparative ratings and higher levels of preemptions due to our breaking news coverage of global events. Meanwhile, at the national sports networks, we measured against last year's broadcast of the Men's World Cup. Expenses at the Cable segment were 14% lower than the prior year, with savings mainly gained from the absence of the Men's World Cup as well as lower legal programming and production costs at FOX News Media. Taking all these factors into account quarterly adjusted EBITDA at the Cable segment grew 60% over the prior year quarter. \n Moving to our Television segment, which reported total quarterly revenues of $2.54 billion, down 13% from the prior year. The TV segment reported strong 10% growth in affiliate fee revenues as price increases across all FOX-affiliated stations more than offset the impact from industry subscriber declines. TV advertising revenues were down 19%. The solid growth at Tubi was more than offset by comparisons with last year's cycle of major events, including the FIFA Men's World Cup and midterm political revenues as well as the relative mix of World Series matchups and game counts. \n Also at TV, revenue from our entertainment production companies was impacted by the SAG and WGA labor disputes. This contributed to a $64 million decline in TV other revenues, most of which was offset by a commensurate reduction in expenses. Overall, expenses at the TV segment remained flat as higher costs under the NFL agreement and a modest increase in investment in Tubi were offset by lower costs from the absence of the Men's World Cup, lower college sports rights costs and fewer hours of original scripted content due to the strikes. Together, these revenue and expense impacts led to a quarterly adjusted EBITDA loss of $138 million of our TV segment compared to an EBITDA contribution of $256 million reported in the prior year quarter. \n Turning to free cash flow, where we recorded a deficit of $615 million this quarter. This is consistent with the normal seasonality of our working capital cycle where the first half of our fiscal year reflects the concentration of payments for sports rights and the buildup of advertising-related receivables. In terms of capital allocation, fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased an additional $550 million through our share buyback program, bringing the total cumulative amount repurchased to $5.15 billion or 25% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the program in 2019. \n In addition, today, we announced a $0.26 per share semiannual dividend. These capital return measures are supported by our robust balance sheet, where we ended the quarter with $4.1 billion in cash and $8.4 billion in debt. These balances are before taking into account the repayment of one of our $1.25 billion note in late January. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Gabi to open up the Q&A. \nGabrielle Brown: Thank you, Steve. And now we will be happy to take questions from the investment community. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We have a question from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. \nBenjamin Swinburne: Lachlan, obviously, big news in the new sports joint ventures. I'd love to get your thoughts really around that product and opportunity in kind of 2 areas. First is what is the opportunity that you guys see in the United States for a product like that? Obviously, we're all focused on the cord-cutter sort of TAM, but how many people do you think are interested in a product like this?\n And then do you see any risk to particularly FOX News? This is the first time you guys have offered a product with just FOX Broadcast? How do you balance that when you thought about putting this business together? \nLachlan Murdoch: Thank you very much, Ben, and good morning. So the opportunity is huge, and that's really because this sports-focused platform is focused entirely on cord -- not cord-cutters but cord-nevers. So if you look at the American market, is roughly, say, 125 million households in America and roughly half of those are not within the traditional bundled cable ecosystem. And so the target for this product, which is going to be I think, incredibly innovative when you see it roll out is really that universe of, call it, 60 million-odd households that currently don't participate in the bundled cable and pay television ecosystem. So we think it's a tremendous opportunity.\n We've been working on it for -- I think it's been reported this [ Swin ] fairly accurately for several months now. I've been lucky enough to have seen some of the prototypes for this service. And again, it will be unique and I think very innovative when you see it roll out.\n In terms of the risks and particularly for FOX News, I think the risks are very low, and that's because of the focus of the sports product being on the cord-nevers. FOX News continues to be top rating cable network and our distributors, our partners really value that channel and that brand as it really drives tremendous viewership and audience and engagement for them, we think we'll continue to do so within the traditional cable and pay television bundle. \nOperator: We go to Robert Fishman with MoffettNathanson. \nRobert Fishman: Sticking with the sports news. So we've long discussed with you the benefits of FOX to a sports-led skinny bundles. So I'm just wondering, any additional background you can share on what pushed this deal forward now, including maybe any flexibility you built into your recent affiliate fee renewals? And then on a related note, should we expect to see any changes in your approach to negotiate future sports rights? And any comments you want to share about the Netflix-WWE deal that might impact these negotiations going forward? \nLachlan Murdoch: Well, let me start back to front, Robert. So there's no impact on the Netflix-WWE deal at all. So I don't think that plays a factor in this and a fact in how we approach our portfolio of sports rights. We will be aggressively competing in the sports market for sports rights, but nothing has changed there. The primary business and value in FOX Sports is competing both for every subscriber in the traditional cable pay-TV bundle and advertiser, viewer and ultimately, advertisers.\n So sports remains a competitive business which we -- frankly, we thrive in, and we don't see any difference to that. What led to this now, I think we've answered many questions on these quarterly calls over many years about when we are ready to launch a streaming service such as this, and we will do it. And we've been monitoring the space, obviously, for years, past few years, in particular. And as we developed with our partners the concept around a very unique and innovative product, we felt now was the right time to launch such a product.\n Really into a new market, right? It's a new market where there's no product serving the sports fans that are not within the cable and TV bundle. So it accesses -- for us, it accesses a whole new market and really drives a tremendous amount of new reach that we weren't servicing before. \nOperator: Next is John Hodulik with UBS. \nJohn Hodulik: First, just quickly on the sports JV. Just any cash contribution? Or can you size any kind of contribution required for -- from FOX? And then turning to advertising. Obviously, a number of things affecting the numbers this quarter. You guys had some positive color as we look into next quarter.\n Just any color, one I'd say on the TV side, what you're seeing at this point in terms of political? And then with the improvement in the ratings and the year-over-year, the gap that you're seeing closing, can we assume that the 22% on the cable ad side is sort of the worst number? And any color on the sort of slope of the improvement that we should see as we head through the year. \nLachlan Murdoch: I've lost track. Okay. So ad contribution advertising and cable -- cable advertising. After this, we won't need any more questions. I'll cover the whole gamut. Thanks, John. On the cash side, I'll let Steve fill in. But it's -- obviously, this business has both the -- there's marketing and other costs associated with running the business in the partnership, but it's also the revenue that we garner through affiliate fees for our networks. That come out as the business grows. But I'll let Steve fill in on the detail. \nSteven Tomsic: Yes, John, I think it's a touch early for us to be giving some forecasts around sort of the contribution of deficit from the JV. But sort of as we look at it, it will be accretive to us from a net-net perspective when you take into account the affiliate fees that we will collect as revenue versus whatever funding we need to make to the JV, we think, from a net-net to FOX perspective, it will be accretive pretty quickly. \nLachlan Murdoch: And then on advertising, I think the advertising outlook is, as I mentioned, with news, but you could apply this term to the overall market as sort of nuanced as we look at it. If I start with sports, we had a very solid regular NFL season from an advertising perspective. And I think of a stronger NFL post-season, which we were very pleased by. But also that was a -- it's a smaller revenue line, but we had a fantastic College Football season, really -- I think the story of this past autumn was really the strength of College Football and particularly as advertisers, sort of a founded and appreciated the quality of the audience watching College Football.\n Coming up, if we look forward, obviously, we have the DAYTONA 500 and then the start of the regular Major League Baseball season in March and there's a lot of positive momentum with advertisers with those. FOX News, you have a positive trend with DR pricing. Direct response pricing is still down. But as you start to lap the comparisons from last year, it's certainly improving quite a lot. We have an impact from preemptions with election and unfortunately, with our war coverage, so the preemptions are affecting. And ratings are continuing to improve. So we're happy with where we are at FOX News as all those trends are improving steadily.\n Local stations is probably the most mixed, but you have a bad comparison, particularly in the current pacings with Super Bowl comps this time last year. It's probably about $50 million in Super Bowl revenue just in the station group this time last year. So the comparisons are quite tough as we go forward. But we remain confident that we'll see a record political cycle. This is slightly ameliorated. I think, in the current quarter with the lack of sort of competitive primary competition.\n But we're already seeing business in the first half of next year start to flow in from a political perspective. And it's obviously -- it's sort of national because our stations, we have a large number of stations in our key political markets like Georgia and Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona and Wisconsin. So we're very confident in a very strong political cycle once that really starts to flow.\n And then finally, with Tubi. TubiTV has continued to grow, I think, at 63% and obviously, with the TubiTV growth, the revenue is following. The revenue growth is slightly less or somewhat less than it was last year. But in the sort of streaming environment, we're very happy with its growth. So that's -- on advertising scatter pricing is all above upfront pricing. So that's positive.\n And then finally, on the cable affiliate subscribers and fees. We are in an environment where -- I think we called out it's roughly 8% cable erosion and yet our cable affiliate fees have grown in this quarter. So I think that really shows the strength of our brands and our programming in the cable universe. So we're very pleased with that. \nOperator: It is from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America Securities. \nJessica Reif Cohen: Back to the sports platform. Lachlan, you seem really confident that it won't affect the pay-TV bundle, which is -- I just wanted to get some color on that given that sports has been really the glue that's kept it together. So why do you feel so confident that it will not impact that? And then -- what is the openness to ad partners? And will they have a separate advertising organization? How will the ads work in your content? \nLachlan Murdoch: Jessica, so the -- first on how it affects the overall pay TV bundle. Again, the key market, the market that we will be driving towards is the market that sits outside the sports fan, who sits currently outside of the traditional pay TV bundle today, and there's tens of millions of them. So we are very confident that this is a large market and a large opportunity that we can address without undermining the traditional bundle.\n We -- obviously, we've been working on this for several months. We've done lots of sensitivity analysis, and we would not be launching this product if we thought it was going to significantly effect our pay-TV affiliate partners, and that's very important to us. We remain, I think the biggest supporters of the traditional pay-TV bundle. We think there's tremendous value in the pay-TV bundle for the consumer who wants to get it all at an affordable price. The big bundle is still the best way to get that programming on those brands.\n So we are confident that this product will be additive and will give us incremental subscribers and not affect significantly the traditional bundle. And the openness to ad partners, that's not something that we're considering at this stage. We think that the 14 linear networks that this service offers gives people a tremendous amount of content between ABC affiliates, FOX affiliates, ESPN, ESPN2, ESPN News, the SEC network, FOX affiliates, FOX Sports 1 and 2, the Big 10 Network, TNT, TBS and others. It's a tremendous offering that covers the majority of the key sports in this country, NFL, NBA, WNBA, Major League Baseball, NHL, et cetera, college, obviously, NASCAR and so on.\n So we think it's an incredibly strong offering and at this stage, we're not contemplating adding partners to it. I think the third question, Jes, was on advertising revenues. And so advertising revenues will flow through this. So the advertising that we have on our linear networks will flow into this service and will just give us increased reach to a market that hasn't seen those -- that advertisers engage with those clients before. So we think it's a net positive. \nGabrielle Brown: Operator, we have time for one more question. \nOperator: Very good. That will come from Michael Morris with Guggenheim. \nMichael Morris: So I wanted to ask about 2 areas of strength in the quarter. The first one on the sports sublicensing. Can you share a little more detail on what that was, how it impacted profitability and how to think about whether or not that's a recurring revenue and profit source? And then my second question is on the affiliate acceleration, which is great to see. We know that the rate of cord-cutting is going to be impactful on that number. It's very hard to predict. But on pricing alone and the precedent that you just said, should we look at this as the first quarter of a sustained stronger pricing dynamic? And how long do you think we should anticipate that you can continue to see this type of growth being fueled by those new contractual relationships? \nLachlan Murdoch: I thought it was unfair that Steve will get the easy question and -- then you asked the second question. So anyway, I'll let Steve address the sports sublicensing first. \nSteven Tomsic: Mike. So our sports sublicensing revenue we have in the Cable segment. So we own sports sublicensing income in relation to various sort of college sports properties and international soccer rights. Some of these rights come with some variable based economics to them, which we saw in the quarter. I think you should see this as somewhat of a one-off. It's not going to repeat like this going in future quarters, future years. And if you want to try and dimensionalize it then the size of the increase in Cable Other revenues between this quarter and previous quarter last year is a pretty good guide to the net benefit to us from those sublicensing arrangements. \nLachlan Murdoch: So on the affiliate revenue acceleration, I think the -- if you look at them two -- and can we currently sustain that. We've now completed all of our distributions of renewals in this cycle that will affect the remainder of this fiscal year. So there's no more renewals negotiated that will effect this fiscal year. And obviously, we're rolling into renewals that will are -- that will take effect after this fiscal. If you look at the underlying rate of decline around 8%, and this goes back to a little bit of John's question.\n If we look at that 8%, actually in September and October, it was better than 8%. It was a little bit better. And then -- and this, we believe, was the impact of football and sports viewing in the fall. But then after October sort of as you get into November and December, the rate returned -- decline return to the sort of baseline at 8%. So for the immediate future, we don't see that changing. There's some cyclicality within that. But I think the 8% is a number that we're sort of baking into our assumptions.\n With that, we believe, as we've achieved in the -- over the last year, where we renewed over 1/3 of our distribution. We've been able to achieve rate increases that have made up for those declines. And that is because of the strength of our brands, the strength of our programming and really where they sit, having sort of focused strategy on a key number of very core brands that are essential for the -- for distributors and for their customers, that we'll be able to maintain similar rates of change going forward. \nGabrielle Brown: At this point, we are out of time. But if you have any further questions, please give me or Dan Carey a call. Thank you again for joining today's call. \nSteven Tomsic: Thank you. \nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks, everyone. Have a good day. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Steven Tomsic",
            "content": "Thanks, Lachlan, and good morning, everyone. With the vast majority of our fiscal 2024 affiliate renewals now successfully completed, FOX delivered 4% growth in total company affiliate fee revenues, led by 10% growth at Television and a return to growth at Cable. This growth reflects the must-have nature of our content and the value that our distribution partners place on it. \n Consistent with our expectations regarding event cycles, advertising revenues this quarter were impacted by the absence of the FIFA Men's World Cup at FOX Sports and midterm political revenues at the local television stations, along with lower advertising revenue at FOX News Media. Collectively, these factors contributed to a 20% decline in total company advertising revenues. Total company other revenues grew by 14%, driven by higher sports sublicensing revenues. All in, FOX reported total company revenues of $4.23 billion, down 8% from the prior year. \n Total company expenses decreased 5% over the prior year primarily due to the absence of the Men's World Cup at FOX Sports and fewer hours of original scripted programming of FOX Entertainment due to the strike. However, this was partially offset by the first year step-up under our new NFL rights agreement. \n Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $350 million as compared to the $531 million reported in the prior year quarter. Net income attributable to stockholders of $109 million or $0.23 per share compared to the $313 million or $0.58 per share reported in the prior year period, largely due to the EBITDA impact I just mentioned, along with the net changes in the fair value of the company's investments recognized in other net. \n Our effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 12%, reflecting a one-off remeasurement of our deferred tax assets as a result of changes in state tax laws. Excluding this impact and other noncore items, adjusted EPS was $0.34 per share versus last year's $0.48. \n Turning to our segments. Starting with Cable, which reported 2% growth in total quarterly revenues. Cable affiliate fee revenues increased by $5 million, with growth in pricing from our distribution renewals, outpacing the impact from industry subscriber declines running at approximately 8%. Cable other revenues increased $124 million, largely driven by higher sports sublicensing revenues associated with our college sports and international soccer agreements. This growth in affiliate and other revenues was partially offset by a 23% decline in cable advertising revenues. \n At FOX News Media, advertising revenues were impacted by softer direct response marketplace, low comparative ratings and higher levels of preemptions due to our breaking news coverage of global events. Meanwhile, at the national sports networks, we measured against last year's broadcast of the Men's World Cup. Expenses at the Cable segment were 14% lower than the prior year, with savings mainly gained from the absence of the Men's World Cup as well as lower legal programming and production costs at FOX News Media. Taking all these factors into account quarterly adjusted EBITDA at the Cable segment grew 60% over the prior year quarter. \n Moving to our Television segment, which reported total quarterly revenues of $2.54 billion, down 13% from the prior year. The TV segment reported strong 10% growth in affiliate fee revenues as price increases across all FOX-affiliated stations more than offset the impact from industry subscriber declines. TV advertising revenues were down 19%. The solid growth at Tubi was more than offset by comparisons with last year's cycle of major events, including the FIFA Men's World Cup and midterm political revenues as well as the relative mix of World Series matchups and game counts. \n Also at TV, revenue from our entertainment production companies was impacted by the SAG and WGA labor disputes. This contributed to a $64 million decline in TV other revenues, most of which was offset by a commensurate reduction in expenses. Overall, expenses at the TV segment remained flat as higher costs under the NFL agreement and a modest increase in investment in Tubi were offset by lower costs from the absence of the Men's World Cup, lower college sports rights costs and fewer hours of original scripted content due to the strikes. Together, these revenue and expense impacts led to a quarterly adjusted EBITDA loss of $138 million of our TV segment compared to an EBITDA contribution of $256 million reported in the prior year quarter. \n Turning to free cash flow, where we recorded a deficit of $615 million this quarter. This is consistent with the normal seasonality of our working capital cycle where the first half of our fiscal year reflects the concentration of payments for sports rights and the buildup of advertising-related receivables. In terms of capital allocation, fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased an additional $550 million through our share buyback program, bringing the total cumulative amount repurchased to $5.15 billion or 25% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the program in 2019. \n In addition, today, we announced a $0.26 per share semiannual dividend. These capital return measures are supported by our robust balance sheet, where we ended the quarter with $4.1 billion in cash and $8.4 billion in debt. These balances are before taking into account the repayment of one of our $1.25 billion note in late January. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Gabi to open up the Q&A. Yes, John, I think it's a touch early for us to be giving some forecasts around sort of the contribution of deficit from the JV. But sort of as we look at it, it will be accretive to us from a net-net perspective when you take into account the affiliate fees that we will collect as revenue versus whatever funding we need to make to the JV, we think, from a net-net to FOX perspective, it will be accretive pretty quickly. Mike. So our sports sublicensing revenue we have in the Cable segment. So we own sports sublicensing income in relation to various sort of college sports properties and international soccer rights. Some of these rights come with some variable based economics to them, which we saw in the quarter. I think you should see this as somewhat of a one-off. It's not going to repeat like this going in future quarters, future years. And if you want to try and dimensionalize it then the size of the increase in Cable Other revenues between this quarter and previous quarter last year is a pretty good guide to the net benefit to us from those sublicensing arrangements. Thank you."

            "name": "Lachlan Murdoch",
            "content": "Thank you, Gabby, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Against the backdrop of an active news cycle and another robust fall sports schedule, our fiscal second quarter, again illustrated the strength of FOX. The growth we delivered in affiliate fee revenues was the standout this quarter, with the Television segment growing by 10% and the Cable segment returning to growth, once again demonstrating the power of our brands and our programming.\n We've now largely completed our fiscal '24 affiliate renewal cycle, having achieved our commercial goals without disruption and setting a solid foundation for renewals in fiscal 2025 and beyond. As expected, advertising revenues in the quarter were down primarily due to comparisons to last year's major cyclical events, including the midterm elections at the TV stations and the broadcast of the Men's World Cup in the Cable and Television segments. \n Parsing through the cyclical comparisons, our concentration in news and sports, coupled with the outstanding performance of Tubi is clearly an advantage in a mixed advertising environment. More specifically, sports advertising was very healthy during the quarter, and we saw particularly strong demand for the NFL and College Football which continued into the NFL playoffs. \n At news, the second quarter was more nuanced. While preemptions and the direct response market adversely impacted quarterly growth, we sequentially narrowed the gap between the current and prior year in ratings and in pricing. We were also able to increase our viewing share over the previous quarter and the positive trends in share, ratings and pricing have carried over into the current quarter. \n Last week, I visited our bureau in Jerusalem. Met with our talented and dedicated staff there and saw firsthand the devastation wrought by Hamas on October 7. Our hearts, our thoughts and our prayers go out to the victims of that day, the innocents killed in Israel and in Gaza and the hostages still denied the embrace of their families and loved ones. The work our correspondents, our camera people and our producers do, reporting on these events is important, outstanding and deeply appreciated. \n Now on to sports. In calendar 2023, 96 of the year's 100 most watch telecasts were live sports. FOX was responsible for 29 of the year's 100 most watched shows, more than any other network. This marks the fifth straight year that FOX has topped the industry in live sports viewing and demonstrates the unparalleled reach and engagement our content achieves. The 30th NFL regular season on FOX concluded with an average of 19 million viewers across all games with America's Game of the Week averaging 25 million viewers, an 8-year high. And FOX NFL Sunday logged its 30th straight year as the #1 NFL Pregame Show. That strength continued into the post season with FOX's 3 post-season windows, delivering a best ever playoff average of almost 45 million viewers across the wildcard, divisional and championship games. \n In Digital, we saw a strong engagement at Tubi, which finished with a very impressive 62% growth in total view time and 17% growth in revenue. Tubi's library of over 240,000 movies and TV episodes, coupled with ubiquitous distribution drove engagement, helping Tubi reach 78 million monthly active users, logged almost 2.5 billion streaming hours in the quarter and set a new monthly record of 855 million total viewing hours in December alone. Tubi has consolidated its position in the streaming landscape ranking as the most watched free TV and movie streaming service in the United States according to Nielsen and surpassing Peacock, Max, Paramount+ and Pluto TV in view time for 7 consecutive months. \n At FOX Entertainment, the second quarter saw programming strength with FOX having the season's #1 new broadcast entertainment series in Krapopolis. Hats off to Dan Harmon, the #1 new game show debut in Snake Oil and the #1 cooking series in Hell's Kitchen. We're also pleased with the very strong start of our mid-season lineup and the early success of We Are Family and The Floor. \n Before I hand over to Steve, I'll comment on the sports platform we announced last night between FOX, Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery. This new and unique digital distribution platform is focused on sports fans outside of existing pay TV offerings. Upon launch in the fall of 2024, the platform will offer a broad suite of sports, including those from a combined 14 linear networks that broadcast sports today. The inclusion of our networks in the platform is consistent with our strategy, being proudly consumer-first and distribution agnostic. \n Across the distribution ecosystem, our traditional pay-TV market will remain our dominant customer base for some time to come. As such, we remain committed to our existing distribution partners, where our strong portfolio of leadership sports, news and entertainment brands thrive in their bundled offerings. This unique new platform opens up a new market for us. One that we at FOX have not accessed before, and they were excited to participate in. As always, we are focused on delivering value for our shareholders in a thoughtful and disciplined manner and we will continue to explore every opportunity to maximize that value over the long term. Let me now turn it over to Steve for his comments on the quarter's financial results. Thank you very much, Ben, and good morning. So the opportunity is huge, and that's really because this sports-focused platform is focused entirely on cord -- not cord-cutters but cord-nevers. So if you look at the American market, is roughly, say, 125 million households in America and roughly half of those are not within the traditional bundled cable ecosystem. And so the target for this product, which is going to be I think, incredibly innovative when you see it roll out is really that universe of, call it, 60 million-odd households that currently don't participate in the bundled cable and pay television ecosystem. So we think it's a tremendous opportunity.\n We've been working on it for -- I think it's been reported this [ Swin ] fairly accurately for several months now. I've been lucky enough to have seen some of the prototypes for this service. And again, it will be unique and I think very innovative when you see it roll out.\n In terms of the risks and particularly for FOX News, I think the risks are very low, and that's because of the focus of the sports product being on the cord-nevers.

So we think it's a net positive. I thought it was unfair that Steve will get the easy question and -- then you asked the second question. So anyway, I'll let Steve address the sports sublicensing first. So on the affiliate revenue acceleration, I think the -- if you look at them two -- and can we currently sustain that. We've now completed all of our distributions of renewals in this cycle that will affect the remainder of this fiscal year. So there's no more renewals negotiated that will effect this fiscal year. And obviously, we're rolling into renewals that will are -- that will take effect after this fiscal. If you look at the underlying rate of decline around 8%, and this goes back to a little bit of John's question.\n If we look at that 8%, actually in September and October, it was better than 8%. It was a little bit better. And then -- and this, we believe, was the impact of football and sports viewing in the fall. But then after October sort of as you get into November and December, the rate returned -- decline return to the sort of baseline at 8%. So for the immediate future, we don't see that changing. There's some cyclicality within that. But I think the 8% is a number that we're sort of baking into our assumptions.\n With that, we believe, as we've achieved in the -- over the last year, where we renewed over 1/3 of our distribution. We've been able to achieve rate increases that have made up for those declines. And that is because of the strength of our brands, the strength of our programming and really where they sit, having sort of focused strategy on a key number of very core brands that are essential for the -- for distributors and for their customers, that we'll be able to maintain similar rates of change going forward. Thanks, everyone. Have a good day."

[Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the conference over to Chief Investor Relations Officer, Ms. Gabriele Brown. Please go ahead, Ms. Brown. \nGabrielle Brown: Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our fiscal 2024 first quarter earnings call. Joining me on the call today are Lachlan Murdoch, Executive Chair and Chief Executive Officer; John Nallen, Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Tomsic, our Chief Financial Officer. First, Lachlan and Steve will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter, and then we'll take questions from the investment community. \n Please note that this call may include forward-looking statements regarding Fox Corporation's financial performance and operating results. These statements are based on management's current expectations and actual results could differ from what is stated as a result of certain factors identified on today's call and in the company's SEC filings. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA or EBITDA, as we refer to it on this call. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and our SEC filings, which are available in the Investor Relations section of our website.  \n And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Lachlan. \nLachlan Murdoch: Thank you, Gabby, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. I just want to start with a comment and a note of thanks. We are living through tumultuous times. And at the outset, I want to acknowledge the work our journalists are doing covering the horrific October 7 terrorist attack and the subsequent ongoing war in the Middle East. \n From the reporting of Trey Yingst, Greg Palkot, Mike Tobin and Lucas Tomlinson in Israel; and Steve Harrigan in [indiscernible] to the deep analysis and insightful commentary by our reporters and hosts, including John Roberts and Trace Gallagher, to the essential and brave work of our on-the-ground producers and camera crews, Fox's fulfilling its mission defined, report and analyze the news of the day without fear or favor.  \n News reporting is hard and word reporting is perhaps the hardest. And while the horror Central to this new cycle and were heavily on those we ask to expose them, their exposure is necessary. And so our team deserves our admiration and our gratitude as they continue to work tirelessly and under demanding conditions to keep us up to date on events far away and on their impact closer to home. My sincere thanks to them all. \n Now turning to today's first quarter earnings release. Against a backdrop of an active news cycle and a robust sports schedule, fiscal 2024 has started off on a solid operational and financial footing. Fox's focused portfolio of assets continues to distinguish itself and deliver exceptional results. Financially, we are now comparing against the fiscal '23 cycle of events that delivered then record revenues and EBITDA. Despite this comparison, we posted total revenues this year slightly ahead of last year's record. \n On the affiliate side, we reported 2% total affiliate growth, led by 8% growth of the TV segment in the quarter. Importantly, we have continued to secure constructive renewals, which deliver for our partners and reinforce the value of our brands and program. Advertising revenues in the quarter decreased by around 2%, principally due to a comparative quarter last year that was much heavier in political ad revenues at our local TV stations. \n We understand there is inconsistency around the broader advertising market, particularly in entertainment, but our focus on live sports and news continues to deliver with healthy national pricing and demand in addition to continued momentum at Tubi. Underpinning revenue are our core brands, which consistently resonate with viewers and the consumption data clearly shows this. With total viewing of FOX brands up 2% in the quarter. \n FOX Sports was a big driver of that consumption, especially with its broadcast of the Women's World Cup, where the U.S. versus the Netherlands on FOX was the most watched Women's World Cup game match ever on U.S. English language television. From summer to fall, our lineup is bolstered by our football packages led by the NFL on FOX, we are averaging over 17 million viewers Tubi gained. Based on the strength of our remaining schedule, especially from Thanksgiving to Christmas, we expect that engagement to improve significantly. \n In College Football, interest is reaching new highs Fox's big new Saturday is progressing to a third straight year as the #1 game window in all of college footfall, averaging almost 6 million viewers. At Tubi, we had another enviable quarter, delivering 30% revenue growth driven by an impressive 65% lift in total view time. \n Tubi surpassed 70 million monthly active users in September, logged nearly 4 billion streaming hours in the first half of the calendar year and remains the #1 AVOD player and most watched free ad-supported TV streaming service in the United States. Additionally, Tubi has beaten Pluto, Max, Paramount Plus and Peacock and Bouton for 5 consecutive months. One reason for the high engagement level that Tubi is its extensive content library that now exceeds 60,000 titles, which translates into more than 225,000 movies and TV episodes in addition to approximately 300 fast channels. And during the quarter, Tubi introduced Rabbit AI a Chat GPT 4 powered recommendation engine to help users navigate this incredible range of titles. \n Tubi also offers a unique and compelling proposition to advertisers. Our recent MRI study of streaming peers concluded that Tubi saw the fastest growth amongst young and diverse populations. And that Tubi is able to deliver high-value net new audiences with 33% of Tubi streamers unreachable on other top AVOD services. \n Now turning back to Fox News, the strength of our overall news coverage and the reach of our linear audio and digital content is unmatched. Whether it is the conflict in the Middle East, the upcoming 2024 election cycle or volatility in the financial markets, FOX News is increasingly their viewers first choice. The launch of our new expanded Primetime lineup in mid-July further solidified Fox News' leadership position, not only in cable news, but in all of cable, finishing the quarter as the most watched cable network in both total day and Primetime. \n FOX News maintained its lead as the most watched cable news network, beating CNN and MSNBC in and total viewers and in the demo for both prime and total day. We have seen that they continue and expand in the current quarter, with October viewership increasing over 20% from the first quarter with over 30% growth in the key demo. Ratings leadership during the quarter was achieved across the platform. \n The Fox News channel had the top 6 cable news programs with P2+ And the top 7 programs within the demo. In P2+,  the 5 led the way in terms of viewers, followed by Jesse Watters Primetime and Hannity, of the 5 Gutfeld. Hannity and Jesse Watters Primetime were a top 4 programs in the demo. And Fox Business News ended the quarter as the most watched business cable network, beating CNBC in total viewers during the business day for the sixth consecutive quarter. \n The election cycle started off with the successful Republican presidential primary debate, which is Fox News channel's highest-rated telecasts, since election day 2020 and the highest-rated non-sports telecast of the year across cable. While the debate kicked off the election cycle, once we get deeper into it, our local station group will benefit greatly from increased political spend in the coming quarters.  \n Over at FOX Entertainment, we started the 2023 to 2024 broadcast season as the #1 network in the key adult 18 to 49 demo, and Fox ranks as the top network and entertainment program. First in at least 10 years. FOX has 3 of the top 4 highest-rated premieres of the 2023/'24 season to date in Krapopolis, the Simpson and The Masked Singer.  And the season's #1 new game show with Snake Oil. Across the company, fiscal '24 is shaping up nicely. We look forward to a great enthusiasm across the fall sports season, underpinned by the NFL college football and now the completed World Series, continued viewing growth at Tubi and renewed momentum at Fox News and our local stations as the election cycle heats up.  \n Our balance sheet remains a core asset for FOX and we will continue to deploy it in a disciplined and thoughtful manner that delivers value for our shareholders. Finally, I would like to congratulate my father on a 70-year career at News Corp and Fox. His enduring legacy can be felt in both of these companies. And I can assure you that he is still very much involved and will continue to be for years to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Steve to take you through the operating details of the quarter. \nSteven Tomsic: Thanks, Lachlan, and good morning, everyone. FOX reported total first quarter company revenues of $3.21 billion, which is slightly above the prior year quarter. This was led by a 2% increase in affiliate fee revenues as the pricing gains from recent distribution renewals more than offset the impact from industry subscriber declines. From an advertising perspective, we, of course, faced the tough comparison to last year's record midterm political revenues at our local stations. \n This, coupled with continued softness in the direct response marketplace at FOX News more than offset the benefits we saw from the broadcast of the FIFA Women's World Cup, the 30% revenue growth generated at Tubi and continued support of national pricing for live content.  \n Taking as a whole, our advertising revenues declined 2%. Meanwhile, total company other revenues increased 2% or $6 million. Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $869 million as compared to the $1.09 billion reported in the prior year quarter. Expenses increased this quarter driven by higher rights amortization and production costs associated with the Women's World Cup, the first year step-up from our NFL rights renewal and increased expenses at our digital businesses.  \n Net income attributable to stockholders of $407 million or $0.82 per share compared to the $605 million or $1.10 per share reported in the prior year period. This move largely reflects the EBITDA impact I just mentioned, along with the change in fair value of the company's investment in Flat recognized in other net. Excluding this impact and other non-core items, adjusted EPS was $1.09 versus last year's $1.21.  \n Turning to our operating segment results, starting with television, where we delivered total quarterly revenues of $1.78 billion or a 4% increase year-over-year. This was driven by an 8% increase in TV affiliate revenues with healthy growth in fees across all FOX-affiliated stations more than offset the impact from industry subscriber declines. Advertising revenues at our TV segment grew 1%, led by the benefits from the broadcast of the Women's World Cup, continued growth at Tubi and the timing of college football broadcast, partially offset by the absence of last year's midterm political revenues and lower ratings of the FOX network. \n Television Other revenues increased 6% in the quarter, primarily a result of the timing of participations tied to our entertainment production initiatives.  The growth in revenue at our television segment was more than offset by a 10% increase in expenses, including costs associated with the Women's World Cup, the first year step-up associated with the renewal of our NFL rights and continued investment at Tubi. Together, these revenue and expense impacts led to quarterly adjusted EBITDA of $351 million in our Television segment compared to the $409 million reported in the prior year quarter. Our Cable segment reported total quarterly revenues of $1.39 billion, a 3% decrease year-over-year.  \n Cable affiliate revenues were down 2% in the quarter, largely a result of industry subscriber declines, which continue to run in the 8% range. Cable advertising revenues were down 8% as a broadcast of the Women's World Cup and the Men's CONCACAF Gold Cup were more than offset by the continued impact of a softer direct response marketplace and lower ratings at FOX News Media. Notably though, we continue to see healthy national linear and digital demand from advertisers of Fox News Media. \n Cable other revenues increased by $6 million in the quarter due to the timing of sports sublicensing revenues. Meanwhile, expenses at our Cable segment increased 13%, led by higher programming rights amortization and production costs for the Women's World Cup and Gold Cup, the timing of college football broadcast at FOX Sports One and contractual rights increases across our sports portfolio.  \n All in all, this resulted in adjusted EBITDA at our Cable segment of $607 million compared to the $742 million reported in the prior year period. Turning to cash flow, where free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx, was negative $70 million in the quarter. This is consistent with the seasonality of our working capital cycle with the first half of our fiscal year is characterized by a concentration of payments for sports rights and the buildup of advertising-related receivables, both of which reversed in the second half of our fiscal year. \n From a capital deployment perspective, fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased a further $300 million through our share buyback program. We have now cumulatively repurchased 4.9 billion, representing approximately 24% of our total shares outstanding, since the launch of the buyback program in 2019, and we remain committed to utilizing our full buyback authorization of $7 billion. This is supported by the strength of our balance sheet, where we ended the quarter with approximately $3.8 billion in cash and $7.2 billion in debt.  \n This excludes the $1.25 billion of senior notes that we issued in early October. The proceeds from which we intend to use to pay down the corresponding maturity coming due in January 2024. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Gabby. \nGabrielle Brown: Thank you, Steve. And now we will be happy to take questions from the investment community. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] One moment for first question. And that will come from Robert Fishman from MoffettNathanson. \nRobert Fishman: After deciding on passing on the WWE renewal, can you share anything specific on how you evaluated the ROI of the deal in the context of driving higher advertising and affiliate fee revenue? And then maybe just more broadly, can you discuss, whether you expect to see any impact on future sports right negotiation, if the Disney, Charter renewal impacts the industry rate of cord cutting or affiliate fee growth going forward? \nLachlan Murdoch: Rob, there's a lot in there. So let me unpack it bit by bit and if I -- I hope I don't miss anything. So how we -- I think we've talked about this before, but how we analyze the WWE renewal,  and we look at all of our sports portfolio in the same way and on all new rights, opportunities are for new rights in the same way. We -- on the base of analyst -- analysis, sorry. We on both an advertising point of view, we were not hitting the advertising numbers, due to the audience of the WWE to make return for our return on investment to be above the levels that we would accept. But also we didn't attribute enough significant retransmission revenue to WWE either, so it made sense for us to move on from them. They've been a great partner for many years. \n But just quite simply, we're very disciplined and the RR didn't meet our pretty disciplined parameters. So we wish them luck and we've moved on from them. We're currently in, I think, the final status of a very constructive negotiation for our NASCAR renewal. We look forward to continuing that partnership with NASCAR. It's been a great partnership for many years. And obviously, NASCAR exceeds our expectations from an ROI point of view. In terms of Disney and Charter and how that affects our view going forward. I think it's a net positive for us. I think that we want our distributors to do well. We want them to continue to invest in high-quality programming, and high-quality brands. \n And obviously, between FOX News and Fox Sports, our station group and our network, we have a very focused, very valuable set of core brands, that distributors such as Charter value. So net-net, the Disney, Charter deal has been positive for us and positive for our strategy. \nOperator: The next question is from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. \nBenjamin Swinburne: My one question is on sort of unlocking value, although it does immediately have to spend 2 pieces that might be connected, I guess first -- it's a confession. I wanted to ask about sports and Tubi. So arguably, the popularity of sports, particularly football and even more particularly college football, has probably never been higher. I mean your college rights are probably more valuable today than ever. I'm just wondering if you guys have ideas on capitalizing and maximizing the return on those rights. Beyond the kind of stuff we always think about was advertising on the live rights and retrans fees. \n And then kind of related, maybe is leveraging Tubi, both in terms of sports, but also just broadly, like your stock doesn't have I think, probably objectively credit for what Tubi is worth, and it continues to grow. Are you guys thinking about ways to try to highlight that value more or scale it up maybe through for some strategic activity? And any thoughts on helping to unlock some value around an asset that's obviously doing quite well and probably it will be worth a lot more in the public company than what it is currently priced at inside of Fox. So I know that's a lot, but would love your thoughts. \nLachlan Murdoch: No that's fine. I think the best way I can answer both questions sort of with one answer, I suppose, which is the value -- you're 1,000% right, college football has never been more popular. It's rating extremely well. And 1 of the things we haven't talked about is, frankly, advertisers have found it. Advertisers are pouring in to call triple with tremendous rates and with tremendous appetite for volume because they can see the value in this audience. \n And perhaps it's been underpriced in past years, I'm not sure. But certainly, advertisers are recognizing the opportunity in college football and obviously, we're the leader. But ultimately, we build value through our brands and through the Fox Sports brand and Fox Sports and station distribution. And so we'll continue to build value through college football through the Fox Sports brand and monetizing it that way. The same thing with Tubi.\n First of all, we don't envisage any kind of significant live sports on Tubi in the near or frankly, median, perhaps even long-term future. But Tubi is very focused on primarily entertainment, and particularly in video-on-demand entertainment, which makes that content and then engagement with their users, all the more valuable.  \n And I think it will be a long time before we see significant live sports on Tubi. In terms of how we unlock the value in Tubi. Tubi will be the way our audiences engage -- primarily engage with entertainment in the future. It's a core part of our business and a core part of our strategy. And so we're building value there organically through driving its growth. I couldn't be more pleased with the arrival of our new CEO, Anjali Sud. She's doing a tremendous job and has very clear and strategic sort of retention and view for how we continue to drive Tubi's success. So thank you, Ben. \nOperator: And that's from Jessica Reif Ehrlich from Bank of America Securities. \nJessica Reif Cohen: First of all, I want to say, I really appreciate your introductory comments regarding news reporting and of course, about your father, who was -- is definitely one of a kind. But my question, I guess, 2 part 2 as usual from all of us. First on advertising,  can you give us your outlook for political advertising and what the current tone of sports advertising is. We know the general marketing still seems pretty tepid. \n And then maybe kind of a nuance on what Ben just asked, but the longer-term vision for Tubi, like it's clear there's tremendous growth near term, but is this the vehicle as you think about possibly transitioning to streaming, given the decline in the universe? Or how are you thinking about it? \nLachlan Murdoch: So let me start with advertising. So the -- we also hear and understand that the advertising market appears to be I use the word mixed, right, or sort of unsettled. However, we are not seeing that to the same extent due to our focus on sports and news. So let me start with sports, where we're seeing high demand around our NFL and we just discussed our cost football schedule particularly in the national sort of market, pharmaceuticals, auto, quick service restaurants and CPG categories have all been quite active and I think importantly our pricing has been added premium to our modest premium, but we are pricing above our [ upfront ] which certainly in a sports category, the market remains healthy. This will be somewhat tampered by post season baseball, including their conclusion of their world series last night. \n I think sometimes you get lucky and you get 7 series -- 7-game series with a matchups that are in sight the imagination of a national audience and sometimes you're less lucky. So that's how that could be combos. And so I think we would like to have seen more games and we'd like to have seen a bit more sort of national excitement around these games, but it is what it is. Having said that, we should congratulate the Texas Rangers for a great season and winning the world series. \n At FOX News Media, national advertising is solid with growing pricing. And it's important to note that we have over 80 new national advertisers in Primetime specifically in our 8 p.m. hour in the first quarter. So the refreshing of our schedule and our lineup has worked from both a ratings perspective, but also from an advertising perspective really, really very well. Direct Response continues to face some headwinds really from last year from the previous upfront, where there was which technically created sort of an oversupply in the market for direct response and put downward pressure on pricing. \n We would expect as we go forward for that pressure to be relieved. There will be some -- and we've got increased audiences due to the new cycle, which is a positive from a ratings point of view, but that's partially offset by an increased level of preemptions due to our kind of really in-depth and incredible reported. So overall, I should just overall sports and news, we are very happy with the overall performance of both of those verticals in our business. \n We're also very happy with Tubi. We announced we had 30% revenue gains, which is well driven off the 65% growth in total view time. I think going forward, we'll see continued growth in view time. Anjali is very focused on that. And what there is softness in the entertainment advertising market and Tubi is not immune from that softness. But Anjali is focused on how we better monetize. We've written this incredible growth in audience and viewership, and now it's time, we really focus on how we more effectively and efficiently monetize that huge audience. \n We've earned the right because of the audience growth to really start to take a greater share of wallet from our advertising partners. Finally, the local stations. We are pacing slightly ahead of last year in the base market, if you exclude political. You have to remember, this quarter last year of October, particularly, I think it had over $125 million worth of political revenue in the month of October alone. So it's a huge year-on-year comparison. But ex-political, we're very pleased with the base market is strong. \n And that's really led by the auto and recently, the retail categories are very strong, also financial services. That's offset with bedding, wager and also entertainment, right? It's -- there's not a lot of [indiscernible] they strike in Hollywood. There's no movie launches. So that's offsetting some of the growth in auto, retail and financial services. \n Now I should go on to some of your -- the other part of your question, in the -- sort of taking too long, Jessica. That's what happens when you ask 3 questions in one. But so the longer-term strategy for Tubi. Look, I think we have a multipronged strategy. I think Tubi is in an enviable position. It's the leading AVOD player. It's free. It's focused. It's entirely advertising-driven. That's appreciated by all of our clients and obviously, by our audiences. \n And I couldn't be happier with our transition from Farid, who is an incredible entrepreneur, who deserves all the credit for founding and building and driving Tubi to-date. It's always a difficult transition, when you move to -- from a founder to new leadership. So far, it's early days, but Anjali's very focused on all the issues and all the opportunities that Tubi has in front of it to continue it to grow at impressive levels. But Tubi is our free AVOD streaming service that does not -- it's not our only strategy in the streaming space. Direct-to-consumer is obviously something that we look at closely. We have a small direct-to-consumer SVOD service in Fox Nation, and we have optionality of expanding those services further into news and potentially sports. I hope I answered most of your questions, Jessica. \nOperator: The next question is from John Hodulik from UBS. \nJohn Hodulik: First, can we just get an update on the affiliate renewal process? I think you guys had said that it would be more weighted on the TV side, but I think a lot of the new agreements kick in, in January. So just any color on the trends we should see there. \n And then getting back to the Charter, Disney renewal, you guys seem to be somewhat unique in that you don't really have any long-tail networks or I would say, a major SVOD platform. Lockwood, you talked about Fox Nation, but it's obviously very different than what we're seeing in the rest of the industry. Just any thoughts on the implications for Fox is this model that we've seen out of this renewal and it would be broadly adopted over time for the industry. \nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks, John. On affiliate renewal, let me start with the big picture and Steve can talk to any of the numbers going forward, or not depending on -- but look, the main thing on affiliate renewal is we -- really due to our focus strategy, our focus on our core brands. Also, I think our focus on being good partners with our distributors and wanting their businesses to succeed, because frankly, from a FOX perspective, the Cable bundle, Cable distribution or Pay TV distribution remains our largest and really the most important revenue stream. \n And that we believe that it will remain our largest for years to come. So we are -- we feel the success of our distribution partners is our success as well. We want them to succeed and we want them to do well, which is one reason, why we've kept our premium content within the cable bundle. We are not interested in at this stage, moving premium content away from our cable distribution partners. That would be, I think, a mistake for us and for them. \n And so due to that, since our last call a quarter ago, we have renewed a number of distribution contracts. And in every case, we've been rewarded by that focus, rewarded by our partnerships with our affiliate partners, our distribution partners with our rate increases and distribution agreements that are -- that fit absolutely in line with our plan. And that's because they value our brands, they value Fox News, they value Fox Sports and obviously, our local stations and networks. \n So we are very pleased with our pace of renewals, and we haven't seen any changes to the way we're able to work constructively with our partners. And that goes to the second part of your question with Charter and Disney. It's hard for me to say how -- I don't want to talk about other people -- a lot of people are -- have their earnings calls next week. I think we're early in the media cycle. They can talk about how that renewal affects them and particularly the entertainment channels for us because we're not in that space. \n I think it's a net positive. We like to see our partners focus on the core brands, the core brands, where all the audiences and frankly, where the leverage is in terms of retransmission and less so on channels that might not be as popular.\n  So Steve, do you want to... \nSteven Tomsic: Yes. So John, just to reinforce Lachlan's point, we had -- just over 1/3 of our distribution renewals, due this fiscal year, and we're virtually through all of that. So that's -- and as Lachlan mentioned, we've achieved our pricing objectives against those renewals, which goes to, a, the fact that we haven't gone back with any distributors and the fact that we've been able to achieve objectives. And assuming the distributors are also happy those renewals. \n It goes to a constructive relationship.  We have with those distributors. And so, listen we negotiate our full portfolio as a bundle. And I think you should expect to see that coming into the new calendar year, you'll see the impact of those renewals, and I suspect that the benefit of those will be skewed towards the Television segment, but you should also expect to see some progress on the cable side in the new calendar year, I should say. \nOperator: And that question will come from the line of Phil Cusick from JPMorgan. \nPhilip Cusick: A lot has been asked, but Lachlan, thinking about your comments on DR and recognizing that some of those upfront issues hopefully fade. But it makes me curious about your view on the future of the linear video ad landscape you have Tubi, which allows you to benefit from the shift to digital. But do you think we've reached a tipping point where linear video advertising is it secular, not just cyclical decline? \nSteven Tomsic: The short answer is ,we got to, you have to, I think, break it up by category, right? And so if we look at sports and news, there's no sign of a slowdown in sort of demand for the really incredible and unique reach that those platforms deliver our advertising clients. \n I think on the DR issue is a specific issue that really relates to upfront before last, we're -- there was a -- due to the negotiating strategy of some of our competitors, there was an oversupply of direct response in the market, and that's driven pricing down. And we see -- we didn't see the same activity in this past upfront. \n And so we expect the pricing pressure on DR to ameliorate or wash out in the coming quarters. So we do see that as a shorter-term problem and not a structural problem at all. And so it comes back to particularly in news and sports, there is no other content or platform that offers the reach that those categories offer. And so we are optimistic is not a strong enough word. \n We are very confident in the future of linear advertising, when you can deliver and the audiences that we deliver with the brands and the brand safety that we also can offer our clients. \nGabrielle Brown: At this point, we are out of time. But if you have any further questions, please give me or Dan Carey a call. Thank you once again for joining today. \nSteven Tomsic: Thank you, everyone. Thank you. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Steven Tomsic",
            "content": "Thanks, Lachlan, and good morning, everyone. FOX reported total first quarter company revenues of $3.21 billion, which is slightly above the prior year quarter. This was led by a 2% increase in affiliate fee revenues as the pricing gains from recent distribution renewals more than offset the impact from industry subscriber declines. From an advertising perspective, we, of course, faced the tough comparison to last year's record midterm political revenues at our local stations. \n This, coupled with continued softness in the direct response marketplace at FOX News more than offset the benefits we saw from the broadcast of the FIFA Women's World Cup, the 30% revenue growth generated at Tubi and continued support of national pricing for live content.  \n Taking as a whole, our advertising revenues declined 2%. Meanwhile, total company other revenues increased 2% or $6 million. Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $869 million as compared to the $1.09 billion reported in the prior year quarter. Expenses increased this quarter driven by higher rights amortization and production costs associated with the Women's World Cup, the first year step-up from our NFL rights renewal and increased expenses at our digital businesses.  \n Net income attributable to stockholders of $407 million or $0.82 per share compared to the $605 million or $1.10 per share reported in the prior year period. This move largely reflects the EBITDA impact I just mentioned, along with the change in fair value of the company's investment in Flat recognized in other net. Excluding this impact and other non-core items, adjusted EPS was $1.09 versus last year's $1.21.  \n Turning to our operating segment results, starting with television, where we delivered total quarterly revenues of $1.78 billion or a 4% increase year-over-year. This was driven by an 8% increase in TV affiliate revenues with healthy growth in fees across all FOX-affiliated stations more than offset the impact from industry subscriber declines. Advertising revenues at our TV segment grew 1%, led by the benefits from the broadcast of the Women's World Cup, continued growth at Tubi and the timing of college football broadcast, partially offset by the absence of last year's midterm political revenues and lower ratings of the FOX network. \n Television Other revenues increased 6% in the quarter, primarily a result of the timing of participations tied to our entertainment production initiatives.  The growth in revenue at our television segment was more than offset by a 10% increase in expenses, including costs associated with the Women's World Cup, the first year step-up associated with the renewal of our NFL rights and continued investment at Tubi. Together, these revenue and expense impacts led to quarterly adjusted EBITDA of $351 million in our Television segment compared to the $409 million reported in the prior year quarter. Our Cable segment reported total quarterly revenues of $1.39 billion, a 3% decrease year-over-year.  \n Cable affiliate revenues were down 2% in the quarter, largely a result of industry subscriber declines, which continue to run in the 8% range. Cable advertising revenues were down 8% as a broadcast of the Women's World Cup and the Men's CONCACAF Gold Cup were more than offset by the continued impact of a softer direct response marketplace and lower ratings at FOX News Media. Notably though, we continue to see healthy national linear and digital demand from advertisers of Fox News Media. \n Cable other revenues increased by $6 million in the quarter due to the timing of sports sublicensing revenues. Meanwhile, expenses at our Cable segment increased 13%, led by higher programming rights amortization and production costs for the Women's World Cup and Gold Cup, the timing of college football broadcast at FOX Sports One and contractual rights increases across our sports portfolio.  \n All in all, this resulted in adjusted EBITDA at our Cable segment of $607 million compared to the $742 million reported in the prior year period. Turning to cash flow, where free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx, was negative $70 million in the quarter. This is consistent with the seasonality of our working capital cycle with the first half of our fiscal year is characterized by a concentration of payments for sports rights and the buildup of advertising-related receivables, both of which reversed in the second half of our fiscal year. \n From a capital deployment perspective, fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased a further $300 million through our share buyback program. We have now cumulatively repurchased 4.9 billion, representing approximately 24% of our total shares outstanding, since the launch of the buyback program in 2019, and we remain committed to utilizing our full buyback authorization of $7 billion. This is supported by the strength of our balance sheet, where we ended the quarter with approximately $3.8 billion in cash and $7.2 billion in debt.  \n This excludes the $1.25 billion of senior notes that we issued in early October. The proceeds from which we intend to use to pay down the corresponding maturity coming due in January 2024. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Gabby. Yes. So John, just to reinforce Lachlan's point, we had -- just over 1/3 of our distribution renewals, due this fiscal year, and we're virtually through all of that. So that's -- and as Lachlan mentioned, we've achieved our pricing objectives against those renewals, which goes to, a, the fact that we haven't gone back with any distributors and the fact that we've been able to achieve objectives. And assuming the distributors are also happy those renewals. \n It goes to a constructive relationship.  We have with those distributors. And so, listen we negotiate our full portfolio as a bundle. And I think you should expect to see that coming into the new calendar year, you'll see the impact of those renewals, and I suspect that the benefit of those will be skewed towards the Television segment, but you should also expect to see some progress on the cable side in the new calendar year, I should say. The short answer is ,we got to, you have to, I think, break it up by category, right? And so if we look at sports and news, there's no sign of a slowdown in sort of demand for the really incredible and unique reach that those platforms deliver our advertising clients. \n I think on the DR issue is a specific issue that really relates to upfront before last, we're -- there was a -- due to the negotiating strategy of some of our competitors, there was an oversupply of direct response in the market, and that's driven pricing down. And we see -- we didn't see the same activity in this past upfront. \n And so we expect the pricing pressure on DR to ameliorate or wash out in the coming quarters. So we do see that as a shorter-term problem and not a structural problem at all. And so it comes back to particularly in news and sports, there is no other content or platform that offers the reach that those categories offer. And so we are optimistic is not a strong enough word. \n We are very confident in the future of linear advertising, when you can deliver and the audiences that we deliver with the brands and the brand safety that we also can offer our clients. Thank you, everyone. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Gabby, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. I just want to start with a comment and a note of thanks. We are living through tumultuous times. And at the outset, I want to acknowledge the work our journalists are doing covering the horrific October 7 terrorist attack and the subsequent ongoing war in the Middle East. \n From the reporting of Trey Yingst, Greg Palkot, Mike Tobin and Lucas Tomlinson in Israel; and Steve Harrigan in [indiscernible] to the deep analysis and insightful commentary by our reporters and hosts, including John Roberts and Trace Gallagher, to the essential and brave work of our on-the-ground producers and camera crews, Fox's fulfilling its mission defined, report and analyze the news of the day without fear or favor.  \n News reporting is hard and word reporting is perhaps the hardest. And while the horror Central to this new cycle and were heavily on those we ask to expose them, their exposure is necessary. And so our team deserves our admiration and our gratitude as they continue to work tirelessly and under demanding conditions to keep us up to date on events far away and on their impact closer to home. My sincere thanks to them all. \n Now turning to today's first quarter earnings release. Against a backdrop of an active news cycle and a robust sports schedule, fiscal 2024 has started off on a solid operational and financial footing. Fox's focused portfolio of assets continues to distinguish itself and deliver exceptional results. Financially, we are now comparing against the fiscal '23 cycle of events that delivered then record revenues and EBITDA. Despite this comparison, we posted total revenues this year slightly ahead of last year's record. \n On the affiliate side, we reported 2% total affiliate growth, led by 8% growth of the TV segment in the quarter. Importantly, we have continued to secure constructive renewals, which deliver for our partners and reinforce the value of our brands and program. Advertising revenues in the quarter decreased by around 2%, principally due to a comparative quarter last year that was much heavier in political ad revenues at our local TV stations. \n We understand there is inconsistency around the broader advertising market, particularly in entertainment, but our focus on live sports and news continues to deliver with healthy national pricing and demand in addition to continued momentum at Tubi. Underpinning revenue are our core brands, which consistently resonate with viewers and the consumption data clearly shows this. With total viewing of FOX brands up 2% in the quarter. \n FOX Sports was a big driver of that consumption, especially with its broadcast of the Women's World Cup, where the U.S. versus the Netherlands on FOX was the most watched Women's World Cup game match ever on U.S. English language television. From summer to fall, our lineup is bolstered by our football packages led by the NFL on FOX, we are averaging over 17 million viewers Tubi gained. Based on the strength of our remaining schedule, especially from Thanksgiving to Christmas, we expect that engagement to improve significantly. \n In College Football, interest is reaching new highs Fox's big new Saturday is progressing to a third straight year as the #1 game window in all of college footfall, averaging almost 6 million viewers. At Tubi, we had another enviable quarter, delivering 30% revenue growth driven by an impressive 65% lift in total view time. \n Tubi surpassed 70 million monthly active users in September, logged nearly 4 billion streaming hours in the first half of the calendar year and remains the #1 AVOD player and most watched free ad-supported TV streaming service in the United States. Additionally, Tubi has beaten Pluto, Max, Paramount Plus and Peacock and Bouton for 5 consecutive months. One reason for the high engagement level that Tubi is its extensive content library that now exceeds 60,000 titles, which translates into more than 225,000 movies and TV episodes in addition to approximately 300 fast channels. And during the quarter, Tubi introduced Rabbit AI a Chat GPT 4 powered recommendation engine to help users navigate this incredible range of titles. \n Tubi also offers a unique and compelling proposition to advertisers. Our recent MRI study of streaming peers concluded that Tubi saw the fastest growth amongst young and diverse populations. And that Tubi is able to deliver high-value net new audiences with 33% of Tubi streamers unreachable on other top AVOD services. \n Now turning back to Fox News, the strength of our overall news coverage and the reach of our linear audio and digital content is unmatched. Whether it is the conflict in the Middle East, the upcoming 2024 election cycle or volatility in the financial markets, FOX News is increasingly their viewers first choice. The launch of our new expanded Primetime lineup in mid-July further solidified Fox News' leadership position, not only in cable news, but in all of cable, finishing the quarter as the most watched cable network in both total day and Primetime. \n FOX News maintained its lead as the most watched cable news network, beating CNN and MSNBC in and total viewers and in the demo for both prime and total day. We have seen that they continue and expand in the current quarter, with October viewership increasing over 20% from the first quarter with over 30% growth in the key demo. Ratings leadership during the quarter was achieved across the platform. \n The Fox News channel had the top 6 cable news programs with P2+ And the top 7 programs within the demo. In P2+,  the 5 led the way in terms of viewers, followed by Jesse Watters Primetime and Hannity, of the 5 Gutfeld. Hannity and Jesse Watters Primetime were a top 4 programs in the demo. And Fox Business News ended the quarter as the most watched business cable network, beating CNBC in total viewers during the business day for the sixth consecutive quarter. \n The election cycle started off with the successful Republican presidential primary debate, which is Fox News channel's highest-rated telecasts, since election day 2020 and the highest-rated non-sports telecast of the year across cable. While the debate kicked off the election cycle, once we get deeper into it, our local station group will benefit greatly from increased political spend in the coming quarters.  \n Over at FOX Entertainment, we started the 2023 to 2024 broadcast season as the #1 network in the key adult 18 to 49 demo, and Fox ranks as the top network and entertainment program. First in at least 10 years. FOX has 3 of the top 4 highest-rated premieres of the 2023/'24 season to date in Krapopolis, the Simpson and The Masked Singer.  And the season's #1 new game show with Snake Oil. Across the company, fiscal '24 is shaping up nicely. We look forward to a great enthusiasm across the fall sports season, underpinned by the NFL college football and now the completed World Series, continued viewing growth at Tubi and renewed momentum at Fox News and our local stations as the election cycle heats up.  \n Our balance sheet remains a core asset for FOX and we will continue to deploy it in a disciplined and thoughtful manner that delivers value for our shareholders. Finally, I would like to congratulate my father on a 70-year career at News Corp and Fox. His enduring legacy can be felt in both of these companies. And I can assure you that he is still very much involved and will continue to be for years to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Steve to take you through the operating details of the quarter. Rob, there's a lot in there. So let me unpack it bit by bit and if I -- I hope I don't miss anything. So how we -- I think we've talked about this before, but how we analyze the WWE renewal,  and we look at all of our sports portfolio in the same way and on all new rights, opportunities are for new rights in the same way. We -- on the base of analyst -- analysis, sorry. We on both an advertising point of view, we were not hitting the advertising numbers, due to the audience of the WWE to make return for our return on investment to be above the levels that we would accept. But also we didn't attribute enough significant retransmission revenue to WWE either, so it made sense for us to move on from them. They've been a great partner for many years. \n But just quite simply, we're very disciplined and the RR didn't meet our pretty disciplined parameters. So we wish them luck and we've moved on from them. We're currently in, I think, the final status of a very constructive negotiation for our NASCAR renewal. We look forward to continuing that partnership with NASCAR. It's been a great partnership for many years. And obviously, NASCAR exceeds our expectations from an ROI point of view. In terms of Disney and Charter and how that affects our view going forward. I think it's a net positive for us. I think that we want our distributors to do well. We want them to continue to invest in high-quality programming, and high-quality brands. \n And obviously, between FOX News and Fox Sports, our station group and our network, we have a very focused, very valuable set of core brands, that distributors such as Charter value. So net-net, the Disney, Charter deal has been positive for us and positive for our strategy. No that's fine. I think the best way I can answer both questions sort of with one answer, I suppose, which is the value -- you're 1,000% right, college football has never been more popular. It's rating extremely well. And 1 of the things we haven't talked about is, frankly, advertisers have found it. Advertisers are pouring in to call triple with tremendous rates and with tremendous appetite for volume because they can see the value in this audience. \n And perhaps it's been underpriced in past years, I'm not sure. But certainly, advertisers are recognizing the opportunity in college football and obviously, we're the leader. But ultimately, we build value through our brands and through the Fox Sports brand and Fox Sports and station distribution. And so we'll continue to build value through college football through the Fox Sports brand and monetizing it that way. The same thing with Tubi.\n First of all, we don't envisage any kind of significant live sports on Tubi in the near or frankly, median, perhaps even long-term future. But Tubi is very focused on primarily entertainment, and particularly in video-on-demand entertainment, which makes that content and then engagement with their users, all the more valuable.  \n And I think it will be a long time before we see significant live sports on Tubi. In terms of how we unlock the value in Tubi. Tubi will be the way our audiences engage -- primarily engage with entertainment in the future. It's a core part of our business and a core part of our strategy. And so we're building value there organically through driving its growth. I couldn't be more pleased with the arrival of our new CEO, Anjali Sud. She's doing a tremendous job and has very clear and strategic sort of retention and view for how we continue to drive Tubi's success. So thank you, Ben. So let me start with advertising. So the -- we also hear and understand that the advertising market appears to be I use the word mixed, right, or sort of unsettled. However, we are not seeing that to the same extent due to our focus on sports and news. So let me start with sports, where we're seeing high demand around our NFL and we just discussed our cost football schedule particularly in the national sort of market, pharmaceuticals, auto, quick service restaurants and CPG categories have all been quite active and I think importantly our pricing has been added premium to our modest premium, but we are pricing above our [ upfront ] which certainly in a sports category, the market remains healthy. This will be somewhat tampered by post season baseball, including their conclusion of their world series last night. \n I think sometimes you get lucky and you get 7 series -- 7-game series with a matchups that are in sight the imagination of a national audience and sometimes you're less lucky. So that's how that could be combos. And so I think we would like to have seen more games and we'd like to have seen a bit more sort of national excitement around these games, but it is what it is. Having said that, we should congratulate the Texas Rangers for a great season and winning the world series. \n At FOX News Media, national advertising is solid with growing pricing. And it's important to note that we have over 80 new national advertisers in Primetime specifically in our 8 p.m. hour in the first quarter. So the refreshing of our schedule and our lineup has worked from both a ratings perspective, but also from an advertising perspective really, really very well. Direct Response continues to face some headwinds really from last year from the previous upfront, where there was which technically created sort of an oversupply in the market for direct response and put downward pressure on pricing. \n We would expect as we go forward for that pressure to be relieved. There will be some -- and we've got increased audiences due to the new cycle, which is a positive from a ratings point of view, but that's partially offset by an increased level of preemptions due to our kind of really in-depth and incredible reported. So overall, I should just overall sports and news, we are very happy with the overall performance of both of those verticals in our business. \n We're also very happy with Tubi. We announced we had 30% revenue gains, which is well driven off the 65% growth in total view time. I think going forward, we'll see continued growth in view time. Anjali is very focused on that. And what there is softness in the entertainment advertising market and Tubi is not immune from that softness. But Anjali is focused on how we better monetize. We've written this incredible growth in audience and viewership, and now it's time, we really focus on how we more effectively and efficiently monetize that huge audience. \n We've earned the right because of the audience growth to really start to take a greater share of wallet from our advertising partners. Finally, the local stations. We are pacing slightly ahead of last year in the base market, if you exclude political. You have to remember, this quarter last year of October, particularly, I think it had over $125 million worth of political revenue in the month of October alone. So it's a huge year-on-year comparison. But ex-political, we're very pleased with the base market is strong. \n And that's really led by the auto and recently, the retail categories are very strong, also financial services. That's offset with bedding, wager and also entertainment, right? It's -- there's not a lot of [indiscernible] they strike in Hollywood. There's no movie launches. So that's offsetting some of the growth in auto, retail and financial services. \n Now I should go on to some of your -- the other part of your question, in the -- sort of taking too long, Jessica. That's what happens when you ask 3 questions in one. But so the longer-term strategy for Tubi. Look, I think we have a multipronged strategy. I think Tubi is in an enviable position. It's the leading AVOD player. It's free. It's focused. It's entirely advertising-driven. That's appreciated by all of our clients and obviously, by our audiences. \n And I couldn't be happier with our transition from Farid, who is an incredible entrepreneur, who deserves all the credit for founding and building and driving Tubi to-date. It's always a difficult transition, when you move to -- from a founder to new leadership. So far, it's early days, but Anjali's very focused on all the issues and all the opportunities that Tubi has in front of it to continue it to grow at impressive levels. But Tubi is our free AVOD streaming service that does not -- it's not our only strategy in the streaming space. Direct-to-consumer is obviously something that we look at closely. We have a small direct-to-consumer SVOD service in Fox Nation, and we have optionality of expanding those services further into news and potentially sports. I hope I answered most of your questions, Jessica. Thanks, John. On affiliate renewal, let me start with the big picture and Steve can talk to any of the numbers going forward, or not depending on -- but look, the main thing on affiliate renewal is we -- really due to our focus strategy, our focus on our core brands. Also, I think our focus on being good partners with our distributors and wanting their businesses to succeed, because frankly, from a FOX perspective, the Cable bundle, Cable distribution or Pay TV distribution remains our largest and really the most important revenue stream. \n And that we believe that it will remain our largest for years to come. So we are -- we feel the success of our distribution partners is our success as well. We want them to succeed and we want them to do well, which is one reason, why we've kept our premium content within the cable bundle. We are not interested in at this stage, moving premium content away from our cable distribution partners. That would be, I think, a mistake for us and for them. \n And so due to that, since our last call a quarter ago, we have renewed a number of distribution contracts. And in every case, we've been rewarded by that focus, rewarded by our partnerships with our affiliate partners, our distribution partners with our rate increases and distribution agreements that are -- that fit absolutely in line with our plan. And that's because they value our brands, they value Fox News, they value Fox Sports and obviously, our local stations and networks. \n So we are very pleased with our pace of renewals, and we haven't seen any changes to the way we're able to work constructively with our partners. And that goes to the second part of your question with Charter and Disney. It's hard for me to say how -- I don't want to talk about other people -- a lot of people are -- have their earnings calls next week. I think we're early in the media cycle. They can talk about how that renewal affects them and particularly the entertainment channels for us because we're not in that space. \n I think it's a net positive. We like to see our partners focus on the core brands, the core brands, where all the audiences and frankly, where the leverage is in terms of retransmission and less so on channels that might not be as popular.\n  So Steve, do you want to..."
