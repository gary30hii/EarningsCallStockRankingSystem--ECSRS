During today\u2019s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Tim Fox, PTC's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nTim Fox: Thank you, Joelle. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining PTC's conference call to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 financial results. On the call today are Jim Heppelmann, Chief Executive Officer; and Kristian Talvitie, Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, we'd like to acknowledge that a table from our press release became public and we're currently looking into how this happened. In the meantime of course the full set of earnings documents are available on PTC's Investor Relations website. Now, moving on to today's call. Please note that our comments including forward-looking statements including statements regarding future financial guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in PTC's filings with the SEC including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. As a reminder, we will be referring to operating and non-GAAP financial measures during today's call. Discussion of our operating metrics and the items excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings press release and related Form 8-K. References to growth rates will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted. And lastly we'll be referencing our prepared remarks document which is in presentation form today which you can find posted on our IR website. With that, let me turn it over to Jim.\nJim Heppelmann: Thanks Tim. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. I hope you and your families continue to stay safe and well during this crisis. Before jumping into our quarter and year-end review, I'd like to begin by sharing several pieces of new news that we announced earlier this afternoon. Turning to slide four, we're very pleased to announce that PTC and Rockwell Automation have extended our strategic partnership by two additional years which cements the alliance in place through fiscal 2023. We have also broadened the partnership beyond IoT and AR to include PLM and Onshape. Back in May, Rockwell acquired Kalypso, a professional services company who has been a strong PLM and IoT partner of PTC for years. Kalypso gives Rockwell increased capabilities to pursue digital threat initiatives so the scope of our agreement has been broadened to embrace those pursuits. The agreement has other changes that better encourage sales cooperation give PTC access to Rockwell's Emulate3D factory simulation software and naturally it contemplates continued growth through fiscal 2023. The alliance has expanded our reach and our capabilities as intended while providing Rockwell with access to best-in-class Industry 4.0 software technology, the agreement has allowed PTC to address significant white space in the market. Rockwell has introduced PTC technology into more than 250 sizable companies across 45 countries to date. And 70% represent new logos to PTC. Rockwell has quickly become one of PTC's biggest and most important partners. Blake Moret, the Chairman and CEO of Rockwell Automation shares my view that this extension is a big win for both companies. Turning now to slide five, we also announced earlier today that we'll be hosting a virtual Investor Day on December 15th. We'll be reviewing our strategy, secular growth drivers in our markets, our broad solutions portfolio, and how we're taking those solutions to market. Kristian will also review progress of our very attractive financial model. Given that upcoming event, we plan to keep this call focused on Q4 and fiscal 2020 results and on fiscal 2021 guidance. We hope you can join us for the event in December. With that I'd like to turn to slide six and spend a few minutes describing what we see the three key elements of our strategy to deliver long-term shareholder value. It starts by aligning with market demand so we can build a strong pipeline. Then optimizing new and renewal sales and customer success to power the top line ARR growth. Finally, creating an efficient business model and operation that allows PTC to drive the bottom line free cash flow growth even faster. This will be PTC's new framework for describing our business strategy, operations and results here as we head into fiscal 2021. First on market demand. Fiscal 2020 will no doubt be remembered as one of the most unique and challenging times PTC has faced over our 35-year history. I fundamentally believe we'll look back at the last year as a pivotal moment for PTC. Pivotal in the sense that our suite of software solutions, which have been driving significant value from customers before the pandemic, have now become even more mission critical. Years back, we had anticipated a growing need for the types of capabilities PTC has been investing in, but COVID has certainly accelerated demand for them. Digital transformation initiatives across the industrial space are accelerating as companies adjust to this new normal way of doing business. The importance of solutions that enable work from home, global team and supply chain collaboration, remote asset management, remote frontline worker training and support have never been higher. For PTC, this translates into more demand for PLM, for IoT, for AR and for SaaS. What we're seeing in our pipeline, which stands at record levels confirms that PTC is in a strong position. Regarding the top line, necessity is the mother of invention and work from home has pushed PTC to dramatically accelerate our digital marketing and sales capabilities. I'm very pleased to report that we delivered strong Q4 bookings, up from the previous high-water mark in Q4 of 2019, which is even more impressive when you consider the state of the global economy and the fact that our sales teams were constrained to virtual operations. I feel like we've made more progress adopting digital go-to-market in the last 6 months than in the previous 5 years. With the subscription transition in the rearview mirror, we have successfully crossed the proverbial valley of death and are back to record levels of ARR and revenue. Now we're enjoying the top line stability and the higher rates of growth and higher margins that led us to undertake that difficult 5-year journey. As proof, fiscal 2020 marked the third consecutive year of double-digit ARR growth for PTC, despite the extreme volatility of PMIs and the macro environment that occurred during that same time frame. Now more than 90% of our revenue is software and 98% of that software revenue is recurring. I'm so pleased with this outcome. It came just-in-time for COVID. Finally, in the bottom line category, our EPS and free cash flow were both above guidance. As Kristian will detail a little later, our fiscal 2021 free cash flow guidance represents another new high-water mark for PTC. This is driven by strong ARR growth and the passing of several short-term free cash flow headwinds that held us back in fiscal 2020, but are now fading as we go into fiscal 2021 allowing our true earnings power to shine through. Altogether, PTC is very fortunate to have industry-leading technology that's well aligned with secular growth drivers, vastly improved digital go-to-market capabilities and in a sustainable and efficient recurring software business model. With that let me turn to slide 7 and touch on a few key financial highlights. ARR of $1.27 billion represents growth of 14% or 11% at constant currency, which was the midpoint of our guidance range. To put the COVID-19 impact into context fiscal 2020 ARR growth was about 500 basis points below our pre-COVID internal plan, due to bookings pressures and modestly elevated churn resulting from the pandemic. At this point, we see a smaller 200 basis point headwind to fiscal 2021 ARR growth. And as of now, no headwind to fiscal 2022 and beyond. Overall, we're very pleased with our fiscal 2020 financial results and excited about our fiscal 2021 guidance. And I believe that PTC is positioned to do even better in coming years. There's a lot of shareholder value creation that lies ahead of us. With that as context, let's take a look at the respective contributions of the FSG, Core and Growth business segments of our portfolio. Moving to slide 8. You'll see that ARR growth declined modestly in our FSG business but was strong in our much larger Core business and accelerated in our fast-growing Growth business. Recall that our Focused Solutions Group which we position as a lower growth cash cow has exposure to industries heavily impacted by COVID-19 in particular retailers and airlines. Our FSG products remain very competitive and we're expecting FSG to recover to low single-digit growth again in fiscal 2021 as economic conditions in those segments improve. At the same time, we're very pleased with the 11% growth of our Core business, which continues to materially outpace the market growth rate. Q4 was the 12th consecutive quarter that our core ARR growth rate has been in double-digits. Meanwhile our growth business had a very strong quarter and year, with growth trending back to the levels we want to see. ThingWorx, Vuforia and Onshape, all posted impressive results in Q4, but Vuforia and Onshape have really been strong all year. It's worth noting that ARR of our growth business has now surpassed that of FSG, which creates a tailwind of growth for the entire portfolio. Let's go a click deeper into the main elements of our core and growth segments. Turning to slide 9, our CAD team delivered a solid quarter with ARR growth in the high-single-digits. Across geos, APAC, once again delivered strong results and the overall demand environment improved sequentially in the Americas and stabilized in Europe. Overall CAD renewals remained healthy with churn improving quarter-over-quarter. We're excited to be launching the next release of Creo 7.0 in the coming months, which incorporates our first Atlas-based offering. Creo generative design extension or GDX, as we call it, leverages our Frustum generative design technology with the compute offloaded to a pure SaaS Atlas environment from where it is served to both Creo and Onshape. Also in this next Creo release, we'll be launching the mainstream high fidelity simulation capabilities from ANSYS, fully integrated with Creo, creating another highly differentiated leg of growth for our CAD business. Speaking of ANSYS, we had solid results from Creo Simulation Live, our CAD solution that embeds real-time simulation from ANSYS, which delivered its second highest bookings quarter to date. We continue to see interest across a wide variety of verticals, like automotive, medical device, industrials and in the high-tech space. On Slide 10, we highlight a great high-tech CSL win with NVIDIA. This is a classic example of how traditional design and simulation processes impact time to market. Creo Simulation Live provides NVIDIA engineers with real-time control of design direction, allowing a more refined design handoff to analysts, resulting in reduced rework, faster time to market and improved work processes. We're pleased with CSL's traction in the market and look forward to launching new marketing programs in the coming quarters. Moving on to slide 11 in our PLM business, you'll see that PLM continued to deliver strong performance with mid-teens ARR growth in Q4 and for the full year. In fact, the PLM team beat their pre-COVID sales goal for the full year. From a geographic perspective in Q4, PLM performance was broad-based with double-digit growth across all three major geographies led by the APAC region. From a vertical perspective, our PLM team continues to win big in the medical device space and in A&D. Turning to Slide 12, a great proof point in the life sciences arena was a major competitive displacement at Baxter International. What started as a point solution opportunity for product requirements management expanded into a full-blown digital thread enterprise engagement. Baxter was operating with disparate independent systems and processes, which was negatively impacting regulatory cycle times. By adopting PTC's broad suite of Windchill PLM solutions, Baxter's consolidating its footprint into a single enterprise system and transforming from document-centric to part-centric processes, resulting in a 4,500-seat competitive displacement. You'll see on slide 13 that we had a great win at TE Connectivity. In this case, TE was using a highly customized incumbent system for technical document distribution. By leveraging ThingWorx Navigate and seamlessly integrating with Windchill PLM and other enterprise systems, TE will deliver content to 20,000 users across functions like purchasing, supply chain, planning and manufacturing planning. Moving on to our Growth business, I'll begin with IoT on slide 14. While IoT ARR was impacted in fiscal 2020 from the new logo headwinds we described earlier in the year, we were pleased to see IoT bookings double sequentially in Q4, which benefited from some pent-up demand following macro slowdowns midyear, but also benefited from a number of significant wins in the quarter. Once again the standout IoT vertical in the quarter was medical device industry, which has experienced less economic disruption during the crisis. We also had very strong performance in the Americas with bookings more than doubling sequentially. We were also pleased to receive further validation of PTC's strong IoT market position by the industry analyst community. Just last week PTC was named a leader in the 2020 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Industrial IoT Platforms. This is a particularly special award given Gartner's rigorous and in-depth evaluation process and the strong influence that Gartner has in our market. On slide 15 we have an example of ThingWorx in action at Stanley Black & Decker, one of the most venerable manufacturing brands in the industrial tool and hardware markets. Stanley has been on a multiyear digital transformation journey with PTC and we were pleased to expand this relationship in Q4. Leveraging ThingWorx applications to expose data across previously disconnected assets, Stanley is driving significant improvements in OEE, overall equipment effectiveness across their global manufacturing footprint. Turning to slide 16. Bridgestone is another SCO customer that's had great success leveraging ThingWorx Analytics, the embedded machine learning engine to provide real-time insights into its production environment to drive operational efficiencies, improve throughput and improve quality all at scale. Let me shift to our AR business on slide 17. The Vuforia augmented reality team delivered very strong results in Q4 with bookings up 50% year-over-year. The AR team landed a nice seven-figure deal in the largest deal to date in Europe. We also saw a significant increase in the number of six-figure deals with 18 in the quarter, doubling the previous high-water mark. The large deal acceleration is a testament to the success of our up-sell strategy. Customers are starting to adopt our entry-level AR solution Vuforia Chalk and then identifying more sophisticated AR use cases, which we addressed with Vuforia Studio and Vuforia Expert Capture. These advanced solutions are tailor-made for the remote work situation that our industrial customers are currently navigating. We had two notable wins in Q4 that highlighted the broader value -- or the value of our broader AR suite. The first on slide 18 is at Jabil, a major global contract manufacturing company with 260,000 employees in 30 countries. Jabil operates in a highly competitive market where margins are paramount. One of the biggest cost inputs is, of course, human capital so finding new transformative solutions to improve onboarding and training and increasing frontline worker efficiency can have huge returns. PTC's AR team leveraging existing CAD and PLM relationships at Jabil introduced the Vuforia suite to their manufacturing team and landed a seven-figure AR starter deal. Turning to slide 19. A second great AR success story in the quarter was with Nordex, one of the world's leading wind turbine manufacturers. And as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded, Nordex was planning to ramp new production capacity in India. However, the COVID related travel restrictions kept their German based technical experts grounded, which stalled the commissioning of new production facilities. By leveraging Vuforia Expert Capture, local technicians recorded training instructions in context then automatically published that content to headsets and mobile devices used by the production teams on the ground in India. Turning now to slide 20. I'll wrap up my comments on our Growth business by discussing Onshape, which delivered another strong quarter as they wrapped up their first year as part of the PTC family. Onshape had a record quarter with bookings up more than 80% year-over-year and with 70% growth in new logos. During fiscal 2020, Onshape landed over 700 competitive displacements, the majority coming from SolidWorks. I see this as clear evidence of the disruptive nature of Onshape's SaaS based solution in what has been a competitive mature market with entrenched incumbent players. The investments we're making in Onshape's global market expansion is starting to pay early dividends in Europe, which is a large market for design software. The PTC reseller channel while still early in its Onshape journey is gaining traction and opens up another exciting vector of growth for the Onshape business. Lastly on Onshape, I'd like to update you on the exciting trends we're seeing in the education market. On slide 21, you'll see that education sign-ups during the back-to-school season have been growing nicely for years, but they have literally exploded this year due to COVID. Let me explain why. Mainstream CAD systems run exclusively on Windows workstations, but students generally have Macbooks, Chromebooks or iPads. So schools have always been forced to provide a special PC computer room on-campus for any CAD-related work. Because of the pandemic, most schools now require work-from-anywhere solutions. So they're increasingly turning to Onshape which runs on any of the devices students typically have. Schools are realizing that they don't even need the expensive PC room anymore. So, I don't see the situation reverting. Winning in education is really important because students represent the workforce of tomorrow. Winning them over, while setting the bar at a new level has proven to be a winning long-term sales and marketing technique in the CAD industry. We believe the rapid adoption of Onshape in education provides a template for SaaS adoption to follow in the commercial market. Our manufacturing customers have the same needs for real-time collaboration and access to data from anywhere and on any device. I believe the COVID crisis is accelerating the SaaS tipping point for the engineering software industry by several years. Bottom line is that one year into it Onshape looks to be another excellent acquisition. To wrap up on our Growth business, I think it's pretty clear that the COVID crisis has only amplified long-term growth opportunities for PTC. Let me provide some color on geographic performance. On slide 22, you'll see that APAC had strong performance with ARR growth of 14%, reflecting the earlier reopening of those economies and much healthier churn rates on subscription licenses particularly in China where our subscription model seems to be gaining a foothold. America's ARR growth of 11% was driven by mid-teens PLM growth and strong growth across our AR suite, but partially offset by softness in FSG. Europe ARR growth of 8% while benefiting from solid PLM performance lagged other regions primarily because of the higher mix of CAD and pressure on new logo activity in IoT. Before I wrap up let me turn to slide 23 and touch on our other key alliance partner. I've already spoken of the strength of the Rockwell and ANSYS alliances, but our partnership with Microsoft had another strong quarter with bookings increasing around 20% from Q3 with momentum building in Europe which comprised 30% of the bookings in Q4. With a solid pipeline heading into FY 2021 and field engagement strengthening across the globe we remain bullish on the Microsoft Alliance opportunity. To wrap up and summarize turning to slide 24. We're seeing strong demand from secular drivers like digital transformation, work from home, the need for remote monitoring solutions for asset management remote support of frontline workers and growing interest in SaaS. We're in the right place at the right time. We've executed well during a challenging environment, delivering solid ARR growth and record bookings to close out the year. Our subscription transition is complete with a return to record ARR and revenue in FY '20. And we're expecting a free cash flow inflection in fiscal 2021 with continued strong free cash flow growth thereafter. We're confident that by aligning with market demand to build a strong pipeline, improving our execution to convert that pipeline to robust ARR growth and leveraging scale and business model efficiencies to drive even higher free cash flow growth is a recipe that will continue to create significant shareholder value for years to come. With that I'll turn it over to Kristian, who will take you through more details on the financial results and guidance.\nKristian Talvitie: Thanks, Jim and good afternoon everyone. Before I review our results, I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance and all growth rate references will be in constant currency. Let me start off with a brief review of our fourth quarter and full year results and then spend the balance of the call on our outlook for fiscal 2021. Turning to Slide 26. Fiscal '20 ARR of $1.27 billion increased 14% year-over-year or 11% on a constant currency basis, which was at the midpoint of guidance. As Jim noted earlier, we had very strong bookings performance in Q4. And consistent with recent trends we did see an uptick in ramp deals which we believe reflects a level of customer conservatism on the pace of their software deployment plans, given the current environment. The takeaway here is that even though our strong bookings outperformance didn't represent a meaningful change to fiscal 2020 ARR, it contributed to backlog in future periods, primarily fiscal 2022 and beyond. Fiscal 2020 new ACV grew 10% despite a year-over-year bookings decline in the high single digits due to the backlog we had entering the year. Churn of 8.6% was slightly higher than expected. Fiscal 2020 free cash flow of $214 million was slightly ahead of guidance. Note that free cash flow for the year includes approximately $52 million of restructuring and acquisition-related payments, as well as approximately $8 million of incremental interest paid before we retire the $500 million of 6% notes back in May. It's also worth pointing out that interest payments on our bonds are now in our second and fourth quarters, while previously they were in our first and third quarters. Fiscal 2020 revenue of $1.46 billion increased 17% year-over-year and was above guidance, driven by 27% recurring revenue growth. As we've discussed previously, revenue is impacted by ASC 606 and related business policy changes. For example, in Q4 contract durations were slightly longer than forecasted. And we had stronger-than-expected conversions, both of which positively impacted the amount of upfront subscription revenue recognized in the quarter. FX was also a modest revenue tailwind. Fiscal 2020 operating margin of 29% increased approximately 870 basis points over fiscal 2019. And lastly, EPS of $2.57 increased almost 60% year-on-year. Turning to page 27. I'll begin with our balance sheet. We ended fiscal 2020 with cash and marketable securities of $335 million and $1.02 billion of gross debt, including $1 billion of senior notes and $18 million outstanding on our revolving credit facility. Note that that outstanding balance of $18 million was paid down on October 27. We believe that this is an attractive and stable capital structure, especially in light of the current economic backdrop. Also please note that for your financial modeling, at the beginning in fiscal 2021 we have adopted a calendar quarter end financial reporting. Now turning to guidance. On slide 28, we highlight a few of our key guidance assumptions. In essence, based on Q4 performance and current outlook for 2021, we're expecting the macro environment to remain stable in the near term, with conditions improving in the second half of the fiscal year. So with that as context and turning to slide 29, we're expecting fiscal 2021 ARR of $1.39 billion to $1.42 billion. That's a growth rate of 9% to 12% on a constant currency basis. And regarding ARR seasonality, we would expect the growth rates to be fairly consistent each quarter throughout fiscal 2021. Free cash flow is expected to be approximately $340 million for the full year, growth of approximately 60% year-over-year. As we've said previously, fiscal 2021 free cash flow growth benefits from reduced interest, restructuring and acquisition-related payments. And regarding the linearity of free cash flow in fiscal 2021, we expect to generate more than 60% of our annual free cash flow in the first half. As collections are stronger in the first half, it will be offset by expenses increasing as we ramp hiring throughout the year. We expect Q1 free cash flow north of $100 million. With the incremental revolver debt paid off and free cash flow accelerating, we plan to address the stock repurchase program with our Board at our upcoming Board Meeting in November. And as a reminder fiscal 2021 free cash flow includes approximately $15 million of restructuring payments related primarily to the headquarter relocation as well as to the cost actions we took early in fiscal '20. Now turning to P&L guidance. We're expecting fiscal 2021 revenue of $1.55 billion to $1.6 billion. That's a growth rate of 6% to 10%. The decline in the revenue growth rate relative to fiscal '20 is related to the impact of ASC 606 and related business policy changes that benefited revenue growth last fiscal year. It has no impact on ARR or free cash flow as we continue to bill customers annually upfront. On the expense front, we're expecting operating expense growth of approximately 10% in fiscal 2021. We plan to start filling open headcount roles at a more normalized pace after hitting the pause button last year while tightly managing expenses throughout fiscal '20. We also expect other expenses like travel to increase as the global economy reopens. And we also expect some increase in variable compensation expense. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $2.65 to $2.85 that's growth of 3% to 11%. So wrapping up, we had solid financial performance in fiscal '20. We delivered our third consecutive year of double-digit ARR growth while maintaining discipline on our expense structure. And we are successfully navigating a very challenging macro environment. We began fiscal 2021 in a strong position to continue driving attractive top line growth and very strong free cash flow growth. With that I'll turn the call over to the operator to begin Q&A. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Your line is now open.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Yes, thank you. Good evening. Jim let me start with you and ask about what I think are still the two largest sources of revenue for you, namely your CAD active base and your PLM active base. And this is an industry trend question. Over the last couple of years there's been a very interesting phenomenon with Creo growing as quickly in terms of its active base as your principal peers have been doing after lagging your peers' growth as far as active base is concerned. So you're now with the rest of the group in that respect in the mid-single digits for Creo base growth. And so the question is, how are you thinking about the growth from here in the active base for Creo? And then similar question for the Windchill which has also been growing its base, it seems in about the mid-single digits, would you expect some acceleration in 2021 and beyond in the base? And for Kristian since you referred to hiring, I can't help but ask about that. It's been very clear that your open recs are well up from the trough back in the spring particularly for sales and service and R&D. Maybe walk us through how you're thinking about that reopening of the hiring aperture in terms of functions and geos and what it might mean for OpEx growth? \nJim Heppelmann: Okay. Jay I'll take the first part of that. So we showed last November was it when we had our Investor Day? We showed a model that said, if our bookings for CAD and PLM were to be flat then over the course of five years our growth rates would slow down from that low double-digit number to the kind of upper single digit almost mid-single-digit growth rate in the industry. That's if the bookings numbers are flat. But I think we do see an opportunity to do better than flat. We're winning -- we have very strong competitive products. We have new things to sell. For example in Creo, we have the Creo Simulation Live and pretty soon now the whole ANSYS suite behind that. We have this generative design stuff. We have AR the augmented reality technologies built into both Creo and Windchill. So I mean I think we feel like in the near term, we could slow down a bit in the next couple of years. But I think then, once you get to the midterm this Atlas project could be a real tailwind for growth. So I think that scenario that we showed last fall of slowing down to market growth, probably won't happen because I think that this Atlas SaaS-ification we call it of Creo and Windchill will actually be a growth driver using this Atlas platform that's kind of shared with Onshape. So we'll talk more about that naturally in the November time frame. But I think when you look at our growth rate versus others and one of our European peers reported results that were materially weaker than ours, I think we have really strong competitive products, I think we're in better verticals. For example, aerospace and defense is really defense for us in a strong way. We're in the medical device arena. And we have a business model that's terrific. It doesn't leak so much as others who don't have a recurring revenue model like we do. So I think there's just a collection of advantages that are allowing us for the third consecutive year and frankly forecasted into next year to continue to grow at rates materially higher than the balance of the market we compete against. Do you want to take the headcount question?\nKristian Talvitie: Is this part seven of the presentation?\nJim Heppelmann: Nine. \nKristian Talvitie: Part 9? Hey, you just put out a report was it yesterday or two days ago that laid out all the headcount like I don't even understand what the question is. I have to go to you to get the data on our own hiring plan. \nJay Vleeschhouwer: Well, no I guess the question is... \nKristian Talvitie: Yes. Let me try and articulate it this way. We are continuing to invest in the business. There's a fair amount of call it go to market-related, which includes customer success sales and marketing resources. And additionally, Jim talked a lot about some of the future technology that's being developed. That obviously requires talent as well. So R&D talent is really the \u2013 also a large pool of hiring for us for the year. I think at the same time we are cognizant of what's going on in the world around us. And we're \u2013 we've got plans to hire them throughout the year, but I think we'll maintain flexibility as well depending on how the macro environment continues to evolve and how that impacts us in the short term. But that's generally what we're trying to hire is folks that can build cool products for our customers and folks who can help customers extract value from that. \nJim Heppelmann: Yes. I think too let me add. When you look at our OpEx increase in fiscal 2021, it seems higher than you might expect. But frankly a lot of that is just cost that fell out of 2020 because of COVID. We're allowing room for it to come back in. So let me give you an example. We spend $40 million to $50 million a year in travel and that just went to zero. So most of FY 2020 had zero travel. But we're assuming in FY 2021 that, yes, we'd be back calling on customers and stuff like that and that would ramp. So a lot of the cost increase makes more sense, if you take the two years and average them, right? If you take the 2% or 3% OpEx growth in FY 2020 and the 10% in 2021 you add it together you get let's call it 13%. Okay average is 6.5%. Well 6.5% makes sense against the guidance of 9% to 12% ARR growth. That's the way you ought to look at it. It's not so much that we're spending a lot more. But that we're returning some of the spend or actually planning for some of the spend to come back as we go into FY 2021. \nKristian Talvitie: Perfect. Thanks very much .\nOperator: Our next question comes from Saket Kalia with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nKristian Talvitie: Hi, Saket.\nSaket Kalia: Okay. Great. Hi, guys. Hey, Kristain. Thanks for taking my question here. I'll just keep it to one. Jim, maybe for you. How did the IoT and AR businesses sort of trend towards the end of Q4? And to the extent you can sort of comment here at the beginning of Q1 I guess exiting last quarter, it sounded like just like everybody else it was kind of difficult to sell into some of your end customers, just because of things like factory closing. So curious how things sort of evolved at the end of Q4, and how they're sort of looking now? \nJim Heppelmann: Well, let me tell you when we started Q4 the -- what we call the beginning of the quarter forecast had a what we call a wedge in it versus a hedge. No, I'm sorry a hedge versus the wedge I said that wrong. Meaning, we were actually taking it down from the roll-ups and saying the roll-ups look nice coming from the field, but we have this COVID thing going out there we should be conservative. But actually the roll-ups were higher than the forecast. So what happened throughout the course of the quarter is we raised the forecast four times internally. So I think we saw building strength throughout the quarter. It wasn't just like a Hail Mary pass at the end although frankly a lot of business did come in at the end. But we had raised the quarter or raised the forecast three times in the month of September alone prior to the last week. So I think we just saw a building strength, and yes a lot of it was IoT and AR, but frankly a lot of it was PLM as well. I mean, we had a bang-up PLM quarter, but we also had very, very good IoT and AR quarter.\nSaket Kalia: Got it. Makes sense. Thanks guys.\nJim Heppelmann : Thanks, Saket.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Celino with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nJason Celino : Hey, thanks guys for taking the question here.\nJim Heppelmann: Hi, Jason.\nJason Celino : So we talked a little bit about the funnel for the -- for IoT and in AR. It seems like it's really ticked up at least at the beginning of the pandemic. And you -- and it looks like Q4 things are back on track. Maybe can you talk about how we should think about sales cycles? What is the typical sales cycle look like now that things might be opening up? Would that be any different?\nJim Heppelmann: Yes. I think most of our AR sales cycles are less than two quarters. And then most of our IoT sales cycles tend to be more three and four, because it's a kind of bigger more complex enterprise system. It's a system of record, it requires some amount of implementation and weaving into the physical side of the business and so forth. So let me just say though the IoT pipeline is good and the AR pipeline is fantastic. And part of the places that some of those sales and marketing resources are going to is to make sure for example in AR that we can actually keep up in that pipeline, because there's so much interest and our competitive advantage is so strong. I mean, if you go look at the Magic Quadrant-type reports, which we'll show you in December if you haven't seen them recently. I mean, we are miles ahead of everybody in this field of industrial AR, and there's just a huge level of interest. So we just want to make sure we're in place actually to execute on it, because again, that interest won't hang around forever if we don't service it. So that's where some of the investment is going. Thanks.\nJason Celino: Thank you. I\u2019ll stick to one.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Borg with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nJim Heppelmann: Hey, Adam.\nAdam Borg: Hey, guys, and thanks for taking the question. Maybe just two quick ones for me. First one Jim, maybe a bigger picture question. So, nice to see the Rockwell partnership being extended another two years. It would be great if you could comment on maybe the one or two focus areas of the partnership for this year and how you're thinking about that playing out. And then maybe just for Kristian churn, obviously, you're talking about 100 basis points of improvement next year off of some worsening trend this year. Maybe talk about what are the low-hanging fruit? And what are the drivers of the trend improvement? Thanks so much.\nJim Heppelmann: Yes. On the Rockwell contract just to add a little more color. I mean, we extended that early, because both salespeople and customers want certainty that by the time a campaign completes that the partnership is still in full force, right? I mean, you wouldn't want to start a three-quarter sales cycle in the back half of the year if that contract wasn't extended. So we really did it just to take any fear out and because it's a great partnership and we're both committed to it. There were some other changes we wanted to make, while we had the hood open, for example, throwing some more products in there and so forth. But the real thing was it's a great partnership. Let's not scare anybody by letting it come too close to the sun here where it looks like it might expire. So where are we going to focus? I think it's the same place we've been focusing. Rockwell has some real momentum with our products and they're really selling them into their strong suites. Their food and beverage, their North American automotive, their various different materials and oil and gas probably that's a little more challenged at the moment. But it's really Rockwell taking our technology into their very large customer base and really doing the smart factory kind of thing, where they add software this IoT and AR type of software to all the other products that Rockwell has both software and hardware and really build the whole smart factory strategy. So I think that's where we'll continue to focus. It doesn't represent a change. Adding PLM and Onshape, I think is interesting. I don't think that will become central to the partnership. It really is an IoT and AR partnership. But they see some opportunities around Onshape. We showed some examples of how, you could use Onshape for factory design, during our LiveWorx presentation during my keynote. And then for PLM, they have a PLM capability. Now that's quite impressive in Kalypso. And they see some opportunities they want to be able to go after.\nKristian Talvitie: Hey Adam, it's Kristian. So on, the churn question. I think first I'd start off by saying, relative to last year in fiscal 2020 we only saw about, 100 basis point degradation in churn, which I think in general, speaks to the very sticky nature of the software that we sell right? And the value that customers are getting from it. And frankly, even a significant piece of that increase was really down to a couple of customers -- larger customers that were known churn, that went into this year. So, point number one being, we don't -- we didn't really see any meaningful change in churn activity, as a result of the pandemic, at least not yet. Number two, as we're talking earlier about the hiring plans, one of the things that I mentioned was customer success. That's one area that we are going to be, continuing to invest in. And we expect that that will also have a positive impact throughout the year. And then, additionally, we started late this or late in fiscal 2020, actually offering multiyear renewal terms to customers, which previously had not been a policy. It's one of the policies when we talk about, ASC 606 and related business policy changes. That's another example of a business policy change, which we believe also would continue to help reduce churn. So when we talk about 100 basis points of churn improvement, that's really just getting us back to last year's levels. And we think that's an achievable target.\nAdam Borg: Great. Thanks so much.\nKristian Talvitie: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Broome with Mizuho. Your line is now open.\nMatthew Broome: Hi. Thanks very much. Hi, Jim, Kristian and Tim and congrats on the results, by the way, so just on the Rockwell partnership, will Rockwell be increasing the number of quota-carrying reps assigned to selling PTC solutions? And then, will there be any changes to PTC's sales organization now that it sounds like you'll be selling more of Rockwell software?\nJim Heppelmann: Yes. So let me say, Rockwell's earnings call is next week or maybe even the week after. And I'd probably prefer to defer to them. But let me say certainly the partnership contemplates strong continued growth. And normally associated with strong continued growth, one would continue to make go-to-market investments. But let me defer that question to them, so I don't steal any of their thunder. And then on the PTC side. I mean, I think, we -- what we really have gained access to is this Emulate3D. I don't think that's central to what we're trying to do. But I think we are interested in trying to figure out, how to better integrate that with Onshape. And at least have it as a weapon in the arsenal. But I don't think we're going to pivot hard toward that. I think we have more pipeline than we can keep up with in CAD, PLM, IoT and AR and Onshape. So -- but anyway, it's a weapon in the arsenal that we can pull out, if we find the right opportunity. And we've certainly seen such opportunities over time. This company Emulate3D that Rockwell acquired actually had been on our acquisition list too. So its technology we're interested in, but we got a lot on our plate, at the same time. So we'll call on it opportunistically.\nMatthew Broome: Okay. Make sense. Thanks very much.\nKristian Talvitie: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Vruwink with Baird. Your line is now open.\nKristian Talvitie: Hi Joe.\nJoe Vruwink: Great. Hi everyone. I just wanted to maybe talk about the recent bookings environment. And if we have maybe gotten the forecast for fiscal 2021, I don't know a month or two ago. What would have been different about it? So in other words, it sounds like, your internal plans have moved up as the quarter went on. You're getting some recovery in pieces of the business that were negatively impacted in FY 2020. That all seems to be good. At the same time we might be about to revisit an environment with certain economies closing that could have an impact on new bookings activity. So I'm just wondering kind of the puts and takes in arriving at ARR growth of 9% to 12%, which is kind of a similar number. Kristian, I think you were even talking about it at the beginning of September. Just a give and take and how you think about FY 2021?\nJim Heppelmann: Okay. Joe, let me \u2013 this is Jim. Let me take a high level let's call it qualitative pass at this. And Kristian if you want to add any quantitative numbers too you can. In the case of FSG, that's a business where for example one of the big properties is Servigistics. Spare parts management and airlines is the largest industry we sell into or one of the largest. So that's had some pressure as airlines were in deep trouble and whatnot. I think if we see modest low single-digit improvement in ARR for Servigistics or let's say for all of FSG, FSG will still be down versus 2019, right? So we're not really expecting miracles there. We're just saying we see some things happening that will be slightly helpful. Now as you go to the rest of it, the real thing is the pipeline. First of all we've become much better at managing the pipeline. And right now we have a very optimistic looking pipeline and not just for Q1. I mean really for the whole year and really for each of the main segments CAD, PLM IoT and AR and really for each of the main geographies. So we have a lot of pipeline. Now we don't have a crystal ball as to what could happen with COVID. Lockdowns could hurt. Although, honestly, we feel like we're locked down and I think most of our customers feel to me like they're locked down already. I mean their production people are showing up to work in the factories but the people we're selling to really are pretty much working from home. More let's say on the knowledge worker side of the business. So I don't know what lockdowns will mean. I kind of think we're in lockdown mode. Yes restaurants are open but that's fine. We're not selling to restaurants. We're selling to manufacturing companies. So I don't know what that will mean. I think Kristian was clear though that our assumption is that life will be kind of like it is now in the near-term and improving somewhat in the back half of our year. If COVID does something radical and it's radically different than that yes, okay, we're going to have to have a different set of assumptions. But we're only working with kind of what we have.\nKristian Talvitie: Yes. I don't \u2013 I mean, I don't have anything to add to that Jim. Okay. Unless there's a specific question Joe you're trying to get at.\nJoe Vruwink: No. No I'm just looking for more color. If I can squeeze one more in and it goes back Jim to a comment you made at the very beginning. We don't see your backlog but it sounds like there's actually a pretty high amount of visibility in the backlog just given some of the ramp deal structures that give you confidence. And the question you talked about this year being a 500 basis point departure from plan, next year a 200 basis point departure and then FY 2022 having no departure. So is that...\nJim Heppelmann: Let me link those comments to backlog. I was really talking about backlog as I look forward to 2021 and beyond. When I said is there's a 200 basis points or two percentage points headwind to our growth in FY 2021, which is contemplated in our guidance by the way, really because the backlog is down, entering the year. But if you look at the backlog for the year after that, it's right where it should be, in part because of the booking strength we saw, particularly in the fourth quarter. So right now, we don't have a FY 2022 deficit in our backlog chart. But we do have one that will cost us about two points in FY 2021. Two points of growth, you can run the math, that's what the backlog differential is.\nJoe Vruwink: Okay. Thank you.\nJim Heppelmann: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Your line is now open. \nAndrew Obin: Hi, guys. Good afternoon. \nJim Heppelmann: Hey, Andrew.\nAndrew Obin: Just a bigger picture question. I guess, you started to talk about adding sort of Atlas functionality to Creo and Windchill. So as you, sort of, think over the next couple of years what is the investment cycle? What does the rollout look like? When should it peak? When should it start moving the needle in terms of the numbers? Because we've been getting a lot of questions on that particular area actually. \nJim Heppelmann: Yes. I mean we're going to give you a little more insight again in December, but let me kind of just paint the highest level picture. We think the industry is going to SaaS. And with Onshape we're leading the charge. But we'd like to bring our customer base that's on Creo and Windchill along for the ride. So we're saying what if we developed using the Atlas kernel if you will or architecture of Onshape, what if we developed versions of Creo and Windchill that kind of acted a lot like Onshape in terms of being true multi-tenant, multiuser SaaS. But at the same time, we're compatible so that you could do a lift and shift of an on-premise deployment into the SaaS cloud. Now that will take us a couple of years to build to be frank because if you're talking about compatibility then you need pin for pin feature capability, right? We're not talking about building a new product with limited functionality. We're really talking about full on versions of Creo and Windchill so that you could lift the production deployment shift it into the SaaS cloud and never miss a beat. When it's -- or why it's interesting is because that lift and shift typically doubles the ARR.  Because a subscription on-premise seat generally doubles in value when it becomes a subscription SaaS seat because you save the servers and the administration and the upgrades and lots of different things. So I think you should model that kind of in the back half of a five-year window and well beyond by the way. I think it's something that would probably run for I don't know it could be a decade. And -- but it will take us a while to get it going. So I'm not counting on anything there in 2021 and probably not even anything in 2022. And we'll keep you posted. We've got a lot of work to do. \nAndrew Obin: Got you. And just a follow-up question on site access. So you did highlight that you started seeing better results in industrial IoT in September. How related was it to actually being able to gain site access to your customers? And are you seeing any impact particularly in Europe from sort of the announcements of lockdowns in Europe in terms of actual site access? \nJim Heppelmann: Well the lockdowns in Europe of course happened just lately. So I wouldn't have seen that in Q4 in any case. But I think it was helpful. Now we did have a pickup in Europe, but the real pickup was in the U.S. And we were able to reengage customers and customers send people back into their plants to get these projects going and so forth. And it was based a lot on expansions, but also we called out some real interesting new wins competitive wins where companies said, okay, let's get this initiative going and make a selection and get back to work. So we did see some of that in Q4. Again the interest level in our IoT software remains very high. And what happened in the fourth quarter is the close rate went up to a more kind of normalized close rate than we were seeing, let's say, in Q2 and Q3. \nAndrew Obin: Great, answer. Thanks for answering my question. Thanks a lot.\nJim Heppelmann: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. \nSterling Auty: Yes. Thanks. Hi, guys. You mentioned improvement in pipeline management. I'm curious what were the changes that you made that drove the improvement? And now that you're in the new fiscal year what are the biggest changes that you've made to the sales and go-to-market mode for this fiscal year? \nJim Heppelmann: Yes. Well on the pipeline thing about a year ago, we hired a Chief Pipeline Officer, which really was somebody whose job it is to really watch the pipeline and make sure we're doing the right things to build it out. So this Chief Pipeline Officer maintains a six-quarter rolling view of the pipeline by segment, by geo, by sales channel you name it. So at any point in time, I have a dashboard that says, how does the pipeline look for CAD in Europe three quarters from now? I can tell you that. And there's a goal for how CAD in Europe three quarters from now should look as compared to what is the forecast or the plan for CAD in Europe three quarters from now. So we really have a level of data that is unprecedented here at PTC. And therefore, we have a level of proactiveness that's unprecedented because we know. For example, we might say, PLM in Japan is soft four quarters out. Get on it. We need to run some marketing promotions, we need to do this, we need to do that. We also know where to put resources. So, in terms of hiring and whatnot. We've done a lot of hiring, for example, into AR because this pipeline is so big, and we're worried about whether or not it will age out and disappear if we can't tend to it. But let me say going into the year on -- in terms of go-to-market configuration, no big changes. No big new players, no big reorganizations. It's really just keep doing what we're doing, because it's working pretty well. It came off the best quarter of sales we ever had. And it's working well to link sales and marketing in a digital go-to-market motion. We learned a lot in the last year. It wasn't wasted at all in that respect.\nKristian Talvitie: Yes. Just adding on that, I mean I think the go-to-market teams have done a remarkable job of figuring out how to leverage virtual selling environment, right and actually adapt and thrive in it. So, I think that will be a complementary model going forward.\nJim Heppelmann: Yes, much more efficient. I think you all know this, but if you travel with airplane tickets and rental cars and hotel rooms to make sales calls, you don't get that many sales calls made. And to the extent you can do that through a video call, it's very, very productive. And we came up with some really interesting ideas. For example, we've shifted our customer experience center, which was designed for customers to come to into more like a broadcast studio. So that we could do high-quality events with the customer online, but us not in our living rooms at home, but actually like you're watching the TV news practically. I mean it looks really impressive. And then, if you're there, it looks kind of strange, because you realize it's a studio. But we're doing things like that that really make it a much more powerful scalable and efficient go-to-market model. I really want to stress, for years, I was pushing -- so is Kristian, for selling to be more digital. And it was hard, but it suddenly got very easy and everybody embraced it, because the options were taken away.\nSterling Auty: Yes, exactly. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.\nKristian Talvitie: Yes.\nJim Heppelmann: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Valera with Needham & Company. Your line is open.\nJim Heppelmann: Hey, Rich.\nKristian Talvitie: Hey, Rich.\nRich Valera: Thank you. Hi, hi, guys. So Jim, when we were talking back in the, I guess, sort of mid-fourth quarter, when you talked about the pipeline for your AR products being multiples of historical levels. I think at that point maybe it wasn't clear what your close rates were going to be on this very strong pipeline. And based on how the quarter turned out, it sounds like maybe they started to accelerate or were pretty good. So, just wondering if you can provide any color on sort of the AR pipeline buildup, where it stands versus historical, and then maybe what you've learned and how you've started to close on that pipeline.\nJim Heppelmann: Yes. Well, Rich, I mean, if you've been in and around enterprise software for a while, you know that kind of like rule of thumb is that for every $1 you have in the forecast, you ought to have $3 in the pipeline. And sometimes it's $2 and sometimes it's $4. If you have numbers that are closer to $10, it tells you something. It tells you that you don't have enough capacity or you're not qualifying enough or you have product problems or I mean whatever. So, it also tells you have low close rates, right? Because if you didn't take the forecast up and you sit there with all that coverage somehow you -- by mathematically, you're not doing an effective job closing that pipeline. So, we have very high levels of coverage in AR. I mean -- and by the way in Onshape too very high. And so, we are trying to both understand what it takes to increase the close rate. And we made some progress, but it isn't near that 3:1 ratio, but we're also bringing in more resources. So we're making good progress and it led to pretty good results all of last year, especially in Q4 of last year. And we have a strong plan for AR this year. I mean, this is a business. It's a hyper-growth business. It has some real legs and we're pretty excited about it. Just trying to figure out how to make sure we don't leave anything behind.\nRich Valera: Great. And just for Kristian quick clarification. The reason you're able to close that 200 basis point headwind -- growth headwind in F 2022 is because of the ramp deal, is that right? Why you've got the 200 basis point headwind F 2021, but not in F 2022 I just wanted to clarify that?\nKristian Talvitie: Yes. And I think we tried to articulate that. A lot of the overperformance that we saw in -- even in Q4 relative to our original forecast actually created backlog, primarily for fiscal 2022 and beyond. So it's -- yes, its ramped deals going out that far as customers... \nJim Heppelmann: Yes. Let me just step through that. If a sales rep closed the deal late in Q4, there was a ramp. A little bit in the first year a little bit more in the second more in the third. While if they closed it in Q4, the start date is almost certainly in Q1. And then the ramps would typically ramp on the anniversary of the start date. So that deal closed in Q4 of 2020 did nothing for 2020. It will do a little bit for 2021 and a lot for 2022 and possibly even more for 2023. I mean that's how these ramps work. So what we're saying is we have a 2 point -- two percentage points against the $1.2-ish billion $1.250 billion of ARR $25 million air gap if you will in pipeline going into fiscal 2021. But if you say well how does the pipeline look for fiscal 2022 compared to how it should look right now, the answer is it looks fine.\nRich Valera: Hey, thanks. Thanks gentlemen.\nJim Heppelmann: Yes.\nKristian Talvitie: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Tim Fox for closing remarks.\nTim Fox: Thanks, Joelle. And everybody thanks for joining us today on the call. PTC will be participating in a number of virtual events this quarter. We'll be posting those details on our investor website. And we hopefully look forward to seeing you on the conference circuit or at our Investor Day on December 15. And once again thanks for your interest in PTC and have a great evening.\nJim Heppelmann: Thank you everybody. Bye-bye.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kristian Talvitie",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim and good afternoon everyone. Before I review our results, I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance and all growth rate references will be in constant currency. Let me start off with a brief review of our fourth quarter and full year results and then spend the balance of the call on our outlook for fiscal 2021. Turning to Slide 26. Fiscal '20 ARR of $1.27 billion increased 14% year-over-year or 11% on a constant currency basis, which was at the midpoint of guidance. As Jim noted earlier, we had very strong bookings performance in Q4. And consistent with recent trends we did see an uptick in ramp deals which we believe reflects a level of customer conservatism on the pace of their software deployment plans, given the current environment. The takeaway here is that even though our strong bookings outperformance didn't represent a meaningful change to fiscal 2020 ARR, it contributed to backlog in future periods, primarily fiscal 2022 and beyond. Fiscal 2020 new ACV grew 10% despite a year-over-year bookings decline in the high single digits due to the backlog we had entering the year. Churn of 8.6% was slightly higher than expected. Fiscal 2020 free cash flow of $214 million was slightly ahead of guidance. Note that free cash flow for the year includes approximately $52 million of restructuring and acquisition-related payments, as well as approximately $8 million of incremental interest paid before we retire the $500 million of 6% notes back in May. It's also worth pointing out that interest payments on our bonds are now in our second and fourth quarters, while previously they were in our first and third quarters. Fiscal 2020 revenue of $1.46 billion increased 17% year-over-year and was above guidance, driven by 27% recurring revenue growth. As we've discussed previously, revenue is impacted by ASC 606 and related business policy changes. For example, in Q4 contract durations were slightly longer than forecasted. And we had stronger-than-expected conversions, both of which positively impacted the amount of upfront subscription revenue recognized in the quarter. FX was also a modest revenue tailwind. Fiscal 2020 operating margin of 29% increased approximately 870 basis points over fiscal 2019. And lastly, EPS of $2.57 increased almost 60% year-on-year. Turning to page 27. I'll begin with our balance sheet. We ended fiscal 2020 with cash and marketable securities of $335 million and $1.02 billion of gross debt, including $1 billion of senior notes and $18 million outstanding on our revolving credit facility. Note that that outstanding balance of $18 million was paid down on October 27. We believe that this is an attractive and stable capital structure, especially in light of the current economic backdrop. Also please note that for your financial modeling, at the beginning in fiscal 2021 we have adopted a calendar quarter end financial reporting. Now turning to guidance. On slide 28, we highlight a few of our key guidance assumptions. In essence, based on Q4 performance and current outlook for 2021, we're expecting the macro environment to remain stable in the near term, with conditions improving in the second half of the fiscal year. So with that as context and turning to slide 29, we're expecting fiscal 2021 ARR of $1.39 billion to $1.42 billion. That's a growth rate of 9% to 12% on a constant currency basis. And regarding ARR seasonality, we would expect the growth rates to be fairly consistent each quarter throughout fiscal 2021. Free cash flow is expected to be approximately $340 million for the full year, growth of approximately 60% year-over-year. As we've said previously, fiscal 2021 free cash flow growth benefits from reduced interest, restructuring and acquisition-related payments. And regarding the linearity of free cash flow in fiscal 2021, we expect to generate more than 60% of our annual free cash flow in the first half. As collections are stronger in the first half, it will be offset by expenses increasing as we ramp hiring throughout the year. We expect Q1 free cash flow north of $100 million. With the incremental revolver debt paid off and free cash flow accelerating, we plan to address the stock repurchase program with our Board at our upcoming Board Meeting in November. And as a reminder fiscal 2021 free cash flow includes approximately $15 million of restructuring payments related primarily to the headquarter relocation as well as to the cost actions we took early in fiscal '20. Now turning to P&L guidance. We're expecting fiscal 2021 revenue of $1.55 billion to $1.6 billion. That's a growth rate of 6% to 10%. The decline in the revenue growth rate relative to fiscal '20 is related to the impact of ASC 606 and related business policy changes that benefited revenue growth last fiscal year. It has no impact on ARR or free cash flow as we continue to bill customers annually upfront. On the expense front, we're expecting operating expense growth of approximately 10% in fiscal 2021. We plan to start filling open headcount roles at a more normalized pace after hitting the pause button last year while tightly managing expenses throughout fiscal '20. We also expect other expenses like travel to increase as the global economy reopens. And we also expect some increase in variable compensation expense. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $2.65 to $2.85 that's growth of 3% to 11%. So wrapping up, we had solid financial performance in fiscal '20. We delivered our third consecutive year of double-digit ARR growth while maintaining discipline on our expense structure. And we are successfully navigating a very challenging macro environment. We began fiscal 2021 in a strong position to continue driving attractive top line growth and very strong free cash flow growth. With that I'll turn the call over to the operator to begin Q&A. Is this part seven of the presentation? Part 9? Hey, you just put out a report was it yesterday or two days ago that laid out all the headcount like I don't even understand what the question is. I have to go to you to get the data on our own hiring plan. Yes. Let me try and articulate it this way. We are continuing to invest in the business. There's a fair amount of call it go to market-related, which includes customer success sales and marketing resources. And additionally, Jim talked a lot about some of the future technology that's being developed. That obviously requires talent as well. So R&D talent is really the \u2013 also a large pool of hiring for us for the year. I think at the same time we are cognizant of what's going on in the world around us. And we're \u2013 we've got plans to hire them throughout the year, but I think we'll maintain flexibility as well depending on how the macro environment continues to evolve and how that impacts us in the short term. But that's generally what we're trying to hire is folks that can build cool products for our customers and folks who can help customers extract value from that. Perfect. Thanks very much . Hi, Saket. Hey Adam, it's Kristian. So on, the churn question. I think first I'd start off by saying, relative to last year in fiscal 2020 we only saw about, 100 basis point degradation in churn, which I think in general, speaks to the very sticky nature of the software that we sell right? And the value that customers are getting from it. And frankly, even a significant piece of that increase was really down to a couple of customers -- larger customers that were known churn, that went into this year. So, point number one being, we don't -- we didn't really see any meaningful change in churn activity, as a result of the pandemic, at least not yet. Number two, as we're talking earlier about the hiring plans, one of the things that I mentioned was customer success. That's one area that we are going to be, continuing to invest in. And we expect that that will also have a positive impact throughout the year. And then, additionally, we started late this or late in fiscal 2020, actually offering multiyear renewal terms to customers, which previously had not been a policy. It's one of the policies when we talk about, ASC 606 and related business policy changes. That's another example of a business policy change, which we believe also would continue to help reduce churn. So when we talk about 100 basis points of churn improvement, that's really just getting us back to last year's levels. And we think that's an achievable target. Thank you. Thank you. Hi Joe. Yes. I don't \u2013 I mean, I don't have anything to add to that Jim. Okay. Unless there's a specific question Joe you're trying to get at. Yes. Just adding on that, I mean I think the go-to-market teams have done a remarkable job of figuring out how to leverage virtual selling environment, right and actually adapt and thrive in it. So, I think that will be a complementary model going forward. Yes. Hey, Rich. Yes. And I think we tried to articulate that. A lot of the overperformance that we saw in -- even in Q4 relative to our original forecast actually created backlog, primarily for fiscal 2022 and beyond. So it's -- yes, its ramped deals going out that far as customers... Thank you."

            "name": "Jim Heppelmann",
            "content": "Thanks Tim. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. I hope you and your families continue to stay safe and well during this crisis. Before jumping into our quarter and year-end review, I'd like to begin by sharing several pieces of new news that we announced earlier this afternoon. Turning to slide four, we're very pleased to announce that PTC and Rockwell Automation have extended our strategic partnership by two additional years which cements the alliance in place through fiscal 2023. We have also broadened the partnership beyond IoT and AR to include PLM and Onshape. Back in May, Rockwell acquired Kalypso, a professional services company who has been a strong PLM and IoT partner of PTC for years. Kalypso gives Rockwell increased capabilities to pursue digital threat initiatives so the scope of our agreement has been broadened to embrace those pursuits. The agreement has other changes that better encourage sales cooperation give PTC access to Rockwell's Emulate3D factory simulation software and naturally it contemplates continued growth through fiscal 2023. The alliance has expanded our reach and our capabilities as intended while providing Rockwell with access to best-in-class Industry 4.0 software technology, the agreement has allowed PTC to address significant white space in the market. Rockwell has introduced PTC technology into more than 250 sizable companies across 45 countries to date. And 70% represent new logos to PTC. Rockwell has quickly become one of PTC's biggest and most important partners. Blake Moret, the Chairman and CEO of Rockwell Automation shares my view that this extension is a big win for both companies. Turning now to slide five, we also announced earlier today that we'll be hosting a virtual Investor Day on December 15th. We'll be reviewing our strategy, secular growth drivers in our markets, our broad solutions portfolio, and how we're taking those solutions to market. Kristian will also review progress of our very attractive financial model. Given that upcoming event, we plan to keep this call focused on Q4 and fiscal 2020 results and on fiscal 2021 guidance. We hope you can join us for the event in December. With that I'd like to turn to slide six and spend a few minutes describing what we see the three key elements of our strategy to deliver long-term shareholder value. It starts by aligning with market demand so we can build a strong pipeline. Then optimizing new and renewal sales and customer success to power the top line ARR growth. Finally, creating an efficient business model and operation that allows PTC to drive the bottom line free cash flow growth even faster. This will be PTC's new framework for describing our business strategy, operations and results here as we head into fiscal 2021. First on market demand. Fiscal 2020 will no doubt be remembered as one of the most unique and challenging times PTC has faced over our 35-year history. I fundamentally believe we'll look back at the last year as a pivotal moment for PTC. Pivotal in the sense that our suite of software solutions, which have been driving significant value from customers before the pandemic, have now become even more mission critical. Years back, we had anticipated a growing need for the types of capabilities PTC has been investing in, but COVID has certainly accelerated demand for them. Digital transformation initiatives across the industrial space are accelerating as companies adjust to this new normal way of doing business. The importance of solutions that enable work from home, global team and supply chain collaboration, remote asset management, remote frontline worker training and support have never been higher. For PTC, this translates into more demand for PLM, for IoT, for AR and for SaaS. What we're seeing in our pipeline, which stands at record levels confirms that PTC is in a strong position. Regarding the top line, necessity is the mother of invention and work from home has pushed PTC to dramatically accelerate our digital marketing and sales capabilities. I'm very pleased to report that we delivered strong Q4 bookings, up from the previous high-water mark in Q4 of 2019, which is even more impressive when you consider the state of the global economy and the fact that our sales teams were constrained to virtual operations. I feel like we've made more progress adopting digital go-to-market in the last 6 months than in the previous 5 years. With the subscription transition in the rearview mirror, we have successfully crossed the proverbial valley of death and are back to record levels of ARR and revenue. Now we're enjoying the top line stability and the higher rates of growth and higher margins that led us to undertake that difficult 5-year journey. As proof, fiscal 2020 marked the third consecutive year of double-digit ARR growth for PTC, despite the extreme volatility of PMIs and the macro environment that occurred during that same time frame. Now more than 90% of our revenue is software and 98% of that software revenue is recurring. I'm so pleased with this outcome. It came just-in-time for COVID. Finally, in the bottom line category, our EPS and free cash flow were both above guidance. As Kristian will detail a little later, our fiscal 2021 free cash flow guidance represents another new high-water mark for PTC. This is driven by strong ARR growth and the passing of several short-term free cash flow headwinds that held us back in fiscal 2020, but are now fading as we go into fiscal 2021 allowing our true earnings power to shine through. Altogether, PTC is very fortunate to have industry-leading technology that's well aligned with secular growth drivers, vastly improved digital go-to-market capabilities and in a sustainable and efficient recurring software business model. With that let me turn to slide 7 and touch on a few key financial highlights. ARR of $1.27 billion represents growth of 14% or 11% at constant currency, which was the midpoint of our guidance range. To put the COVID-19 impact into context fiscal 2020 ARR growth was about 500 basis points below our pre-COVID internal plan, due to bookings pressures and modestly elevated churn resulting from the pandemic. At this point, we see a smaller 200 basis point headwind to fiscal 2021 ARR growth. And as of now, no headwind to fiscal 2022 and beyond. Overall, we're very pleased with our fiscal 2020 financial results and excited about our fiscal 2021 guidance. And I believe that PTC is positioned to do even better in coming years. There's a lot of shareholder value creation that lies ahead of us. With that as context, let's take a look at the respective contributions of the FSG, Core and Growth business segments of our portfolio. Moving to slide 8. You'll see that ARR growth declined modestly in our FSG business but was strong in our much larger Core business and accelerated in our fast-growing Growth business. Recall that our Focused Solutions Group which we position as a lower growth cash cow has exposure to industries heavily impacted by COVID-19 in particular retailers and airlines. Our FSG products remain very competitive and we're expecting FSG to recover to low single-digit growth again in fiscal 2021 as economic conditions in those segments improve. At the same time, we're very pleased with the 11% growth of our Core business, which continues to materially outpace the market growth rate. Q4 was the 12th consecutive quarter that our core ARR growth rate has been in double-digits. Meanwhile our growth business had a very strong quarter and year, with growth trending back to the levels we want to see. ThingWorx, Vuforia and Onshape, all posted impressive results in Q4, but Vuforia and Onshape have really been strong all year. It's worth noting that ARR of our growth business has now surpassed that of FSG, which creates a tailwind of growth for the entire portfolio. Let's go a click deeper into the main elements of our core and growth segments. Turning to slide 9, our CAD team delivered a solid quarter with ARR growth in the high-single-digits. Across geos, APAC, once again delivered strong results and the overall demand environment improved sequentially in the Americas and stabilized in Europe. Overall CAD renewals remained healthy with churn improving quarter-over-quarter. We're excited to be launching the next release of Creo 7.0 in the coming months, which incorporates our first Atlas-based offering. Creo generative design extension or GDX, as we call it, leverages our Frustum generative design technology with the compute offloaded to a pure SaaS Atlas environment from where it is served to both Creo and Onshape. Also in this next Creo release, we'll be launching the mainstream high fidelity simulation capabilities from ANSYS, fully integrated with Creo, creating another highly differentiated leg of growth for our CAD business. Speaking of ANSYS, we had solid results from Creo Simulation Live, our CAD solution that embeds real-time simulation from ANSYS, which delivered its second highest bookings quarter to date. We continue to see interest across a wide variety of verticals, like automotive, medical device, industrials and in the high-tech space. On Slide 10, we highlight a great high-tech CSL win with NVIDIA. This is a classic example of how traditional design and simulation processes impact time to market. Creo Simulation Live provides NVIDIA engineers with real-time control of design direction, allowing a more refined design handoff to analysts, resulting in reduced rework, faster time to market and improved work processes. We're pleased with CSL's traction in the market and look forward to launching new marketing programs in the coming quarters. Moving on to slide 11 in our PLM business, you'll see that PLM continued to deliver strong performance with mid-teens ARR growth in Q4 and for the full year. In fact, the PLM team beat their pre-COVID sales goal for the full year. From a geographic perspective in Q4, PLM performance was broad-based with double-digit growth across all three major geographies led by the APAC region. From a vertical perspective, our PLM team continues to win big in the medical device space and in A&D. Turning to Slide 12, a great proof point in the life sciences arena was a major competitive displacement at Baxter International. What started as a point solution opportunity for product requirements management expanded into a full-blown digital thread enterprise engagement. Baxter was operating with disparate independent systems and processes, which was negatively impacting regulatory cycle times. By adopting PTC's broad suite of Windchill PLM solutions, Baxter's consolidating its footprint into a single enterprise system and transforming from document-centric to part-centric processes, resulting in a 4,500-seat competitive displacement. You'll see on slide 13 that we had a great win at TE Connectivity. In this case, TE was using a highly customized incumbent system for technical document distribution. By leveraging ThingWorx Navigate and seamlessly integrating with Windchill PLM and other enterprise systems, TE will deliver content to 20,000 users across functions like purchasing, supply chain, planning and manufacturing planning. Moving on to our Growth business, I'll begin with IoT on slide 14. While IoT ARR was impacted in fiscal 2020 from the new logo headwinds we described earlier in the year, we were pleased to see IoT bookings double sequentially in Q4, which benefited from some pent-up demand following macro slowdowns midyear, but also benefited from a number of significant wins in the quarter. Once again the standout IoT vertical in the quarter was medical device industry, which has experienced less economic disruption during the crisis. We also had very strong performance in the Americas with bookings more than doubling sequentially. We were also pleased to receive further validation of PTC's strong IoT market position by the industry analyst community. Just last week PTC was named a leader in the 2020 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Industrial IoT Platforms. This is a particularly special award given Gartner's rigorous and in-depth evaluation process and the strong influence that Gartner has in our market. On slide 15 we have an example of ThingWorx in action at Stanley Black & Decker, one of the most venerable manufacturing brands in the industrial tool and hardware markets. Stanley has been on a multiyear digital transformation journey with PTC and we were pleased to expand this relationship in Q4. Leveraging ThingWorx applications to expose data across previously disconnected assets, Stanley is driving significant improvements in OEE, overall equipment effectiveness across their global manufacturing footprint. Turning to slide 16. Bridgestone is another SCO customer that's had great success leveraging ThingWorx Analytics, the embedded machine learning engine to provide real-time insights into its production environment to drive operational efficiencies, improve throughput and improve quality all at scale. Let me shift to our AR business on slide 17. The Vuforia augmented reality team delivered very strong results in Q4 with bookings up 50% year-over-year. The AR team landed a nice seven-figure deal in the largest deal to date in Europe. We also saw a significant increase in the number of six-figure deals with 18 in the quarter, doubling the previous high-water mark. The large deal acceleration is a testament to the success of our up-sell strategy. Customers are starting to adopt our entry-level AR solution Vuforia Chalk and then identifying more sophisticated AR use cases, which we addressed with Vuforia Studio and Vuforia Expert Capture. These advanced solutions are tailor-made for the remote work situation that our industrial customers are currently navigating. We had two notable wins in Q4 that highlighted the broader value -- or the value of our broader AR suite. The first on slide 18 is at Jabil, a major global contract manufacturing company with 260,000 employees in 30 countries. Jabil operates in a highly competitive market where margins are paramount. One of the biggest cost inputs is, of course, human capital so finding new transformative solutions to improve onboarding and training and increasing frontline worker efficiency can have huge returns. PTC's AR team leveraging existing CAD and PLM relationships at Jabil introduced the Vuforia suite to their manufacturing team and landed a seven-figure AR starter deal. Turning to slide 19. A second great AR success story in the quarter was with Nordex, one of the world's leading wind turbine manufacturers. And as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded, Nordex was planning to ramp new production capacity in India. However, the COVID related travel restrictions kept their German based technical experts grounded, which stalled the commissioning of new production facilities. By leveraging Vuforia Expert Capture, local technicians recorded training instructions in context then automatically published that content to headsets and mobile devices used by the production teams on the ground in India. Turning now to slide 20. I'll wrap up my comments on our Growth business by discussing Onshape, which delivered another strong quarter as they wrapped up their first year as part of the PTC family. Onshape had a record quarter with bookings up more than 80% year-over-year and with 70% growth in new logos. During fiscal 2020, Onshape landed over 700 competitive displacements, the majority coming from SolidWorks. I see this as clear evidence of the disruptive nature of Onshape's SaaS based solution in what has been a competitive mature market with entrenched incumbent players. The investments we're making in Onshape's global market expansion is starting to pay early dividends in Europe, which is a large market for design software. The PTC reseller channel while still early in its Onshape journey is gaining traction and opens up another exciting vector of growth for the Onshape business. Lastly on Onshape, I'd like to update you on the exciting trends we're seeing in the education market. On slide 21, you'll see that education sign-ups during the back-to-school season have been growing nicely for years, but they have literally exploded this year due to COVID. Let me explain why. Mainstream CAD systems run exclusively on Windows workstations, but students generally have Macbooks, Chromebooks or iPads. So schools have always been forced to provide a special PC computer room on-campus for any CAD-related work. Because of the pandemic, most schools now require work-from-anywhere solutions. So they're increasingly turning to Onshape which runs on any of the devices students typically have. Schools are realizing that they don't even need the expensive PC room anymore. So, I don't see the situation reverting. Winning in education is really important because students represent the workforce of tomorrow. Winning them over, while setting the bar at a new level has proven to be a winning long-term sales and marketing technique in the CAD industry. We believe the rapid adoption of Onshape in education provides a template for SaaS adoption to follow in the commercial market. Our manufacturing customers have the same needs for real-time collaboration and access to data from anywhere and on any device. I believe the COVID crisis is accelerating the SaaS tipping point for the engineering software industry by several years. Bottom line is that one year into it Onshape looks to be another excellent acquisition. To wrap up on our Growth business, I think it's pretty clear that the COVID crisis has only amplified long-term growth opportunities for PTC. Let me provide some color on geographic performance. On slide 22, you'll see that APAC had strong performance with ARR growth of 14%, reflecting the earlier reopening of those economies and much healthier churn rates on subscription licenses particularly in China where our subscription model seems to be gaining a foothold. America's ARR growth of 11% was driven by mid-teens PLM growth and strong growth across our AR suite, but partially offset by softness in FSG. Europe ARR growth of 8% while benefiting from solid PLM performance lagged other regions primarily because of the higher mix of CAD and pressure on new logo activity in IoT. Before I wrap up let me turn to slide 23 and touch on our other key alliance partner. I've already spoken of the strength of the Rockwell and ANSYS alliances, but our partnership with Microsoft had another strong quarter with bookings increasing around 20% from Q3 with momentum building in Europe which comprised 30% of the bookings in Q4. With a solid pipeline heading into FY 2021 and field engagement strengthening across the globe we remain bullish on the Microsoft Alliance opportunity. To wrap up and summarize turning to slide 24. We're seeing strong demand from secular drivers like digital transformation, work from home, the need for remote monitoring solutions for asset management remote support of frontline workers and growing interest in SaaS. We're in the right place at the right time. We've executed well during a challenging environment, delivering solid ARR growth and record bookings to close out the year. Our subscription transition is complete with a return to record ARR and revenue in FY '20. And we're expecting a free cash flow inflection in fiscal 2021 with continued strong free cash flow growth thereafter. We're confident that by aligning with market demand to build a strong pipeline, improving our execution to convert that pipeline to robust ARR growth and leveraging scale and business model efficiencies to drive even higher free cash flow growth is a recipe that will continue to create significant shareholder value for years to come. With that I'll turn it over to Kristian, who will take you through more details on the financial results and guidance. Okay. Jay I'll take the first part of that. So we showed last November was it when we had our Investor Day? We showed a model that said, if our bookings for CAD and PLM were to be flat then over the course of five years our growth rates would slow down from that low double-digit number to the kind of upper single digit almost mid-single-digit growth rate in the industry. That's if the bookings numbers are flat. But I think we do see an opportunity to do better than flat. We're winning -- we have very strong competitive products. We have new things to sell. For example in Creo, we have the Creo Simulation Live and pretty soon now the whole ANSYS suite behind that. We have this generative design stuff. We have AR the augmented reality technologies built into both Creo and Windchill. So I mean I think we feel like in the near term, we could slow down a bit in the next couple of years. But I think then, once you get to the midterm this Atlas project could be a real tailwind for growth. So I think that scenario that we showed last fall of slowing down to market growth, probably won't happen because I think that this Atlas SaaS-ification we call it of Creo and Windchill will actually be a growth driver using this Atlas platform that's kind of shared with Onshape. So we'll talk more about that naturally in the November time frame. But I think when you look at our growth rate versus others and one of our European peers reported results that were materially weaker than ours, I think we have really strong competitive products, I think we're in better verticals. For example, aerospace and defense is really defense for us in a strong way. We're in the medical device arena. And we have a business model that's terrific. It doesn't leak so much as others who don't have a recurring revenue model like we do. So I think there's just a collection of advantages that are allowing us for the third consecutive year and frankly forecasted into next year to continue to grow at rates materially higher than the balance of the market we compete against. Do you want to take the headcount question? Nine. Yes. I think too let me add. When you look at our OpEx increase in fiscal 2021, it seems higher than you might expect. But frankly a lot of that is just cost that fell out of 2020 because of COVID. We're allowing room for it to come back in. So let me give you an example. We spend $40 million to $50 million a year in travel and that just went to zero. So most of FY 2020 had zero travel. But we're assuming in FY 2021 that, yes, we'd be back calling on customers and stuff like that and that would ramp. So a lot of the cost increase makes more sense, if you take the two years and average them, right? If you take the 2% or 3% OpEx growth in FY 2020 and the 10% in 2021 you add it together you get let's call it 13%. Okay average is 6.5%. Well 6.5% makes sense against the guidance of 9% to 12% ARR growth. That's the way you ought to look at it. It's not so much that we're spending a lot more. But that we're returning some of the spend or actually planning for some of the spend to come back as we go into FY 2021. Well, let me tell you when we started Q4 the -- what we call the beginning of the quarter forecast had a what we call a wedge in it versus a hedge. No, I'm sorry a hedge versus the wedge I said that wrong. Meaning, we were actually taking it down from the roll-ups and saying the roll-ups look nice coming from the field, but we have this COVID thing going out there we should be conservative. But actually the roll-ups were higher than the forecast. So what happened throughout the course of the quarter is we raised the forecast four times internally. So I think we saw building strength throughout the quarter. It wasn't just like a Hail Mary pass at the end although frankly a lot of business did come in at the end. But we had raised the quarter or raised the forecast three times in the month of September alone prior to the last week. So I think we just saw a building strength, and yes a lot of it was IoT and AR, but frankly a lot of it was PLM as well. I mean, we had a bang-up PLM quarter, but we also had very, very good IoT and AR quarter. Thanks, Saket. Hi, Jason. Yes. I think most of our AR sales cycles are less than two quarters. And then most of our IoT sales cycles tend to be more three and four, because it's a kind of bigger more complex enterprise system. It's a system of record, it requires some amount of implementation and weaving into the physical side of the business and so forth. So let me just say though the IoT pipeline is good and the AR pipeline is fantastic. And part of the places that some of those sales and marketing resources are going to is to make sure for example in AR that we can actually keep up in that pipeline, because there's so much interest and our competitive advantage is so strong. I mean, if you go look at the Magic Quadrant-type reports, which we'll show you in December if you haven't seen them recently. I mean, we are miles ahead of everybody in this field of industrial AR, and there's just a huge level of interest. So we just want to make sure we're in place actually to execute on it, because again, that interest won't hang around forever if we don't service it. So that's where some of the investment is going. Thanks. Hey, Adam. Yes. On the Rockwell contract just to add a little more color. I mean, we extended that early, because both salespeople and customers want certainty that by the time a campaign completes that the partnership is still in full force, right? I mean, you wouldn't want to start a three-quarter sales cycle in the back half of the year if that contract wasn't extended. So we really did it just to take any fear out and because it's a great partnership and we're both committed to it. There were some other changes we wanted to make, while we had the hood open, for example, throwing some more products in there and so forth. But the real thing was it's a great partnership. Let's not scare anybody by letting it come too close to the sun here where it looks like it might expire. So where are we going to focus? I think it's the same place we've been focusing. Rockwell has some real momentum with our products and they're really selling them into their strong suites. Their food and beverage, their North American automotive, their various different materials and oil and gas probably that's a little more challenged at the moment. But it's really Rockwell taking our technology into their very large customer base and really doing the smart factory kind of thing, where they add software this IoT and AR type of software to all the other products that Rockwell has both software and hardware and really build the whole smart factory strategy. So I think that's where we'll continue to focus. It doesn't represent a change. Adding PLM and Onshape, I think is interesting. I don't think that will become central to the partnership. It really is an IoT and AR partnership. But they see some opportunities around Onshape. We showed some examples of how, you could use Onshape for factory design, during our LiveWorx presentation during my keynote. And then for PLM, they have a PLM capability. Now that's quite impressive in Kalypso. And they see some opportunities they want to be able to go after. Yes. So let me say, Rockwell's earnings call is next week or maybe even the week after. And I'd probably prefer to defer to them. But let me say certainly the partnership contemplates strong continued growth. And normally associated with strong continued growth, one would continue to make go-to-market investments. But let me defer that question to them, so I don't steal any of their thunder. And then on the PTC side. I mean, I think, we -- what we really have gained access to is this Emulate3D. I don't think that's central to what we're trying to do. But I think we are interested in trying to figure out, how to better integrate that with Onshape. And at least have it as a weapon in the arsenal. But I don't think we're going to pivot hard toward that. I think we have more pipeline than we can keep up with in CAD, PLM, IoT and AR and Onshape. So -- but anyway, it's a weapon in the arsenal that we can pull out, if we find the right opportunity. And we've certainly seen such opportunities over time. This company Emulate3D that Rockwell acquired actually had been on our acquisition list too. So its technology we're interested in, but we got a lot on our plate, at the same time. So we'll call on it opportunistically. Okay. Joe, let me \u2013 this is Jim. Let me take a high level let's call it qualitative pass at this. And Kristian if you want to add any quantitative numbers too you can. In the case of FSG, that's a business where for example one of the big properties is Servigistics. Spare parts management and airlines is the largest industry we sell into or one of the largest. So that's had some pressure as airlines were in deep trouble and whatnot. I think if we see modest low single-digit improvement in ARR for Servigistics or let's say for all of FSG, FSG will still be down versus 2019, right? So we're not really expecting miracles there. We're just saying we see some things happening that will be slightly helpful. Now as you go to the rest of it, the real thing is the pipeline. First of all we've become much better at managing the pipeline. And right now we have a very optimistic looking pipeline and not just for Q1. I mean really for the whole year and really for each of the main segments CAD, PLM IoT and AR and really for each of the main geographies. So we have a lot of pipeline. Now we don't have a crystal ball as to what could happen with COVID. Lockdowns could hurt. Although, honestly, we feel like we're locked down and I think most of our customers feel to me like they're locked down already. I mean their production people are showing up to work in the factories but the people we're selling to really are pretty much working from home. More let's say on the knowledge worker side of the business. So I don't know what lockdowns will mean. I kind of think we're in lockdown mode. Yes restaurants are open but that's fine. We're not selling to restaurants. We're selling to manufacturing companies. So I don't know what that will mean. I think Kristian was clear though that our assumption is that life will be kind of like it is now in the near-term and improving somewhat in the back half of our year. If COVID does something radical and it's radically different than that yes, okay, we're going to have to have a different set of assumptions. But we're only working with kind of what we have. Let me link those comments to backlog. I was really talking about backlog as I look forward to 2021 and beyond. When I said is there's a 200 basis points or two percentage points headwind to our growth in FY 2021, which is contemplated in our guidance by the way, really because the backlog is down, entering the year. But if you look at the backlog for the year after that, it's right where it should be, in part because of the booking strength we saw, particularly in the fourth quarter. So right now, we don't have a FY 2022 deficit in our backlog chart. But we do have one that will cost us about two points in FY 2021. Two points of growth, you can run the math, that's what the backlog differential is. Thank you. Hey, Andrew. Yes. I mean we're going to give you a little more insight again in December, but let me kind of just paint the highest level picture. We think the industry is going to SaaS. And with Onshape we're leading the charge. But we'd like to bring our customer base that's on Creo and Windchill along for the ride. So we're saying what if we developed using the Atlas kernel if you will or architecture of Onshape, what if we developed versions of Creo and Windchill that kind of acted a lot like Onshape in terms of being true multi-tenant, multiuser SaaS. But at the same time, we're compatible so that you could do a lift and shift of an on-premise deployment into the SaaS cloud. Now that will take us a couple of years to build to be frank because if you're talking about compatibility then you need pin for pin feature capability, right? We're not talking about building a new product with limited functionality. We're really talking about full on versions of Creo and Windchill so that you could lift the production deployment shift it into the SaaS cloud and never miss a beat. When it's -- or why it's interesting is because that lift and shift typically doubles the ARR.  Because a subscription on-premise seat generally doubles in value when it becomes a subscription SaaS seat because you save the servers and the administration and the upgrades and lots of different things. So I think you should model that kind of in the back half of a five-year window and well beyond by the way. I think it's something that would probably run for I don't know it could be a decade. And -- but it will take us a while to get it going. So I'm not counting on anything there in 2021 and probably not even anything in 2022. And we'll keep you posted. We've got a lot of work to do. Well the lockdowns in Europe of course happened just lately. So I wouldn't have seen that in Q4 in any case. But I think it was helpful. Now we did have a pickup in Europe, but the real pickup was in the U.S. And we were able to reengage customers and customers send people back into their plants to get these projects going and so forth. And it was based a lot on expansions, but also we called out some real interesting new wins competitive wins where companies said, okay, let's get this initiative going and make a selection and get back to work. So we did see some of that in Q4. Again the interest level in our IoT software remains very high. And what happened in the fourth quarter is the close rate went up to a more kind of normalized close rate than we were seeing, let's say, in Q2 and Q3. Thank you. Yes. Well on the pipeline thing about a year ago, we hired a Chief Pipeline Officer, which really was somebody whose job it is to really watch the pipeline and make sure we're doing the right things to build it out. So this Chief Pipeline Officer maintains a six-quarter rolling view of the pipeline by segment, by geo, by sales channel you name it. So at any point in time, I have a dashboard that says, how does the pipeline look for CAD in Europe three quarters from now? I can tell you that. And there's a goal for how CAD in Europe three quarters from now should look as compared to what is the forecast or the plan for CAD in Europe three quarters from now. So we really have a level of data that is unprecedented here at PTC. And therefore, we have a level of proactiveness that's unprecedented because we know. For example, we might say, PLM in Japan is soft four quarters out. Get on it. We need to run some marketing promotions, we need to do this, we need to do that. We also know where to put resources. So, in terms of hiring and whatnot. We've done a lot of hiring, for example, into AR because this pipeline is so big, and we're worried about whether or not it will age out and disappear if we can't tend to it. But let me say going into the year on -- in terms of go-to-market configuration, no big changes. No big new players, no big reorganizations. It's really just keep doing what we're doing, because it's working pretty well. It came off the best quarter of sales we ever had. And it's working well to link sales and marketing in a digital go-to-market motion. We learned a lot in the last year. It wasn't wasted at all in that respect. Yes, much more efficient. I think you all know this, but if you travel with airplane tickets and rental cars and hotel rooms to make sales calls, you don't get that many sales calls made. And to the extent you can do that through a video call, it's very, very productive. And we came up with some really interesting ideas. For example, we've shifted our customer experience center, which was designed for customers to come to into more like a broadcast studio. So that we could do high-quality events with the customer online, but us not in our living rooms at home, but actually like you're watching the TV news practically. I mean it looks really impressive. And then, if you're there, it looks kind of strange, because you realize it's a studio. But we're doing things like that that really make it a much more powerful scalable and efficient go-to-market model. I really want to stress, for years, I was pushing -- so is Kristian, for selling to be more digital. And it was hard, but it suddenly got very easy and everybody embraced it, because the options were taken away. Thank you. Hey, Rich. Yes. Well, Rich, I mean, if you've been in and around enterprise software for a while, you know that kind of like rule of thumb is that for every $1 you have in the forecast, you ought to have $3 in the pipeline. And sometimes it's $2 and sometimes it's $4. If you have numbers that are closer to $10, it tells you something. It tells you that you don't have enough capacity or you're not qualifying enough or you have product problems or I mean whatever. So, it also tells you have low close rates, right? Because if you didn't take the forecast up and you sit there with all that coverage somehow you -- by mathematically, you're not doing an effective job closing that pipeline. So, we have very high levels of coverage in AR. I mean -- and by the way in Onshape too very high. And so, we are trying to both understand what it takes to increase the close rate. And we made some progress, but it isn't near that 3:1 ratio, but we're also bringing in more resources. So we're making good progress and it led to pretty good results all of last year, especially in Q4 of last year. And we have a strong plan for AR this year. I mean, this is a business. It's a hyper-growth business. It has some real legs and we're pretty excited about it. Just trying to figure out how to make sure we don't leave anything behind. Yes. Let me just step through that. If a sales rep closed the deal late in Q4, there was a ramp. A little bit in the first year a little bit more in the second more in the third. While if they closed it in Q4, the start date is almost certainly in Q1. And then the ramps would typically ramp on the anniversary of the start date. So that deal closed in Q4 of 2020 did nothing for 2020. It will do a little bit for 2021 and a lot for 2022 and possibly even more for 2023. I mean that's how these ramps work. So what we're saying is we have a 2 point -- two percentage points against the $1.2-ish billion $1.250 billion of ARR $25 million air gap if you will in pipeline going into fiscal 2021. But if you say well how does the pipeline look for fiscal 2022 compared to how it should look right now, the answer is it looks fine. Yes. Thank you everybody. Bye-bye."

During today\u2019s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. I would now turn the call over to Tim Fox, PTC\u2019s Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nTim Fox: Thank you, Valerie and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining PTC\u2019s conference call to discuss our third fiscal quarter financial results. On the call today are; Jim Heppelmann, Chief Executive Officer; and Kristian Talvitie, Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, please note that today\u2019s comments include forward-looking statements including statements regarding future financial guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in PTC\u2019s filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. As a reminder, we will be referring to operating and non-GAAP financial measures during today\u2019s call. Discussion of our operating metrics and items excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings press release and related Form 8-K. Lastly, references to growth rates will be in constant currency, unless otherwise noted. With that, let me turn the call over to Jim.\nJim Heppelmann: Thanks, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone and thanks for joining us. I hope you and your families continue to stay safe and well during this crisis. I\u2019d also like to thank the extended global PTC team for their continued hard work and commitment during this time of disruption. Before I jump into a review of our quarter, I\u2019d like to briefly reflect on the Coronavirus crisis, and review the headwinds and tailwinds that\u2019s been creating for our business. In terms of headwinds, we all know that the COVID-driven economic downturn is creating profitability and even business continuity concerns for many companies around the world. Naturally, some of the affected companies are PTC customers and prospects. The second major headwind is the travel bans and work from home requirements, which slows down selling processes and interferes with on-site project work. As a result of these headwinds, we\u2019ve seen pressure on bookings and some purchases get pushed out. Fortunately, to-date, the pressure has been somewhat less than we discussed in our guidance commentary last quarter. Our Q3 bookings were down mid 20% year-over-year, which is slightly better than the expectations we shared of down 30% to 50%. Based on the current forecast, we expect Q4 bookings growth rate to improve sequentially. The impact on renewal rates continues to be muted and we believe our previous guidance, suggesting a modest downtick and renewals remains an accurate assessment. So in aggregate, at this point, we think that the COVID crisis will continue to be a major headwind, but perhaps less so than we guided to last quarter. I\u2019ll remind you, however, that this situation remains very dynamic. And we don\u2019t have a crystal ball to see what lies ahead in the future. Like everybody else, we\u2019d sure like to see a vaccine become widely available. At the same time, the COVID crisis is creating some strong tailwind still. We expect these tailwinds to persist for years to come long after the short-term headwinds fade as the health crisis passes. If there\u2019s one thing the crisis has illuminated for our industrial customers, it\u2019s the need to accelerate their digital transformation efforts. In my LiveWorx keynote, I talked about the key learnings our customers have seen as a consequence of the crisis. They include the need to embrace the mobile workforce, the need for tools that better enable impromptu collaboration across supply chain partners. The need to bring digital to the frontline workforce and the need to push forward with remote monitoring and optimization of products in factories. These needs very directly translate into elevated levels of interest for our PLM, IoT, Augmented Reality and SaaS solutions. The COVID situation is driving higher pipelines for Windchill for ThingWorx for the Vuforia and for Onshape. Each business is feeling the negative effects of the headwind still, but in cases like Vuforia and Onshape, the new tailwinds are strong enough to cancel most of the headwinds and these businesses continue to exhibit hyper growth rates. With Vuforia and Onshape in particular, where we have a deal push because of economic concerns, a new one tends to pop up because of the needs of the new normal. When the health crisis is ultimately managed down through a vaccine or other means, I expect that PTC will be in a very strong growth position as the tailwinds blow uncontested. With that, let me now turn to our Q3 results. Overall, we\u2019re very pleased with our performance. We delivered 10% ARR growth, which was above our expectation of high single-digit growth. We delivered very strong revenue and APS and exceptionally strong free cash flow in the quarter. Kristian will get into the details later. So let me focus on providing color on the trends we\u2019re seeing across our business segments. From a geographic perspective, ARR growth was evenly balanced with 10% year-over-year growth across all three major geographic regions. One notable area of performance was in China, which posted mid-teens ARR growth and early indicator that the economy there is on the path to recovery, and that our subscription model is gaining traction. Turning to our business performance by segment. Let me begin with our growth products, which as a reminder includes IoT, AR and Onshape. Growth product ARR grew 24% year-over-year, which is below our expectations for a normal environment. But consistent with the COVID dynamics we\u2019ve discussed, which in particular, have extended sales cycles for new IoT customers. Remember that IoT is where the physical world meets the digital world. And we typically have to engage the physical world in the initial setup phase, so that we can then remotely monitor and control it thereafter. It\u2019s hard, for example, to make progress, selling a smart factory project to a new logo if the factory shut down or you\u2019re not allowed to go there for COVID reasons. But once the IoT systems in place, customers really see the value of remote monitoring and optimization and the expansion business remains brisk. Vuforia and Onshape are relatively less affected due to lightweight deployment models and their pure SaaS nature. Let me provide you some highlights in these two areas, starting with AR. We delivered a solid quarter overall with record Vuforia-Chalk, enterprise sales and acceleration in a six figure AR deals and we added substantially to the burgeoning AR pipeline, which will serve us well in the fourth quarter and beyond. You may recall that in response to the crisis back in March, we decided to provide free access to the Vuforia-Chalk, which is the entry level capability of the Vuforia-Suite that allows everybody to use their mobile device to see and markup real world frontline worker environments, such as factories and worksite. Chalk is proving to be incredibly helpful for remote support and problem solving. The adoption of Chalk has been exceptional, with daily production usage levels across the customer base, now running 5 times higher than before we launched the program a few months back. All those companies using Chalk now represent an exciting upsell pipeline to pursue in Q4 and beyond. Because of the strong adoption we\u2019ve seen when we took the sales friction out of the way, we\u2019re moving toward a freemium program that positions Chalk as a basic offering that\u2019s an easy entry point into the broader Vuforia-Suite. One of the most interesting upsell opportunities is the Vuforia Expert Capture, a more advanced AR solution, which was a key driver in large AR deals in Q3. Expert capture is tailor-made for doing knowledge transfer between frontline workers in the remote work situation that our industrial customers are currently navigating. We had two notable wins in Q3 that highlight the value of our broader AR suite. The first is a leading US-based manufacturer of specialty measurement equipment, before the crisis hit, their services organization had kicked off an initiative to transform the way to deliver services to differentiate their offerings and improve operational efficiency. When the crisis hit, they encountered new services delivery challenges, because of travel bans and on-site restrictions. PTC introduced the Vuforia Suite through this free Chalk program. And in less than three months, the customer adopted and deployed Vuforia Chalk and Expert Capture across the Global Services team, using Vuforia that now delivering highly effective remote support and are capturing best practices from internal experts for distribution to their end customers. A second grade AR success story in the quarter was Philips Healthcare. As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded, Philips needed to significantly ramp up ventilator production to address the growing healthcare crisis. They faced two significant challenges. The first was accelerating training of new staff required to enable 24/7 production shifts. The second challenge was the travel ban which threatened to delay their new production capacity in India. PTC introduced Philips to our Vuforia Expert Capture solution and in less than 30 days, Philips was capturing expertise from technicians in the US, and remotely training new hires across the globe. Despite facing the same COVID headwinds that were navigating across our business, our pure SaaS Onshape CAD business, delivered a strong quarter. The Onshape organization had a solid bookings quarter, added a record number of new logos and is tracking to achieve their FY \u201921 \u2013 \u201820 plan. It\u2019s worth noting that in this challenging macro environment, Onshape\u2019s growth rate is more than 30 percentage points higher than the well known mainstream product it\u2019s most frequently displacing, which tells me that something interesting is happening. Another proof point for Onshape momentum is that the pipeline is 4 times larger today than when we acquired the company three quarters ago. To support this strong demand, we\u2019re making significant investments in Onshape go-to market, including expanding sales reach into Europe, which is a large market for design software. In Q3 Onshape also booked the first handful of orders from PTC\u2019s reseller channel, a new program that was just launched. We believe getting PTC VaRs in the game will open another exciting vector of growth for the Onshape business. We\u2019re proceeding full speed ahead on the Atlas program too, which aims to generalize the underlying Onshape SaaS architecture and put it to work more broadly across the entire PTC product portfolio. Work has progressed well on the Vuforia and generate design front and we\u2019re working towards the day when there are versions of Creo and Windchill that are fully multi-tenant SaaS. Thanks to the underlying Atlas platform they share with Onshape. Overall, we remain extremely excited about the opportunity to grow Onshape into the leading SaaS engineering design suite. As industrial companies rethink their innovation strategies for a new normal built around SaaS, there\u2019s no better solution than Onshape. Jon Hirschtick and John McEleney and the rest of the Onshape team have integrated seamlessly in the PTC and morale is very high. And they\u2019ve never missed a beat in their frequent delivery schedules. Naturally, they love the Atlas strategy and we\u2019re very pleased with how this acquisition is unfolding. Lastly, in our growth business, I\u2019d like to discuss IoT a bit more. As I mentioned earlier, we\u2019ve seen pressure on new deal closure as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. While the new logo pipeline remains strong, the inability to engage with customers on-site, the scope and plan of the Enterprise Solutions has elongated sales cycles. But the interest level remains higher than ever. So we\u2019re confident that as we see the environment begin to stabilize and engagement activity resume, we\u2019ll get this part of the pipeline cranking back up. Meanwhile, we did see solid IoT expansion activity in Q3, which is a testament to the value customers are realizing with ThingWorx. We saw a balanced expansion across both the smart connected products use case and the smart connected operations use case. And from a vertical perspective, we continue to see broad-based demand in a core industrial space in high tech and electronics, and in aerospace and defense. But the real standout vertical in the quarter was the medical device industry, which has experienced less economic disruption during the crisis. Medical device companies like Abbott Laboratories and Hologic are continuing to expand their smart connected product deployments, enabling them to remotely monitor and service the product fleet seamlessly, despite the operational challenges caused by the pandemic. Our partner, Rockwell had a relatively good quarter of AR and IoT sales with a strong sequential tick up in business. Like PTC, Rockwell saw strong expansion sales, which is great for the success of the partnership as we have landed a lot of starter deals previously. Our partnership with Microsoft had a strong quarter across IoT, AR and PLM fronts. We were pleased to learn just recently that we won Microsoft\u2019s Global Manufacturing Partner of the Year Award for second consecutive year. We\u2019ve recently extended this partnership into a new class of IoT solutions, called Factory Insight as a Service. This solution was launched a few weeks ago, is a three-way partnership with Rockwell Automation and Microsoft. Factory Insights as a Service is a turnkey cloud solution that enables manufacturers to achieve significant impact, speed and scale with the digital transformation initiatives. All three companies are taking it to market. Lastly, on IoT, in addition to solid expansion activity and healthy backlog and pipeline heading into the fourth quarter, our confidence in PTC\u2019s IoT market position was once again validated by the industry analyst community. Quadrant Knowledge Solutions identified PTC as the outright leader in industrial IoT platforms in this latest SPARK Matrix report, based on technology excellence and customer impact. We\u2019ll put this report on our Investor Relations website for you to reveal. To wrap up on a growth business, the punch line here is the COVID crisis creates a significant long-term growth opportunity for PTC, balanced against some near-term headwinds. We believe there are fundamental changes happening in the industrial economy that will play out in our favor over the coming years, bolstered by the strong alliances with Rockwell Automation and Microsoft, PTC is extremely well positioned to be a central part of the digital transformation strategies of our industrial customers. Turning now to the core business, we\u2019re very pleased with our Q3 performance with ARR growth of 10% once again, outpacing the market growth. The juxtaposition of Creo and Windchill being up are combined 10% in a quarter where DSOS, CATIA and INNOVIA businesses were down a combined 10% is interesting. I attribute that 20 point disparity to the great progress PTC has made to strengthen our products and to strengthen our business model. Q3 was the 11th consecutive quarter that our core ARR growth rate has been in the double-digits. With such steady and predictable performance over a long period now, it\u2019s obvious that we made tremendous strides, driving the cyclicality out of our core business. At this point, PMI fluctuations seem to have a more muted effect on PTC than they do on some of our peers. PTC\u2019s PLM business continues its streak of strong performance with mid-teens ARR growth in Q3. From a geographic perspective, PLM performance was broad based with double-digit growth across all three major geographies, led by the APAC region. The momentum in our PLM business was underscored by a major win with the US Navy, which we announced earlier this afternoon. Following a rigorous competitive process against a dozen other technology providers that concluded with a small initial win a year ago, we conducted a successful pilot program and we\u2019ve now won a substantial expansion agreement to power a cloud-based digital transformation and modernization effort around the weapons readiness and war fighting capabilities of the Naval Sea Systems Command. This project will drive a fundamental change in the way the Navy operates and supports its fleet of ships and submarines. PTC software will be used to create a model based digital twin of each chip that will be used by more than 15,000 users and an expansive supplier network to optimize lifecycle costs and maximize operational availability. With additional options in place that could expand the ARR of this project to over $25 million in year five. This contract is poised to become PTC\u2019s largest run rate customer so long as we successfully execute. The Navy when reinforces, my earlier point about the digital transformation trends that are happening across the broader industrial economy and how they\u2019re driving new demand for PLM. Our PLM pipeline looks strong and with many more digital transformation projects being discussed. We feel the prospects of a new wave of secular PLM growth are increasing. Turning now to CAD. Our CAD team delivered a solid quarter with ARR growth in high single-digits. Growth across the GOs was mixed with APAC leading the way, followed by the Americas and Europe. In Europe, which has our largest CAD channel exposure, sales were more severely impacted by the COVID crisis, given the patchwork of government shutdown across the regions. But CAD renewal rates were extremely strong. We had solid results from Creo simulation live, our CAD solution that embeds real-time simulation from Ansys. We closed 10 expansion deals across a number of verticals like automotive, medical device and industrials. And we inked our first seven figure CSL deal with a large US government agency. It feels like we\u2019re gaining some steam with CSL and we look forward to launching new marketing programs in the coming quarters. And finally, our Focused Solution Group was flat, more or less it is expected given the difficult circumstances. With high profitability and low churn, this business continues to add real strength to the portfolio. To wrap up my comments, I think it\u2019s safe to say that we\u2019re operating in unchartered waters as we navigate through this pandemic. However, I couldn\u2019t be more pleased with our strategic position. And with our team\u2019s execution in the face of these challenging times. We\u2019re fully mindful of the headwinds the pandemic will place on new business, as we continue to target double-digit growth in ARR, revenue and EPS for the year. We\u2019re confident that once this crisis passes, we\u2019ll be well positioned to drive even higher levels of growth, margin expansion and shareholder value creation. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Kristian, who\u2019ll take you through more details on the financial results.\nKristian Talvitie: Great, thanks, Jim and good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our result, I\u2019d like to note that I\u2019ll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance, and all growth rate references will be in constant currency. Let me start off with a brief review of our third quarter results, and then spend the balance of the call on our outlook for the remainder of the year. Q3 ARR was $1.21 billion, representing 10% year-over-year growth at constant currency, which was slightly above the guidance commentary we provided last quarter. The upside was driven by solid new ACV bookings, and only modest deterioration in churn which came in essentially in line with our forecast for the quarter. Q3 revenue of $352 million was up 20% year-over-year, driven by 28% recurring revenue growth. As we\u2019ve discussed previously, revenue is impacted by ASC 606 and related business policy changes. Operating margin of 29% increased approximately 1,200 basis points over Q3 \u201819. And lastly, non-GAAP EPS of $0.62 increased almost a 180% year-over-year. Q3 free cash flow of $99 million was ahead of our expectations, driven primarily by the timing of collections, lower than allowed for customer concessions and lower than planned expenses such as travel and the virtual LiveWorx event. I think the key takeaway here is that even in the current macro environment, customers are clearly getting value from our solutions and paying largely on time. Moving on to our balance sheet, following the redemption of the $500 million of 6% senior notes in May, we ended Q3 with $1.1 billion of debt, including $1 billion of senior notes with a weighted average cost of debt of 3.8% and $138 million outstanding on our credit facility. We ended Q3 with cash and marketable securities of $435 million. We believe this is a very attractive and stable debt structure, especially in light of the current economic backdrop. Now, turning to guidance. Based on our Q3 performance and outlook for Q4, we\u2019re raising the low end of our ARR guidance, and now expect year-over-year ARR growth of 10% to 12% on a constant currency basis, versus our previous 9% to 12% range. At the low end of the ARR guidance, we expect new ACV bookings to be down approximately 30% for the back half of FY \u201820 versus our previous low end expectation of down 50%. At the high end of guidance, we continue to expect new ACV bookings to be down approximately 20% year-over-year and we\u2019re still expecting churn of approximately 8% for fiscal \u201820. It\u2019s worth noting that despite these declines in new ACV bookings and slightly increased churn, we\u2019re still able to target double-digit ARR growth, which is a testament to the strength of our recurring business model. Before I get into the guidance details, there are few important factors worth reviewing as it relates to ARR. First, as a reminder, the way that we define ARR is the total value of active ACV or Annual Contract Value contracts at the end of the quarter. This means the timing matters, both for new ACV bookings and renewal ACV bookings. In that, our subscription ACV is counted in ARR when contracts start. So, for example, if we book an order at the end of the quarter, but the start date is in the following quarter, it\u2019s not counted in ending ARR for that quarter, but instead goes into backlog. The key takeaway here is, that while we build a set of start date assumptions into our forecast and guidance, there\u2019s always some risk that start dates move, and hence ARR and backlog change accordingly. The second key factor is ramp agreements. A portion of our new ACV bookings are structured with annual committed ACV ramps that grow each year of the contract duration. The ramp agreements are great in the sense that they build future committed backlog which increases our ARR visibility in the future. However, if we book more ramp agreements than anticipated in any given quarter, this can also impact ending ARR and of course, backlog. Given the current macro environment, where customers are more cautious about their budgets and deployments, we\u2019ve seen an uptick in demand for ramp agreements. We factored some of this into our guidance. But we believe it\u2019s important to call this out heading into what is our largest bookings quarter for the year. So now for the specifics, we\u2019re expecting fiscal \u201820 ARR of $1.24 billion to $1.2 6 billion, that\u2019s a constant currency growth rate of 10% to 12%. Relative to Q3, our ARR guidance includes approximately $5 million of positive FX impact. And the quarter-over-quarter increase in growth is driven primarily by both normal seasonality of our business, as well as our backlog of deals booked in prior periods. Turning now to free cash flow. For fiscal \u201920, we\u2019re expecting to deliver approximately $210 million which is an increase of about $10 million from our prior guidance, due to modestly higher expected ARR, solid collection activity and FX, and consistent with last quarter even though we haven\u2019t seen a material change in customer payment activity, we\u2019ve built in some cushion for potential customer payment concessions. Please note that the interest payments for the two senior notes we closed in February will be paid in our fiscal second and fourth fiscal quarters, beginning this quarter, where the interests on the retired note was previously paid in our first and third fiscal quarters. For the full year, free cash flow guidance includes $45 million in restructuring costs, $9 million of acquisition related payments, $65 million of interest payments and CapEx investments in the low to 20 - low to mid $20 million range. Now turning to P&L guidance, we\u2019re expecting fiscal \u201820 revenue of $1.42 billion to $1.43 billion, that\u2019s an increase of $7 million at the midpoint of guidance, reflecting modestly higher ARR and subscription revenue. The resulting revenue range is growth of 13% to 14%. On the expense front, we remain diligent relative to our headcount additions and continue to limit hiring to critical roles, primarily in our growth businesses. We continue to target operating expense growth in the lower single-digits for fiscal \u201820 and an operating margin range of 27% to 28%, which is an increase of 700 basis points to 800 basis points year-over-year. Non-GAAP EP S is now expected to be $2.28 to $2.35, that\u2019s an increase of $0.04 at the midpoint of guidance, and represents 39% to 43% year-over-year growth. A final point on guidance, you\u2019ll note that the implied Q4 P&L guidance calls for a slowdown in year-over-year revenue and EPS growth. This slowdown is related to the accounting treatment of on-premise subscription revenue under ASC 606 and business policy changes we put in place in Q4 of \u201919. Subscription revenue under ASC 606 is also impacted by contract term length. So to the extent that term length change going forward, you should expect to see variability on a quarterly basis. That said, it is important to understand this has no impact on ARR or free cash flow as we continue to build customers annually upfront. Also, please note that we\u2019re guiding to a higher than normal seasonal increase in operating expenses for Q4. This is due in part to lower than normal expenses in Q3, with LiveWorx being held virtually this year, and other lower expenses such as travel, due to COVID related restrictions. And in Q4, we\u2019re also expecting for normal higher commissions, an uptick in new hires and also there are four more business days in Q4 than Q3 which drives incremental improvements as well. So to sum up with the caveats I described earlier about start date, timing and ramp contracts, we believe that our guidance to be appropriate. We continue to be diligent on expenses and protecting earnings without impairing our ability to make key investments in our growth businesses. And lastly, we have a strong and stable capital structure to support our profitable growth strategy going forward. While we\u2019re not providing fiscal \u201821 guidance at this time, it is worth noting that even under a scenario of prolonged economic softness, we would still expect solid ARR growth. And as a reminder, there will be additional free cash flow tailwinds in fiscal \u201821. Well, we expect CapEx to continue in the same mid 20s ballpark. Interest expense is expected to decrease roughly $25 million compared to fiscal \u201920, given our new debt structure, and assuming no restructuring, we would expect $30 million less of restructuring payments and assuming no acquisitions, another approximately $10 million less of actual acquisition related payments in fiscal \u201821. One additional note for those of you building models for fiscal \u201921. We will be moving to calendar quarters next year off of the modified four or five quarters we\u2019ve had previously. We\u2019ll provide more details on this topic next quarter. So, wrapping up, we had another solid quarter, but recognize that the market is changing rapidly. We believe we\u2019re very well positioned to perform during the downturn, and to continue delivering significant value to our customers, which in turn will drive ARR growth well into the future. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to the operator to begin Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matt Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nMatt Hedberg: Well, hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Hey, guys. Glad you\u2019re all doing well. And it\u2019s great to hear your voices again. Jim, I think what really is intriguing me and I started to dig into it a lot in some of the work that we\u2019ve been doing is, you guys leveraging Atlas, which I think is obviously one of the crown jewels of odd shape. You noted in your prepared remarks working on a SaaS version of Creo and Windchill and you said, you know, it\u2019s still an ongoing process. I\u2019m just wondering, could you provide a bit more detail on there and how you think about the timeline for that rollout? And how, you know, existing customers might leverage a SaaS version of Creo and Windchill?\nJim Heppelmann: Yeah. Well, Matt, good catch there. Because, you know, I think it really is ultimately a very large opportunity. But let me be clear, it\u2019s kind of a mid to long-term thing, because we\u2019re really looking at doing kind of a major redevelopment of those properties onto this platform. And You know, the key thing for us would be to optimize for compatibility and continuity. So I sort of \u2013 I have an analogy I\u2019ve shared internally many times and probably help with investors as well. You know, if you think of Google Docs, it\u2019s a completely fresh thought, fresh look at, let\u2019s say, Office Productivity Suite. Meanwhile, you had Microsoft Office, which was on-prem. But Microsoft came out with Office 365, which was SaaS, and companies like PTC might have been thinking about whether or not we should go to Google Docs. I mean, many, many do, and particularly new companies, but as companies who have been using Office forever, really do prioritize compatibility of data and user experience, but we like to have SaaS. So you could imagine we could build a product that looks a lot like Creo. But it runs in the cloud and is multi-tenant, but you open up your same old files and you go right back to work with the same old user interface, much like you did with Office 365. Meanwhile, Onshape\u2019s over here are more like Google Docs, unbridled, unconstrained innovation, no legacy, trying to invent the next generation of application. So I think Onshape fights the fight against competitors and Atlas allows Creo and Windchill to bring their customer base with. Again, it\u2019ll take us, I\u2019m going to say a couple of years to do this. You know, I partly tell you, because it\u2019s part of our commitment, I really go to SaaS. It is a long-term monetization effort that\u2019s significant, because while we\u2019ve brought our customers from perpetual to subscription, there\u2019s another and potentially bigger monetization associated with bringing them from on-prem into SaaS. So I\u2019m excited about that. You know, and really, to me, if the Onshape acquisition seemed expensive, I mean, it was, but what people didn\u2019t realize is that we were getting both a breakthrough CAD system, but also a breakthrough CAD platform that will allow Creo and Windchill, you know, to get into that SaaS world years earlier than they would have independently and on a consistent platform. So that is, we bring our customers to SaaS, everything\u2019s knitted together on a common platform as well. So we\u2019re very excited about it. But you know, I want to be clear, it\u2019s not a short-term strategy. I think, though, if you\u2019re looking about \u2013 let me just add one more comment. If you\u2019re thinking about, are there any drivers for longer-term, strong growth in CAD and PLM, I would say, yeah, there\u2019s kind of two that have captured my attention. One would be the movement of Creo and Windchill, the SaaS and the second one is something I mentioned which is the digital transformation story around Windchill that\u2019s starting to get more and more traction.\nMatt Hedberg: Thanks a lot, Jim.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Saket Kalia of Barclays. Your line is open.\nJim Heppelmann: Hey, Saket.\nSaket Kalia: Hey guys, thanks. Hey, Jim. Hey, Kristian, thanks for taking my question here. Jim, I actually maybe want to pick up on that last item that you just mentioned with Windchill and just PLM broadly. You know, can you just talk about that strength in PLM, ARR? You know, is it related to that digital transformation? You talked about a secular wave and PLM again? Is it market share gains? And how do you sort of think about that going forward?\nJim Heppelmann: Yeah, I think, you know, when I talk to my sales team, and when I spend a lot of time with customers, I think that, you know, in the past PLM followed CAD around, now it\u2019s starting to follow digital transformation initiatives. And what really happens there is, industrial companies say, how could we think about, you know, taken ourselves through a digital transformation that didn\u2019t involve digital product data, you know, being under control and well managed and so forth. So I think like the Navy example, it\u2019s got nothing to do actually with engineering. It\u2019s about a model driven, you know, operation and support paradigm. And it\u2019s got nothing to do with following CAD around. It\u2019s really about how do you use that data to transform the way products are operated and serviced and supported, you know, during the lifecycle out in the field. And that\u2019s a great example of the kind of initiatives we\u2019re hearing more and more about, as people saying that product data could be useful for a lot more than engineering. And if we want to try to do that, you know, this digital threat discussion, reuse it for manufacturing, reuse it for service, potentially use it for sales and marketing. If we want to do that, we got to get it under better control. And Windchill excels at that, you know, it\u2019s already a SaaS and web-based system. And it differentiates well, you know, every single Magic Quadrant report you\u2019ve seen in years Windchill\u2019s way up front, in terms of its, you know, competitiveness, let's say. And I just think that digital transformation has become a real driver.\nSaket Kalia: Got it, makes sense. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew DeGasperi of Berenberg. Your line is open.\nAndrew DeGasperi: Thanks for \u2013 hi, how are you? Maybe just one or two questions. The first on Q4 ARR, I was just wondering in terms of the makeup of that guidance. Can you maybe elaborate a little bit how much of that is based on ramp deals versus brand new booking?\nKristian Talvitie: Well, as we\u2019ve said numerous times before, we\u2019re not getting into the specifics around that just but we do have a fair amount of visibility into the ARR. Again, it\u2019s our largest bookings quarter of the year, which does make it a little bit harder to call around the \u2013 you know, the line of start dates and how much is actually going to come in this ramp deal. But from a fundamental, you know, how much business are we selling out to the market perspective, I think we feel pretty good about the, you know, about the prospects for Q4. And we feel good about the, you know, the ranges we\u2019ve put out with those caveats.\nJim Heppelmann: Yeah. And maybe just to add, Andrew. I mean, clearly, Q4 has forever been a seasonally strong quarter for bookings. And so it\u2019s natural that it would be a seasonally strong quarter for backlog as well. So, you know, we start Q4 with kind of seasonally high backlog. And then we\u2019re going to \u2013 and some of that new bookings will land in the quarter and some of it will go back in the backlog. So again, what Kristian saying is, the real risk here is calling the timing of it, because how much of the new bookings lands in backlog versus in the quarter? I mean, that\u2019s actually important to the way we report, although it\u2019s actually not important to the \u2013 how well the business is doing. You know, the important thing there is, how much business do we go get? So I\u2019d say seasonally, high. But we don\u2019t really want to get into the details and percentages of it.\nAndrew DeGasperi: That\u2019s helpful. Just quickly on Onshape in terms of the channel, and how much you've essentially leveraged that, I mean, as at this point is it completely out there or is it just a select few that have been able to sell it? And if given the success, would you consider accelerating that process?\nJim Heppelmann: Yeah. So it\u2019s a couple of dozen right now, but it\u2019s a couple of dozen of the best ones, biggest investment. So what we did is, we said, you know, we have hundreds and hundreds of channel partners. But you know, there\u2019s definitely a kind of a tail, let\u2019s say to that. So let\u2019s start with the biggest best ones, the ones who are in best position to invest in new sales capacity, because they\u2019re still selling Creo and, and let\u2019s go ramp them up and see how it goes. So we started that last quarter. And by the way, we thought we would do this someday. But COVID convinced us we should do it right now. Because we just saw the pipeline just blossoming. And we said, you know, we just don\u2019t have the capacity to execute on this. And there\u2019s probably a lot more business that we\u2019re not even finding. So, you know, that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing there, we\u2019re taken a couple of dozen of our biggest and best resellers. They\u2019re ramping up incremental new capacity. And they\u2019re selling Onshape kind of into the lower end segment of the market, typically against SolidWorks. And they\u2019re continuing to sell Creo kind of that\u2019s slightly bigger and more sophisticated customers who, you know, for whatever reason really need that more advanced functionality of a higher end product.\nAndrew DeGasperi: Thanks, Jim.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Borg of Stifel. Your line is open.\nAdam Borg: Hey, guys and thanks for taking \u2013 hey, guys thanks for taking the question. Just a real question on OpEx as I think beyond this year, obviously I\u2019m not looking for guidance, but you guys have done a great job this year, you know, limiting OpEx spend. Some of that is one-time in nature, some of that is expense discipline. How should we think about OpEx grows more qualitatively going forward just given the opportunities that you\u2019re talking about and the attraction you\u2019re seeing? I know we\u2019ve talked in the past about OpEx going at half the rate of ARR. I\u2019m just curious if that thinking has changed? Thanks so much.\nKristian Talvitie: Yeah, great, Adam. Good, good question. You know, I think as a general rule of thumb, I think that\u2019s the right way to think about it. And that\u2019s, you know, certainly where we, you know, start with our planning process and we\u2019re in the middle of the planning process right now in any given year, we may, you know, flex that up or down. But over the longer-term, that\u2019s definitely the, you know, the starting point. But again, it can fluctuate a little bit depending on timing and opportunities we see in front of us.\nAdam Borg: Great and maybe just a quick follow-up. Any comments on just recent business trends in July versus what you\u2019re seeing in June? Thanks again.\nJim Heppelmann: All I would say is the quarter. You know, I was nervous as we came to the end of the quarter. And it was surprisingly not that stressful. So the quarter ended without a lot of fireworks and without a lot of angst and so forth it was actually quite relaxed. So that just tells me that it didn\u2019t get worse. It probably held together and you know, gives me more confidence looking at the Q4 forecast.\nAdam Borg: Thanks again.\nKristian Talvitie: Thank you, Adam.\nJim Heppelmann: Thanks, Adam.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes with Tyler Radke of Citi. Your line is open.\nTyler Radke: Hey, thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask about the growth business, obviously, the ARR decelerated there and I think, you know, you call out some headwinds as it relates to, you know, selling some of these new IoT deals into customers, you know, where you have to be on site? I guess, how are you thinking about the trajectory of the growth ARR? Is this kind of the trough? And would you expect that to accelerate next quarter with the, you know, just overall ARR expected to reaccelerate? And then, you know, in regions, whether it\u2019s China or Europe, you know, that are further along the reopening. Are you starting to see any signs of those IoT deals starting to pick back up just as things start to reopen? Thank you.\nJim Heppelmann: Go ahead.\nKristian Talvitie: Yeah, sure. Tyler, good question. You know, again, you know I think that the demand environment still remains a little bit challenging out there. So we\u2019re mindful of that. That said, echoing Jim\u2019s comments earlier, we do have committed backlog, if you will, of ARR coming into Q4, so we would actually expect to see fairly solid ARR performance for the growth business in Q4, just given some of that visibility that we have. Over the longer-term, you know, start looking into next year. I think that part\u2019s still open.\nJim Heppelmann: Yeah. And let me, maybe just say in Q4, you know, Q4 is always for us, a seasonally strong quarter. You know, we have a hockey stick in Q4. And we\u2019re telling you, we expect Q4 to be down less year-over-year than Q3 was, which means they\u2019re going to go a good step up. And it\u2019s not possible to achieve a good step up in bookings without IoT playing a major role. So there\u2019s a lot of IoT business in our Q4 forecast, certainly a sequential step up. And at the same time, you know, we feel like we\u2019re applying some conservatism there. So what I would say, Kristian said there\u2019s problems in the demand environment, I\u2019d actually say there\u2019s problems in the closing environment, because the demand is high. And so what we need to do in Q4 is called the right close rate. And I think in any case, we\u2019re going to have a sequential step up that\u2019s quite interesting, you know, in the IoT business, and therefore, this probably would be the trough in the in the growth rate of the growth business, ARR growth rate.\nTyler Radke: Right and then are you just seeing any type of demand differences in regions that are opening up faster than others?\nKristian Talvitie: Well, we have seen China, as an example, has continued to accelerate, which is, you know, good. That\u2019s both a function I think of their economy opening back up a little bit as well as, you know, our subscription model. Customers getting more comfortable with the subscription model in that region as well. You know, I think on a geo basis, we are looking for continued strong performance in Europe and Americas as well, but on a, you know, growth percentage, I think APAC would be the leader.\nTyler Radke: Okay, thanks.\nJim Heppelmann: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities. Your line is open.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Thank you, good evening. Hey, Jim, let me start with you on a technology question referring back to LiveWorx last month, the most valuable part of the conference so the various roadmap sessions for the various products, and was good to see that you\u2019re right hearing to the release cadences, particularly for Windchill and of course for Creo. The question I have is, when you think about the upcoming releases that it just hit in December and June next year, what do you think will be the most incremental or catalytic, new features and capabilities, I\u2019m highlighting PLM, because that\u2019s where I think a lot of the flux is technologically and in terms of the end markets. So when you think about that, what do you think could be the drivers? And then additionally, how are you thinking about the incremental effect possibly of the new Creo ANSYS simulation product for the higher end product that coming out with in the fall?\nJim Heppelmann: Yeah, let me take the second question first. I mean, there\u2019s two things simultaneously happening in our relationship with ANSYS. One is, we\u2019ve seen a nice pickup in the first wave of the Creo simulation live. And then as you point out, we\u2019re coming out with another wave of capability around the mainstream simulation suite that is called ANSYS AIM. So, you know, while we\u2019re getting momentum, we\u2019re also now going to broaden the portfolio. And I think we\u2019re optimistic about that. You know, PTC does have some capacity to sell simulation, we just decided we\u2019d rather sell with ANSYS then against them. So I think we have a best-in-class simulation suite now within our CAD environment. And there\u2019s customers certainly are interested in that. So I think that ANSYS partnership will continue to gain traction accordingly. And then, you know, on this Windchill thing, I do think there\u2019s two big things we\u2019re working on right now. And without getting deep in the details, responding to this digital transformation moment, is one of them. And then, although it won\u2019t ship in the near-term, you know, beginning to think about how do you go to a multi-tenant SaaS version or Windchill. We do sell Windchill and SaaS today, but it\u2019s single tenant. And what that means is that we don\u2019t have all the upgrades \u2013 all the benefits of regular upgrades, you know, every three weeks, the whole basis is upgraded and so forth. But we\u2019d like to go tackle that problem. We\u2019d like to do I because it represents incrementally more value to the customer. And it represents incrementally more value of the PTC. I mean, frankly, less wasted energy by everybody. Now, in the meantime, some of the things we are working on is even while it remains single tenant SaaS, we could do a lot to make the cost of ownership lower, which would benefit PTC when we provided the SaaS and benefit all those, all those customers who take it as on-premise. So I\u2019d say again, those two things more related to responding to digital transformation moment. And that includes integration with IoT and integration with the Vuforia Suite and stuff like that. And then, you know, preparing both tactically and strategically for a better SaaS future.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: For Kristian, how do you think the contribution from your partners, the total number, so to say that you get from them might evolve? If it\u2019s x today? Where do you think it might be 2, 3, 5 years from now and Microsoft has been very vocal in just the last couple of months about their commitment to the manufacturing market. They highlighted you. There are multiple use cases they\u2019re increasingly looking at, generally, but with what you do as well tied in. So when you think about all your partners, how does that footprint or ecosystem, whatever you want to call it proportionally, become more important to you?\nKristian Talvitie: Yeah, well, great question, Jay. I think that the, you know, the partner economy is extremely important to PTC. And, you know, that includes the more traditional partners as well as some of the more strategic as we call them alliances we\u2019ve had recently \u2013\nJim Heppelmann: And that\u2019s the role in the global system integrators.\nKristian Talvitie: Global system integrators, but you know, again, Rockwell, Microsoft, you know, ANSYS as well. And so, you know, as we look out over multiple years, you know, I think that there is, you know, historically, let me say it this way, historically, the channel contribution has been, you know, mid 20s to kind of 30% of PTC\u2019s overall business and as we look out over multiple years, we think that the opportunity for that is, you know, certainly to push, you know, the high 30s, approaching 40% of the, you know, approaching 40% of the business, you know, over a period of time.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Thank you.\nJim Heppelmann: Thank you, Jim.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nAndrew Obin: Hey, thanks a lot. Just a question on Onshape. You know, you guys sort of highlighted that revenue in the quarter was in line with expectations. We\u2019ve been hearing through channel checks that actually COVID locked down the fact that everybody works from home are actually stimulated a lot of demand for the product, a lot of interest. Do you see sort of the growth trajectory for Onshape being meaningfully impacted post-COVID of the next several quarters that we can notice from the outside?\nJim Heppelmann: Yeah, my view, Andrew is that two things are happening simultaneously. Some deals are being blocked, because companies are themselves in crisis mode and that tends to be larger deals. So there\u2019s a headwind for sure, slowing actually down. But then is this tailwind, bringing in more deals that would not have, if not for COVID, probably wouldn\u2019t have been in the forecast, meaning people are talking to us about because of COVID, I\u2019m talking to you. And so we think right now, the headwinds and the tailwinds are cancelling each other out. And we\u2019re basically on plan. However, we think at some point, when the economic fear subsides a little bit. I mean, companies going out of business, don\u2019t buy any software from anybody. But when they stop worrying about going out of business, and they start thinking about going back to business, then we think there\u2019s just the tailwind. And so the real answer is that, PTC has far more confidence in the future of Onshape than with the day we pulled the trigger on the acquisition nine months ago, we just feel like it was a great move both as a CAD tool, and then really something special in terms of this Atlas architecture that\u2019s going to help us in many ways.\nAndrew Obin: I mean just a follow-up question on-site access. Do you see any material improvement in July over June?\nJim Heppelmann: Again, our quarter is back-end loaded, okay. So we don\u2019t close near as much business in June as we do in July. So for us, the risk would be that we didn\u2019t close the business in July, but we did. Actually we landed our forecast came in above the guidance range we gave you. And so to us, July was certainly not worse than June and potentially better, because a back end quarter close more or less as expected.\nAndrew Obin: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Wong of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.\nKen Wong: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just one for you, Jim, you touched on this Navy deal potentially $25 million 5 years out from now, I guess how should we be thinking about the potential slope of that transaction from a ramp perspective? And then as we think about other areas of defense, is it fair to assume that this is something that could potentially map over to kind of other departments?\nJim Heppelmann: Yeah, okay those are both good questions. So first on the slope, let me just be clear, what we have is a pre-negotiated set of annual expansion options. We\u2019re not calling it a ramp, because they\u2019re not committed, they\u2019re options. Okay, so think of it like a ramp, but without the commitment, therefore, none of it\u2019s in backlog, none of it\u2019s in ARR, none of that stuff. It\u2019s just out there. But they\u2019re pre-negotiated and it\u2019s a pretty steady ramp that would get us from the initial deal, which by the way, the Navy disclosed some information on this. So I\u2019ll tell you, they disclosed that they had set aside $97 million for this contract. And they also disclosed that the first order was a little over $3 million. So think that we got a $3 million ACV order and there\u2019s a series of additional orders, if you added them all together over all the years, you know, plus a little bit of services gets you to that $97 million, they\u2019ve set aside for us. Now, again, just to be clear, we \u2013 the project needs to go well or you could imagine scenarios where we don\u2019t get that full ramp. Now, your second question.\nKristian Talvitie: So just to clarify on that, the first two years are in that 3, 3.5 \u2013\nJim Heppelmann: Okay, first two years and then 3.5, right. Fair enough. So two years upfront and then a series of expansion options. Thanks, Kristian. Now, first of all, the Navy doesn't only have ships, they have airplanes. And so there\u2019s Nav Sea, which is the deal we want and there\u2019s there's Nav Air and it\u2019s completely logical that the Navy would use the same system for the airplanes and that would, you know, potentially double it. But then absolutely, we\u2019re going to go pitch the same story to every other branch of the military who operates all these assets and really see if we can't get others to follow so. We think we have something special there. But you know, we\u2019re not going to call anything right now other than put that in the category of the digital transformation tailwind for PLM, because this is not engineering in CAD, it\u2019s digital product models under configuration management, for purposes of operations and support.\nKen Wong: Got it, well thanks for the detail. And actually maybe a follow-on, I guess beyond defense. I mean, it sounds like this is something that could potentially map out to kind of other end markets. Is that a fair statement? Or is this very defense-specific?\nKristian Talvitie: No, no, no it\u2019s not defense-specific at all. In fact, they\u2019re deploying commercial off-the-shelf software that we actually developed for initially for non-defense customers. So we\u2019re certainly engaged in similar discussions with other customers. And in fact, if you go to the LiveWorx event two years ago, some of you might remember, I was doing a configuration managed augmented reality inspection procedure against the Volvo truck engine. That\u2019s actually the same story, just a particular use case of it. So this definitely could go elsewhere. It\u2019s just of course these military commands operate such large numbers of assets of such high value that they\u2019re you know, really, really interesting if you can win them.\nKen Wong: Great. Thanks a lot, guys.\nJim Heppelmann: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question comes from Rich Valera of Needham & Company. Your line is open.\nRich Valera: Thank you. Thanks for fitting me in. Jim, a question for you on IoT. If you can put aside the logistical issues with deployment right now, I just wanted to get your sense of where that product is and its lifestyle \u2013 lifecycle in terms of adoption. And the things you\u2019ve done specifically to facilitate adoption to reduce the friction and getting customers to adopt it. I know you just rolled out kind of insights as a service, which I think is one of the things in that sort of ilk. And you\u2019ve also been working on sort of, I think, more templates to make it maybe more shrink wrapped and less customizable. But if you could just talk us through where that product is in its lifecycle and if you think there\u2019s kind of an inflection somewhere down the road as you all these things sort of coalesce to make it more of a final product, as opposed to, you know, custom deployment.\nJim Heppelmann: Yeah, and I think that\u2019s a great question, Rich, because I think the product has matured quite a bit as a great platform to develop and run IoT business applications, okay. But what we\u2019d like to do is have more than pre-developed exactly as you said. We\u2019d like it to be a solution in a way that has the platform in the background if you want it, but you\u2019d really rather buy the solution. You know, I kind of in the industry example that\u2019s a bit dated would be like salesforce.com and force.com. You know what I mean? Like force.com is there, if you bought salesforce.com, but most people really would focus on the CRM system or what have you. So just thinking about that for a minute, we\u2019d like to have more value-oriented, outcome-based solutions that are ready to go. And that\u2019s been a big focus at PTC, we hired a new executive to run that about a year ago now, Craig Melrose you know, a longtime McKinsey manufacturing expert. And so the reason I really like Craig is, he looks at it from a value standpoint. Hey, Mr. customer, what problems do you have? And what value could be created by solving those problems? And then we want to come and say, we have a solution that does exactly that. Let\u2019s not talk about developing anything, it\u2019s ready to go. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re aiming for. Again, I think at the platform level, we now have a very mature system and really we\u2019re focusing now on the solutions. This factory insight as a service is a down payment. But I think you know, in the next one and even two years, you\u2019re going to see us roll out a whole series of very interesting solutions that will change the way we sell. We\u2019ll go back to selling Enterprise Solutions built around the concept of IoT as opposed to an IoT platform you could use to build the Enterprise Solutions, which is kind of the world we\u2019ve been coming from.\nRich Valera: That makes sense. Thanks for that clarification, Jim.\nJim Heppelmann: Thanks, Rich.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our Q&A portion. I\u2019d like to turn this call back over to Tim for any closing remarks.\nTim Fox: Thanks, Valerie. And again, thank you, everyone for joining us today. We will be participating in a number of virtual events coming up this quarter. You can find all the details on our investor website. We look forward to seeing you on the conference circuit in the coming months and again, thank you for your interest in PTC and we all hope you have a great evening.

            "content": "Great, thanks, Jim and good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our result, I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance, and all growth rate references will be in constant currency. Let me start off with a brief review of our third quarter results, and then spend the balance of the call on our outlook for the remainder of the year. Q3 ARR was $1.21 billion, representing 10% year-over-year growth at constant currency, which was slightly above the guidance commentary we provided last quarter. The upside was driven by solid new ACV bookings, and only modest deterioration in churn which came in essentially in line with our forecast for the quarter. Q3 revenue of $352 million was up 20% year-over-year, driven by 28% recurring revenue growth. As we've discussed previously, revenue is impacted by ASC 606 and related business policy changes. Operating margin of 29% increased approximately 1,200 basis points over Q3 \u201819. And lastly, non-GAAP EPS of $0.62 increased almost a 180% year-over-year. Q3 free cash flow of $99 million was ahead of our expectations, driven primarily by the timing of collections, lower than allowed for customer concessions and lower than planned expenses such as travel and the virtual LiveWorx event. I think the key takeaway here is that even in the current macro environment, customers are clearly getting value from our solutions and paying largely on time. Moving on to our balance sheet, following the redemption of the $500 million of 6% senior notes in May, we ended Q3 with $1.1 billion of debt, including $1 billion of senior notes with a weighted average cost of debt of 3.8% and $138 million outstanding on our credit facility. We ended Q3 with cash and marketable securities of $435 million. We believe this is a very attractive and stable debt structure, especially in light of the current economic backdrop. Now, turning to guidance. Based on our Q3 performance and outlook for Q4, we're raising the low end of our ARR guidance, and now expect year-over-year ARR growth of 10% to 12% on a constant currency basis, versus our previous 9% to 12% range. At the low end of the ARR guidance, we expect new ACV bookings to be down approximately 30% for the back half of FY \u201820 versus our previous low end expectation of down 50%. At the high end of guidance, we continue to expect new ACV bookings to be down approximately 20% year-over-year and we're still expecting churn of approximately 8% for fiscal \u201820. It's worth noting that despite these declines in new ACV bookings and slightly increased churn, we're still able to target double-digit ARR growth, which is a testament to the strength of our recurring business model. Before I get into the guidance details, there are few important factors worth reviewing as it relates to ARR. First, as a reminder, the way that we define ARR is the total value of active ACV or Annual Contract Value contracts at the end of the quarter. This means the timing matters, both for new ACV bookings and renewal ACV bookings. In that, our subscription ACV is counted in ARR when contracts start. So, for example, if we book an order at the end of the quarter, but the start date is in the following quarter, it's not counted in ending ARR for that quarter, but instead goes into backlog. The key takeaway here is, that while we build a set of start date assumptions into our forecast and guidance, there's always some risk that start dates move, and hence ARR and backlog change accordingly. The second key factor is ramp agreements. A portion of our new ACV bookings are structured with annual committed ACV ramps that grow each year of the contract duration. The ramp agreements are great in the sense that they build future committed backlog which increases our ARR visibility in the future. However, if we book more ramp agreements than anticipated in any given quarter, this can also impact ending ARR and of course, backlog. Given the current macro environment, where customers are more cautious about their budgets and deployments, we've seen an uptick in demand for ramp agreements. We factored some of this into our guidance. But we believe it's important to call this out heading into what is our largest bookings quarter for the year. So now for the specifics, we're expecting fiscal \u201820 ARR of $1.24 billion to $1.2 6 billion, that's a constant currency growth rate of 10% to 12%. Relative to Q3, our ARR guidance includes approximately $5 million of positive FX impact. And the quarter-over-quarter increase in growth is driven primarily by both normal seasonality of our business, as well as our backlog of deals booked in prior periods. Turning now to free cash flow. For fiscal '20, we're expecting to deliver approximately $210 million which is an increase of about $10 million from our prior guidance, due to modestly higher expected ARR, solid collection activity and FX, and consistent with last quarter even though we haven't seen a material change in customer payment activity, we've built in some cushion for potential customer payment concessions. Please note that the interest payments for the two senior notes we closed in February will be paid in our fiscal second and fourth fiscal quarters, beginning this quarter, where the interests on the retired note was previously paid in our first and third fiscal quarters. For the full year, free cash flow guidance includes $45 million in restructuring costs, $9 million of acquisition related payments, $65 million of interest payments and CapEx investments in the low to 20 - low to mid $20 million range. Now turning to P&L guidance, we're expecting fiscal \u201820 revenue of $1.42 billion to $1.43 billion, that's an increase of $7 million at the midpoint of guidance, reflecting modestly higher ARR and subscription revenue. The resulting revenue range is growth of 13% to 14%. On the expense front, we remain diligent relative to our headcount additions and continue to limit hiring to critical roles, primarily in our growth businesses. We continue to target operating expense growth in the lower single-digits for fiscal \u201820 and an operating margin range of 27% to 28%, which is an increase of 700 basis points to 800 basis points year-over-year. Non-GAAP EP S is now expected to be $2.28 to $2.35, that's an increase of $0.04 at the midpoint of guidance, and represents 39% to 43% year-over-year growth. A final point on guidance, you'll note that the implied Q4 P&L guidance calls for a slowdown in year-over-year revenue and EPS growth. This slowdown is related to the accounting treatment of on-premise subscription revenue under ASC 606 and business policy changes we put in place in Q4 of '19. Subscription revenue under ASC 606 is also impacted by contract term length. So to the extent that term length change going forward, you should expect to see variability on a quarterly basis. That said, it is important to understand this has no impact on ARR or free cash flow as we continue to build customers annually upfront. Also, please note that we're guiding to a higher than normal seasonal increase in operating expenses for Q4. This is due in part to lower than normal expenses in Q3, with LiveWorx being held virtually this year, and other lower expenses such as travel, due to COVID related restrictions. And in Q4, we're also expecting for normal higher commissions, an uptick in new hires and also there are four more business days in Q4 than Q3 which drives incremental improvements as well. So to sum up with the caveats I described earlier about start date, timing and ramp contracts, we believe that our guidance to be appropriate. We continue to be diligent on expenses and protecting earnings without impairing our ability to make key investments in our growth businesses. And lastly, we have a strong and stable capital structure to support our profitable growth strategy going forward. While we're not providing fiscal \u201821 guidance at this time, it is worth noting that even under a scenario of prolonged economic softness, we would still expect solid ARR growth. And as a reminder, there will be additional free cash flow tailwinds in fiscal \u201821. Well, we expect CapEx to continue in the same mid 20s ballpark. Interest expense is expected to decrease roughly $25 million compared to fiscal '20, given our new debt structure, and assuming no restructuring, we would expect $30 million less of restructuring payments and assuming no acquisitions, another approximately $10 million less of actual acquisition related payments in fiscal \u201821. One additional note for those of you building models for fiscal '21. We will be moving to calendar quarters next year off of the modified four or five quarters we've had previously. We'll provide more details on this topic next quarter. So, wrapping up, we had another solid quarter, but recognize that the market is changing rapidly. We believe we're very well positioned to perform during the downturn, and to continue delivering significant value to our customers, which in turn will drive ARR growth well into the future. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator to begin Q&A. Well, as we've said numerous times before, we're not getting into the specifics around that just but we do have a fair amount of visibility into the ARR. Again, it's our largest bookings quarter of the year, which does make it a little bit harder to call around the \u2013 you know, the line of start dates and how much is actually going to come in this ramp deal. But from a fundamental, you know, how much business are we selling out to the market perspective, I think we feel pretty good about the, you know, about the prospects for Q4. And we feel good about the, you know, the ranges we've put out with those caveats. Yeah, great, Adam. Good, good question. You know, I think as a general rule of thumb, I think that's the right way to think about it. And that's, you know, certainly where we, you know, start with our planning process and we're in the middle of the planning process right now in any given year, we may, you know, flex that up or down. But over the longer-term, that's definitely the, you know, the starting point. But again, it can fluctuate a little bit depending on timing and opportunities we see in front of us. Thank you, Adam. Yeah, sure. Tyler, good question. You know, again, you know I think that the demand environment still remains a little bit challenging out there. So we're mindful of that. That said, echoing Jim's comments earlier, we do have committed backlog, if you will, of ARR coming into Q4, so we would actually expect to see fairly solid ARR performance for the growth business in Q4, just given some of that visibility that we have. Over the longer-term, you know, start looking into next year. I think that part's still open. Well, we have seen China, as an example, has continued to accelerate, which is, you know, good. That's both a function I think of their economy opening back up a little bit as well as, you know, our subscription model. Customers getting more comfortable with the subscription model in that region as well. You know, I think on a geo basis, we are looking for continued strong performance in Europe and Americas as well, but on a, you know, growth percentage, I think APAC would be the leader. Yeah, well, great question, Jay. I think that the, you know, the partner economy is extremely important to PTC. And, you know, that includes the more traditional partners as well as some of the more strategic as we call them alliances we've had recently \u2013 Global system integrators, but you know, again, Rockwell, Microsoft, you know, ANSYS as well. And so, you know, as we look out over multiple years, you know, I think that there is, you know, historically, let me say it this way, historically, the channel contribution has been, you know, mid 20s to kind of 30% of PTC's overall business and as we look out over multiple years, we think that the opportunity for that is, you know, certainly to push, you know, the high 30s, approaching 40% of the, you know, approaching 40% of the business, you know, over a period of time. So just to clarify on that, the first two years are in that 3, 3.5 \u2013 No, no, no it's not defense-specific at all. In fact, they're deploying commercial off-the-shelf software that we actually developed for initially for non-defense customers. So we're certainly engaged in similar discussions with other customers. And in fact, if you go to the LiveWorx event two years ago, some of you might remember, I was doing a configuration managed augmented reality inspection procedure against the Volvo truck engine. That's actually the same story, just a particular use case of it. So this definitely could go elsewhere. It's just of course these military commands operate such large numbers of assets of such high value that they're you know, really, really interesting if you can win them."

            "name": "Jim Heppelmann",
            "content": "Thanks, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone and thanks for joining us. I hope you and your families continue to stay safe and well during this crisis. I'd also like to thank the extended global PTC team for their continued hard work and commitment during this time of disruption. Before I jump into a review of our quarter, I'd like to briefly reflect on the Coronavirus crisis, and review the headwinds and tailwinds that's been creating for our business. In terms of headwinds, we all know that the COVID-driven economic downturn is creating profitability and even business continuity concerns for many companies around the world. Naturally, some of the affected companies are PTC customers and prospects. The second major headwind is the travel bans and work from home requirements, which slows down selling processes and interferes with on-site project work. As a result of these headwinds, we've seen pressure on bookings and some purchases get pushed out. Fortunately, to-date, the pressure has been somewhat less than we discussed in our guidance commentary last quarter. Our Q3 bookings were down mid 20% year-over-year, which is slightly better than the expectations we shared of down 30% to 50%. Based on the current forecast, we expect Q4 bookings growth rate to improve sequentially. The impact on renewal rates continues to be muted and we believe our previous guidance, suggesting a modest downtick and renewals remains an accurate assessment. So in aggregate, at this point, we think that the COVID crisis will continue to be a major headwind, but perhaps less so than we guided to last quarter. I'll remind you, however, that this situation remains very dynamic. And we don't have a crystal ball to see what lies ahead in the future. Like everybody else, we'd sure like to see a vaccine become widely available. At the same time, the COVID crisis is creating some strong tailwind still. We expect these tailwinds to persist for years to come long after the short-term headwinds fade as the health crisis passes. If there's one thing the crisis has illuminated for our industrial customers, it's the need to accelerate their digital transformation efforts. In my LiveWorx keynote, I talked about the key learnings our customers have seen as a consequence of the crisis. They include the need to embrace the mobile workforce, the need for tools that better enable impromptu collaboration across supply chain partners. The need to bring digital to the frontline workforce and the need to push forward with remote monitoring and optimization of products in factories. These needs very directly translate into elevated levels of interest for our PLM, IoT, Augmented Reality and SaaS solutions. The COVID situation is driving higher pipelines for Windchill for ThingWorx for the Vuforia and for Onshape. Each business is feeling the negative effects of the headwind still, but in cases like Vuforia and Onshape, the new tailwinds are strong enough to cancel most of the headwinds and these businesses continue to exhibit hyper growth rates. With Vuforia and Onshape in particular, where we have a deal push because of economic concerns, a new one tends to pop up because of the needs of the new normal. When the health crisis is ultimately managed down through a vaccine or other means, I expect that PTC will be in a very strong growth position as the tailwinds blow uncontested. With that, let me now turn to our Q3 results. Overall, we're very pleased with our performance. We delivered 10% ARR growth, which was above our expectation of high single-digit growth. We delivered very strong revenue and APS and exceptionally strong free cash flow in the quarter. Kristian will get into the details later. So let me focus on providing color on the trends we're seeing across our business segments. From a geographic perspective, ARR growth was evenly balanced with 10% year-over-year growth across all three major geographic regions. One notable area of performance was in China, which posted mid-teens ARR growth and early indicator that the economy there is on the path to recovery, and that our subscription model is gaining traction. Turning to our business performance by segment. Let me begin with our growth products, which as a reminder includes IoT, AR and Onshape. Growth product ARR grew 24% year-over-year, which is below our expectations for a normal environment. But consistent with the COVID dynamics we've discussed, which in particular, have extended sales cycles for new IoT customers. Remember that IoT is where the physical world meets the digital world. And we typically have to engage the physical world in the initial setup phase, so that we can then remotely monitor and control it thereafter. It's hard, for example, to make progress, selling a smart factory project to a new logo if the factory shut down or you're not allowed to go there for COVID reasons. But once the IoT systems in place, customers really see the value of remote monitoring and optimization and the expansion business remains brisk. Vuforia and Onshape are relatively less affected due to lightweight deployment models and their pure SaaS nature. Let me provide you some highlights in these two areas, starting with AR. We delivered a solid quarter overall with record Vuforia-Chalk, enterprise sales and acceleration in a six figure AR deals and we added substantially to the burgeoning AR pipeline, which will serve us well in the fourth quarter and beyond. You may recall that in response to the crisis back in March, we decided to provide free access to the Vuforia-Chalk, which is the entry level capability of the Vuforia-Suite that allows everybody to use their mobile device to see and markup real world frontline worker environments, such as factories and worksite. Chalk is proving to be incredibly helpful for remote support and problem solving. The adoption of Chalk has been exceptional, with daily production usage levels across the customer base, now running 5 times higher than before we launched the program a few months back. All those companies using Chalk now represent an exciting upsell pipeline to pursue in Q4 and beyond. Because of the strong adoption we've seen when we took the sales friction out of the way, we're moving toward a freemium program that positions Chalk as a basic offering that's an easy entry point into the broader Vuforia-Suite. One of the most interesting upsell opportunities is the Vuforia Expert Capture, a more advanced AR solution, which was a key driver in large AR deals in Q3. Expert capture is tailor-made for doing knowledge transfer between frontline workers in the remote work situation that our industrial customers are currently navigating. We had two notable wins in Q3 that highlight the value of our broader AR suite. The first is a leading US-based manufacturer of specialty measurement equipment, before the crisis hit, their services organization had kicked off an initiative to transform the way to deliver services to differentiate their offerings and improve operational efficiency. When the crisis hit, they encountered new services delivery challenges, because of travel bans and on-site restrictions. PTC introduced the Vuforia Suite through this free Chalk program. And in less than three months, the customer adopted and deployed Vuforia Chalk and Expert Capture across the Global Services team, using Vuforia that now delivering highly effective remote support and are capturing best practices from internal experts for distribution to their end customers. A second grade AR success story in the quarter was Philips Healthcare. As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded, Philips needed to significantly ramp up ventilator production to address the growing healthcare crisis. They faced two significant challenges. The first was accelerating training of new staff required to enable 24/7 production shifts. The second challenge was the travel ban which threatened to delay their new production capacity in India. PTC introduced Philips to our Vuforia Expert Capture solution and in less than 30 days, Philips was capturing expertise from technicians in the US, and remotely training new hires across the globe. Despite facing the same COVID headwinds that were navigating across our business, our pure SaaS Onshape CAD business, delivered a strong quarter. The Onshape organization had a solid bookings quarter, added a record number of new logos and is tracking to achieve their FY '21 \u2013 \u201820 plan. It's worth noting that in this challenging macro environment, Onshape's growth rate is more than 30 percentage points higher than the well known mainstream product it's most frequently displacing, which tells me that something interesting is happening. Another proof point for Onshape momentum is that the pipeline is 4 times larger today than when we acquired the company three quarters ago. To support this strong demand, we're making significant investments in Onshape go-to market, including expanding sales reach into Europe, which is a large market for design software. In Q3 Onshape also booked the first handful of orders from PTC's reseller channel, a new program that was just launched. We believe getting PTC VaRs in the game will open another exciting vector of growth for the Onshape business. We're proceeding full speed ahead on the Atlas program too, which aims to generalize the underlying Onshape SaaS architecture and put it to work more broadly across the entire PTC product portfolio. Work has progressed well on the Vuforia and generate design front and we're working towards the day when there are versions of Creo and Windchill that are fully multi-tenant SaaS. Thanks to the underlying Atlas platform they share with Onshape. Overall, we remain extremely excited about the opportunity to grow Onshape into the leading SaaS engineering design suite. As industrial companies rethink their innovation strategies for a new normal built around SaaS, there's no better solution than Onshape. Jon Hirschtick and John McEleney and the rest of the Onshape team have integrated seamlessly in the PTC and morale is very high. And they've never missed a beat in their frequent delivery schedules. Naturally, they love the Atlas strategy and we're very pleased with how this acquisition is unfolding. Lastly, in our growth business, I'd like to discuss IoT a bit more. As I mentioned earlier, we've seen pressure on new deal closure as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. While the new logo pipeline remains strong, the inability to engage with customers on-site, the scope and plan of the Enterprise Solutions has elongated sales cycles. But the interest level remains higher than ever. So we're confident that as we see the environment begin to stabilize and engagement activity resume, we'll get this part of the pipeline cranking back up. Meanwhile, we did see solid IoT expansion activity in Q3, which is a testament to the value customers are realizing with ThingWorx. We saw a balanced expansion across both the smart connected products use case and the smart connected operations use case. And from a vertical perspective, we continue to see broad-based demand in a core industrial space in high tech and electronics, and in aerospace and defense. But the real standout vertical in the quarter was the medical device industry, which has experienced less economic disruption during the crisis. Medical device companies like Abbott Laboratories and Hologic are continuing to expand their smart connected product deployments, enabling them to remotely monitor and service the product fleet seamlessly, despite the operational challenges caused by the pandemic. Our partner, Rockwell had a relatively good quarter of AR and IoT sales with a strong sequential tick up in business. Like PTC, Rockwell saw strong expansion sales, which is great for the success of the partnership as we have landed a lot of starter deals previously. Our partnership with Microsoft had a strong quarter across IoT, AR and PLM fronts. We were pleased to learn just recently that we won Microsoft's Global Manufacturing Partner of the Year Award for second consecutive year. We've recently extended this partnership into a new class of IoT solutions, called Factory Insight as a Service. This solution was launched a few weeks ago, is a three-way partnership with Rockwell Automation and Microsoft. Factory Insights as a Service is a turnkey cloud solution that enables manufacturers to achieve significant impact, speed and scale with the digital transformation initiatives. All three companies are taking it to market. Lastly, on IoT, in addition to solid expansion activity and healthy backlog and pipeline heading into the fourth quarter, our confidence in PTC's IoT market position was once again validated by the industry analyst community. Quadrant Knowledge Solutions identified PTC as the outright leader in industrial IoT platforms in this latest SPARK Matrix report, based on technology excellence and customer impact. We'll put this report on our Investor Relations website for you to reveal. To wrap up on a growth business, the punch line here is the COVID crisis creates a significant long-term growth opportunity for PTC, balanced against some near-term headwinds. We believe there are fundamental changes happening in the industrial economy that will play out in our favor over the coming years, bolstered by the strong alliances with Rockwell Automation and Microsoft, PTC is extremely well positioned to be a central part of the digital transformation strategies of our industrial customers. Turning now to the core business, we're very pleased with our Q3 performance with ARR growth of 10% once again, outpacing the market growth. The juxtaposition of Creo and Windchill being up are combined 10% in a quarter where DSOS, CATIA and INNOVIA businesses were down a combined 10% is interesting. I attribute that 20 point disparity to the great progress PTC has made to strengthen our products and to strengthen our business model. Q3 was the 11th consecutive quarter that our core ARR growth rate has been in the double-digits. With such steady and predictable performance over a long period now, it's obvious that we made tremendous strides, driving the cyclicality out of our core business. At this point, PMI fluctuations seem to have a more muted effect on PTC than they do on some of our peers. PTC's PLM business continues its streak of strong performance with mid-teens ARR growth in Q3. From a geographic perspective, PLM performance was broad based with double-digit growth across all three major geographies, led by the APAC region. The momentum in our PLM business was underscored by a major win with the US Navy, which we announced earlier this afternoon. Following a rigorous competitive process against a dozen other technology providers that concluded with a small initial win a year ago, we conducted a successful pilot program and we've now won a substantial expansion agreement to power a cloud-based digital transformation and modernization effort around the weapons readiness and war fighting capabilities of the Naval Sea Systems Command. This project will drive a fundamental change in the way the Navy operates and supports its fleet of ships and submarines. PTC software will be used to create a model based digital twin of each chip that will be used by more than 15,000 users and an expansive supplier network to optimize lifecycle costs and maximize operational availability. With additional options in place that could expand the ARR of this project to over $25 million in year five. This contract is poised to become PTC's largest run rate customer so long as we successfully execute. The Navy when reinforces, my earlier point about the digital transformation trends that are happening across the broader industrial economy and how they're driving new demand for PLM. Our PLM pipeline looks strong and with many more digital transformation projects being discussed. We feel the prospects of a new wave of secular PLM growth are increasing. Turning now to CAD. Our CAD team delivered a solid quarter with ARR growth in high single-digits. Growth across the GOs was mixed with APAC leading the way, followed by the Americas and Europe. In Europe, which has our largest CAD channel exposure, sales were more severely impacted by the COVID crisis, given the patchwork of government shutdown across the regions. But CAD renewal rates were extremely strong. We had solid results from Creo simulation live, our CAD solution that embeds real-time simulation from Ansys. We closed 10 expansion deals across a number of verticals like automotive, medical device and industrials. And we inked our first seven figure CSL deal with a large US government agency. It feels like we're gaining some steam with CSL and we look forward to launching new marketing programs in the coming quarters. And finally, our Focused Solution Group was flat, more or less it is expected given the difficult circumstances. With high profitability and low churn, this business continues to add real strength to the portfolio. To wrap up my comments, I think it's safe to say that we're operating in unchartered waters as we navigate through this pandemic. However, I couldn't be more pleased with our strategic position. And with our team's execution in the face of these challenging times. We're fully mindful of the headwinds the pandemic will place on new business, as we continue to target double-digit growth in ARR, revenue and EPS for the year. We're confident that once this crisis passes, we'll be well positioned to drive even higher levels of growth, margin expansion and shareholder value creation. With that, I'll turn it over to Kristian, who'll take you through more details on the financial results. Yeah. Well, Matt, good catch there. Because, you know, I think it really is ultimately a very large opportunity. But let me be clear, it's kind of a mid to long-term thing, because we're really looking at doing kind of a major redevelopment of those properties onto this platform. And You know, the key thing for us would be to optimize for compatibility and continuity. So I sort of \u2013 I have an analogy I've shared internally many times and probably help with investors as well. You know, if you think of Google Docs, it's a completely fresh thought, fresh look at, let's say, Office Productivity Suite. Meanwhile, you had Microsoft Office, which was on-prem. But Microsoft came out with Office 365, which was SaaS, and companies like PTC might have been thinking about whether or not we should go to Google Docs. I mean, many, many do, and particularly new companies, but as companies who have been using Office forever, really do prioritize compatibility of data and user experience, but we like to have SaaS. So you could imagine we could build a product that looks a lot like Creo. But it runs in the cloud and is multi-tenant, but you open up your same old files and you go right back to work with the same old user interface, much like you did with Office 365. Meanwhile, Onshape's over here are more like Google Docs, unbridled, unconstrained innovation, no legacy, trying to invent the next generation of application. So I think Onshape fights the fight against competitors and Atlas allows Creo and Windchill to bring their customer base with. Again, it'll take us, I'm going to say a couple of years to do this. You know, I partly tell you, because it's part of our commitment, I really go to SaaS. It is a long-term monetization effort that's significant, because while we've brought our customers from perpetual to subscription, there's another and potentially bigger monetization associated with bringing them from on-prem into SaaS. So I'm excited about that. You know, and really, to me, if the Onshape acquisition seemed expensive, I mean, it was, but what people didn't realize is that we were getting both a breakthrough CAD system, but also a breakthrough CAD platform that will allow Creo and Windchill, you know, to get into that SaaS world years earlier than they would have independently and on a consistent platform. So that is, we bring our customers to SaaS, everything's knitted together on a common platform as well. So we're very excited about it. But you know, I want to be clear, it's not a short-term strategy. I think, though, if you're looking about \u2013 let me just add one more comment. If you're thinking about, are there any drivers for longer-term, strong growth in CAD and PLM, I would say, yeah, there's kind of two that have captured my attention. One would be the movement of Creo and Windchill, the SaaS and the second one is something I mentioned which is the digital transformation story around Windchill that's starting to get more and more traction. Hey, Saket. Yeah, I think, you know, when I talk to my sales team, and when I spend a lot of time with customers, I think that, you know, in the past PLM followed CAD around, now it's starting to follow digital transformation initiatives. And what really happens there is, industrial companies say, how could we think about, you know, taken ourselves through a digital transformation that didn't involve digital product data, you know, being under control and well managed and so forth. So I think like the Navy example, it's got nothing to do actually with engineering. It's about a model driven, you know, operation and support paradigm. And it's got nothing to do with following CAD around. It's really about how do you use that data to transform the way products are operated and serviced and supported, you know, during the lifecycle out in the field. And that's a great example of the kind of initiatives we're hearing more and more about, as people saying that product data could be useful for a lot more than engineering. And if we want to try to do that, you know, this digital threat discussion, reuse it for manufacturing, reuse it for service, potentially use it for sales and marketing. If we want to do that, we got to get it under better control. And Windchill excels at that, you know, it's already a SaaS and web-based system. And it differentiates well, you know, every single Magic Quadrant report you've seen in years Windchill's way up front, in terms of its, you know, competitiveness, let's say. And I just think that digital transformation has become a real driver. Yeah. And maybe just to add, Andrew. I mean, clearly, Q4 has forever been a seasonally strong quarter for bookings. And so it's natural that it would be a seasonally strong quarter for backlog as well. So, you know, we start Q4 with kind of seasonally high backlog. And then we're going to \u2013 and some of that new bookings will land in the quarter and some of it will go back in the backlog. So again, what Kristian saying is, the real risk here is calling the timing of it, because how much of the new bookings lands in backlog versus in the quarter? I mean, that's actually important to the way we report, although it's actually not important to the \u2013 how well the business is doing. You know, the important thing there is, how much business do we go get? So I'd say seasonally, high. But we don't really want to get into the details and percentages of it. Yeah. So it's a couple of dozen right now, but it's a couple of dozen of the best ones, biggest investment. So what we did is, we said, you know, we have hundreds and hundreds of channel partners. But you know, there's definitely a kind of a tail, let's say to that. So let's start with the biggest best ones, the ones who are in best position to invest in new sales capacity, because they're still selling Creo and, and let's go ramp them up and see how it goes. So we started that last quarter. And by the way, we thought we would do this someday. But COVID convinced us we should do it right now. Because we just saw the pipeline just blossoming. And we said, you know, we just don't have the capacity to execute on this. And there's probably a lot more business that we're not even finding. So, you know, that's what we're doing there, we're taken a couple of dozen of our biggest and best resellers. They're ramping up incremental new capacity. And they're selling Onshape kind of into the lower end segment of the market, typically against SolidWorks. And they're continuing to sell Creo kind of that's slightly bigger and more sophisticated customers who, you know, for whatever reason really need that more advanced functionality of a higher end product. All I would say is the quarter. You know, I was nervous as we came to the end of the quarter. And it was surprisingly not that stressful. So the quarter ended without a lot of fireworks and without a lot of angst and so forth it was actually quite relaxed. So that just tells me that it didn't get worse. It probably held together and you know, gives me more confidence looking at the Q4 forecast. Thanks, Adam. Go ahead. Yeah. And let me, maybe just say in Q4, you know, Q4 is always for us, a seasonally strong quarter. You know, we have a hockey stick in Q4. And we're telling you, we expect Q4 to be down less year-over-year than Q3 was, which means they're going to go a good step up. And it's not possible to achieve a good step up in bookings without IoT playing a major role. So there's a lot of IoT business in our Q4 forecast, certainly a sequential step up. And at the same time, you know, we feel like we're applying some conservatism there. So what I would say, Kristian said there's problems in the demand environment, I'd actually say there's problems in the closing environment, because the demand is high. And so what we need to do in Q4 is called the right close rate. And I think in any case, we're going to have a sequential step up that's quite interesting, you know, in the IoT business, and therefore, this probably would be the trough in the in the growth rate of the growth business, ARR growth rate. Thank you. Yeah, let me take the second question first. I mean, there's two things simultaneously happening in our relationship with ANSYS. One is, we've seen a nice pickup in the first wave of the Creo simulation live. And then as you point out, we're coming out with another wave of capability around the mainstream simulation suite that is called ANSYS AIM. So, you know, while we're getting momentum, we're also now going to broaden the portfolio. And I think we're optimistic about that. You know, PTC does have some capacity to sell simulation, we just decided we'd rather sell with ANSYS then against them. So I think we have a best-in-class simulation suite now within our CAD environment. And there's customers certainly are interested in that. So I think that ANSYS partnership will continue to gain traction accordingly. And then, you know, on this Windchill thing, I do think there's two big things we're working on right now. And without getting deep in the details, responding to this digital transformation moment, is one of them. And then, although it won't ship in the near-term, you know, beginning to think about how do you go to a multi-tenant SaaS version or Windchill. We do sell Windchill and SaaS today, but it's single tenant. And what that means is that we don't have all the upgrades \u2013 all the benefits of regular upgrades, you know, every three weeks, the whole basis is upgraded and so forth. But we'd like to go tackle that problem. We'd like to do I because it represents incrementally more value to the customer. And it represents incrementally more value of the PTC. I mean, frankly, less wasted energy by everybody. Now, in the meantime, some of the things we are working on is even while it remains single tenant SaaS, we could do a lot to make the cost of ownership lower, which would benefit PTC when we provided the SaaS and benefit all those, all those customers who take it as on-premise. So I'd say again, those two things more related to responding to digital transformation moment. And that includes integration with IoT and integration with the Vuforia Suite and stuff like that. And then, you know, preparing both tactically and strategically for a better SaaS future. And that's the role in the global system integrators. Thank you, Jim. Yeah, my view, Andrew is that two things are happening simultaneously. Some deals are being blocked, because companies are themselves in crisis mode and that tends to be larger deals. So there's a headwind for sure, slowing actually down. But then is this tailwind, bringing in more deals that would not have, if not for COVID, probably wouldn't have been in the forecast, meaning people are talking to us about because of COVID, I'm talking to you. And so we think right now, the headwinds and the tailwinds are cancelling each other out. And we're basically on plan. However, we think at some point, when the economic fear subsides a little bit. I mean, companies going out of business, don't buy any software from anybody. But when they stop worrying about going out of business, and they start thinking about going back to business, then we think there's just the tailwind. And so the real answer is that, PTC has far more confidence in the future of Onshape than with the day we pulled the trigger on the acquisition nine months ago, we just feel like it was a great move both as a CAD tool, and then really something special in terms of this Atlas architecture that's going to help us in many ways. Again, our quarter is back-end loaded, okay. So we don't close near as much business in June as we do in July. So for us, the risk would be that we didn't close the business in July, but we did. Actually we landed our forecast came in above the guidance range we gave you. And so to us, July was certainly not worse than June and potentially better, because a back end quarter close more or less as expected. Yeah, okay those are both good questions. So first on the slope, let me just be clear, what we have is a pre-negotiated set of annual expansion options. We're not calling it a ramp, because they're not committed, they're options. Okay, so think of it like a ramp, but without the commitment, therefore, none of it's in backlog, none of it's in ARR, none of that stuff. It's just out there. But they're pre-negotiated and it's a pretty steady ramp that would get us from the initial deal, which by the way, the Navy disclosed some information on this. So I'll tell you, they disclosed that they had set aside $97 million for this contract. And they also disclosed that the first order was a little over $3 million. So think that we got a $3 million ACV order and there's a series of additional orders, if you added them all together over all the years, you know, plus a little bit of services gets you to that $97 million, they've set aside for us. Now, again, just to be clear, we \u2013 the project needs to go well or you could imagine scenarios where we don't get that full ramp. Now, your second question. Okay, first two years and then 3.5, right. Fair enough. So two years upfront and then a series of expansion options. Thanks, Kristian. Now, first of all, the Navy doesn't only have ships, they have airplanes. And so there's Nav Sea, which is the deal we want and there's there's Nav Air and it's completely logical that the Navy would use the same system for the airplanes and that would, you know, potentially double it. But then absolutely, we're going to go pitch the same story to every other branch of the military who operates all these assets and really see if we can't get others to follow so. We think we have something special there. But you know, we're not going to call anything right now other than put that in the category of the digital transformation tailwind for PLM, because this is not engineering in CAD, it's digital product models under configuration management, for purposes of operations and support. Thank you. Yeah, and I think that's a great question, Rich, because I think the product has matured quite a bit as a great platform to develop and run IoT business applications, okay. But what we'd like to do is have more than pre-developed exactly as you said. We'd like it to be a solution in a way that has the platform in the background if you want it, but you'd really rather buy the solution. You know, I kind of in the industry example that's a bit dated would be like salesforce.com and force.com. You know what I mean? Like force.com is there, if you bought salesforce.com, but most people really would focus on the CRM system or what have you. So just thinking about that for a minute, we'd like to have more value-oriented, outcome-based solutions that are ready to go. And that's been a big focus at PTC, we hired a new executive to run that about a year ago now, Craig Melrose you know, a longtime McKinsey manufacturing expert. And so the reason I really like Craig is, he looks at it from a value standpoint. Hey, Mr. customer, what problems do you have? And what value could be created by solving those problems? And then we want to come and say, we have a solution that does exactly that. Let's not talk about developing anything, it's ready to go. So that's what we're aiming for. Again, I think at the platform level, we now have a very mature system and really we're focusing now on the solutions. This factory insight as a service is a down payment. But I think you know, in the next one and even two years, you're going to see us roll out a whole series of very interesting solutions that will change the way we sell. We'll go back to selling Enterprise Solutions built around the concept of IoT as opposed to an IoT platform you could use to build the Enterprise Solutions, which is kind of the world we've been coming from. Thanks, Rich. Thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the PTC 2020 Second Quarter Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Tim Fox, PTC's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nTim Fox: Great. Thank you, Valorie. Good afternoon everybody and thank you for joining us today on PTC\u2019s conference call to discuss our fiscal Q2 \u201820 results. On the call today are Jim Heppelmann, Chief Executive Officer; and Kristian Talvitie, Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding future financial guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in PTC's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. As a reminder, we will be referring to operating and non-GAAP financial measures today during the call. Discussion of our operating metrics and these items excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings press release and related Form 8-K. And lastly, references to growth rates will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted. With that, let me turn the call over to Jim.\nJim Heppelmann: Thanks Tim. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. I hope you and your families are safe and well during this crisis. Before I jump into review of our quarter, I'd like to start by thanking our tens of thousands of customers around the world for their continued support and loyalty. Many of our customer relationships date back two and three decades now, which shows how important the relationships have been to both parties. We've been through several crises together and we'll get through this one too. I'd also like to thank PTC\u2019s 6,000 employees around the globe for their hard work and commitment during the crisis. The way our team has embraced the remote work environment, while pushing forward to strategic initiatives and leaning in to support our global customer base, is a testament to the great culture we built here at PTC. Overall, we are very pleased with our fiscal Q2 results. We delivered 11% ARR growth, 25% revenue growth and 117% EPS growth. We did experience some bookings pressure related to the pandemic in the final weeks of the quarter, resulting in new ACV bookings being down mid-teens year-over-year. The impact came late in the quarter and was greater in Europe and Asia and within our smaller channel customers. Renewals were essentially unaffected by the crisis in Q2. Looking ahead, we\u2019re mindful of the pressure that the pandemic would place on new bookings and our guidance reflects that. Still we continue to target double digit organic growth in ARR, revenue and EPS for the full year, despite factoring in the potential of severe demand challenges and modest renewal headwinds as well. I am very pleased that PTC remains able to provide such a strong outlook, given the very conservative guidance assumptions that Kristian will outline later in the call. Our strong Q2 results and outlook are not due to luck or happenstance, but are attributable to several successful strategic and operational initiatives we've executed over the past few years. These actions were initially taken to position PPC as a premium software company in a timeless manner, but they are proving to be particularly fortuitous in the current crisis environment. I am referring to our business model transition, our successful expansion into high growth IoT and AR markets, our recent embrace of a pure SaaS future through the Onshape acquisition and the restructuring we did earlier this year before the pandemic arrived. Because of these changes, PTC is positioned to hold up well during the downturn and we are very well positioned to drive even stronger growth in shareholder value creation once this crisis passes. Q2 ARR growth rates were 10% for the Core business, 30% in the Growth business, and low single digits in the Focus Solutions Group. Each business performed just modestly below the level we would have expected without the crisis. The datas in the prepared remarks and there's nothing particularly notable there. So instead of going deeper into Q2 results, let me instead use my time to take you through the strategic changes we've made to transform PTC into a company that's well positioned for this downturn. Understanding these changes will help illuminate the confidence we have in our guidance and in our longer term future. The biggest change has been our successful transition to a subscription business model that was completed last fall as we wrapped up fiscal 2019. Today over 95% of our software revenue is recurring. In stark contrast to the 2009 financial crisis, where double digit bookings decline led to double digit revenue and earnings declines for PTC. Our fiscal 2020 guidance is targeting double digit organic ARR growth with even higher levels of revenue growth, plus expanding margins that drive strong EPS growth and solid free cash flow. This is despite Q2 new bookings declines and the assumption of more significant year-over-year bookings declines in Q3 and Q4. The recurring nature of our model is allowing us to largely protect earnings and cash flow without materially impacting our ability to make key investments in our growth businesses to further extend our competitive positioning. The second big challenge \u2013 the second big change over the past few years has been the expansion of the markets we serve, enabled by strategic changes in our product portfolio. I think there's broad consensus that inside this terrible crisis it is digital technologies that are coming to the rescue and keeping many of us productive to avoid a much worse situation. As we've seen with video calls, anything digital that empowers a distributed workforce and embraces remote work is the most compelling of all. Fortunately for PTC IoT, ARR and PLM are all about remote work. Digitizing product data, and factory data and worker expertise so that it can be used by a distributed workforce is the very point of these technologies. We expect that the new normal that follows this crisis will create stronger tailwind to the already high growth IoT and AR markets and will make PLM more relevant than ever. Let me double click on augmented reality. PTC\u2019s Vuforia AR suite allows companies to capture and digitize human expertise for purposes of collaborating with, training and supporting remote frontline workers. We\u2019ve all seen Zoom, Teams and Go to Meeting usage explode for knowledge workers, but these tools don't bring any value to frontline workers. Vuforia does essentially what Zoom does, but for frontline workers. And there are three times more frontline workers, than knowledge workers on the world. Vuforia is a strong leader in industrial AR and PTC really stands to benefit as enterprise AR adoption accelerates. Here is an interesting proof point. In response to the crisis, we decided to provide free access to Vuforia Chalk, the entry level capability of the Vuforia suite. Think of the Vuforia Chalk as like a FaceTime call that allows you to see and mark up the real world environment at the frontline workers\u2019 factory or work site. It's incredibly helpful for remote support and problem solving. By making Chalk free for the crisis period, we eliminated sales friction and quickly introduced AR for the first time to thousands of companies who were desperate for an immediate solution. Rockwell Automation and other companies partnered with us in promoting this initiative. Here in the U.S. National Association of Manufacturers embraced AR as a key strategy for their manufacturing constituents and promoted our free Chalk initiative. The NAM went a step further and published a paper that Professor Michael Porter and I co-authored on the topic of using AR to drive front line worker productivity, which you can find on our Investor website. The adoption of Chalk has been amazing and daily Vuforia Chalk AR collaboration traffic soared to levels 10 times higher than it was before the crisis. These companies using Chalk represent a big upsell pipeline to pursue in Q4 and beyond. Please check out ptc.com/freechalk to learn more, including a nice case study that discusses Toyota's use of Chalk to provide remote support the factory workers. Toyota incidentally is currently our largest Chalk customer. Moving on to IoT. From the beginning, PTC's IoT story has been about remote monitoring of smart connected products and remote monitoring of smart connected factories. Many medtech companies use PTC IoT solutions and we've already experienced large spikes in IoT usage as several medical diagnostics customers rush to launch new smart connected diagnostics and treatment equipment to respond to the COVID crisis. Because IoT and AR are both such strong drivers of digital transformation, ThingWorx and Vuforia solutions are frequently used together to allow customers to remotely monitor and diagnose assets and then to allow remote experts to collaboratively troubleshoot with front-line workers even from the safety of their homes. In a joint study that PTC and BCG recently published, we found that 81% of IoT projects see added value in AR, while 76% of projects that started with AR see real value in adding IoT. There's an important takeaway here. IoT and AR together form the foundation for a new era called spatial computing. This wave will be big, but it's just starting to form. Last week, PTC launched our first spatial computing offering called Vuforia Spatial Toolbox. I'm very excited about the possibilities for spatial computing in the industrial world of plants, factories and work sites and with best-in-class IoT and AR solutions to build on. PTC has a real competitive advantage as this wave comes together. Our Windchill software has been a real hero during the COVID crisis too, because Windchill has been a pure web application from the start. It doesn't matter where you are or what device you have, you still have full access to product data and full ability to participate in the process. We received accolades from numerous Windchill customers regarding how effective the software has been in their transition to a work from home environment. Because every manual or paper based process at their site came to an abrupt stop. Many customers have asked us to help accelerate and broaden their deployments because there was no hiccup in any process where PLM was used. PLM is more in fashion now than it ever has been. While AR, IoT and PLM are all about remote work, CAD is a different story. Mainstream CAD is an on-premise market today with 99% of current professional CAD seats installed on desktop workstations. These CAD environments prove more challenging in a work from home scenario because engineers were denied access to their workstation at the office that contain both their applications and data. This situation will have to change in a new normal that embraces remote work, which brings me to the next PTC strategic change I'd like to highlight, which is our effort to transition the engineering software industry, the full SaaS leveraging our Onshape acquisition. Working from home is more difficult with CAD because engineers don't have the big workstations at home to load the software on. No matter which mainstream CAD tool they use, many industrial companies have been forced to implement painful workarounds like using Citrix to gain access to the CAD software and data on a workstation back in the office. I talked last week to the CIO of a major automotive OEM. He said that he now has thousands of knowledge workers working from home and his biggest challenges have been an engineering. His company uses a competitor's PLM system that unlike Windchill has a fat client. So even his PLM system isn't readily accessible from home, he was exasperated by the state of engineering software and in complete agreement that we really need to bring the engineering world to SaaS so it can enjoy the benefits we now take for granted across the rest of our business systems. Frankly, our acquisition of Onshape could not have been timelier. If you want SaaS and engineering, Onshape is the only native SaaS product development platform on the market. Onshape users thrived during work from home because all their functionality and data lives in the cloud at all times. They can easily access their work from home at any time on any device, including a MacBook, Chromebook, phone or tablet. If it's hard to imagine what true SaaS means to CAD, take this 15 second test. Fire up a web browser and go to our Investor Relations website and then click on the Onshape link you see there. In about 15 seconds, you'll be in a full blown professional CAD system interacting with 3D model of a ventilator or a robot you pick. That's it. The implementation is done, you're in production. There's nothing like that in the industry and because it took the veteran Onshape team six years and more than $100 million to build the platform, PTC has a major lead as we enter this phase of SaaS acceleration. Onshape is not a big business yet, but of all our product lines that had the best performance relative to plan in Q2 and showed strong year-over-year bookings growth. As the crisis deepens, the level of Onshape interest grew commensurately and the pipeline is very strong going forward. Because it's so easy to get started with more than a dozen community-based emergency response programs aiming to develop new personal protection equipment and ventilators adopted Onshape globally. These efforts typically involve some combination of academic, commercial and government entities, joining forces to quickly design and manufacture a novel approach to respond quickly to the emergency shortages. This is a perfect fit for Onshape, teams discussed that we can either go implement a common CAD system or we can just start using Onshape right now. It's like calling an Uber rather than buying a car and securing a place to park it. The level of innovation and speed observed in these community projects is causing industrial companies to rethink their rigid supply chain strategies. And instead, look for technologies they can use to encourage and lubricate impromptu collaboration. We saw a related phenomenon happening in the education market. Many universities and many high schools have a 3D CAD curriculum in their engineering or STEM programs. most frequently using SolidWorks because all major CAD systems like SolidWorks run exclusively on Windows workstations and students generally have MacBooks, Chromebooks or iPads. Students are forced to provide a special PC computer room on campus where all CAD work must be done. The computer work has \u2013 the computer room has always been a pain because a lot of extra work and money for the school and students can't work from their dorm or classroom. But in this crisis, the computer room has become a showstopper because it's simply inaccessible because schools needed an immediate work from home solution to get back on track, Onshape education signups have soared to levels never seen before, especially during the middle of a school year. Likewise because of the coronavirus, the popular FIRST robotics program had to cancel their physical robot building season, but we worked with first to offer virtual Robots to the Rescue program and more than 400 virtual student teams quickly spring back to life and join this online CAD based robot competition. We estimate that Onshape has taken five to 10 points of education market share already in the past two months. And I expect things to really heat up during the summer back-to-school planning season. Winning an education is really important because infusing college new hires with the latest thinking so that they can influence the commercial companies that hire them is a proven sales and marketing approach in the CAD industry. We believe that COVID crisis will accelerate the SaaS tipping point for the engineering and software industry by several years. With this belief, we've been thinking about SaaS more broadly. For example, what about our installed customer base? What can we do there? As we mentioned in November, our acquisition thesis viewed Onshape as a CAD application built on a multipurpose SaaS platform. We saw the underlying SaaS platform as big a prize as the new CAD system and we've been investing heavily there. We'll be shining a light on this platform at live works in introducing it, using the code name Atlas. Think that Atlas will carry the PTC SaaS world on its shoulders. We're making great progress to extend Atlas more broadly across the PTC portfolio and we're deep into the work required to have it carry the frustum generative design capabilities and the Vuforia AR suite. I expect that we'll have the first brand new Atlas based deliverables in the market yet in calendar 2020. The long-term goal at PTC is to have a broad and seamless portfolio sharing a common SaaS infrastructure. We'll have more info at live works, which by the way has been converted to a virtual event that you're all welcome to attend. The bottom line is that I really liked the Onshape acquisition back in November, but I like it even more now. The timing could not have been better. The work-from-home genie won't go back in the bottle and it's now clear that we will need to embrace a more distributed and agile workforce and we've ever known before. That future will need SaaS based PLM, IoT, AR and CAD more than ever and PTC\u2019s years ahead of competition across this waterfront. The last change I want to talk about is restructuring and cost management. As we entered fiscal 2020, we announced a restructuring plan to shift resources into our SaaS initiatives. As we executed that strategy throughout the fall and winter, we reduced costs more than the original plan, which you can see in our higher restructuring costs. This coupled with lower travel costs plus an intentional slowdown in hiring and cancellation of various live events like LiveWorx has us tracking toward a spending number that's well below our plan for the year. Even as we continue to invest aggressively in new technologies like SaaS and AR, we still expect to deliver strong operating margin expansion in fiscal 2020. Before I wrap up, I'd like to share one other piece of important news, which is that PTC just launched Creo 7 in the market two weeks ago during the work-from-home period. This is a huge release for us because it brings to market a frustum generative design technology. It adds fluid dynamics to the ANSYS live simulation capabilities and lays the groundwork for the mainstream EM simulation suite to ship with Creo this fall. It introduces multi body design and has a host of improvements related to additive manufacturing and more. While I'm excited about our opportunity to take share in the transition to SaaS, that's a long-term strategy. In the meantime, Creo 7 is a big advancement in terms of our ability to continue to win and renew Creo customers with this flagship product line. In summary, because of the tough decisions PTC previously action to change our business model to expand in the growth markets like IoT and AR to launch into SaaS with Onshape and to work on our cost structure. We're very well positioned to perform during the downturn and to thrive in the new normal the inevitable turnaround will bring. It's a difficult market out there, but I couldn't be more pleased with PTC\u2019s positioning in it. And with that, I'll turn it over to Kristian to take you through the quantitative results.\nKristian Talvitie: Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I begin \u2013 before I review our results, I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance and all growth rate references will be in constant currency. Let me start off with a brief review of our second quarter results and then spend the balance of the call on our outlook for the remainder of the year. Q2 ARR was $1.18 billion representing 11% year-over-year growth, which is consistent with the guidance commentary we provided last quarter and slightly better than on our March 10 business update call. Similar to other software peers, we did see a deterioration in new bookings in the last few weeks of the quarter. However, due to factors such as backlog and timing of start dates, we still achieved strong new ACV growth. And as Jim mentioned earlier, Q2 churn came in essentially on plan. So the net result of all that was 11% ARR growth. Q2 revenue of $360 million, was up 25% year-over-year driven by 35% recurring revenue growth. Operating margin of 29%, increased 1,400 basis points over Q2 2019 and lastly, non-GAAP EPS of $0.59 increased almost 200% year-over-year. Q2 free cash flow of $82 million was within our expectations and included $18 million of restructuring payments primarily associated with the workforce reduction actions we began in Q1 2020 and $2 million of acquisition related payments.  Moving on to our balance sheets, we ended Q2 with $1.6 billion of debt, including $1.5 billion of senior notes and $148 million outstanding on our revolving credit facility. And we had cash and marketable securities of $884 million. As you know, in January we announced that we will redeem the $500 million of 6% notes due in 2024 on May 15 of this year. Following this redemption, we will have $1 billion of senior notes with a weighted average cost of debt of 3.8% it's also worth noting that the maturity dates on these new notes extended to 2025 and 2028 respectively and will have approximately $350 million of cash and marketable securities. We believe this is a very attractive and stable capital structure, especially in light of the current economic backdrop. Now turning the guidance. Let me begin by providing some context on our outlook and our underlying guidance assumptions for the balance of the year. As Jim discussed earlier, while we were pleased with our Q2 results, we did see some pressure on new bookings in the final weeks of the quarter. Conversely, renewal activity was strong throughout Q2. In addition, the majority of our Q3 renewals take place during the first month of the quarter and April renewal rates were largely on track. Given the uncertainty around the duration and depth of the current economic slowdown, we've revised our fiscal 2020 outlook to assume continued deterioration and the demand environment for the remainder of the year. From a demand perspective, you will recall that a certain portion of our new ACV is backlog, meaning it was previously committed in a prior period and therefore not really impacted by a macroeconomic induced downturn and our new bookings assumption relates only to the new business that has not been yet committed. At the same time, only the contracts that are up for renewal in any given period can experience churn, not the full ARR base. Well, we do not share the specifics of new deals sold or proportion of expiring contracts, I do think it's important to outline this nuance so you can understand how our guidance range contemplates and market demand at both the high and low end of the ARR range. So with that as a backdrop, let me share with you our thinking on ARR for the remainder of the fiscal year. At the low end of the range, we assume a severe disruption in new bookings growth in Q3 and Q4 with both quarters down approximately 50% year-over-year. To be clear, this level of deterioration is not what our internal forecast is calling for, but given the uncertainty of the environment, we wanted to provide an appropriately conservative outlook for the low end. The mid-point of the range assumes new bookings are down about 30% in the back half. This is in line with the commentary we provided on March 10th, as well as in line with our performance in fiscal 2009. But it's also well below what our internal forecast is calling for. The high end of the range assumes new bookings are down 30% year-over-year in Q3 and modest sequential improvement in Q4, but still down about 20% year-over-year, again, this scenario also modestly below internal expectation. In addition to account for the possibility of lower retention rates in the back half of the year, we've increased our churn rate assumptions on both the low and high-end of the range. Now, instead of assuming a modest year-over-year improvement in churn, we're factoring in a churn rate of approximately 8% for fiscal 2020. Through Q2, approximately 20% of our churn was related to customer loss, primarily smaller customers in the channel with the remainder of the churn related to downgrades. Lastly, we're anticipating our professional services business will face headwinds over the next few quarters. We're seeing regions like Southern Europe, where projects are being paused or postponed and industries like automotive and retail and footwear and apparel are more heavily impacted. On the positive side, our professional services teams and most geographies are able to continue their work remotely, so the slow down is primarily related to new implementation, where the potential deals are being pushed out into a lesser extent a temporary pause for ongoing projects. We also saw a strong move of training to a virtual format even in more conservative areas such as the CAD and PLM markets and in countries like Germany and Italy. What is particularly noteworthy is Jim mentioned earlier, is that the strength of the recurring business model could not be more evident. Even with these declines in new bookings and increased churn, we're still targeting double-digit ARR growth for the year. Now for this specifics, we're expecting fiscal 2020 ARR of $1.22 billion to $1.2 6 billion, that's a growth rate of 9% to 12%. Relative to Q2, our ARR guidance includes approximately $7 million of negative FX impact, and we expect Q3 ARR growth to be in the high single-digits with ARR growth accelerating in Q4. This increase is driven primarily by both normal seasonality of our business and our backlog of new deals booked in prior periods. Now turning to free cash flow. For fiscal 2020, we're expecting to deliver approximately $200 million, which is down about $30 million from our prior guidance and includes $10 million of additional restructuring charges related to our reorganization in the first half and a $5 million negative FX impact. And even though we haven't seen a material change in customer payment activity, we've also built some caution into our collections forecast for the back half of the year. For the full year, free cash flow guidance includes $45 million of restructuring costs, approximately $10 million of acquisition-related payments, $65 million of interest payments and CapEx investments in the low-to-mid $20 million range. Now, turning to the P&L guidance, we're expecting fiscal 2020 revenue of $1.4 to $1.43 billion, that\u2019s a decrease of about $70 million at the mid-point of guidance. Again, revenue is somewhat funny concept for an on-prem subscription company under ASC 606. So while our ARR, which is essentially our subscription and support billings on a trailing 12 month basis is down about $45 million at the midpoint, revenue will be down $70 million, reflecting an additional $17 million reduction in professional services, $5 million reduction in perpetual license revenue and shorter expected contract durations as we're seeing more customer opt for one year terms, given the macro backdrop. The resulting revenue range is growth of 11% to 14%. As I mentioned earlier, to ensure we can mitigate the impact of lower top line growth on earnings and cash flow, we're taking additional steps beyond our early restructuring actions to control expenses by limiting new headcount additions to critical roles in our growth businesses, that in conjunction with lower travel expense, lesser spend on events such as live works and lower expected variable compensation expense sets us up well to deliver on the margin front despite a $70 million reduction in revenue at the midpoint. The result is that, we expect a tighter operating margin range of 27% to 28% compared with our previous guidance of 26% to 29%. This is an increase of 700 basis points to 800 basis points year-over-year. Non-GAAP EPS is now expected to be $2.20 to $2.35, which is only a decrease of $0.12 at the mid-point of guidance and represents 34% to 43% growth year-over-year. So to sum up, we feel our guidance has an appropriate and prudent amount of conservatism, considering all the current exoticness factors, we've taken measures to control expenses and protect earnings without impairing our ability to make key investments in our growth businesses and to further extend our competitive positioning. And lastly, we have a strong and stable capital structure to support our profitable growth strategy going forward. Well, we're not providing fiscal 2021 guidance at this time. It is worth noting that even under a scenario of economic softness, we still expect ARR to grow. And with spending control that PTC has demonstrated for many years, we also expect to generate free cash flow growth. Bear in mind, there will be some free cash flow tailwinds in fiscal 2021, and while we expect that CapEx will continue in the same mid-20s ballpark, interest expense is expected to decrease roughly $25 million compared to the fiscal 2020 outlook, given the debt structure we put in place and assuming no new restructuring, we would expect approximately $30 million less of restructuring payments and assuming no acquisitions and other approximately $10 million less of acquisition related payments in fiscal 2021. So wrapping up, we had a solid quarter, but recognized the market is changing rapidly. We believe, we're well positioned to perform during the downturn and continue delivering significant value to our customers, which will in turn drive ARR and free cash flow growth well into the future. So with that, I'd like to thank everyone for their time and I'll turn the call over to the operator to begin Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Saket Kalia of Barclays Capital. Your line is open.\nJim Heppelmann: Hey, Saket.\nSaket Kalia: Okay, great. Hey Jim, hey Kristian. Thanks for taking my questions here. Hey Jim, maybe, first for you. Can you talk a little bit about the pipeline in the IoT business? I think we said in the prepared remarks clearly not a lot of big deals being signed there in this environment particularly closer to the end of the March quarter. But how about interest/pipeline for IoT for the remainder of this year?\nJim Heppelmann: Yes, Saket. Just this morning actually we did go through the pipeline kind of in preparation for the call. And the IoT pipeline is pretty strong. The question for us is close rates and the risk that some of that pipeline pushes back a quarter or whatever, from Q3 to Q4 and Q4 to Q1.  So we have plenty to work with. Plenty to support our forecast that, as Kristian said, is well above the guidance range we've given you. We're being conservative around close rates in the forecast and being double conservative in the guidance, because we're worried about software that has to be implemented in bigger ticket purchases might get delayed. I doubt it's going to get canceled. But it's just what we saw at the end of the quarter was, if you needed to buy software, you had to implement. But everybody is being sent home and you don't know how to implement it, we'll then want to just wait until we all come back to the office and buy it then. And so that to me is the risk. But it's not really a question of pipeline, it's really a question of close rates. And that's generally true across the board.\nSaket Kalia: That makes a lot of sense. Kristian, maybe for my follow-up for you, can you just talk a little bit about the slightly higher churn assumption? You talked about sort of where that comes from downgrades versus smaller customers. But I'm curious, as you think about that assumption in the guide, are you starting to see any headcount reductions at your customers that would maybe contribute to that forecast? Or is that maybe another element of conservatism? \nKristian Talvitie: Yes. So again, here, we haven't really seen major headcount reductions in our customer base. But an effort to, again, provide a prudent and conservative outlook. We thought that was the right thing to do to factor in some extra churn. It's a dicey market environment right now.\nJim Heppelmann: Yes Kristian said this, but to reiterate, we've not seen COVID-related churn thus far.\nSaket Kalia: Got it. Very helpful guys. Thanks very much for the color.\nJim Heppelmann: Thanks again.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Vruwink of Baird. Your line is open.\nJim Heppelmann: Hey Joe.\nKristian Talvitie: Hey Joe.\nJoe Vruwink: Hey, hello everyone. I just wanted to be clear on, I guess, guidance versus internal expectations. So are your internal expectations that you referred to closer to what you're actually seeing in the market today and guidance presents a dramatically, I'll say, worse scenario ultimately? Is that a fair characterization?\nJim Heppelmann: Yes. I mean, we have a forecast. That's our internal expectation. Keep in mind, new bookings were down 16% last quarter. Going forward, our forecast would have it down more than 16%, but still above the entire range that Kristian gave you. So the truth is none of us know what's going to happen in the coming quarters. We just don't. So rather than assume it's going to be good and get surprised when it's bad, we're assuming it's going to be kind of bad. And hopefully, if there's a surprise, it will be to the good side. But certainly, we're looking at a forecast that's above the high end of the guidance range.\nKristian Talvitie: And again just to follow-on to that, just to put the guidance range, the midpoint where new bookings down, call it, in the 30% range in Q3 and Q4. That's the kind of the levels of deterioration that we saw back in 2009, right? We've provided that even at our Analyst Day scenario. And the low end contemplates something even more difficult than that environment.\nJoe Vruwink: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then a lot of companies seem to be going back to the 2009 playbook. Obviously, PTC has provided a lot of detail with the mid-March update, and now just in regards to how new ACV trended during that period of time. I guess when you compare and contrast the pieces of the portfolio that were around in 2009, has anything held up, I guess, surprisingly better? And then when you look at the pieces that have been added, and obviously, you spoke to Onshape and the strength there, but with some of the newer pieces over the last decade, can you maybe speak to how that's helping provide the resiliency or helping provide the offset, given this is a pretty tough environment your customers are going through?\nJim Heppelmann: Yes. I mean, for sure. I think if you look at 2009, we were really a CAD and PLM company. And those businesses combined \u2013 those markets combined were growing single digits, probably upper single digits at the time. We didn't have the growth engines we have now. And I spent a lot of time upfront to say, actually, this COVID crisis will probably create a substantial tailwind for our SaaS business, our IoT business and our AR business. Maybe not immediately, but definitely, some of it is happening immediately. Our AR pipeline is off the charts. So it's hard to know for sure how to compare this to 2009. I would say we definitely have a growth year portfolio and a more relevant portfolio in the context of this crisis than we had in the context of that crisis. And then as Kristian said, the high end of our guidance sort of assumes it's as bad as 2009, and the low end of our guidance assumes it's much worse than 2009.\nJoe Vruwink: Okay, great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJim Heppelmann: Hi, Matt.\nMatt Hedberg: Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. Really do appreciate a lot of the detail that you guys gave, that's super helpful. Jim, I'm wondering, your guidance outlines a variety of new booking scenario, which I think is helpful relative to ARR. Now given this is a clearly back-end loaded quarters, I'm wondering if you can comment on new booking trends you are seeing thus far in April? It sounds like renewals, and as Kristian said, remained strong this month. But wondering if you're seeing any signs of change in new bookings, maybe beyond what you saw in Q2?\nJim Heppelmann: Yes, I mean, as you said, we do have relatively back-end loaded quarters. And that said, we do track what we call the done number, which is what percent done are we versus this point in a typical quarter? And relative to the forecast, the done number is just fine. But it's early and it's not that meaningful when it's this early.\nMatt Hedberg: That's helpful. And then I like the done number, we got to use that more often. And then I guess, in terms of your global model, obviously you've got a very diversified model globally. And I think in your prepared remarks, you noted some new bookings weakness in Europe and Asia, in particular this past quarter. I'm wondering though if you can comment on, if you're seeing any signs of improvement or stabilization in some of these pockets internationally that are showing signs of reopening. I'm thinking like China, maybe pockets of Asia, anything of note there as if some of those economies start to open up a little bit?\nJim Heppelmann: Yes. I mean, in China in particular, even by the end of the last quarter, we saw hints of come back and definitely when we look at the forecast for this quarter, it's up quarter-over-quarter, it's up nicely. So I think we do see China coming back online and spending coming back into the system. The U.S. of course is two steps behind that, right. So last quarter, Europe was in a deeper funk than the U.S. and maybe by the end of the quarter we'll see Europe improving. I don't know. And part of the problem right now is none of us know, none of us know what's going to happen. So what we tried to do is give guidance with a lot of prudence as Kristian said. And then be transparent on the level of prudence we put in the guidance so that you can decide if it should be more or less based on your own deal of what's going to happen in the world.\nMatt Hedberg: Sounds good. Thanks a lot guys. Thanks for all the details.\nJim Heppelmann: Thank you.\nKristian Talvitie: Thanks Matt.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Borg of Stifel. Your line is open.\nAdam Borg: Great. Thanks for taking the question, guys. And again, appreciate all the commentary as well. Just real quickly on ARR. So in the past, Kristian, you've talked about ramp deals in the back half of the year. Just curious, I want to confirm that those committed ramp deals that we've talked about, you haven't seen any impact to that or have some of those ramp deals been renegotiated and I have a follow-up?\nKristian Talvitie: No, we're not seeing, at this point, meaningful changes to the previously committed ramps. I mean, I think\u2026\nJim Heppelmann: Well, I mean, the thing you have to understand is their contracts. And once you sign a contract, if somebody comes and said hypothetically, we'd like to renegotiate that, our reaction is, we wouldn't \u2013 there's a whole lot of contracts we have too that we'd like to renegotiate. We have a lease on a brand new headquarters. It's been empty for six weeks. I'd like to renegotiate that, but the vendor doesn't seem to want to renegotiate it with me. So I'm just saying these are contracts, that there isn't renegotiation unless there's something in it for us too and simply taking them down would just be a win loss and difficult to get us to sign up for that.\nAdam Borg: Perfect. I appreciate that. And just as a quick follow-up, I don't think I heard anything yet about the partnerships with Rockwell, ANSYS, we talked a little bit about Creo Simulation Live, but any color you can provide on how Rockwell \u2013 Creo Simulation Live and even the Microsoft partnership did in the quarter? Thanks again.\nJim Heppelmann: Yes. I passed on that simply to save time because I wanted to talk about the strategic perspectives, but all three main partnerships did okay in the quarter. Probably of them all, Microsoft was the strongest. But with Rockwell, we had some great wins. Rockwell had some great wins. Rockwell has taken us into some amazing new accounts and I'll let them speak about their accounts. And then with ANSYS, we also had some good sales. I don't think we probably were on plan with ANSYS, but in general, we weren't on plan with anything. So I think all three partnerships posted a decent quarter. None of them particularly notable in either direction, all of them suffered a little bit in the context of what happened to everybody late in the quarter.\nAdam Borg: Great. Thanks again.\nKristian Talvitie: Thanks Adam.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities. Your line is open.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Thanks. Good evening. Jim, your comments on product strategy were quite interesting, including the reference to the forthcoming Atlas release. My question there before my follow-up for Kristian is could you put all of those comments and your strategic outlook in the context of the close with lifecycle management strategy that we've talked about that you've talked about. What are perhaps some of the metrics or milestones that you would think about to validate that the strategy is viable, that it is having an impact in the marketplace and maybe throw in some Onshape roadmap comments into that. And then secondly, for Kristian, your cost containment efforts were certainly quite apparent from the very large reduction in your open positions over the last few months down over 60% since the end of 2019 for all open positions. In that number, there was an especially large decline in sales openings, which I suppose is understandable given the bookings outlook. But is there some longer term implication in there in terms of how you were thinking about your sales structure. Maybe driving to more of an inside sales structured in support of Onshape and SaaS, generally and you\u2019re thinking perhaps about any kind of further R&D or even product line consolidations, maybe end of lifeing anything or anything along those lines.\nJim Heppelmann: Yes. So Jay, I'll take the first one. To share with people some terminology so rather than say Vuforia will be based on Onshape, which sounds funny. Let's say Onshape is based on Atlas and Vuforia will also be based on Atlas. And we will bring other technologies onto the Atlas platform. And this Atlas platform will evolve over time and at some point it actually will look materially different than what we acquired from Onshape because we've taken it in other directions as well. For example, Vuforia needs a computer vision engine in the platform and Onshape didn't, but that's okay. No Atlas will have a computer vision engine for anything that needs it and then AI engine for IoT and so forth. But to get to the gist of your question today, we have a closed loop life cycle management story with significant properties being subscription but on-premise, in particular Creo. And Windchill has a lot of on-premise, but we also do sell that as SaaS. And so what we'd like to do is somewhere down the road, have a complete 100% SaaS based closed-loop life cycle management suite that passes that 15-second test. You click on a link, and within 15 seconds, you're in any part of the suites doing anything that we can do. We are not there today, but and the industry is far from there by the way. And so I think that what PTC has is a lead and now we see an exogenous factor as Kristian said, that's a wake up call that this industry have to move to SaaS pronto and pronto won't be quick, but it's going to be a lot quicker than I might have thought it was three months ago. And so PTC is going to press our advantage is as hard as we can and try to be the company that brings this industry to SaaS. And it's going to require a lot of work from us in the coming quarters and even years. But I think it could represent a significant share shift. Because of the industry goes to SaaS and we're far ahead of everybody pulling the industry there, we might definitely benefit from that. We're seeing it happen in education. That's why I started up that story is as you know, to imagine taking five points or 10 points of educational market share in two months. I couldn't have dreamed to that. But I can now in the context of this crisis.\nKristian Talvitie: And Jay then to answer the second through seventh questions\u2026\nJay Vleeschhouwer: At least that.\nKristian Talvitie: That you sneakily wrapped all into one. Let me just try to sum it up this way. To a certain degree, PTC was fortunate with the timing of the reorganization that we did in the first half, which was actually pre-global pandemic and therefore unrelated. It was really more around reorganizing around the growth businesses. And, now as this struck, we had actually taken out more costs than perhaps originally anticipated. But that now puts us in a position where as we start looking at the back half much of that cost control, we can really just think about it as how, and when we want to release the spicket. We all want to get back to a stage where we're all hiring and growth is happening. So we want to be mindful of that and we're watching carefully what's going on in the market. But in the meantime, it's more like a slow drip on when and where we're hiring and we're trying to be pretty thoughtful about where we're adding capacity right now to take most advantage of the situation.\nJim Heppelmann: Yeah. Maybe I can add two tidbits to that that might be helpful. One is when we did this restructuring, we set out to do a reduction in force, but then we said, what we've moved to this new headquarters and that might be causing some pressures associated with the commute and so forth to some people. And they might leave anyway if it's a problem. So why don't we have a voluntary program and by the way, an early retirement program. And so we serve those two programs up with really only but an estimate of what might happen. And we had fairly good adoption of the voluntary and early retirement programs. So we ended up taking out more people than we probably would have taken out by a reduction in force. We said, okay, that's fine. We'll hire them back. But guess what? We're not going to hire them back. So you might say, it's almost like we've done a reduction in force by going below the headcount we intended to be at and then electing not to go back up. So that's a little bit why our cost structure has come down so much. And then, we definitely are still hiring. I can tell you what we're hiring developers for sure in our AR business, in our SaaS business and we're making selective hires here and there and also doing portfolio work within the portfolio. So for example, based on the demand we've seen for Onshape, we've shifted a fair amount of inside sellers into selling Onshape just did that recently. So don't yet have results. But we're responding to what we see as interesting demands in the market. We also did something else we turned our premier channel resellers, loose \u2013 or we're just doing that now, turning them loose with the right to sell Onshape. We hadn't intended to do that. But we said, hey, wait a minute. If the industry suddenly wants SaaS-based CAD and we alone have it, let's not miss this opportunity. Let's put capacity on it. So thinking that is just within the headcount and within the ecosystem, we're also doing some portfolio management to move resources to where the demand is the strongest.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Thank you.\nJim Heppelmann: Thank you, Jay.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJackson Ader: Thanks. This is Jackson Ader on for Sterling tonight. Question from our side, maybe on the go-to-market motion. Jim, you explained how any of us can go to ptc.com couple of clicks. We're using Onshape. So I was just curious, the required legwork for maybe an Onshape net new logo relative to the on premise world. Can you just give us a flavor for just how much easier or less friction there is with, with an Onshape, onboarding relative to the on-premise?\nJim Heppelmann: Yes, well, again, there's no software and there's no data at the customer sites. So we skip all those phases of installation and so forth. And then as you might expect with a SaaS product, all the demonstrations and so forth are done digitally, virtually over the web. So definitely Onshape is set up for a digital go-to-market process and that's really what we're trying to leverage. Now that said, if you want to get in bigger deals, where there's more switching costs, more perceived risk in switching, no matter what you're switching to, you might have to call on people and have live conversations with them and so forth. So I think it's definitely more than just selling over the web, but it's not at all like pounding the pavement and making cold calls and stuff like that kind of the old fashioned direct sales way. So I think it's somewhere in the middle and that's why we're pulling more of our inside sales and more of our resellers into the game.\nJackson Ader: Okay, great. Thank you. And then the follow-up question on services. So you mentioned services were cut \u2013 but which services are still happening and which services where maybe cut the most, what types of services?\nJim Heppelmann: Well, let me just say, it's probably hard to categorize it by type, but let me do my best. So any services work that have to be performed onsite is a problem, because generally speaking, we're not allowed to go onsite, we're not allowed to travel there. And by the way, if we went onsite, probably the customer wouldn't be there anyway. So I would say as a characterization, onsite work is where the problem is. Good amount of our work is done offsite and really has been for years in part to take advantage of lower cost labor and so forth. So if you give us a project in Europe, we're probably going to do it in Romania, even if the actual project is in France or something like that. So that kind of work has gone full speed ahead, but it's really services work that requires onsite for example, if you're going to stand up IoT in a factory, somebody really has to go to the factory and assess all the physical assets that are there and determine how to connect to them. And it's hard to do that project without ever being in the factory. You maybe don't have to be in the factory all the time, but you at least have to go there to kick off the project. So I think it's those projects in the near-term, while we're in lockdown mode that require onsite work that are most challenged.\nJackson Ader: Makes sense. Thank you.\nJim Heppelmann: Thanks, Jackson.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Koenig of Wedbush. Your line is open.\nJim Heppelmann: Hey, Steve.\nSteve Koenig: Hi gentlemen. Hey. Thanks for taking my question. I'll just \u2013 I'll make it one question. So \u2013 and I apologize if this is repetitive with either scripted or QA remarks. I'm curious, I heard the remarks on your guidance and how you're thinking about it in comparison with 09, and that sounds sensible and it sounds pretty robust. I'm wondering though the composition of \u2013 particularly by vertical Jim, I'm curious on your view as you look out across your verticals kind of the relative, maybe resilience of the verticals and maybe one way to do it is to stack rank them if you want it to, but kind of any generalizations you can make regarding the financial crisis and the relative impact on your verticals versus this crisis and any relevant supply chain disruptions or other factors that affect those verticals.\nJim Heppelmann: Yes, well. Maybe I could start by saying where we have the highest concentrations would be, what I'm going to call generalized industrial. That would be everything from John Deere to machine tools and factories to Carrier air conditioning equipment. That's our biggest vertical at this point in time. Our second vertical is Aerospace and Defense, which by the way particularly on the defense side is where we're strong, is not really suffering that much, the U.S. government is not dialing back, they're leading in. The third thing would be Electronics and High-Tech, but that's not really consumer electronics, it's really more business-to-business type of electronics equipment. So those would be our three biggest exposures. And then if you get down to places like Automotive, you're talking single-digits which is good because automotive is a tough industry. If you get into commercial aviation, it's not that big, again, we're much bigger than defense. If you think about places like, there is been questions about airlines. Well airlines are less than 5%. I think airlines and retail together are less than 5% of our ARR. And by the way, the business we do with airlines is around spare parts management. And we don't so much \u2013 it's not about new sales, it's more about renewals. And as long as they own those airplanes, they're going to own spare parts for them, whether they're flying them or not. And I don't think any airline that's still in business is going to stop managing spare parts because they won't be able to get back into business. They'll never put those airplanes in the air again, if they give up on the spare parts. So it feels like the parts of this particular economy that I hit the worst really are not the places where PTC has the deepest exposure. And in particular, I'm probably referring to automotive here, which I think is probably one of the toughest places to be.\nSteve Koenig: Got it. Great. Well, thanks, Jim. Thanks, Kat.\nJim Heppelmann: Thanks, Steve.\nKristian Talvitie: Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: Thank you. I\u2019d now like to turn the conference back over to Jim for any closing remarks.\nJim Heppelmann: Thank you, and thanks everybody for joining us today. So in addition to LiveWorx going virtual, a lot of investor are going virtual as well. We're going to be at a bunch of them in this quarter beginning with JP Morgan\u2019s Global TMT Conference on May 14th. So, look out on our website for the other events as they get posted. So we do look forward to seeing you on the conference circuit, hopefully. And if not, hopefully you can join us at the LiveWorx event, information is up on the website for that as well. And lastly, thank you for your interest in PTC and have a great and safe evening. See you all later. Bye-bye.\nJim Heppelmann: Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating, you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kristian Talvitie",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I begin \u2013 before I review our results, I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance and all growth rate references will be in constant currency. Let me start off with a brief review of our second quarter results and then spend the balance of the call on our outlook for the remainder of the year. Q2 ARR was $1.18 billion representing 11% year-over-year growth, which is consistent with the guidance commentary we provided last quarter and slightly better than on our March 10 business update call. Similar to other software peers, we did see a deterioration in new bookings in the last few weeks of the quarter. However, due to factors such as backlog and timing of start dates, we still achieved strong new ACV growth. And as Jim mentioned earlier, Q2 churn came in essentially on plan. So the net result of all that was 11% ARR growth. Q2 revenue of $360 million, was up 25% year-over-year driven by 35% recurring revenue growth. Operating margin of 29%, increased 1,400 basis points over Q2 2019 and lastly, non-GAAP EPS of $0.59 increased almost 200% year-over-year. Q2 free cash flow of $82 million was within our expectations and included $18 million of restructuring payments primarily associated with the workforce reduction actions we began in Q1 2020 and $2 million of acquisition related payments.  Moving on to our balance sheets, we ended Q2 with $1.6 billion of debt, including $1.5 billion of senior notes and $148 million outstanding on our revolving credit facility. And we had cash and marketable securities of $884 million. As you know, in January we announced that we will redeem the $500 million of 6% notes due in 2024 on May 15 of this year. Following this redemption, we will have $1 billion of senior notes with a weighted average cost of debt of 3.8% it's also worth noting that the maturity dates on these new notes extended to 2025 and 2028 respectively and will have approximately $350 million of cash and marketable securities. We believe this is a very attractive and stable capital structure, especially in light of the current economic backdrop. Now turning the guidance. Let me begin by providing some context on our outlook and our underlying guidance assumptions for the balance of the year. As Jim discussed earlier, while we were pleased with our Q2 results, we did see some pressure on new bookings in the final weeks of the quarter. Conversely, renewal activity was strong throughout Q2. In addition, the majority of our Q3 renewals take place during the first month of the quarter and April renewal rates were largely on track. Given the uncertainty around the duration and depth of the current economic slowdown, we've revised our fiscal 2020 outlook to assume continued deterioration and the demand environment for the remainder of the year. From a demand perspective, you will recall that a certain portion of our new ACV is backlog, meaning it was previously committed in a prior period and therefore not really impacted by a macroeconomic induced downturn and our new bookings assumption relates only to the new business that has not been yet committed. At the same time, only the contracts that are up for renewal in any given period can experience churn, not the full ARR base. Well, we do not share the specifics of new deals sold or proportion of expiring contracts, I do think it's important to outline this nuance so you can understand how our guidance range contemplates and market demand at both the high and low end of the ARR range. So with that as a backdrop, let me share with you our thinking on ARR for the remainder of the fiscal year. At the low end of the range, we assume a severe disruption in new bookings growth in Q3 and Q4 with both quarters down approximately 50% year-over-year. To be clear, this level of deterioration is not what our internal forecast is calling for, but given the uncertainty of the environment, we wanted to provide an appropriately conservative outlook for the low end. The mid-point of the range assumes new bookings are down about 30% in the back half. This is in line with the commentary we provided on March 10th, as well as in line with our performance in fiscal 2009. But it's also well below what our internal forecast is calling for. The high end of the range assumes new bookings are down 30% year-over-year in Q3 and modest sequential improvement in Q4, but still down about 20% year-over-year, again, this scenario also modestly below internal expectation. In addition to account for the possibility of lower retention rates in the back half of the year, we've increased our churn rate assumptions on both the low and high-end of the range. Now, instead of assuming a modest year-over-year improvement in churn, we're factoring in a churn rate of approximately 8% for fiscal 2020. Through Q2, approximately 20% of our churn was related to customer loss, primarily smaller customers in the channel with the remainder of the churn related to downgrades. Lastly, we're anticipating our professional services business will face headwinds over the next few quarters. We're seeing regions like Southern Europe, where projects are being paused or postponed and industries like automotive and retail and footwear and apparel are more heavily impacted. On the positive side, our professional services teams and most geographies are able to continue their work remotely, so the slow down is primarily related to new implementation, where the potential deals are being pushed out into a lesser extent a temporary pause for ongoing projects. We also saw a strong move of training to a virtual format even in more conservative areas such as the CAD and PLM markets and in countries like Germany and Italy. What is particularly noteworthy is Jim mentioned earlier, is that the strength of the recurring business model could not be more evident. Even with these declines in new bookings and increased churn, we're still targeting double-digit ARR growth for the year. Now for this specifics, we're expecting fiscal 2020 ARR of $1.22 billion to $1.2 6 billion, that's a growth rate of 9% to 12%. Relative to Q2, our ARR guidance includes approximately $7 million of negative FX impact, and we expect Q3 ARR growth to be in the high single-digits with ARR growth accelerating in Q4. This increase is driven primarily by both normal seasonality of our business and our backlog of new deals booked in prior periods. Now turning to free cash flow. For fiscal 2020, we're expecting to deliver approximately $200 million, which is down about $30 million from our prior guidance and includes $10 million of additional restructuring charges related to our reorganization in the first half and a $5 million negative FX impact. And even though we haven't seen a material change in customer payment activity, we've also built some caution into our collections forecast for the back half of the year. For the full year, free cash flow guidance includes $45 million of restructuring costs, approximately $10 million of acquisition-related payments, $65 million of interest payments and CapEx investments in the low-to-mid $20 million range. Now, turning to the P&L guidance, we're expecting fiscal 2020 revenue of $1.4 to $1.43 billion, that's a decrease of about $70 million at the mid-point of guidance. Again, revenue is somewhat funny concept for an on-prem subscription company under ASC 606. So while our ARR, which is essentially our subscription and support billings on a trailing 12 month basis is down about $45 million at the midpoint, revenue will be down $70 million, reflecting an additional $17 million reduction in professional services, $5 million reduction in perpetual license revenue and shorter expected contract durations as we're seeing more customer opt for one year terms, given the macro backdrop. The resulting revenue range is growth of 11% to 14%. As I mentioned earlier, to ensure we can mitigate the impact of lower top line growth on earnings and cash flow, we're taking additional steps beyond our early restructuring actions to control expenses by limiting new headcount additions to critical roles in our growth businesses, that in conjunction with lower travel expense, lesser spend on events such as live works and lower expected variable compensation expense sets us up well to deliver on the margin front despite a $70 million reduction in revenue at the midpoint. The result is that, we expect a tighter operating margin range of 27% to 28% compared with our previous guidance of 26% to 29%. This is an increase of 700 basis points to 800 basis points year-over-year. Non-GAAP EPS is now expected to be $2.20 to $2.35, which is only a decrease of $0.12 at the mid-point of guidance and represents 34% to 43% growth year-over-year. So to sum up, we feel our guidance has an appropriate and prudent amount of conservatism, considering all the current exoticness factors, we've taken measures to control expenses and protect earnings without impairing our ability to make key investments in our growth businesses and to further extend our competitive positioning. And lastly, we have a strong and stable capital structure to support our profitable growth strategy going forward. Well, we're not providing fiscal 2021 guidance at this time. It is worth noting that even under a scenario of economic softness, we still expect ARR to grow. And with spending control that PTC has demonstrated for many years, we also expect to generate free cash flow growth. Bear in mind, there will be some free cash flow tailwinds in fiscal 2021, and while we expect that CapEx will continue in the same mid-20s ballpark, interest expense is expected to decrease roughly $25 million compared to the fiscal 2020 outlook, given the debt structure we put in place and assuming no new restructuring, we would expect approximately $30 million less of restructuring payments and assuming no acquisitions and other approximately $10 million less of acquisition related payments in fiscal 2021. So wrapping up, we had a solid quarter, but recognized the market is changing rapidly. We believe, we're well positioned to perform during the downturn and continue delivering significant value to our customers, which will in turn drive ARR and free cash flow growth well into the future. So with that, I'd like to thank everyone for their time and I'll turn the call over to the operator to begin Q&A. Yes. So again, here, we haven't really seen major headcount reductions in our customer base. But an effort to, again, provide a prudent and conservative outlook. We thought that was the right thing to do to factor in some extra churn. It's a dicey market environment right now. Hey Joe. And again just to follow-on to that, just to put the guidance range, the midpoint where new bookings down, call it, in the 30% range in Q3 and Q4. That's the kind of the levels of deterioration that we saw back in 2009, right? We've provided that even at our Analyst Day scenario. And the low end contemplates something even more difficult than that environment. Thanks Matt. No, we're not seeing, at this point, meaningful changes to the previously committed ramps. I mean, I think... Thanks Adam. And Jay then to answer the second through seventh questions... That you sneakily wrapped all into one. Let me just try to sum it up this way. To a certain degree, PTC was fortunate with the timing of the reorganization that we did in the first half, which was actually pre-global pandemic and therefore unrelated. It was really more around reorganizing around the growth businesses. And, now as this struck, we had actually taken out more costs than perhaps originally anticipated. But that now puts us in a position where as we start looking at the back half much of that cost control, we can really just think about it as how, and when we want to release the spicket. We all want to get back to a stage where we're all hiring and growth is happening. So we want to be mindful of that and we're watching carefully what's going on in the market. But in the meantime, it's more like a slow drip on when and where we're hiring and we're trying to be pretty thoughtful about where we're adding capacity right now to take most advantage of the situation. Thanks, Steve."

            "name": "Jim Heppelmann",
            "content": "Thanks Tim. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. I hope you and your families are safe and well during this crisis. Before I jump into review of our quarter, I'd like to start by thanking our tens of thousands of customers around the world for their continued support and loyalty. Many of our customer relationships date back two and three decades now, which shows how important the relationships have been to both parties. We've been through several crises together and we'll get through this one too. I'd also like to thank PTC's 6,000 employees around the globe for their hard work and commitment during the crisis. The way our team has embraced the remote work environment, while pushing forward to strategic initiatives and leaning in to support our global customer base, is a testament to the great culture we built here at PTC. Overall, we are very pleased with our fiscal Q2 results. We delivered 11% ARR growth, 25% revenue growth and 117% EPS growth. We did experience some bookings pressure related to the pandemic in the final weeks of the quarter, resulting in new ACV bookings being down mid-teens year-over-year. The impact came late in the quarter and was greater in Europe and Asia and within our smaller channel customers. Renewals were essentially unaffected by the crisis in Q2. Looking ahead, we're mindful of the pressure that the pandemic would place on new bookings and our guidance reflects that. Still we continue to target double digit organic growth in ARR, revenue and EPS for the full year, despite factoring in the potential of severe demand challenges and modest renewal headwinds as well. I am very pleased that PTC remains able to provide such a strong outlook, given the very conservative guidance assumptions that Kristian will outline later in the call. Our strong Q2 results and outlook are not due to luck or happenstance, but are attributable to several successful strategic and operational initiatives we've executed over the past few years. These actions were initially taken to position PPC as a premium software company in a timeless manner, but they are proving to be particularly fortuitous in the current crisis environment. I am referring to our business model transition, our successful expansion into high growth IoT and AR markets, our recent embrace of a pure SaaS future through the Onshape acquisition and the restructuring we did earlier this year before the pandemic arrived. Because of these changes, PTC is positioned to hold up well during the downturn and we are very well positioned to drive even stronger growth in shareholder value creation once this crisis passes. Q2 ARR growth rates were 10% for the Core business, 30% in the Growth business, and low single digits in the Focus Solutions Group. Each business performed just modestly below the level we would have expected without the crisis. The datas in the prepared remarks and there's nothing particularly notable there. So instead of going deeper into Q2 results, let me instead use my time to take you through the strategic changes we've made to transform PTC into a company that's well positioned for this downturn. Understanding these changes will help illuminate the confidence we have in our guidance and in our longer term future. The biggest change has been our successful transition to a subscription business model that was completed last fall as we wrapped up fiscal 2019. Today over 95% of our software revenue is recurring. In stark contrast to the 2009 financial crisis, where double digit bookings decline led to double digit revenue and earnings declines for PTC. Our fiscal 2020 guidance is targeting double digit organic ARR growth with even higher levels of revenue growth, plus expanding margins that drive strong EPS growth and solid free cash flow. This is despite Q2 new bookings declines and the assumption of more significant year-over-year bookings declines in Q3 and Q4. The recurring nature of our model is allowing us to largely protect earnings and cash flow without materially impacting our ability to make key investments in our growth businesses to further extend our competitive positioning. The second big challenge \u2013 the second big change over the past few years has been the expansion of the markets we serve, enabled by strategic changes in our product portfolio. I think there's broad consensus that inside this terrible crisis it is digital technologies that are coming to the rescue and keeping many of us productive to avoid a much worse situation. As we've seen with video calls, anything digital that empowers a distributed workforce and embraces remote work is the most compelling of all. Fortunately for PTC IoT, ARR and PLM are all about remote work. Digitizing product data, and factory data and worker expertise so that it can be used by a distributed workforce is the very point of these technologies. We expect that the new normal that follows this crisis will create stronger tailwind to the already high growth IoT and AR markets and will make PLM more relevant than ever. Let me double click on augmented reality. PTC's Vuforia AR suite allows companies to capture and digitize human expertise for purposes of collaborating with, training and supporting remote frontline workers. We've all seen Zoom, Teams and Go to Meeting usage explode for knowledge workers, but these tools don't bring any value to frontline workers. Vuforia does essentially what Zoom does, but for frontline workers. And there are three times more frontline workers, than knowledge workers on the world. Vuforia is a strong leader in industrial AR and PTC really stands to benefit as enterprise AR adoption accelerates. Here is an interesting proof point. In response to the crisis, we decided to provide free access to Vuforia Chalk, the entry level capability of the Vuforia suite. Think of the Vuforia Chalk as like a FaceTime call that allows you to see and mark up the real world environment at the frontline workers' factory or work site. It's incredibly helpful for remote support and problem solving. By making Chalk free for the crisis period, we eliminated sales friction and quickly introduced AR for the first time to thousands of companies who were desperate for an immediate solution. Rockwell Automation and other companies partnered with us in promoting this initiative. Here in the U.S. National Association of Manufacturers embraced AR as a key strategy for their manufacturing constituents and promoted our free Chalk initiative. The NAM went a step further and published a paper that Professor Michael Porter and I co-authored on the topic of using AR to drive front line worker productivity, which you can find on our Investor website. The adoption of Chalk has been amazing and daily Vuforia Chalk AR collaboration traffic soared to levels 10 times higher than it was before the crisis. These companies using Chalk represent a big upsell pipeline to pursue in Q4 and beyond. Please check out ptc.com/freechalk to learn more, including a nice case study that discusses Toyota's use of Chalk to provide remote support the factory workers. Toyota incidentally is currently our largest Chalk customer. Moving on to IoT. From the beginning, PTC's IoT story has been about remote monitoring of smart connected products and remote monitoring of smart connected factories. Many medtech companies use PTC IoT solutions and we've already experienced large spikes in IoT usage as several medical diagnostics customers rush to launch new smart connected diagnostics and treatment equipment to respond to the COVID crisis. Because IoT and AR are both such strong drivers of digital transformation, ThingWorx and Vuforia solutions are frequently used together to allow customers to remotely monitor and diagnose assets and then to allow remote experts to collaboratively troubleshoot with front-line workers even from the safety of their homes. In a joint study that PTC and BCG recently published, we found that 81% of IoT projects see added value in AR, while 76% of projects that started with AR see real value in adding IoT. There's an important takeaway here. IoT and AR together form the foundation for a new era called spatial computing. This wave will be big, but it's just starting to form. Last week, PTC launched our first spatial computing offering called Vuforia Spatial Toolbox. I'm very excited about the possibilities for spatial computing in the industrial world of plants, factories and work sites and with best-in-class IoT and AR solutions to build on. PTC has a real competitive advantage as this wave comes together. Our Windchill software has been a real hero during the COVID crisis too, because Windchill has been a pure web application from the start. It doesn't matter where you are or what device you have, you still have full access to product data and full ability to participate in the process. We received accolades from numerous Windchill customers regarding how effective the software has been in their transition to a work from home environment. Because every manual or paper based process at their site came to an abrupt stop. Many customers have asked us to help accelerate and broaden their deployments because there was no hiccup in any process where PLM was used. PLM is more in fashion now than it ever has been. While AR, IoT and PLM are all about remote work, CAD is a different story. Mainstream CAD is an on-premise market today with 99% of current professional CAD seats installed on desktop workstations. These CAD environments prove more challenging in a work from home scenario because engineers were denied access to their workstation at the office that contain both their applications and data. This situation will have to change in a new normal that embraces remote work, which brings me to the next PTC strategic change I'd like to highlight, which is our effort to transition the engineering software industry, the full SaaS leveraging our Onshape acquisition. Working from home is more difficult with CAD because engineers don't have the big workstations at home to load the software on. No matter which mainstream CAD tool they use, many industrial companies have been forced to implement painful workarounds like using Citrix to gain access to the CAD software and data on a workstation back in the office. I talked last week to the CIO of a major automotive OEM. He said that he now has thousands of knowledge workers working from home and his biggest challenges have been an engineering. His company uses a competitor's PLM system that unlike Windchill has a fat client. So even his PLM system isn't readily accessible from home, he was exasperated by the state of engineering software and in complete agreement that we really need to bring the engineering world to SaaS so it can enjoy the benefits we now take for granted across the rest of our business systems. Frankly, our acquisition of Onshape could not have been timelier. If you want SaaS and engineering, Onshape is the only native SaaS product development platform on the market. Onshape users thrived during work from home because all their functionality and data lives in the cloud at all times. They can easily access their work from home at any time on any device, including a MacBook, Chromebook, phone or tablet. If it's hard to imagine what true SaaS means to CAD, take this 15 second test. Fire up a web browser and go to our Investor Relations website and then click on the Onshape link you see there. In about 15 seconds, you'll be in a full blown professional CAD system interacting with 3D model of a ventilator or a robot you pick. That's it. The implementation is done, you're in production. There's nothing like that in the industry and because it took the veteran Onshape team six years and more than $100 million to build the platform, PTC has a major lead as we enter this phase of SaaS acceleration. Onshape is not a big business yet, but of all our product lines that had the best performance relative to plan in Q2 and showed strong year-over-year bookings growth. As the crisis deepens, the level of Onshape interest grew commensurately and the pipeline is very strong going forward. Because it's so easy to get started with more than a dozen community-based emergency response programs aiming to develop new personal protection equipment and ventilators adopted Onshape globally. These efforts typically involve some combination of academic, commercial and government entities, joining forces to quickly design and manufacture a novel approach to respond quickly to the emergency shortages. This is a perfect fit for Onshape, teams discussed that we can either go implement a common CAD system or we can just start using Onshape right now. It's like calling an Uber rather than buying a car and securing a place to park it. The level of innovation and speed observed in these community projects is causing industrial companies to rethink their rigid supply chain strategies. And instead, look for technologies they can use to encourage and lubricate impromptu collaboration. We saw a related phenomenon happening in the education market. Many universities and many high schools have a 3D CAD curriculum in their engineering or STEM programs. most frequently using SolidWorks because all major CAD systems like SolidWorks run exclusively on Windows workstations and students generally have MacBooks, Chromebooks or iPads. Students are forced to provide a special PC computer room on campus where all CAD work must be done. The computer work has \u2013 the computer room has always been a pain because a lot of extra work and money for the school and students can't work from their dorm or classroom. But in this crisis, the computer room has become a showstopper because it's simply inaccessible because schools needed an immediate work from home solution to get back on track, Onshape education signups have soared to levels never seen before, especially during the middle of a school year. Likewise because of the coronavirus, the popular FIRST robotics program had to cancel their physical robot building season, but we worked with first to offer virtual Robots to the Rescue program and more than 400 virtual student teams quickly spring back to life and join this online CAD based robot competition. We estimate that Onshape has taken five to 10 points of education market share already in the past two months. And I expect things to really heat up during the summer back-to-school planning season. Winning an education is really important because infusing college new hires with the latest thinking so that they can influence the commercial companies that hire them is a proven sales and marketing approach in the CAD industry. We believe that COVID crisis will accelerate the SaaS tipping point for the engineering and software industry by several years. With this belief, we've been thinking about SaaS more broadly. For example, what about our installed customer base? What can we do there? As we mentioned in November, our acquisition thesis viewed Onshape as a CAD application built on a multipurpose SaaS platform. We saw the underlying SaaS platform as big a prize as the new CAD system and we've been investing heavily there. We'll be shining a light on this platform at live works in introducing it, using the code name Atlas. Think that Atlas will carry the PTC SaaS world on its shoulders. We're making great progress to extend Atlas more broadly across the PTC portfolio and we're deep into the work required to have it carry the frustum generative design capabilities and the Vuforia AR suite. I expect that we'll have the first brand new Atlas based deliverables in the market yet in calendar 2020. The long-term goal at PTC is to have a broad and seamless portfolio sharing a common SaaS infrastructure. We'll have more info at live works, which by the way has been converted to a virtual event that you're all welcome to attend. The bottom line is that I really liked the Onshape acquisition back in November, but I like it even more now. The timing could not have been better. The work-from-home genie won't go back in the bottle and it's now clear that we will need to embrace a more distributed and agile workforce and we've ever known before. That future will need SaaS based PLM, IoT, AR and CAD more than ever and PTC's years ahead of competition across this waterfront. The last change I want to talk about is restructuring and cost management. As we entered fiscal 2020, we announced a restructuring plan to shift resources into our SaaS initiatives. As we executed that strategy throughout the fall and winter, we reduced costs more than the original plan, which you can see in our higher restructuring costs. This coupled with lower travel costs plus an intentional slowdown in hiring and cancellation of various live events like LiveWorx has us tracking toward a spending number that's well below our plan for the year. Even as we continue to invest aggressively in new technologies like SaaS and AR, we still expect to deliver strong operating margin expansion in fiscal 2020. Before I wrap up, I'd like to share one other piece of important news, which is that PTC just launched Creo 7 in the market two weeks ago during the work-from-home period. This is a huge release for us because it brings to market a frustum generative design technology. It adds fluid dynamics to the ANSYS live simulation capabilities and lays the groundwork for the mainstream EM simulation suite to ship with Creo this fall. It introduces multi body design and has a host of improvements related to additive manufacturing and more. While I'm excited about our opportunity to take share in the transition to SaaS, that's a long-term strategy. In the meantime, Creo 7 is a big advancement in terms of our ability to continue to win and renew Creo customers with this flagship product line. In summary, because of the tough decisions PTC previously action to change our business model to expand in the growth markets like IoT and AR to launch into SaaS with Onshape and to work on our cost structure. We're very well positioned to perform during the downturn and to thrive in the new normal the inevitable turnaround will bring. It's a difficult market out there, but I couldn't be more pleased with PTC's positioning in it. And with that, I'll turn it over to Kristian to take you through the quantitative results. Hey, Saket. Yes, Saket. Just this morning actually we did go through the pipeline kind of in preparation for the call. And the IoT pipeline is pretty strong. The question for us is close rates and the risk that some of that pipeline pushes back a quarter or whatever, from Q3 to Q4 and Q4 to Q1.  So we have plenty to work with. Plenty to support our forecast that, as Kristian said, is well above the guidance range we've given you. We're being conservative around close rates in the forecast and being double conservative in the guidance, because we're worried about software that has to be implemented in bigger ticket purchases might get delayed. I doubt it's going to get canceled. But it's just what we saw at the end of the quarter was, if you needed to buy software, you had to implement. But everybody is being sent home and you don't know how to implement it, we'll then want to just wait until we all come back to the office and buy it then. And so that to me is the risk. But it's not really a question of pipeline, it's really a question of close rates. And that's generally true across the board. Yes Kristian said this, but to reiterate, we've not seen COVID-related churn thus far. Thanks again. Hey Joe. Yes. I mean, we have a forecast. That's our internal expectation. Keep in mind, new bookings were down 16% last quarter. Going forward, our forecast would have it down more than 16%, but still above the entire range that Kristian gave you. So the truth is none of us know what's going to happen in the coming quarters. We just don't. So rather than assume it's going to be good and get surprised when it's bad, we're assuming it's going to be kind of bad. And hopefully, if there's a surprise, it will be to the good side. But certainly, we're looking at a forecast that's above the high end of the guidance range. Yes. I mean, for sure. I think if you look at 2009, we were really a CAD and PLM company. And those businesses combined \u2013 those markets combined were growing single digits, probably upper single digits at the time. We didn't have the growth engines we have now. And I spent a lot of time upfront to say, actually, this COVID crisis will probably create a substantial tailwind for our SaaS business, our IoT business and our AR business. Maybe not immediately, but definitely, some of it is happening immediately. Our AR pipeline is off the charts. So it's hard to know for sure how to compare this to 2009. I would say we definitely have a growth year portfolio and a more relevant portfolio in the context of this crisis than we had in the context of that crisis. And then as Kristian said, the high end of our guidance sort of assumes it's as bad as 2009, and the low end of our guidance assumes it's much worse than 2009. Hi, Matt. Yes, I mean, as you said, we do have relatively back-end loaded quarters. And that said, we do track what we call the done number, which is what percent done are we versus this point in a typical quarter? And relative to the forecast, the done number is just fine. But it's early and it's not that meaningful when it's this early. Yes. I mean, in China in particular, even by the end of the last quarter, we saw hints of come back and definitely when we look at the forecast for this quarter, it's up quarter-over-quarter, it's up nicely. So I think we do see China coming back online and spending coming back into the system. The U.S. of course is two steps behind that, right. So last quarter, Europe was in a deeper funk than the U.S. and maybe by the end of the quarter we'll see Europe improving. I don't know. And part of the problem right now is none of us know, none of us know what's going to happen. So what we tried to do is give guidance with a lot of prudence as Kristian said. And then be transparent on the level of prudence we put in the guidance so that you can decide if it should be more or less based on your own deal of what's going to happen in the world. Thank you. Well, I mean, the thing you have to understand is their contracts. And once you sign a contract, if somebody comes and said hypothetically, we'd like to renegotiate that, our reaction is, we wouldn't \u2013 there's a whole lot of contracts we have too that we'd like to renegotiate. We have a lease on a brand new headquarters. It's been empty for six weeks. I'd like to renegotiate that, but the vendor doesn't seem to want to renegotiate it with me. So I'm just saying these are contracts, that there isn't renegotiation unless there's something in it for us too and simply taking them down would just be a win loss and difficult to get us to sign up for that. Yes. I passed on that simply to save time because I wanted to talk about the strategic perspectives, but all three main partnerships did okay in the quarter. Probably of them all, Microsoft was the strongest. But with Rockwell, we had some great wins. Rockwell had some great wins. Rockwell has taken us into some amazing new accounts and I'll let them speak about their accounts. And then with ANSYS, we also had some good sales. I don't think we probably were on plan with ANSYS, but in general, we weren't on plan with anything. So I think all three partnerships posted a decent quarter. None of them particularly notable in either direction, all of them suffered a little bit in the context of what happened to everybody late in the quarter. Yes. So Jay, I'll take the first one. To share with people some terminology so rather than say Vuforia will be based on Onshape, which sounds funny. Let's say Onshape is based on Atlas and Vuforia will also be based on Atlas. And we will bring other technologies onto the Atlas platform. And this Atlas platform will evolve over time and at some point it actually will look materially different than what we acquired from Onshape because we've taken it in other directions as well. For example, Vuforia needs a computer vision engine in the platform and Onshape didn't, but that's okay. No Atlas will have a computer vision engine for anything that needs it and then AI engine for IoT and so forth. But to get to the gist of your question today, we have a closed loop life cycle management story with significant properties being subscription but on-premise, in particular Creo. And Windchill has a lot of on-premise, but we also do sell that as SaaS. And so what we'd like to do is somewhere down the road, have a complete 100% SaaS based closed-loop life cycle management suite that passes that 15-second test. You click on a link, and within 15 seconds, you're in any part of the suites doing anything that we can do. We are not there today, but and the industry is far from there by the way. And so I think that what PTC has is a lead and now we see an exogenous factor as Kristian said, that's a wake up call that this industry have to move to SaaS pronto and pronto won't be quick, but it's going to be a lot quicker than I might have thought it was three months ago. And so PTC is going to press our advantage is as hard as we can and try to be the company that brings this industry to SaaS. And it's going to require a lot of work from us in the coming quarters and even years. But I think it could represent a significant share shift. Because of the industry goes to SaaS and we're far ahead of everybody pulling the industry there, we might definitely benefit from that. We're seeing it happen in education. That's why I started up that story is as you know, to imagine taking five points or 10 points of educational market share in two months. I couldn't have dreamed to that. But I can now in the context of this crisis. Yeah. Maybe I can add two tidbits to that that might be helpful. One is when we did this restructuring, we set out to do a reduction in force, but then we said, what we've moved to this new headquarters and that might be causing some pressures associated with the commute and so forth to some people. And they might leave anyway if it's a problem. So why don't we have a voluntary program and by the way, an early retirement program. And so we serve those two programs up with really only but an estimate of what might happen. And we had fairly good adoption of the voluntary and early retirement programs. So we ended up taking out more people than we probably would have taken out by a reduction in force. We said, okay, that's fine. We'll hire them back. But guess what? We're not going to hire them back. So you might say, it's almost like we've done a reduction in force by going below the headcount we intended to be at and then electing not to go back up. So that's a little bit why our cost structure has come down so much. And then, we definitely are still hiring. I can tell you what we're hiring developers for sure in our AR business, in our SaaS business and we're making selective hires here and there and also doing portfolio work within the portfolio. So for example, based on the demand we've seen for Onshape, we've shifted a fair amount of inside sellers into selling Onshape just did that recently. So don't yet have results. But we're responding to what we see as interesting demands in the market. We also did something else we turned our premier channel resellers, loose \u2013 or we're just doing that now, turning them loose with the right to sell Onshape. We hadn't intended to do that. But we said, hey, wait a minute. If the industry suddenly wants SaaS-based CAD and we alone have it, let's not miss this opportunity. Let's put capacity on it. So thinking that is just within the headcount and within the ecosystem, we're also doing some portfolio management to move resources to where the demand is the strongest. Thank you, Jay. Yes, well, again, there's no software and there's no data at the customer sites. So we skip all those phases of installation and so forth. And then as you might expect with a SaaS product, all the demonstrations and so forth are done digitally, virtually over the web. So definitely Onshape is set up for a digital go-to-market process and that's really what we're trying to leverage. Now that said, if you want to get in bigger deals, where there's more switching costs, more perceived risk in switching, no matter what you're switching to, you might have to call on people and have live conversations with them and so forth. So I think it's definitely more than just selling over the web, but it's not at all like pounding the pavement and making cold calls and stuff like that kind of the old fashioned direct sales way. So I think it's somewhere in the middle and that's why we're pulling more of our inside sales and more of our resellers into the game. Well, let me just say, it's probably hard to categorize it by type, but let me do my best. So any services work that have to be performed onsite is a problem, because generally speaking, we're not allowed to go onsite, we're not allowed to travel there. And by the way, if we went onsite, probably the customer wouldn't be there anyway. So I would say as a characterization, onsite work is where the problem is. Good amount of our work is done offsite and really has been for years in part to take advantage of lower cost labor and so forth. So if you give us a project in Europe, we're probably going to do it in Romania, even if the actual project is in France or something like that. So that kind of work has gone full speed ahead, but it's really services work that requires onsite for example, if you're going to stand up IoT in a factory, somebody really has to go to the factory and assess all the physical assets that are there and determine how to connect to them. And it's hard to do that project without ever being in the factory. You maybe don't have to be in the factory all the time, but you at least have to go there to kick off the project. So I think it's those projects in the near-term, while we're in lockdown mode that require onsite work that are most challenged. Thanks, Jackson. Hey, Steve. Yes, well. Maybe I could start by saying where we have the highest concentrations would be, what I'm going to call generalized industrial. That would be everything from John Deere to machine tools and factories to Carrier air conditioning equipment. That's our biggest vertical at this point in time. Our second vertical is Aerospace and Defense, which by the way particularly on the defense side is where we're strong, is not really suffering that much, the U.S. government is not dialing back, they're leading in. The third thing would be Electronics and High-Tech, but that's not really consumer electronics, it's really more business-to-business type of electronics equipment. So those would be our three biggest exposures. And then if you get down to places like Automotive, you're talking single-digits which is good because automotive is a tough industry. If you get into commercial aviation, it's not that big, again, we're much bigger than defense. If you think about places like, there is been questions about airlines. Well airlines are less than 5%. I think airlines and retail together are less than 5% of our ARR. And by the way, the business we do with airlines is around spare parts management. And we don't so much \u2013 it's not about new sales, it's more about renewals. And as long as they own those airplanes, they're going to own spare parts for them, whether they're flying them or not. And I don't think any airline that's still in business is going to stop managing spare parts because they won't be able to get back into business. They'll never put those airplanes in the air again, if they give up on the spare parts. So it feels like the parts of this particular economy that I hit the worst really are not the places where PTC has the deepest exposure. And in particular, I'm probably referring to automotive here, which I think is probably one of the toughest places to be. Thanks, Steve. Thank you, and thanks everybody for joining us today. So in addition to LiveWorx going virtual, a lot of investor are going virtual as well. We're going to be at a bunch of them in this quarter beginning with JP Morgan's Global TMT Conference on May 14th. So, look out on our website for the other events as they get posted. So we do look forward to seeing you on the conference circuit, hopefully. And if not, hopefully you can join us at the LiveWorx event, information is up on the website for that as well. And lastly, thank you for your interest in PTC and have a great and safe evening. See you all later. Bye-bye. Thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the PTC 2020 First Quarter Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Tim Fox, PTC's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nTim Fox: Thank you, Sheila. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining PTC's conference call to discuss our fiscal Q1 '20 results. On the call today are Jim Heppelmann, Chief Executive Officer; and Kristian Talvitie, Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding future financial guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in PTC's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. As a reminder, we'll be referring to operating and non-GAAP financial measures during today's call. Discussion of our operating metrics and these items excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings press release and related Form 8-K. Lastly, references to growth rates will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted. And with that let me turn the call over to Jim.\nJim Heppelmann: Thanks, Tim. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to share that our solid Q1 performance puts us right on track to deliver against our fiscal '20 targets and our attractive long-term financial ranges. ARR which is our key top line metric grew 11% in Q1. As Kristian will detail later in the call, we are raising our fiscal '20 ARR guidance based on our Q1 performance, our visibility into the balance of the fiscal year and favorable currency tailwinds. We're also raising revenue, EPS and adjusted free cash flow guidance for the year. At the midpoint of our guidance, we're now expecting fiscal '20 ARR growth in the mid-teens, revenue growth approaching 20% and EPS growth above 40%. The benefits of all the hard work we've done in the past years to expand our profitability, to increase our growth rate and to convert to a subscription model are really starting to show, because PTC truly is emerging as one of the world's premier public software companies. Before digging into the details, I'd like to share some observations about broader industry trends and PTC's unique position in terms of helping customers thrive during this period of rapid change in the industrial world. Similar to other industries like entertainment, hospitality or transportation that have been disrupted by digital technologies, industrial companies are now facing new challenges from traditional competitors that are embracing digital technologies across the value chains, and from new entrants exploring new business models. Digital transformation has become a wave that's sweeping across the industrial market, enabling companies to better differentiate their products and services while simultaneously optimizing their engineering, manufacturing, sales and service processes. As the only company out there who has a suite of CAD, PLM, IoT, AI and AR capabilities, PTC has a unique ability to help customers pursue their digital transformation ambitions. Every day, we are helping customers to do things like implement AI driven product design, or to create a digital thread to leverage product data across the value chain, or to gain operational insight from their products in the field and their assets and their factories through our leading IoT and AI technology and to drive significant improvements to worker productivity through our AR technology. I host many customer meetings and I can tell you that PTC Solutions really resonate with our customers, because they align with their high priority initiatives. Nobody else looks like PTC, and with the opportunity in front of us it's a very exciting time to be here. Given our performance and forward-looking momentum, one should take note that traditional economic measures like the PMI index are now much less correlated with PTC business trends. As we all learned in the great recession of 2009, recurring revenue streams are impacted much less by economic fluctuations then is perpetual license revenue. This suggests that our subscription-based business model coupled with growing secular dynamics of our business that I described earlier, have to a large degree driven a decoupling from traditional cyclical measures like PMI. We are guiding the strong ARR growth against the backdrop of some of the most lackluster PMI numbers in recent memory. Of course, we remain mindful of these external measures, but this negative sentiment has been around for some time now. This decoupling gives us even more confidence in our ability to drive sustainable growth going forward. Turning now to some highlights in the quarter. I'll begin with our growth business that now includes ThingWorx IoT, Vuforia AR and Onshape SaaS. ARR growth for our IoT solutions accelerated quarter-over-quarter and our augmented reality solutions once again outpaced high market growth rates, thanks to a continuation of the trend of customers introducing AR into their manufacturing and service environments. In addition the healthy new logo activity, Q1 expansion bookings represented about 65% of IoT and AR bookings, primarily driven by customer shifting from pilots to production at an accelerating pace. The number of six-figure deals in the quarter, more than doubled versus a year ago. When viewed through an ARR lens, trends across our customer cohorts are impressive. Relative to Q1 of last year the number of IoT and AR customers with ARR greater than 500K grew by over 50% [ph]. One of these customers; Thermo Fisher is a great example of how enterprises are transforming their business with PTC Solutions. Thermo Fisher is a global leader in the biotech space, who is leveraging ThingWorx to offer new value-added services to further differentiate themselves in their competitive end markets. In their chemical analysis division for example, Thermo Fisher embeds ThingWorx within their products, allowing end customers to remotely capture and analyze test data from these products. Thermo Fisher is also leveraging ThingWorx for predictive maintenance, and to provide feedback loops to their product development teams. Thermo Fisher is representative of the trends we're seeing where customers are expanding their digital footprint across product lines and use cases and into their production environments as well. Given the broad scope and global nature of the digital transformation opportunity within the industrial market, we knew it would be challenging to pursue this alone. Of course, that's why we performed strategic alliances with industry leaders like Rockwell Automation and Microsoft. Both of these alliances again delivered the goods in Q1. In our Rockwell Automation alliance, Q1 provided a strong start to the year with robust new deal activity, plus a meaningful uptick in expansions as pilot projects that were kicked off earlier in FY '19 moved into production. The Rockwell alliance team delivered new deals across the broad cross-section of vertical markets and in 15 different geographies, which highlights both the deep industrial domain expertise and the global reach that Rockwell Automation brings to this relationship. In our Microsoft alliance, Q1 also marked a strong start to the year with new ACV bookings well above plan. Geographically, the Americas continues to be the main driver of growth. However, momentum in Europe is building and the Microsoft alliance has a robust pipeline heading into Q2. We're also pleased to see that demand continued to expand beyond the smart connected product use case into factory and even AR solutions, which represented more than a third of the alliance bookings in Q1. A great proof point of the power of our Microsoft alliance is a recent win at Johnson Controls, who is a leading global provider of building control systems. It turns out that PTC, Microsoft and Accenture were independently supporting JCI's digital transformation efforts from different angles. Too many cooks in the kitchen ran the risk of slowing things down. So PTC, Microsoft and Accenture joined forces and approached the C-suite with a unified strategy for their smart factory initiatives. Together we landed the deal to deliver a fully cloud-based smart factory solution that has Accenture deploying PTC's ThingWorx and Microsoft's Azure. Before I leave the growth discussion, let me share that we're making great progress integrating the Onshape team. In fact the Onshape team moved into our Seaport headquarters earlier this week. I'd like to think of Onshape as the proverbial iceberg. What you see above water the 5%, looks a lot like a next-gen CAD and PLM system. But what's below the water the 95%, is PTC's new pure SaaS platform. We have big plans for Onshape and for SaaS, and I'm convinced this will become another major growth engine for PTC. Well it's too early to say much yet, I look forward to updating you on our SaaS progress in coming quarters. Our core product group delivered strong Q1 performance as well. Core business ARR growth of 10% outpaced market growth again in the quarter. It was led by very strong performance in PLM which delivered mid-teens ARR growth, that reflected broad based strength across all major geographies. In my view, the strong performance in PLM is indicative of the growing strategic role that PLM technology now plays in our customers' digital transformation strategies. Any industrial company who wants to undertake a digital transformation, quickly realizes that PLM will need to be one of their anchor tenant systems of record. Take Groupe Beneteau, our French manufacturer who is a leader in luxury sale in power boats. By leveraging PTC's Windchill, along with Creo and ThingWorx and Vuforia, Beneteau is delivering product and service differentiation together with engineering excellence and operational efficiency. Their PLM technology roadmap began with foundational capabilities such as bill of material management and change management. Then, extended into the factory with concurrent engineering and manufacturing instructions and from there into leveraging AR functionality for shop floor operators and dealership scenarios. This powerful combination of highly differentiated technologies is truly unique to PTC. We're using it to win new business and to expand relationships with existing customers as they seek to modernize the business processes. Altogether, we're seeing more and more evidence of a rejuvenation of PLM that makes the long-term growth opportunity that much more attractive for PTC. Our CAD team had a solid start to the year too, again delivering high single-digit ARR growth with notable strength in Asia-Pacific and in our global reseller channel. On the Creo Simulation Live front which is the starting point for our ANSYS partnership, interest remains high. Adoption, particularly in the enterprise space continues to ramp nicely with average deal sizes continuing to grow. Our focus on Creo Simulation Live or CSL as we call it, in FY '20 is on driving adoption in the channel which generates about half of our CAD business. We're kicking off new channel enablement and promotional programs in Q2 and remain bullish on the long-term opportunity for a significant CSL penetration in our installed base. While CSL is the tip of the spear in our partnership with ANSYS, we're also making good progress, bringing the broader discovery aim suite into the Creo fold as well. To wrap up my comments, I'd like to reiterate PTC's full commitment to driving mid-teens ARR growth and generating significant free cash flow in the coming years. Our strong performance in CAD and PLM, plus our leadership positions in the high growth IoT and AR markets, and more new opportunities for growth in the SaaS-based product development market with Onshape, gives us strong confidence that our growth will remain both significant and sustainable over the long-term. With our subscription transition and the rear -- rearview mirror and our ongoing focus on disciplined cost and portfolio management, we're firmly on track with our plans to transform PTC into one of the premier public software companies in the world. And with that, I'll turn it over to Kristian to comment on financials and guidance.\nKristian Talvitie: Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon everyone. Before I review our results, I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance and all growth rate references will be in constant currency. Let me start off with a review of our first quarter results. Again this quarter I'm going to keep my remarks brief hitting just some key highlights and ask investors to refer to our press release and prepared remarks document available on our IR website for additional details. Q1 ARR was $1.16 billion, representing 11% year-over-year growth, which is consistent with the guidance commentary we provided last quarter. ARR in our growth product group was up 36% year-over-year and we continue to expect ARR growth to be above market growth rates of 30% to 40% in fiscal '20. ARR in the core, was up 10% year-over-year which was also above market growth and consistent with our outlook for fiscal '20. ARR in FSG was up 1% year-over-year, primarily due to the timing of deals and we expect ARR growth to be in the low to mid-single-digits for FSG for fiscal '20. Total Q1 revenue of $356 million was up 8% year-over-year, despite a 78% year-over-year decrease in perpetual license revenue driven by the end of perpetual license sales on January 1, 2019. Operating margin of 26% increased 200 basis points over Q4 '19 and declined 100 basis points compared to Q1 '19, where we experienced higher than expected perpetual license revenue resulting from the perpetual end of life program. And lastly, non-GAAP EPS of $0.57 increased 5% year-over-year against the perpetual heavy comparison of last year. And as you'll recall, revenue and operating expenses and consequently EPS can be impacted positively or negatively by ASC 606. Major drivers impacting revenue include term length changes and support to subscription conversion. And on the OpEx side, commissions were obviously also impacted. Finally, our Q1 adjusted free cash flow of $12 million was within our expectations and sets us up to achieve our full year guidance. Now turning to the guidance. Beginning with ARR. For fiscal '20, we're increasing our guidance to a range of $1.27 billion to $1.29 billion or 14% to 16% year-over-year growth and 13% to 15% on a constant currency basis. ARR guidance includes approximately $15 million of positive FX and already embedded in our original guidance for the year is approximately $10 million of ARR or 1 point of growth from the Onshape acquisition. Consistent with our prior guidance commentary, we expect Q2 constant currency ARR growth to be in line with Q1 results with ARR growth rates accelerating in the back half of the year. This increase is driven by both normal seasonality of our business and our backlog of deals booked in prior periods. Now turning to adjusted free cash flow. For fiscal '20, we're expecting a range of $260 million to $280 million reflecting the positive FX impact of $5 million. Now turning to P&L guidance. We're now expecting fiscal '20 total revenue of $1.45 billion to $1.53 billion, an increase of $25 million at the midpoint of guidance reflecting our Q1 performance, our outlook for the remainder of the year and approximately $15 million of FX. Non-GAAP EPS is now expected to be $2.15 to $2.65, an increase of $0.12 at the midpoint of guidance, reflecting our Q1 performance and outlook, and $0.05 of FX. We continue to expect fiscal '20 operating expenses to grow approximately 9% year-over-year. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nMatt Hedberg: Hey, guys. Great, thanks for taking my question. PLM ARR growth mid-teens constant currency was pretty good, I know you called out pretty good geographic success. I think in your press release you talked about China and Europe in particular and Jim you mentioned digital transformation being a real tailwind here. Could you talk about the sustainability of this PLM growth. I know we spent a lot of time on some of the growth or -- growth of your businesses, but sort of the durability of PLM as we look forward through this year?\nJim Heppelmann: Well, I think we're going to have a very strong year this year for sure. And I think if you remember back to September, Kristian said over the coming five years, we would expect our PLM ARR growth rate to slow down to the market growth rate, which I think you had at 8%?\nKristian Talvitie: Yes.\nJim Heppelmann: Yes. So we're sort of mid-teens and we think over the five years that will slow to 8%. Now that's based on a number of factors. One thing is our renewal rates in PLM are very high. This is very, very sticky software, and relative to the base of ARR, we're selling a lot of it. So we're really in a strong good situation where there is strong demand because of digital transformation. Our product is ranked number one by every analyst report I have ever seen. And so we're in a good strong position where we get a chance to meet that demand with our product and high renewal rates and that's bodes well for a long time to come.\nMatt Hedberg: Thanks, Jim.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Your line is open.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Thank you. Good evening. Hey, Jim. Hi, Kristian and Tim. With regard to PLM following up on that subject. When we think back over the last 12 to 15 years or more, there seems to been a pendulum of adoption among customers. In other words, there have been times when PLM only companies seem to have had momentum. And then there were times when integrated engineering software companies that have CAD and PLM and perhaps other products that had momentum. The question therefore is, what are you seeing in terms of conjoined business or CLM business across your three letter acronyms? How much of the PLM business is just for PLM versus your being able to conjoin CAD or anything else to that either as a beneficiary or driver to the PLM business?\nJim Heppelmann: Yes. I think, there have been pendulums for sure. And one of the strong upswings was when PTC who at that point had a CAD footprint brought PLM into the picture and cross-sold a lot of PLM to the CAD audience. Now, I think what's happening this time is a couple of different drivers. One is, we're doing a lot more engineering in the manufacturing data transformation. We have the software module of our PLM system called MPM link as in manufacturing process management and it's used to convert an engineering design and an engineering bill of material into a manufacturing process design and instructions, and the manufacturing bill of material in a very systematic configuration managed sort of way, so that if somebody later decides to change the engineering design, we can pinpoint what they need to update in the manufacturing process very quickly. And if the engineering design is highly configurable. Well, it turns out so as the manufacturing instructions and the MBOMs. So today we're selling a lot into that, that's become a new driver, an incremental new driver. And then the other thing is customers are really realizing for example, this augmented reality technology which we have best-in-class, customers love it. It's selling like crazy. That stuff needs configuration management of its content. So a lot of customers and I'm thinking of a great big -- I won't name them, because it didn't -- I didn't ask if I could, but a great big truck company in Europe really is excited about our AR technology and what its produced is a PLM project. Because they say, all right, that's great. But we'll never really be able to do augmented reality without configuration management of the content. So let's go do this broader PLM project. So I think that's another driver. I put that one also in kind of the digital transformation category. So I think there is definitely an upswing, but it's really brought by people saying how could you have a digital transformation strategy without having the digital descriptions of your products and manufacturing processes under control. It's silly to even talk about that. So I think this is definitely produced the tailwind that's generating momentum for PLM.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Thanks, Jim.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ken Talanian with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nKen Talanian: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Could you give us a sense for how your net retention rate trended in the quarter for core growth in FSG compared to last year?\nKristian Talvitie: Yes. Hi, Ken, it's Kristian. I think we're not going to get into the quarterly variability, again just given the reporting framework that we have. But I think, suffice it to say that given the guidance that we have for the year we're expecting -- continuing to expect a modest improvement in net retention here in fiscal '20.\nKen Talanian: Great. And I guess as a follow-up, it looks like the growth portfolio saw some good traction in both Europe and APAC. Could you give us a sense for how we should think about the sustainability of that growth portfolio in both those regions?\nJim Heppelmann: Yes. I mean, I think, what normally happens here at PTC maybe elsewhere, but here at PTC when we launch a business, a new business, it gets traction first in the US and then over time it gains more and more traction in Europe and APAC. And so I think that's just a natural way that these businesses develop, and we see it happening here. So a lot of times they get stronger first in the US and then without the US necessarily weakening, Europe and Asia have come on stronger a little bit later. That's what I would attribute that to.\nKen Talanian: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Saket Kalia with Barclays. Your line is open.\nSaket Kalia: Hi, Jim. Hi, Kristian. Thanks for taking my question here. Kristian maybe for you. Bit of a mechanical question. But can you just talk a little bit about ramp deals. We talked about them a little bit last quarter. You've talked a little bit about sort of the back half strength that we should see in ARR for a variety of reasons. It sounds like ramp deals are part of it. Can you just touch on what parts of the businesses are you seeing these types of deals, these ramp deals. And then just for the benefit of the broader group, can you just talk about how they impact ARR at sort of different points in that ramp. Does that make sense?\nKristian Talvitie: Yes. Sure, Saket, it's a good question. So, thanks. If we just delve into the mechanics of it, how ramp deals impact ARR, is we will add things to ARR on start date of the contract, right, not book date, start date and in the case of a ramp deal where you have in essence kind of multiple start dates that you have year one of whatever 100,000...\nSaket Kalia: Can I give an example and then you talk about the mechanics?\nKristian Talvitie: Sure.\nSaket Kalia: Let me just lay out an example. Let's say, a customer loves our smart factory solution and they have 20 factories, and so they say, I want to really understand what it's going to cost me across all 20 factories. So I'd like to negotiate the deal for 20 factories, but I can only get about five deployed in the first year. Let's say another five in the second year and 10 in the third year. So they're going to do a ramp that's a commitment to five in the first year, five plus five in the second year, and five plus five plus 10 in the third year. So that's the ramp of the commitment now moving -- in that?\nKristian Talvitie: So the way that that would flow into ARR is, we would take the first five factories worth in year one. And say year two when the next five come -- comes on we would take the incremental five factories. And then in the third year we would take the incremental 10. So that's the mechanics of it. ARR flows in on start date of the contractual commitment. In terms of where we're seeing -- where we're seeing ramp deals. I think...\nSaket Kalia: Yes, that's right.\nKristian Talvitie: We see, I would say more of them in the growth product group, IoT AR, and then we still actually do see some in core as well but to a lesser extent, and to the least extent in any of the FSG products.\nSaket Kalia: Got it. That's very helpful. I'll get back in queue. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Broome with Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.\nMatthew Broome: Thanks. Hi, Jim, Kristian and Tim. I'm just curious, how you're tracking for sales capacity so far versus your hiring plan to this year? And can you just sort of give us any kind of an update on what sort of percentage of your total capacity is now focused on IoT and Augmented Reality?\nJim Heppelmann: So if the question -- sorry, I'm just going to repeat it to make sure that I understood it. I think the question was how are we tracking in terms of sales capacity?\nMatthew Broome: Yes.\nJim Heppelmann: Was step one and then step two, how is that capacity divided between growth in core and in FSG?\nMatthew Broome: Yes, exactly. Thanks.\nKristian Talvitie: Yes. Great. So in terms of tracking the capacity, I think we are on track for hiring kind of right where we would like to be at this point given our plan. In terms of the spread, frankly I'm going to have to get back to you on specific details, but the majority is actually still on the core product set which is understandable and the increasing amount on IoT. And then still specialists focused on the various compounds in FSG.\nJim Heppelmann: Yes. I mean another way to look at it would be to look at sales productivity which would be lowest in the growth business, because growth, you're bringing on a lot of new capacity. And it's doing a lot of land and expand deals and so forth. It would be significantly higher in the core and maybe even higher yet in the Focus Solution Group.\nKristian Talvitie: It gets a little more complicated where you have -- we also have full product line reps, right reps who are focused on major accounts and they sell everything in the bag. So, like how you want to break that out, it will be a little bit complicated.\nJim Heppelmann: But a basic takeaway would be that capacity is over represented for the growth business right? Which is what we need to do to deliver the growth. And you go back to the hiring thing, I can certainly understand where that question comes from? You should know we after about a year ago when we did get behind capacity, we changed the way we looked at this. We used to think of capacity as being a fiscal year thing and now we think of it really is every quarter. So it's not like this year, we have this many heads. But it's more like a constant, every quarter we need to be bringing on more capacity, so that we don't end the year and then have a big step function of capacity we have to ramp going into the next year. So I think our processes are vastly improved in this area.\nMatthew Broome: Okay, perfect. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew [ph] with Berenberg. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: So, thanks for taking my question. Maybe if I could ask about the ARR guidance increase. Can you maybe explain to us the components of that. I guess Onshape is a big one, but are there deal timing pushouts that happens from Q4 to Q1. FX, can you maybe quantify that a little further?\nKristian Talvitie: Yes. Sure. So this is Kristian. Let's start with Onshape. Onshape is already embedded in our initial guidance, which we provided last quarter.\nJim Heppelmann: After the acquisition was announced.\nKristian Talvitie: After the acquisition announced, but provided in the initial guidance, so it's about $10 million from Onshape. There is about a $15 million increase from favorable FX as well, and then, just we're now a quarter of the way through the year. And we delivered what we believe were very solid results for Q1 and feel that much more comfortable with the range that we have out there. So in essence, what we did was tighten up the bottom end of the range from 12% to 15% to 13% to 15% and then increase the range from 13% to 15% to 14% to 16% really based on the FX impact. So hopefully that helps.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Wong with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.\nKen Wong: Okay. Thanks for taking my question guys. Hi, how is it going? Good afternoon. You're very positive on just the trajectory of Onshape and obviously you guys have more things to come and announce. It sounds like so far we've had a lot of feedback in terms of how maybe your customers are receiving it. Can you give us a little bit of color in terms of how the Onshape side of the installed base is looking at the PTC portfolio?\nJim Heppelmann: Yes. I mean, I think the first thing we focused on was to make sure that the Onshape customers felt that it was a good thing that PTC acquired Onshape, just even if they stop there. And I think we've been very successful there. The messaging, we put out there was very supportive of Onshape and its importance to our future strategy. And of course CAD is very sticky software that companies tend to use for a lot of years. So if you're using Onshape you want to make sure it's in a sustainable place, so that you don't end up finding it's being shut down some years down the road or something like that. You've got to go find a new CAD system. So I think the general message was well received that Onshape has a great home within PTC. That's been a big success. Now as it goes to cross-sell, I mean, honestly it's too early. I do have a few anecdotal stories, but not enough to really draw any meaningful conclusions. But I would say this, we certainly think there are complementary use cases. For example, we're going to bring our AR technology close to Onshape, actually use much of the Onshape platform and that will make that an easy cross-sell. And then we're off exploring coexistence strategies with Creo and Windchill as well so that we could both upsell from Onshape to Creo, Windchill and Vuforia, but also cross-sell in those accounts to bring Onshape in for peripheral or let's call it edge use cases. So it's too early, though, to be honest. I'm very optimistic, but we've only owned it for about two months and we're past the phase where people are looking for the bathroom, although we had to start over this week when they move to the headquarters. But I mean it's just -- it's honestly too early.\nKen Wong: Got it. Great, thanks for the color Jim.\nOperator: Next, we will hear from Adam Borg with Stifel. Your line is open.\nAdam Borg: Hi guys. And -- hi guys, thanks for the question. Maybe just talking a little bit more in AR. So you've talked about Augmented Reality growing above market rates and some opportunities in PLM, but just wanted to dig in a little more on the cross-sell opportunity with IoT. Just given how complementary it is with ThingWorx and maybe talk more about that cross-sell opportunity within installed base? Thanks.\nJim Heppelmann: Yes. I mean, I think, you have to think about it as we're trying to connect the physical and digital worlds together like in our logo, right. And IoT is one form of connection and AR is another. And when you connect them together, you can then have AR experiences that contain IoT data, meaning I can use AR in the physical world to tell you about the physical world because I know about the physical world, thanks to IoT. So these are definitely piece in the pod. It is a wonderful beautiful combination. The products are very well integrated. In fact, if you remember, for a while, we call the Vuforia Studio, ThingWorx Studio, but these are very complementary technology and what's really great, they are both best-in-class and there is no other IoT company who has AR technology and there is no other AR company who has IoT technology. So this is a very compelling story and it's completely unique to PTC.\nAdam Borg: Great. And maybe just as a quick follow-up. I think this year, you guys are focusing on increasing deal duration both for new deals and renewals. And just curious, I know it's still early in the year but what's customer receptivity towards that? Thanks again.\nKristian Talvitie: Yes. I think it's early in the year to really comment on that.\nAdam Borg: Great. Thanks so much.\nKristian Talvitie: Is it that later.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sterling Auty with JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nSterling Auty: Yes. Thanks. Hi guys. Jim, you mentioned that nothing has really changed in the economic backdrop that you're still dealing with the challenging PMI numbers. So with that as the constant, what would you say is the biggest change in the business and based on your tone are you suggesting that the core of the business -- sorry, I don't mean core isn't that label, but the bulk of the business has fundamentally changed for the better and if so, what are the main factors that have caused that?\nJim Heppelmann: Yes. Okay. So yes, let me say, first of all, the PMI is what it is, it's not in a good place and yet, we're in a good place. So clearly something has changed and I would submit that two things have changed. Number one, we've changed our business model and metrics and we're a recurring revenue company versus a perpetual, and I want to come back to that. And then number two, we have a growth business and as many growth businesses are, they're not cyclical, they are secular. Companies want to do digital transformation even when they're laying off workers. In fact, they might even connect those strategies together. So I think the secular piece is very important, but frankly it's overwhelmed by the business model change. And so if we go back to the great recession of 2009, let's review what happened at PTC. We had a perpetual stream of licenses and we had a recurring stream of maintenance. The bottom fell out on the economy. The perpetual license sales declined, if I remember correctly 32% in 2009. And what happened is the maintenance stream, which had been growing mid-single-digits, basically went flat. And in 2010 it actually went down 2% and after that it grew every year since. So what happened actually is the effect on a recurring revenue stream is very much muted. And you can see this in the sensitivity analysis we gave you some quarters ago, where we showed you that for every 5 points that bookings drop, it would only bring ARR down 1 point. So if bookings dropped 30%, it would put 6 points of pressure on ARR, but that would be 2009 all over again. So we're in a situation where actually bookings aren't dropping. They're going up, because of the secular thing. And therefore, ARR is going up with it. So I just think the days when PTC was highly correlated to PMI are simply behind us.\nSterling Auty: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Koenig with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.\nSteve Koenig: Thanks guys. Congratulations on a very good quarter. So, let's see my question here is on the -- you had your revenue growth in your growth business this quarter masked your ARR growth or actually was a point above, and you mentioned that expansion deals were something like two-thirds of your IoT AR bookings. How did that latter metric compare with other quarters and how is that trending? And more generally, do you expect revenue growth is going to be more a parity with bookings growth here going forward. Then I have a really quick housekeeping follow-up, if you don't mind.\nJim Heppelmann: Yes. I can take part of that, because I've commented on this many quarters and it's always in many recent quarters it's been in the 60% some range of bookings was from expansions. So again, we've been following a land and expand model, which is a beautiful thing when you get it to work and I think ours is really starting to work, because you have a lot of accounts out there that you've sold, and they haven't contributed much to revenue, but then they come back and expand, and the expansions are really interesting. And they may come back several tranches of expansion. So that's been happening. We have many IoT and AR customers in particular who have come back one or more times for expansions. And I think I need to defer to Kristian, if you can talk at all -- explain the correlation between bookings and revenue growth rates. I think it's complicated.\nKristian Talvitie: Yes, it's pretty complicated. And depends again, I'll just remind everybody, it depends a lot on start dates. It depends on term length. It depends on renewal activity, etc. So it's not just term length of new deals but term length of this new deal.\nJim Heppelmann: Could I just interrupt; the real question is it revenue but revenue recognition. So you get a booking, maybe you can recognize it maybe you can't, maybe it starts next month, which means next quarter. Maybe it's a ramp deal. So, yes, it is a murky correlation between bookings growth and revenue growth.\nKristian Talvitie: Which is why we're trying to focus on ARR, which is kind of a much cleaner and a better proxy in that sense, cash generation for the business. And we still continue to expect the growth businesses to deliver north of market growth rates for fiscal '20. We would also expect there to be strong revenue growth attendance of that as well.\nSteve Koenig: Okay, that's helpful. I guess, maybe to recast that question a little bit. How are you seeing churn or the inverse kind of renewal and expansion activity trending in that growth business. And then I'll just toss out the housekeeping question here, which is your -- am I correct that your new ARR guide is now -- you're now giving that nominally and that's 14% to 16%, but the comparison was 12% to 15% as your prior guide, the constant currency compares 13% to 15%. Is that right?\nKristian Talvitie: That's correct. Yes, we tightened up the low end of the range and then raised the entire range because of FX. 100% agreed. Then in terms of churn, we continue to see churn in the growth businesses higher than in the core and FSG from a percentage perspective, and we also continue to expect that that will trend down over time. So...\nJim Heppelmann: It has been improving consistently for a long period of time and we expect that to continue.\nKristian Talvitie: Yes. So I don't think there's anything notable really to point out there other than those factors remain.\nSteve Koenig: Got you. Great. Well thank you very much, guys and congrats again.\nJim Heppelmann: Okay, great.\nOperator: Next we will hear from Yun Kim with Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is open.\nYun Kim: Thank you. Hi guys. Congrats on a solid quarter. I just want to talk about some of the ASP trends that you may be seeing out there. Obviously, you guys talked about ASP trend, I'm assuming its increasing in the growth products group. How is that ASP trending versus your core products group. And obviously, Jim, you talked about land and expand model working very well. Has that minimized the overall percent of business coming from large deals, despite I am assuming increase in ASP coming from your growth business?\nJim Heppelmann: Okay. By ASP, you really mean deal size.\nYun Kim: Yes.\nJim Heppelmann: Transaction size, exactly. Yes, I mean average deal size in the growth business, I'd have to check because while we're getting more big deals, we're also getting more small deals. So I'm not convinced -- I don't have the data in front of me, but my intuition would be ASP is actually not changing much. But of course, the business is growing fast. And then in any case it would generally be smaller than the core business because of this land and expand motion that we adopted in the growth business and didn't really adapt so much ever in the core business. So the core business tends to be bigger transactions, although there is a lot of add-ons of modules here and there, but PLM for example would tend to have larger ASPs because there is not really a land and expand model.\nYun Kim: Got it. Okay, that makes sense.\nJim Heppelmann: Sorry, that's not a perfect answer, but I hopefully it answers.\nKristian Talvitie: I think they were smaller than they were when they were perpetual.\nYun Kim: Oh yes, sure. Okay, great. And Jim also real quick question around more of a thematic stuff. So, not sure if you're running into this, but we are hearing a lot about 5G technology potentially accelerating the market adoption of IoT out there, especially in the factory automation market. Do you see that or do you expect the 5G technology to be meaningful for you in your IoT business or is it too early to tell?\nJim Heppelmann: Well, I definitely think it's important to our IoT customers. It's too early to know if it would cause our business to grow faster or not, but certainly in factories, people want to adapt 5G to have high-speed, low latency wireless communications for their machines and their Augmented Reality devices and so forth. So it's definitely important and I can tell you, we are engaged in discussions with several different 5G partners. I think one of them might end up being a big sponsor of LiveWorx. And I see it at this point as an ecosystem play, which is I want to make sure that 5G companies help promote our IoT technology and that our IoT technology can create opportunities for 5G companies and so forth. I think it's too early to say it's accelerator, but it's definitely important.\nYun Kim: Okay, great. I think that's it. So congrats on a great quarter.\nJim Heppelmann: Right, great. Thanks, Yun.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Celino with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJason Celino: Thanks for taking my question. It looks like expense growth in the quarter was around 5%. But I think you guys are guiding more to 9% growth for the full year. Can you just talk about what are maybe some of the other big investments that you'll be making on integration costs as we kind of go through the year?\nJim Heppelmann: Yes. So I think expense growth has a little bit to do with timing of Onshape right, as we only had a couple of months in the quarter. So we didn't have a full quarter's worth of Onshape. And then there is the kind of normal hiring plans. And we do have some back end loading to that hiring.\nJason Celino: Great, thanks.\nOperator: Next, we'll hear from Alex Tout with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nAlex Tout: Yes, hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. I'd just be interested in your comments on the automotive end market specifically. It seems like it's probably one of the most, if not the most challenged manufacturing end market at the moment. I know your exposure isn't huge, but we are interested to see what you're seeing in terms of -- because I guess on the one hand you have secular and cyclical challenges in that industry versus also a need to innovate at the same time. So, what's kind of the net of those dynamics that you're seeing in your customers in the automotive space right now. Thanks.\nJim Heppelmann: Yes. We're seeing actually relatively strong demand for IoT factory projects. Because I think in the downturn, people are looking for efficiency and taking a dumb factory and making it smart ought to make it most people would believe 5%, 10%, 15% more efficient and across the level of spend that people have in their production processes, those are very big numbers. So IoT demand is good. And then I'd also say PLM demand is good. I mentioned a truck company. There is another big European automotive OEM where we're working on some big PLM projects and probably looking at an expansion on that to the next phase pretty soon and so forth. So I think the PLM is really coming from digital transformation and IoT is coming from, let's try they find more productivity in our factories. I would say CAD, not so much probably. Probably we're not getting a lot of demand on the CAD front right now but good demand for PLM and IoT.\nAlex Tout: Great. Thanks for the color.\nJim Heppelmann: Thanks, Alex.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tyler Radke with Citi. Your line is open.\nTyler Radke: Thank you very much for taking my question. It looks like on the guidance you -- the guidance raised on most metrics was driven by a combination of currency as well as solid execution in the quarter. The one line item that didn't see a raise appeared to be free cash flow. Maybe just help us understand why, given the solid fundamental performance in the quarter and your improved outlook on the year, why you're not expecting more free cash flow, then you previously guided. Thank you.\nKristian Talvitie: Yes, sure. So I think we should look at both adjusted free cash flow and free cash flow. And I'll start with just free cash flow first. So we did take the adjusted free cash flow for currency, free cash flow we did not. And just highlighting we put it in the prepared remarks, but when we put out the initial restructuring estimate for the year that was based on an estimate -- current estimates actually have that about $5 million higher. So that actually offsets favorable currency impact on free cash flow. For adjusted free cash flow, we did raise that by $5 million, which again is largely the FX impact. And what I would say here is, it's just early in the year and we're just being prudent. Of course, we will revisit this as we continue to move through the year, but that's the answer.\nTyler Radke: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That is all the time that we have for questions. Please remain on the line for Tim Fox's closing remarks.\nTim Fox: Hi. Thanks, Sheila. And thanks everybody for joining us today on the call. PTC is going to be participating in three conferences in March, starting with Morgan Stanley's Global TMT Conference in San Francisco, followed by Berenberg's Design Conference and RBC's one-on-one conference both in New York. And additionally, we're going to be sending a save-the-date for our 2020 LiveWorx Event, which will be here in Boston, of course from June 8 to June 11, so watch that in your inbox. And so we look forward to seeing on the conference circuit in the coming months and if not, we'll be sure to update you on our Q2 call in April. Again, thank you for your interest in PTC and have a great evening, everyone.\nJim Heppelmann: Yes. Thanks, everybody.\nKristian Talvitie: Thank you.\nJim Heppelmann: Bye-bye.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "Kristian Talvitie",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon everyone. Before I review our results, I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance and all growth rate references will be in constant currency. Let me start off with a review of our first quarter results. Again this quarter I'm going to keep my remarks brief hitting just some key highlights and ask investors to refer to our press release and prepared remarks document available on our IR website for additional details. Q1 ARR was $1.16 billion, representing 11% year-over-year growth, which is consistent with the guidance commentary we provided last quarter. ARR in our growth product group was up 36% year-over-year and we continue to expect ARR growth to be above market growth rates of 30% to 40% in fiscal '20. ARR in the core, was up 10% year-over-year which was also above market growth and consistent with our outlook for fiscal '20. ARR in FSG was up 1% year-over-year, primarily due to the timing of deals and we expect ARR growth to be in the low to mid-single-digits for FSG for fiscal '20. Total Q1 revenue of $356 million was up 8% year-over-year, despite a 78% year-over-year decrease in perpetual license revenue driven by the end of perpetual license sales on January 1, 2019. Operating margin of 26% increased 200 basis points over Q4 '19 and declined 100 basis points compared to Q1 '19, where we experienced higher than expected perpetual license revenue resulting from the perpetual end of life program. And lastly, non-GAAP EPS of $0.57 increased 5% year-over-year against the perpetual heavy comparison of last year. And as you'll recall, revenue and operating expenses and consequently EPS can be impacted positively or negatively by ASC 606. Major drivers impacting revenue include term length changes and support to subscription conversion. And on the OpEx side, commissions were obviously also impacted. Finally, our Q1 adjusted free cash flow of $12 million was within our expectations and sets us up to achieve our full year guidance. Now turning to the guidance. Beginning with ARR. For fiscal '20, we're increasing our guidance to a range of $1.27 billion to $1.29 billion or 14% to 16% year-over-year growth and 13% to 15% on a constant currency basis. ARR guidance includes approximately $15 million of positive FX and already embedded in our original guidance for the year is approximately $10 million of ARR or 1 point of growth from the Onshape acquisition. Consistent with our prior guidance commentary, we expect Q2 constant currency ARR growth to be in line with Q1 results with ARR growth rates accelerating in the back half of the year. This increase is driven by both normal seasonality of our business and our backlog of deals booked in prior periods. Now turning to adjusted free cash flow. For fiscal '20, we're expecting a range of $260 million to $280 million reflecting the positive FX impact of $5 million. Now turning to P&L guidance. We're now expecting fiscal '20 total revenue of $1.45 billion to $1.53 billion, an increase of $25 million at the midpoint of guidance reflecting our Q1 performance, our outlook for the remainder of the year and approximately $15 million of FX. Non-GAAP EPS is now expected to be $2.15 to $2.65, an increase of $0.12 at the midpoint of guidance, reflecting our Q1 performance and outlook, and $0.05 of FX. We continue to expect fiscal '20 operating expenses to grow approximately 9% year-over-year. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A. Yes. Yes. Hi, Ken, it's Kristian. I think we're not going to get into the quarterly variability, again just given the reporting framework that we have. But I think, suffice it to say that given the guidance that we have for the year we're expecting -- continuing to expect a modest improvement in net retention here in fiscal '20. Yes. Sure, Saket, it's a good question. So, thanks. If we just delve into the mechanics of it, how ramp deals impact ARR, is we will add things to ARR on start date of the contract, right, not book date, start date and in the case of a ramp deal where you have in essence kind of multiple start dates that you have year one of whatever 100,000... Sure. So the way that that would flow into ARR is, we would take the first five factories worth in year one. And say year two when the next five come -- comes on we would take the incremental five factories. And then in the third year we would take the incremental 10. So that's the mechanics of it. ARR flows in on start date of the contractual commitment. In terms of where we're seeing -- where we're seeing ramp deals. I think... We see, I would say more of them in the growth product group, IoT AR, and then we still actually do see some in core as well but to a lesser extent, and to the least extent in any of the FSG products. Yes. Great. So in terms of tracking the capacity, I think we are on track for hiring kind of right where we would like to be at this point given our plan. In terms of the spread, frankly I'm going to have to get back to you on specific details, but the majority is actually still on the core product set which is understandable and the increasing amount on IoT. And then still specialists focused on the various compounds in FSG. It gets a little more complicated where you have -- we also have full product line reps, right reps who are focused on major accounts and they sell everything in the bag. So, like how you want to break that out, it will be a little bit complicated. Yes. Sure. So this is Kristian. Let's start with Onshape. Onshape is already embedded in our initial guidance, which we provided last quarter. After the acquisition announced, but provided in the initial guidance, so it's about $10 million from Onshape. There is about a $15 million increase from favorable FX as well, and then, just we're now a quarter of the way through the year. And we delivered what we believe were very solid results for Q1 and feel that much more comfortable with the range that we have out there. So in essence, what we did was tighten up the bottom end of the range from 12% to 15% to 13% to 15% and then increase the range from 13% to 15% to 14% to 16% really based on the FX impact. So hopefully that helps. Yes. I think it's early in the year to really comment on that. Is it that later. Yes, it's pretty complicated. And depends again, I'll just remind everybody, it depends a lot on start dates. It depends on term length. It depends on renewal activity, etc. So it's not just term length of new deals but term length of this new deal. Which is why we're trying to focus on ARR, which is kind of a much cleaner and a better proxy in that sense, cash generation for the business. And we still continue to expect the growth businesses to deliver north of market growth rates for fiscal '20. We would also expect there to be strong revenue growth attendance of that as well. That's correct. Yes, we tightened up the low end of the range and then raised the entire range because of FX. 100% agreed. Then in terms of churn, we continue to see churn in the growth businesses higher than in the core and FSG from a percentage perspective, and we also continue to expect that that will trend down over time. So... Yes. So I don't think there's anything notable really to point out there other than those factors remain. I think they were smaller than they were when they were perpetual. Yes, sure. So I think we should look at both adjusted free cash flow and free cash flow. And I'll start with just free cash flow first. So we did take the adjusted free cash flow for currency, free cash flow we did not. And just highlighting we put it in the prepared remarks, but when we put out the initial restructuring estimate for the year that was based on an estimate -- current estimates actually have that about $5 million higher. So that actually offsets favorable currency impact on free cash flow. For adjusted free cash flow, we did raise that by $5 million, which again is largely the FX impact. And what I would say here is, it's just early in the year and we're just being prudent. Of course, we will revisit this as we continue to move through the year, but that's the answer. Thank you."

            "name": "Jim Heppelmann",
            "content": "Thanks, Tim. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to share that our solid Q1 performance puts us right on track to deliver against our fiscal '20 targets and our attractive long-term financial ranges. ARR which is our key top line metric grew 11% in Q1. As Kristian will detail later in the call, we are raising our fiscal '20 ARR guidance based on our Q1 performance, our visibility into the balance of the fiscal year and favorable currency tailwinds. We're also raising revenue, EPS and adjusted free cash flow guidance for the year. At the midpoint of our guidance, we're now expecting fiscal '20 ARR growth in the mid-teens, revenue growth approaching 20% and EPS growth above 40%. The benefits of all the hard work we've done in the past years to expand our profitability, to increase our growth rate and to convert to a subscription model are really starting to show, because PTC truly is emerging as one of the world's premier public software companies. Before digging into the details, I'd like to share some observations about broader industry trends and PTC's unique position in terms of helping customers thrive during this period of rapid change in the industrial world. Similar to other industries like entertainment, hospitality or transportation that have been disrupted by digital technologies, industrial companies are now facing new challenges from traditional competitors that are embracing digital technologies across the value chains, and from new entrants exploring new business models. Digital transformation has become a wave that's sweeping across the industrial market, enabling companies to better differentiate their products and services while simultaneously optimizing their engineering, manufacturing, sales and service processes. As the only company out there who has a suite of CAD, PLM, IoT, AI and AR capabilities, PTC has a unique ability to help customers pursue their digital transformation ambitions. Every day, we are helping customers to do things like implement AI driven product design, or to create a digital thread to leverage product data across the value chain, or to gain operational insight from their products in the field and their assets and their factories through our leading IoT and AI technology and to drive significant improvements to worker productivity through our AR technology. I host many customer meetings and I can tell you that PTC Solutions really resonate with our customers, because they align with their high priority initiatives. Nobody else looks like PTC, and with the opportunity in front of us it's a very exciting time to be here. Given our performance and forward-looking momentum, one should take note that traditional economic measures like the PMI index are now much less correlated with PTC business trends. As we all learned in the great recession of 2009, recurring revenue streams are impacted much less by economic fluctuations then is perpetual license revenue. This suggests that our subscription-based business model coupled with growing secular dynamics of our business that I described earlier, have to a large degree driven a decoupling from traditional cyclical measures like PMI. We are guiding the strong ARR growth against the backdrop of some of the most lackluster PMI numbers in recent memory. Of course, we remain mindful of these external measures, but this negative sentiment has been around for some time now. This decoupling gives us even more confidence in our ability to drive sustainable growth going forward. Turning now to some highlights in the quarter. I'll begin with our growth business that now includes ThingWorx IoT, Vuforia AR and Onshape SaaS. ARR growth for our IoT solutions accelerated quarter-over-quarter and our augmented reality solutions once again outpaced high market growth rates, thanks to a continuation of the trend of customers introducing AR into their manufacturing and service environments. In addition the healthy new logo activity, Q1 expansion bookings represented about 65% of IoT and AR bookings, primarily driven by customer shifting from pilots to production at an accelerating pace. The number of six-figure deals in the quarter, more than doubled versus a year ago. When viewed through an ARR lens, trends across our customer cohorts are impressive. Relative to Q1 of last year the number of IoT and AR customers with ARR greater than 500K grew by over 50% [ph]. One of these customers; Thermo Fisher is a great example of how enterprises are transforming their business with PTC Solutions. Thermo Fisher is a global leader in the biotech space, who is leveraging ThingWorx to offer new value-added services to further differentiate themselves in their competitive end markets. In their chemical analysis division for example, Thermo Fisher embeds ThingWorx within their products, allowing end customers to remotely capture and analyze test data from these products. Thermo Fisher is also leveraging ThingWorx for predictive maintenance, and to provide feedback loops to their product development teams. Thermo Fisher is representative of the trends we're seeing where customers are expanding their digital footprint across product lines and use cases and into their production environments as well. Given the broad scope and global nature of the digital transformation opportunity within the industrial market, we knew it would be challenging to pursue this alone. Of course, that's why we performed strategic alliances with industry leaders like Rockwell Automation and Microsoft. Both of these alliances again delivered the goods in Q1. In our Rockwell Automation alliance, Q1 provided a strong start to the year with robust new deal activity, plus a meaningful uptick in expansions as pilot projects that were kicked off earlier in FY '19 moved into production. The Rockwell alliance team delivered new deals across the broad cross-section of vertical markets and in 15 different geographies, which highlights both the deep industrial domain expertise and the global reach that Rockwell Automation brings to this relationship. In our Microsoft alliance, Q1 also marked a strong start to the year with new ACV bookings well above plan. Geographically, the Americas continues to be the main driver of growth. However, momentum in Europe is building and the Microsoft alliance has a robust pipeline heading into Q2. We're also pleased to see that demand continued to expand beyond the smart connected product use case into factory and even AR solutions, which represented more than a third of the alliance bookings in Q1. A great proof point of the power of our Microsoft alliance is a recent win at Johnson Controls, who is a leading global provider of building control systems. It turns out that PTC, Microsoft and Accenture were independently supporting JCI's digital transformation efforts from different angles. Too many cooks in the kitchen ran the risk of slowing things down. So PTC, Microsoft and Accenture joined forces and approached the C-suite with a unified strategy for their smart factory initiatives. Together we landed the deal to deliver a fully cloud-based smart factory solution that has Accenture deploying PTC's ThingWorx and Microsoft's Azure. Before I leave the growth discussion, let me share that we're making great progress integrating the Onshape team. In fact the Onshape team moved into our Seaport headquarters earlier this week. I'd like to think of Onshape as the proverbial iceberg. What you see above water the 5%, looks a lot like a next-gen CAD and PLM system. But what's below the water the 95%, is PTC's new pure SaaS platform. We have big plans for Onshape and for SaaS, and I'm convinced this will become another major growth engine for PTC. Well it's too early to say much yet, I look forward to updating you on our SaaS progress in coming quarters. Our core product group delivered strong Q1 performance as well. Core business ARR growth of 10% outpaced market growth again in the quarter. It was led by very strong performance in PLM which delivered mid-teens ARR growth, that reflected broad based strength across all major geographies. In my view, the strong performance in PLM is indicative of the growing strategic role that PLM technology now plays in our customers' digital transformation strategies. Any industrial company who wants to undertake a digital transformation, quickly realizes that PLM will need to be one of their anchor tenant systems of record. Take Groupe Beneteau, our French manufacturer who is a leader in luxury sale in power boats. By leveraging PTC's Windchill, along with Creo and ThingWorx and Vuforia, Beneteau is delivering product and service differentiation together with engineering excellence and operational efficiency. Their PLM technology roadmap began with foundational capabilities such as bill of material management and change management. Then, extended into the factory with concurrent engineering and manufacturing instructions and from there into leveraging AR functionality for shop floor operators and dealership scenarios. This powerful combination of highly differentiated technologies is truly unique to PTC. We're using it to win new business and to expand relationships with existing customers as they seek to modernize the business processes. Altogether, we're seeing more and more evidence of a rejuvenation of PLM that makes the long-term growth opportunity that much more attractive for PTC. Our CAD team had a solid start to the year too, again delivering high single-digit ARR growth with notable strength in Asia-Pacific and in our global reseller channel. On the Creo Simulation Live front which is the starting point for our ANSYS partnership, interest remains high. Adoption, particularly in the enterprise space continues to ramp nicely with average deal sizes continuing to grow. Our focus on Creo Simulation Live or CSL as we call it, in FY '20 is on driving adoption in the channel which generates about half of our CAD business. We're kicking off new channel enablement and promotional programs in Q2 and remain bullish on the long-term opportunity for a significant CSL penetration in our installed base. While CSL is the tip of the spear in our partnership with ANSYS, we're also making good progress, bringing the broader discovery aim suite into the Creo fold as well. To wrap up my comments, I'd like to reiterate PTC's full commitment to driving mid-teens ARR growth and generating significant free cash flow in the coming years. Our strong performance in CAD and PLM, plus our leadership positions in the high growth IoT and AR markets, and more new opportunities for growth in the SaaS-based product development market with Onshape, gives us strong confidence that our growth will remain both significant and sustainable over the long-term. With our subscription transition and the rear -- rearview mirror and our ongoing focus on disciplined cost and portfolio management, we're firmly on track with our plans to transform PTC into one of the premier public software companies in the world. And with that, I'll turn it over to Kristian to comment on financials and guidance. Well, I think we're going to have a very strong year this year for sure. And I think if you remember back to September, Kristian said over the coming five years, we would expect our PLM ARR growth rate to slow down to the market growth rate, which I think you had at 8%? Yes. So we're sort of mid-teens and we think over the five years that will slow to 8%. Now that's based on a number of factors. One thing is our renewal rates in PLM are very high. This is very, very sticky software, and relative to the base of ARR, we're selling a lot of it. So we're really in a strong good situation where there is strong demand because of digital transformation. Our product is ranked number one by every analyst report I have ever seen. And so we're in a good strong position where we get a chance to meet that demand with our product and high renewal rates and that's bodes well for a long time to come. Yes. I think, there have been pendulums for sure. And one of the strong upswings was when PTC who at that point had a CAD footprint brought PLM into the picture and cross-sold a lot of PLM to the CAD audience. Now, I think what's happening this time is a couple of different drivers. One is, we're doing a lot more engineering in the manufacturing data transformation. We have the software module of our PLM system called MPM link as in manufacturing process management and it's used to convert an engineering design and an engineering bill of material into a manufacturing process design and instructions, and the manufacturing bill of material in a very systematic configuration managed sort of way, so that if somebody later decides to change the engineering design, we can pinpoint what they need to update in the manufacturing process very quickly. And if the engineering design is highly configurable. Well, it turns out so as the manufacturing instructions and the MBOMs. So today we're selling a lot into that, that's become a new driver, an incremental new driver. And then the other thing is customers are really realizing for example, this augmented reality technology which we have best-in-class, customers love it. It's selling like crazy. That stuff needs configuration management of its content. So a lot of customers and I'm thinking of a great big -- I won't name them, because it didn't -- I didn't ask if I could, but a great big truck company in Europe really is excited about our AR technology and what its produced is a PLM project. Because they say, all right, that's great. But we'll never really be able to do augmented reality without configuration management of the content. So let's go do this broader PLM project. So I think that's another driver. I put that one also in kind of the digital transformation category. So I think there is definitely an upswing, but it's really brought by people saying how could you have a digital transformation strategy without having the digital descriptions of your products and manufacturing processes under control. It's silly to even talk about that. So I think this is definitely produced the tailwind that's generating momentum for PLM. Yes. I mean, I think, what normally happens here at PTC maybe elsewhere, but here at PTC when we launch a business, a new business, it gets traction first in the US and then over time it gains more and more traction in Europe and APAC. And so I think that's just a natural way that these businesses develop, and we see it happening here. So a lot of times they get stronger first in the US and then without the US necessarily weakening, Europe and Asia have come on stronger a little bit later. That's what I would attribute that to. So if the question -- sorry, I'm just going to repeat it to make sure that I understood it. I think the question was how are we tracking in terms of sales capacity? Was step one and then step two, how is that capacity divided between growth in core and in FSG? Yes. I mean another way to look at it would be to look at sales productivity which would be lowest in the growth business, because growth, you're bringing on a lot of new capacity. And it's doing a lot of land and expand deals and so forth. It would be significantly higher in the core and maybe even higher yet in the Focus Solution Group. But a basic takeaway would be that capacity is over represented for the growth business right? Which is what we need to do to deliver the growth. And you go back to the hiring thing, I can certainly understand where that question comes from? You should know we after about a year ago when we did get behind capacity, we changed the way we looked at this. We used to think of capacity as being a fiscal year thing and now we think of it really is every quarter. So it's not like this year, we have this many heads. But it's more like a constant, every quarter we need to be bringing on more capacity, so that we don't end the year and then have a big step function of capacity we have to ramp going into the next year. So I think our processes are vastly improved in this area. After the acquisition was announced. Yes. I mean, I think the first thing we focused on was to make sure that the Onshape customers felt that it was a good thing that PTC acquired Onshape, just even if they stop there. And I think we've been very successful there. The messaging, we put out there was very supportive of Onshape and its importance to our future strategy. And of course CAD is very sticky software that companies tend to use for a lot of years. So if you're using Onshape you want to make sure it's in a sustainable place, so that you don't end up finding it's being shut down some years down the road or something like that. You've got to go find a new CAD system. So I think the general message was well received that Onshape has a great home within PTC. That's been a big success. Now as it goes to cross-sell, I mean, honestly it's too early. I do have a few anecdotal stories, but not enough to really draw any meaningful conclusions. But I would say this, we certainly think there are complementary use cases. For example, we're going to bring our AR technology close to Onshape, actually use much of the Onshape platform and that will make that an easy cross-sell. And then we're off exploring coexistence strategies with Creo and Windchill as well so that we could both upsell from Onshape to Creo, Windchill and Vuforia, but also cross-sell in those accounts to bring Onshape in for peripheral or let's call it edge use cases. So it's too early, though, to be honest. I'm very optimistic, but we've only owned it for about two months and we're past the phase where people are looking for the bathroom, although we had to start over this week when they move to the headquarters. But I mean it's just -- it's honestly too early. Yes. I mean, I think, you have to think about it as we're trying to connect the physical and digital worlds together like in our logo, right. And IoT is one form of connection and AR is another. And when you connect them together, you can then have AR experiences that contain IoT data, meaning I can use AR in the physical world to tell you about the physical world because I know about the physical world, thanks to IoT. So these are definitely piece in the pod. It is a wonderful beautiful combination. The products are very well integrated. In fact, if you remember, for a while, we call the Vuforia Studio, ThingWorx Studio, but these are very complementary technology and what's really great, they are both best-in-class and there is no other IoT company who has AR technology and there is no other AR company who has IoT technology. So this is a very compelling story and it's completely unique to PTC. Yes. Okay. So yes, let me say, first of all, the PMI is what it is, it's not in a good place and yet, we're in a good place. So clearly something has changed and I would submit that two things have changed. Number one, we've changed our business model and metrics and we're a recurring revenue company versus a perpetual, and I want to come back to that. And then number two, we have a growth business and as many growth businesses are, they're not cyclical, they are secular. Companies want to do digital transformation even when they're laying off workers. In fact, they might even connect those strategies together. So I think the secular piece is very important, but frankly it's overwhelmed by the business model change. And so if we go back to the great recession of 2009, let's review what happened at PTC. We had a perpetual stream of licenses and we had a recurring stream of maintenance. The bottom fell out on the economy. The perpetual license sales declined, if I remember correctly 32% in 2009. And what happened is the maintenance stream, which had been growing mid-single-digits, basically went flat. And in 2010 it actually went down 2% and after that it grew every year since. So what happened actually is the effect on a recurring revenue stream is very much muted. And you can see this in the sensitivity analysis we gave you some quarters ago, where we showed you that for every 5 points that bookings drop, it would only bring ARR down 1 point. So if bookings dropped 30%, it would put 6 points of pressure on ARR, but that would be 2009 all over again. So we're in a situation where actually bookings aren't dropping. They're going up, because of the secular thing. And therefore, ARR is going up with it. So I just think the days when PTC was highly correlated to PMI are simply behind us. Yes. I can take part of that, because I've commented on this many quarters and it's always in many recent quarters it's been in the 60% some range of bookings was from expansions. So again, we've been following a land and expand model, which is a beautiful thing when you get it to work and I think ours is really starting to work, because you have a lot of accounts out there that you've sold, and they haven't contributed much to revenue, but then they come back and expand, and the expansions are really interesting. And they may come back several tranches of expansion. So that's been happening. We have many IoT and AR customers in particular who have come back one or more times for expansions. And I think I need to defer to Kristian, if you can talk at all -- explain the correlation between bookings and revenue growth rates. I think it's complicated. Could I just interrupt; the real question is it revenue but revenue recognition. So you get a booking, maybe you can recognize it maybe you can't, maybe it starts next month, which means next quarter. Maybe it's a ramp deal. So, yes, it is a murky correlation between bookings growth and revenue growth. It has been improving consistently for a long period of time and we expect that to continue. Okay, great. Okay. By ASP, you really mean deal size. Transaction size, exactly. Yes, I mean average deal size in the growth business, I'd have to check because while we're getting more big deals, we're also getting more small deals. So I'm not convinced -- I don't have the data in front of me, but my intuition would be ASP is actually not changing much. But of course, the business is growing fast. And then in any case it would generally be smaller than the core business because of this land and expand motion that we adopted in the growth business and didn't really adapt so much ever in the core business. So the core business tends to be bigger transactions, although there is a lot of add-ons of modules here and there, but PLM for example would tend to have larger ASPs because there is not really a land and expand model. Sorry, that's not a perfect answer, but I hopefully it answers. Well, I definitely think it's important to our IoT customers. It's too early to know if it would cause our business to grow faster or not, but certainly in factories, people want to adapt 5G to have high-speed, low latency wireless communications for their machines and their Augmented Reality devices and so forth. So it's definitely important and I can tell you, we are engaged in discussions with several different 5G partners. I think one of them might end up being a big sponsor of LiveWorx. And I see it at this point as an ecosystem play, which is I want to make sure that 5G companies help promote our IoT technology and that our IoT technology can create opportunities for 5G companies and so forth. I think it's too early to say it's accelerator, but it's definitely important. Right, great. Thanks, Yun. Yes. So I think expense growth has a little bit to do with timing of Onshape right, as we only had a couple of months in the quarter. So we didn't have a full quarter's worth of Onshape. And then there is the kind of normal hiring plans. And we do have some back end loading to that hiring. Yes. We're seeing actually relatively strong demand for IoT factory projects. Because I think in the downturn, people are looking for efficiency and taking a dumb factory and making it smart ought to make it most people would believe 5%, 10%, 15% more efficient and across the level of spend that people have in their production processes, those are very big numbers. So IoT demand is good. And then I'd also say PLM demand is good. I mentioned a truck company. There is another big European automotive OEM where we're working on some big PLM projects and probably looking at an expansion on that to the next phase pretty soon and so forth. So I think the PLM is really coming from digital transformation and IoT is coming from, let's try they find more productivity in our factories. I would say CAD, not so much probably. Probably we're not getting a lot of demand on the CAD front right now but good demand for PLM and IoT. Thanks, Alex. Yes. Thanks, everybody. Bye-bye."

During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Shimao, PTC Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMatt Shimao: Good afternoon. Thank you, Paula. And welcome to PTC's 2021 Fourth Quarter Conference Call. On the call today are James Heppelmann, Chief Executive Officer, and Kristian Talvitie, Chief Financial Officer. Today's conference call is being broadcast live through an audio webcast, and a replay of the call will be available late today at www.ptc.com. During this call, PTC will make forward-looking statements, including guidance as to future operating results.  Because such statements deal with future events, actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause these factual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements can be found in PTC's annual report on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as in today's press release.  The forward-looking statements, including guidance provided during the call are valid only as of today's date, November 3rd, 2021, and PTC assumes no obligation to publicly update these forward-looking statements. During the call, PTC will discuss non-GAAP financial measures.  These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in today's press release made available on our website. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to PTC's Chief Executive Officer, James Heppelmann.\nJames Heppelmann: Thanks, Matt, and welcome again to PTC. It's been great to get you on board and thanks for your help in preparing for today's call. We have a lot of exciting news for our investors today, so we plan to allow a little more time than usual for the call. No doubt there will be follow-up interest, so we've also scheduled our Annual Investor Day.  In mid-December, and we expect to be active on the IR circuit in the weeks ahead. Starting then with Slide 4. Given the news, we're going to follow a somewhat different agenda for today's call. I'm going to start with highlights of our Q4 and fiscal 2021 performance. Then I will take you through an abbreviated version of our product line results. Next, Kristian will complete our discussion of Q4 and Fiscal 2021 with his financial reviews.  Then turning to the future, I'll address the changes we announced today, which are designed to accelerate our SaaS transition and margin expansion. Following that, Kristian will take you through our go-forward guidance and reporting structure. We've reserved extra time for your questions at the end. Moving to Slide 5, Q4 was an outstanding quarter for PTC and it capped off another strong year.  We came in at the high end of our guidance for ARR growth and we exceeded our free cash flow guidance. Despite the pandemic, every part of the business performed well in fiscal '21, with growth in every product line and in every geography. Fiscal '21 was our fourth consecutive year of double-digit organic ARR growth and we're guiding for fiscal '22 to be the fifth. Furthermore, by continuing our strong focus on operational discipline, we've been able to translate our top-line growth into strong bottom-line free cash flow performance. Kristian will take you through free cash flow in more detail later in the call. Taking a look at the key factors driving our top line performance, and turning to slide 6, our Q4 bookings results were outstanding. Bookings were up mid-teens organically, and high-teens overall from the blockbuster Q4 we had a year ago. Remember then in Q4 of fiscal '20, bookings bounced back sharply following a downturn in Q2 and Q3 during the depths of the pandemic.  Surpassing last year's strong Q4 number is a great accomplishment. Bookings were strong across all product lines and geographies. Because Q4 of fiscal '20 had been such an outlier, our plan targeted Q4 '21 organic bookings to be roughly flat to last year's number. Creo was slightly above plan, while everything else was well above.  FSG and Onshape led the way with bookings growth of more than 90% and 70%, respectively. IoT and ARR bookings were both up mid-teens year-over-year to record levels for each, with IoT bookings growing more than 120% sequentially while ARR bookings grew more than 60% sequentially. PLM bookings were up high-single digits year-over-year.  Keep in mind that a good percentage of our Q4 bookings, especially those done later in the quarter don't start until October or later. So they end up in what we used to call backlog but now call deferred ARR. Deferred ARR ended the year $20 million above the original plan we had for fiscal '21.  So in summary, not only did we hit the high end of our Fiscal '21 ARR guidance range by delivering 12 points of organic ARR growth, we also booked about a 0.5 more growth in the deferred ARR, which will benefit future periods. Turning to ARR on Slide 7, on a top-line basis, fiscal '21 was a big success. In Q4, we came in at 12% organic ARR excluding Arena, and 16% ARR growth overall. Looking at our core products in Q4, we continued to deliver market-leading growth.  Creo came in at low double-digit growth, while Windchill grew mid-teens. According to data published by Jay Vleeschhouwer, Creo and Windchill have significantly outperformed Siemens in DSOs, CAD and PLM businesses lately, as they are relatively flat with 2019, while we're up more than 20%.  We've been seeing a solid growth trend in our core CAD and PLM business for years now, and we expect this to continue. I'll come back to this important point during the second part of my prepared remarks. Next, looking at our growth products, IOT grew mid-teens coming in below our target.  However, bookings were strong in Q4 and we expect stronger ARR growth in Fiscal '22 following bookings momentum and the launch of our new digital performance management solution. Vuforia AR, Vuforia Augmented Reality grew mid-teens, which is better than it sounds when you factor in that this growth came on top of very strong 77% growth in our previous Q4 that we're comparing against. I'm happy with the roughly 40% [Indiscernible] over the past two years. In fiscal '22, we're positioned to continue good growth in AR based on our bookings momentum. Onshape grew over 50%.  It's now been 3 years since we acquired Onshape and we're very pleased with the acquisition and the progress made by the Onshape team. Arena grew over 20%. This represents good acceleration from mid-teens pre acquisition growth rates driven by go-to-market investments we've made coupled with synergies gained by being part of PTC. Turning to FSG, growth was 6% primarily driven by strong performance of our systems and software engineering offerings where we benefited from several large deals.  Turning to slide 8, while Creo and Windchill are powerful independently, these products generate even more value when leveraged together. A great example of this integrated story can be found in our recent announcement that the entire Volvo Group will adopt PTC's Creo product as their primary CAD solution, mirroring what they did several years ago with our Windchill PLM solution. This is a big competitive displacement for Creo.  In addition, our answers powered Creo simulation live technology, together with Creo ANSYS simulation, continues to drive customer interest in simulation. I've been saying for some time that as the product system of record, PLM is a critical element of any manufacturing Company's digital transformation strategy.  This is exactly what led to our largest ever PLM order in Q4 of '21 a multi - year committed ramp deal coming from a large global medical device Company. This too, was a competitive displacement for Windchill. nPLM, we saw our average deal sizes increasing with numerous expansions in the quarter.  In IoT this past week, we launched our digital performance management or DPM solution at our manufacturing live event. If you miss the event, by the way, you can find the replay on our Investor website. DPM is our new solution designed to be a comprehensive, turnkey, out-of-the-box solution that addresses our customer's biggest IoT value-creation opportunities.  It will be the perfect antidote to the so-called pilot programs to our problem the IoT industry has been discussing. You may have also noted separately the press release announcing that PTC is the only industrial IoT player recognized as a leader by all 4 major industry analyst firms. Also in the IoT space, Microsoft yesterday officially launched its Cloud for Manufacturing and we're thrilled to be a lead partner.  Our alliance with Microsoft continues to go well with Q4 being our best quarter to-date in terms of co-selling with Microsoft. Vuforia delivered a healthy mix of expansions, cross-sell and net new logos. We landed our largest ever AR order from a large pharmaceutical Company, which will use Vuforia to deliver augmented digital work instructions to improve the speed and quality of production line changeovers.  Also, with all the buzz you hear about Metaverse these days, you might enjoy watching the amazing, live industrial Metaverse demonstration that our CTO, Steve Dertein and I delivered as part of our manufacturing live keynote, using our Vuforia Spatial Toolbox technology. If you look carefully at the graphic on the right side of Slide 8, that is Steve and I standing in front of our anonymized digital representations whose movement and activity is being measured and analyzed in real-time.  This is a peek into our concept of Digital Taylorism, named after the famous work or Frederick Taylor, who was the father of industrial engineering more than a 100 years ago. Turning now to Onshape and Arena on Slide nine. Onshape performance has been driven by strong win rates against competitors, coupled with solid expansion rates.  Onshape captured nearly 1,000 new logos in Fiscal '21. During the year, churn improved by 10 points, while net retention improved by 15 points. And these metrics now look quite strong compared to similar sized SaaS peers of all types. Naturally smaller companies have been drawn to Onshape because it's lightweight SaaS footprint enables agile hardware development processes.  But thanks to 17 more product releases during the past year, Onshape's maturing functionality also led to several significant orders in Q4 from larger companies and the robotics and medical device fields, who love the product for similar reasons. The amazing adoption that Onshape experienced in the education market in fiscal '21 is icing on the cake. It contributed little to the financials, but sets the stage for mass adoption by the next-generation workforce in future years.  Arena saw numerous expansions driving larger deal sizes too. Arena is also proving to be a great acquisition. Like Onshape, Arena is the cloud-native market leader in PLM, with particular strength in TechCentric markets such as electronics and medical devices. We're on track with the integration plan that we laid out for the acquisition of Arena, with new sales capacity coming online in the U.S. and Europe.  The combination of Onshape and Arena makes PTC the clear market leader in Cloud-native, PLM and CAD solutions. And these offerings make a great pairing for fast-moving high-tech manufacturers who want to develop hardware using the same agile process methodology as software. Next, Slide 10, shows our geographic ARR performance.  America was up 19% led by double-digit growth in core products and Arena. Europe was up 13% led by high single-digit in core products, low 40's growth in growth products, and double-digit growth in FSG. And APAC was up 17% led by mid-teens growth in core products and low 30's growth in growth products. There are thousands of people at PTC that contributed to our outstanding fiscal '21, and I'd like to say thank you to all of them. With that, I'll hand it over to Kristian to complete the portion of today's call focused on Q4 and fiscal '21.\nKristian Talvitie: Thanks, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our results, I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance later in the discussion, and all growth rate references will be in constant currency. So turning to Slide 12. We delivered ARR growth at the high end of our guidance range. Fiscal '21 ARR of $1.47 billion increased 16% year-over-year, excluding Arena, ARR growth was 12%.  FX was a small $4 million headwind in fiscal '21 for us. As Jim highlighted earlier, our bookings were very strong in Q4. With this, we had an uptick in -- within this, we had an uptick in ramp deals. And that's why our bookings performance did not result in even stronger ARR growth.  Instead, the vast majority of our bookings up went into deferred ARR that will benefit future periods, primarily fiscal '23 [Indiscernible] Organic churn improved approximately a 130 basis points year-over-year, slightly ahead of our guidance of approximately a 100 basis points of improvement, primarily driven by strong execution and CAD, PLM, FSG, as well as modest continued improvement in both IoT and AR. Fiscal '21 free cash flow of $344 million grew 61% year-over-year and was slightly above our guidance.  Note that our free cash flow for the year included an unforecasted $18 million outflow related to a foreign tax dispute, $15 million in acquisition-related fees, and $15 million in restructuring payments. These one-time headwinds were offset by other one-time tailwinds, including some one-time tax benefits, Arena working capital, versus original expectations. Improvements in AR aging also helped drive a one-time uptick in free cash flow in '21. Fiscal '21 revenue of $1.81 billion increased 24% year-over-year as reported, or 20% in constant currency, and was above guidance. As we've discussed previously, revenues impacted by ASC606. So in Q4 and throughout fiscal '21, longer than anticipated contract duration and support to subscription conversions positively impacted the amount of upfront subscription revenue recognized in the quarter and in the year. I'd like to remind you that over the long term, ARR and recurring revenue growth rates should be approximately the same.  However, in any period, revenue is subject to much more volatility due to ASC606, which is why we feel that our, our annual run rate, which is also very close proxy for subscription billings is the true in better indicator of PTC's growth in fiscal 21 non-GAAP operating margins were a 35% and increased approximately 610 basis points over fiscal 20. This was due to the strong revenue performance I just mentioned, as well as maintaining good discipline on our operating expense structure. Non-GAAP EPS of $3.97 increased 58% year-over-year and was above guidance.  I'd like to point out that our GAAP results reflect a gain of $69 million related to our investment in Matterport, which we mark-to-market. And as you may recall, Matterport went public and begin trading on July 23. In addition, our GAAP results also included the release of $137 million valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets and a tax benefit of $42 million related to the Arena acquisition.  Moving to the next slide, another way to think about PT's performance is using the cash flow model we often share. And as you can see here on Slide 13, ARR plus perpetual revenue, plus professional services revenue equals our cash generation, which was $1.455 billion is up about $200 million over fiscal '20.  You can also see the total expenses of $1.173 billion. This was up about $138 million over fiscal '20, which leads to a net cash contribution margin of $473 million with an increase of about $62 million. Or if you think about cash contribution margin as a proxy for cash EBITDA EBITDA, we delivered a 29% cash contribution margin.  And this was up about a 100 basis points compared to fiscal '20. In this format, you can see most of the one-time headwinds and tailwinds I discussed earlier are below the line. As in terms of cash tax headwinds and tailwind, M&A related expenses, improvements in aging, which actually resulted in net positive working capital in fiscal '21, which one would normally expect to be negative in a growing business.  Moving to Slide 14, I'll begin with our balance sheet. We ended with fiscal '21 with cash and cash equivalents of 320 million. In addition, we had medium-term investments of $78 million primarily related to our investment in Matterport. Our gross debt was $1.45 billion with an aggregate interest rate of about 3.2%. During Q4. Before we paid down 40 million on our revolving credit facility.  And we also made our $19 million semi-annual bond interest payment. With our leverage ratio now less than 3 times, which we told you as our goal. We resumed our share repurchase program, that $30 million of cash we used to repurchase shares in Q4 was approximately equal to our free cash flow generation in the quarter. All-in-all Q4 wrapped up a solid year for PTC from both an ARR and the free cash flow perspective. With that, I'll turn it back to Jim.\nJames Heppelmann: Thanks, Kristian. PTC is at an exciting point in our history. Despite bumpy macro conditions, we have established a 4-year track record of double-digit, top-line organic growth based on a recurring revenue model, and driven by widely recognized technology leadership positions in an industry increasingly motivated by digital transformation. In parallel, our decade long track record of strong operational discipline has driven our margins up.  Enabling us to benefit significantly from leverage as we scale. You see that in the 61% free cash flow growth, I highlighted at the start of the call. Given the strength of our financial performance in Fiscal 2021, the restructuring we announced today might come as a surprise to some of you.  But sit tight because I think you will like what we're doing. For some time now, I've been telling investors about our plans to leverage the Atlas platform that we acquired with Onshape to pivot the whole Company toward a SaaS future. As I had previously discussed it, much of the upside benefits of the SaaS pivot would come in fiscal 2024 and beyond. Many of you have asked why we wouldn\u2019t invest more to get to that SaaS upside more quickly.  Frankly, that was a good question and one that we've thought long and hard about. We even hired Mckinsey that help us think through it and develop a strategy. Today, I will explain how, thanks to the changes we're making. We will invest substantially more in our SaaS initiatives while actually decreasing our overall run-rate spending projections significantly.  Let me hit the financial summary first on slide 16 and then explain the strategy and operational changes behind it. In terms of the financial view or the restructuring, we're reducing our spending run rate by approximately 60 million compared to fiscal 2021 as we improve the efficiency of our organizational structure. We've also eliminated about 30 million of previously contemplated new spending run rate from our fiscal '22 plans.  So compared to the plan for fiscal '22 that existed prior to the restructuring, we now have -- we now expect to reduce our planned fiscal '22 run-rate spending by approximately $9 million and then reinvest about half of that into initiatives that accelerate our transition to SaaS with the other half falling to the bottom line. Key SaaS investments will be used to increase capacity on the Atlas, to accelerate work to adopt Atlas into our core products and to operate those products as SaaS and into Onshape than Arena product development and sales capacity.  Despite what will be a very significant investment, we expect to expand cash margins by approximately 400 basis points in FY22.So we are accelerating both growth and margin expansion at the same time. Restructuring related cash outflows are expected to be approximately $50 million to $55 million with about 2/3 occurring in the first half of '22, and the majority of the remaining payments to be made in Q3.  In other words, the restructuring will obscure the great cash flow progress for the next 2 or 3 quarters, but the benefits will start shining through after that. Already by Q4 of fiscal '22, we should be seeing a net free cash flow tailwind as a consequence of the restructuring. Then as Kristian will outline, fiscal '23 and beyond will look great. Let's go to slide 17 and I will start by explaining why a SaaS pivot is so interesting to PTC.  There are three reasons why we think now is the time for PTC to align with and invest more in the SaaS transition. First the industrial software market wants to go to SaaS. COVID has greatly amplified the interest in SaaS. PTC is already the recognized SaaS leader in our industry.  Onshape and Arena have proven what's possible and they've dramatically elevated PTC's credibility. We are far ahead of competitors in terms of understanding what SaaS is and what it is not. Customers are looking for PTC to lead the whole industry through a transition to SaaS. We see the need to accelerate SaaS initiatives while better aligning with SaaS best practices in order to meet the needs of the market.  The investments we're making now will allow us to play offense to capture the market demand. Third, we believe our new SaaS strategy will accelerate a major growth driver for PTC. Giving us more pathways to mid-teens growth in the mid-term, and helping to de -risk our growth ambitions.  Meanwhile, cost savings from the restructuring itself are expected to de -risk our free cash flow growth targets even if the growth should prove slower to materialize than I expect. Turning to Slide 18, owning the industry's only cloud-native CAD and PLM combo has been a big advantage.  By comparing our Onshape and Arena businesses work as compared to the balance of BDC. We can see that certain ways in which PTC has been organized are quite inefficient. At the same time, we see an opportunity to serve customers better too, and that's why we're choosing to evolve our organization to be more SaaS-like. I'd like to review several of the larger changes.  Previously in addition to working with sales, our customers would have more than a half dozen touch points across our broad customer success organization, including renewal sales, pre sales, post-sales consulting, customer success management, technical support, our cloud organization, a group called customer experience and others. In comparison, most SaaS companies have a 2 in the box model where each customer has just 1 sales and 1 customer success contact.  Not only is PTC's current model inefficient, perhaps more importantly, customers hate being repeatedly passed from one contact to another as they proceed through their journey with PTC. So we are re-configuring to deploy the same tool box model, the SaaS companies utilize. This reconfiguration has no impact on the sales side of the equation. In fact, the sales side of the equation -- in fact, we're adding direct quota carrying capacity into the current model.  Aside from where we expand coverage, the vast majority of customers will retain the same sales contacts they know and love today. The bigger change for the customer will be that they now have one customer success contact rather than many. There's nothing but goodness here for everybody.  Customers prefer this model and it will save PTC a lot of money as it is much more scalable. The other major changes on the product development, delivery and support side. With Onshape and Arena or any true SaaS Company. This is all done by a single organization using modern DevOps practices.  But within the core PTC product lines the development, cloud delivery, and technical support organizations have been entirely separate. With the latter two belonging to the field organization. You simply can't get to SaaS that way. As part of our reorganization, we have merged our cloud delivery and technical support groups into the product organization to mirror the modern SaaS practices deployed by Onshape and Arena and everybody else in the SaaS world.  This too will create significant operating efficiencies and a much improved customer experience at the same time. Nothing but goodness here to. To better understand the demand drivers, let's take a look at an illustrative value proposition on slide 19, typical of what customers see in the transition from on-premise to SaaS.  For every dollar a customer pays PTC or any other vendor for on - prem PLM, they have an estimated additional $2 to $3 and cost of ownership associated with on-premise servers and store agent system administrators plus SI who help with on-site installations and upgrades and all that. Their total cost of ownership can be $3 to $4.  When the deployment, maintenance, and delivery responsibility for the software is shifted back to PTC, we can leverage significant efficiencies to serve that same functionality back to the customer for roughly an incremental dollar at margins that are attractive to us. Therefore, each dollar of on-premise software ARR today represents potentially $2 of future SaaS, ARR for PTC plus a savings of a dollar or 2 for the customer.  The customer also gets to enjoy the many other benefits of SaaS. It is device-agnostic. It's ideal for a hybrid work environment. Data is shared with employees and suppliers in real-time. Plus no more upgrades to do as everyone is always on the latest version. This value proposition for SaaS is not really new news to any of you, it's what Marc Benioff at salesforce.com has been espousing for 2 decades now.  More than half of the overall commercial software industry has already made this pivot. But that's not yet the case in our world of industrial software, where SaaS has low single-digit penetration. As Salesforce did in CRM, some Company will have to lead the way to SaaS and the CAD and PLM industry. We think the time is right for industrial companies to move to SaaS and PTC is best positioned to lead that transition.  Turning to Slide 20, we've been delivering more and more new PLM projects as SaaS in recent years, as customer preference has shifted there. But going forward, we will make SaaS our primary delivery model and deliver on-premise only when required by the customer. But we also have a large existing customer base with on-premise systems. In order for existing customers to get the SaaS, each customer has to go through a lift and shift process.  This process entails lifting the on-premise deployment, upgrading, and decustomizing it as necessary to eliminate technical debt, and then shifting it into the PTC Cloud from where we can serve it back to the customer as a service. We plan to focus the lift and shift program first on Windchill, where the biggest opportunity lies and bring Creo and other products into the fold in subsequent phases over time.  So you may be wondering, will, how will this. Helped to accelerate growth? The answer is that our organizational changes, and the associated wave of investment, enable us to scale up to make SaaS the default for new sales, and start to lift and shift process now, here in fiscal22, though the value proposition for transitioning to SaaS 's sound, we still have to go through a sales cycle of each customer.  Returning the sales teams lose now with this proposition, and we expect the first projects to begin showing up in the back half of fiscal 22, The Windchill SaaS capability will be deployed into Azure and into the manufacturing Cloud at that. So Microsoft is eager to help us sell this proposition. I'd like to think of this project as the last upgrade for each customer.  Because when the lift and shift projects done then PTC will take it forward from there. Therefore, a good time to sell this program is whenever customers start planning their next upgrade. Customers tend to upgrade Windchill systems, once every 2 or 3 years, so we get a shot at a good portion of the base each year and expect success to accelerate in fiscal 23 and beyond.  There are thousands of Windchill deployments out there, so I anticipate this process will take numerous years, perhaps a decade, and we won't get them all. Naturally we'll focus first on the most ready customers and work on the long tail further out. In the end, I expect we will ultimately get about 75% of the customers to transition and we'll continue to offer on-premise variance of the product. Born of the same code-stream on an indefinite basis for those who do not want SaaS. PTC is all-in on SaaS. The program we're launching is a major cross-functional effort on par with the highly successful program.  We executed the move from perpetual to where we are today with 98% of our software revenue now being subscription. Like that subscription program, the SaaS transition program involves numerous changes to our offerings, to our pricing and packaging, to compensation, and more. We have the same program leader driving it.  An important difference though, is that the SaaS transition program is all about growth acceleration within the recurring software business model, we currently have in place. Which means we will not have the same, same so-called valley of depth effect that our cash flow went back, that went through back then? Now we'll have all of the gain, but none of that pain.  Taking you deeper into the elements of this program will be a key agenda topic at our December Investor Day. One last related change we're making is to organize into two main business units as shown on Slide 21. With plans to leverage SaaS now in place and underway across the entire Company, it no longer makes sense to have a SaaS business unit per say.  Therefore, we plan to reunite Vuforia AR with the CAD PLM and IoT product lines into a business unit designed to promote higher levels across selling, across this integrated product portfolio. This new business unit, which focuses on the digital transformation driver, will be all about growing the base and leading them to SaaS.  It will be called the Digital Thread Business Unit to reflect the highly integrated nature of its portfolio of products. Troy Richardson has been our Chief Operating Officer for the past year, is being promoted to become a president of this business unit. Troy has already been managing them, go-to-market side of these businesses. But now the product developments are more important to him as well to drive tight alignment.  Naturally, I'll stay involved in the technology road map because as you probably know, that's where my passion lies. You'll get more time with Troy Richardson at the upcoming Investor Day. Onshape and Arena will remain together under their current President, Mike DiTullio.6 This will be called the velocity business unit, to reflect that the Cloud-native pure SaaS value proposition of Onshape and Arena is most attractive to companies who want to deploy agile product development processes and move fast.  This business unit is all about disrupting the competition and landing new logos, which in many cases are SMB customers. But we are seeing larger companies being drawn to Onshape and Arena solutions still because their existing vendor simply doesn't have anything that compares.  Companies like Gear Motion, for example, the $4 billion automotive turbocharger Company we've profiled at our fiscal 2020 Investor Day last year, who switched to Onshape from a high-end CAD competitor to gain increased business velocity. You'll have more time with Mike DiTullio too at the Investor Day. [Indiscernible] business unit\u2019s presidents report to me. I help drive their respective strategies while Troy and Mike preside over the operating cadence of each business unit.  A related change is that the Atlas platform will move under our very capable CTO, Steve Dertein, who will develop the shared platform to meet the needs of both units. Steve will continue to report to me. I know that was a lot of information to take in. Turning to Slide 22. Let me summarize and then I'll hand it back to Kristian for more specific go-forward guidance.  First from a top-line perspective, our SaaS acceleration pivot unlocks another powerful multiyear growth catalyst for PTC and our shareholders. Exiting fiscal '21 Creo and Windchill together represent more than $1 billion of ARR growing double-digits organically.  This growth pattern has been in place for 4 years now, right through the pandemic, with the strong performance driven by the role both products play in the digital transformation strategies of industrial companies. With the SaaS program that we're launching, we're layering an additional growth driver into this core business that we expect could last a decade.  Therefore, in our core business, we see double-digit ARR growth being sustainable well into the future. Together with the growth drivers in IoT and AR, plus Onshape and Arena, we're creating more pathways to drive ARR growth to the mid-teens. In my deal, PTC's growth story's alive and well. Second from a bottom-line perspective, the strategic improvements we're making will drive up our cash contribution margins considerably and help de -risk our cash flow targets under a broader range of ARR growth scenarios.  Kristian will expand on this. Given our confidence in growth coupled with the higher margins, we remain committed to the midterm free cash flow targets that we set at our Investor Day last year. Recall that our guidance was for mid-term free cash flow growth of approximately 25% to 30%. After we get beyond the restructuring payments, we expect to perform in that range. Perhaps earlier than you might have expected.  Our guidance for fiscal 22 assumes we'll get a small positive impact from the SaaS transition in the back half of the fiscal year, which is counterbalanced by slower assumed growth rates in FSG, and somewhat conservative assumptions we have around Rockwell has contribution as they work their way through the Plex integrate.  Let me be clear that our commitment to the partnership with Rockwell remains as strong as ever, and that we are energized to work together because of the great potential we see ahead. In particular, we see tremendous potential for the DPM offering sold through Rockwell and their Calypso consulting app. Kristian, back over to you.\nKristian Talvitie: Thanks, James. I'll now take you through our financial guidance and go-forward reporting structure. Turning to Slide 24. First, let me reiterate how exciting a time this is for PTC. The restructuring that we're going through right now is really the single biggest somatic investment PTC has made that I can remember.  This reorganization is designed to better align PTC to our SaaS future, and as an interesting consequence it should also derisk our path towards delivering on the midterm ARR and cash flow growth targets we discussed at our Investor Day last November.  Starting with guidance on slide 24, we continue to target mid-teens ARR growth in the mid-term. Jim did a good job of outlining the many pathways we have to get into these targets with the SaaS opportunity in both the velocity and core businesses. With the addition of solutions to the portfolio starting with DPM, coupled with the general strength of the existing portfolio. More specifically, for fiscal22, we expect ARR of 1.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, please standby. Today's conference will resume momentarily. Thank you for your patience, your lines will once again be placed on music hold until we resume the call. All right. We are back.\nJames Heppelmann: This is James Heppelmann, I think we apparently got dropped from the call, which is a brand new experience for us, but I understand this happened just as Kristian was starting out with our FY 2022 guidance. So Kristian, can you pick it up again from the beginning of the FY 2022 guidance discussion.\nKristian Talvitie: Great. Thanks, Jim. So back to the financial guidance and go-forward reporting structure. First, let me reiterate how exciting time this is for PTC. The restructuring we're going through right now is really the single biggest somatic investment PTC has made that I can remember. This reorganization is designed to better align PTC to our SaaS future.  And as an interesting consequence, it should also de -risk our path to delivering on the mid-term ARR and cash flow growth targets we discussed at our Investor Day last November. So starting with guidance on Slide 24, we continue to target getting to mid-teens ARR growth in the mid-term.  Jim did a good job outlining many of the pathways we have to getting to these targets with the SaaS opportunity in both the velocity and core businesses with the addition of solutions to the portfolio starting with DPM, coupled with the general strength of the existing portfolio.  More specifically, for fiscal '22, we expect ARR of 1.615 billion to 1.66 billion. That's a growth rate of 10 to 13% on a constant currency basis. Following four consecutive years of double-digit ARR growth. It's also worth mentioning that we expect continued churn improvement in fiscal 22 and are targeting another 100 basis points improvement.  From a linearity perspective, we would again expect flattish ARR growth throughout the year on a constant currency basis. So using the midpoint of guidance that would imply about 11.5% ARR growth each quarter. Obviously this can fluctuate given bookings, performance, start dates, et cetera. But we believe we provided for that within the range outlined.  The one thing worth pointing out is that ARR growth in Q1 of '22 are expected to be approximately 15% since Q1 '21 did not include ARR for Arena. In order to help with the modeling, we've provided historical constant currency performance in the data tables, on the website and I'll touch more on this in a little bit. Turning to cash flow, we also continue to target approximately 25 to 30% annual free cash flow growth over the mid-term.  For fiscal '22 specifically, we're guiding for free cash flow of approximately $400 million. As a consequence of the restructuring, we're expecting cash outflows of approximately $50 million to $55 million with approximately 2/3 occurring in the first half and the majority of the remaining payments to be made in Q3.  Excluding restructuring, our expected free cash flow in fiscal '22 would be approximately $450 million, representing 25% growth compared to the $359 million we generated in fiscal '21 on the same basis. Doing some directional math and using round numbers on the mid-term targets, this means we would expect free cash flow in the $550 million to $600 million range in fiscal '23 and would expect $700 million to $750 million of free cash flow in fiscal '24.  Regarding the linearity of free cash flow in fiscal 22, excluding restructuring, we expect to see a similar pattern as in fiscal 21 with more than 60% of free cash flow generation in the first half of the year. Collections are stronger in the first half and we expect expenses to increase as we. And hiring and our SaaS investments throughout the year.  As Jim discussed, the restructuring not only creates strategic improvements in how we're organized, but also enhances our profitability profile. So we believe we'll be able to deliver strong free cash flow growth even if we don't accelerate the ARR. Come back to this point on the next slide.  And finally turning to revenue guidance on for fiscal '22 we're expecting revenue of $1.85 billion to $1.98 billion, which corresponds to a growth rate of 2% to 9% on an as-reported basis or 4% to 11% on a constant currency basis. ASC606 makes revenue fairly difficult to predict in the short term for on-premise subscription companies, hence the wide range.  Note that revenue has no impact on ARR or free cash flow as we continue to primarily bill customers annually upfront. And again, over the longer term, we expect recurring revenue growth to align with ARR growth, particularly as we transition the Company to SaaS and evolve towards increasingly ratable revenue recognition.  So moving onto Slide 25 using the same free cash flow model we showed earlier, this slide illustrates a directional view of what fiscal '22 could look like, assuming the approximate midpoint of our ARR guidance range. ARR here grows at approximately 11.5%. Cash generation is up $170 million.  We see continued growth and expenses but given the new operating model, as Jim pointed out earlier, our cash contribution margin expands almost 400 basis points. Said differently, the new operating model is expected to add more than a $120 million of cash contribution margin versus the 60 plus we add as last year on similar slightly less ARR growth.  On the expense front, as Jim mentioned, we're reducing spending in certain areas to fund investments to accelerate our SaaS transition. Additionally, there are some other items that will impact OpEx this year such as the accounting for commissions which is impacted by ASC606, increased travel merit, and so on.  So as far as the P&L is concerned, the net result is that we are guiding for fiscal 22 non-GAAP operating expense to grow by approximately 3% at the midpoint of guidance, which is certainly lower than the 50% of our targeted ARR growth for the year, even though we're significantly increasing our SaaS related spending.  On an organic basis, factoring in the Arena acquisition, which closed in Q2 of fiscal 21, we actually expect non-GAAP OpEx growth to be closer to 2% at the midpoint of our range. We also have a modest. $5 million uptick in CapEx this year. Hawaii cash taxes remained approximately flat and we see some expansion in the other category which is really the restructuring charge and change in working capital as the business grows.  Moving to Slide 26, as you know, we currently present our ARR and revenue in three product categories, core, FSG, and growth. Going forward, as Jim explained, we'll have 2 business units, digital thread and velocity, so to align our reporting with how we look at the business, we'll be changing our ARR and revenue reporting buckets accordingly.  Digital thread will consist of core FSG and also IoT and ARR from the current growth products. And when we report Digital Thread going forward we'll provide forward -- we'll provide the detailed split one level below. On the slide, the categories in bold taxed on the left represent our current disclosure, the categories on the right in bold green text represent our go-forward disclosure. And velocity will consist of Onshape and Arena from the current growth products.  Slide 27 shows what the recast ARR data looks like. I won't spend a lot of time on this as we publish 3 years of historical ARR and revenue data in our new format within the financial data tables file on the IR website. There are a couple of points I would make. First, please note that all of the historical constant-currency ARR figures have been calculated using our fiscal '22 plan FX rates.  Second, in addition to the digital thread and velocity recast, we did We did a small recast of a portion of our view for ARR business, which removes approximately $6 million of ARR in both fiscal 21 and fiscal '20 and $5 million in fiscal '19. We made this change because we've come to realize there are certain buyers with marketing oriented use cases who purchased Vuforia engine for short-term promotions without a true intention to use it on a recurring basis.  The bulk of the Vuforia Suite is unaffected and will continue to be sold on a recurring basis. We adjusted the historical amounts to enable go-forward comparability. And then lastly, just in terms of expectations for fiscal 22, starting with the digital thread core, we are targeting fiscal 22 ARR growth of 10% to 12%.  This is consistent with our historical performance for digital thread growth. We are targeting fiscal 22 ARR growth accelerating back into the 20% plus range. For digital thread FSG, we target fiscal 22 ARR growth of approximately flattish, again, consistent with historical performance and expectations. So in total for digital thread, we're targeting ARR growth of 10% to 12%.  For velocity, we're targeting fiscal 22 ARR growth in the 20 plus percent range given the strength of both Arena and Onshape. Moving on to Slide 28 and to provide some additional context, the highlight of our guidance assumptions. They're all listed in our press release and I've covered a few of them already, so I won't cover them all here. One point worth calling out is that we target to return approximately 50% of our cash flow to shareholders through share repurchases. In fiscal '22 we will also focus on delivering. Therefore, assuming $450 million of free cash flow, excluding restructuring, we would expect our buybacks to be about 25% of that amount with the rest going to delivering.  So wrapping up, we had strong financial performance in fiscal '21, delivered on 4 quarters of meeting our ARR and free cash flow guidance, and this was our fourth consecutive year of double-digit ARR growth, while maintaining discipline on the expense structure. And most importantly, of course, we believe we're well-positioned to deliver on the midterm targets we provided at our Investor Day last November. We're unlocking a significant multiyear catalyst by accelerating our SaaS transition.  And we're also optimizing how we go-to-market with our digital thread and velocity business units. I'm encouraged by how PTC continues to rapidly evolve to meet the needs of our customers. Moving on to Slide 29, we look forward to discussing today's news during the Q&A session and follow-up calls. Also, we will host an investor meeting on December 15th to further discuss our strategy and targets. Please save that date on your calendars. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator to begin Q&A.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for your questions. We do ask that you please limit yourself to 1 question only. Your first question comes from Gal Munda of Berenberg.\nGal Munda: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. The first 1 is just I'd like to understand a little bit around the dynamics around the ARR guide for next year. If you can help us unpack. The guidance is a little bit wider than we have this year to 13%. What you're thinking behind, and what gets you to the higher end of the range versus the lower end of the range? Yeah.\nOperator: Everyone, please standby. One moment. Please standby the conference will resume momentarily. Once again, please standby on the conference will resume momentarily. We will return to music hold until the call cameras are on. Thank you for your patience.\nJames Heppelmann: Thanks. It will still be step-by-step? Yeah. However, it will start sooner and the phases will be dramatically compressed, thanks to $45 million in new spending, which is a lot of new spending.\nGal Munda: Thanks James. Thanks a lot.\nJames Heppelmann: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Matthew Broome of Mizuho Securities.\nJames Heppelmann: Hey Matt.\nMatthew Broome: Hey guys. Just in terms of you mentioned that the $60 million of savings, now you're expecting to free up us as FY 2021. You did talk about saving money in your sales organization. But there are other areas where you are planning to spend less and any of those areas and revenue generating activities, just trying to get a better understanding of where that $60 million is coming from.\nOperator: Apologies, everyone. Please standby. Once again, we will be on music hold until the conference can resume. Thank you so much for your patience. We are back and your back on with Matthew Broome.\nMatt Shimao: Matt great to be on with you. Can you please re-ask your question? Thank you.\nJames Heppelmann: Maybe we should go to the next question.\nOperator: Okay. The next question comes from Ken Wong of Guggenheim Security Partners.\nKen Wong: Thanks for taking my questions and to make you feel better, supposedly HubSpot ran into some issues at the beginning as well. So not to this [Indiscernible].\nMatt Shimao: Thanks. But no, it doesn't make us feel better.\nKen Wong: I feel like someone in the [Indiscernible] that people forgot to make their picks for the question is now falling on me, this is great. So lots of moving pieces here. I just wanted to touch on -- as far as the Cloud transition as you guys are changing tires while the car is still in motion, should we think about the near-term guidance, the outlook as maybe being a little more conservative?  And then as you look longer-term, you start to feel more confident because like you said, there are more, I guess there's more optionality. Is that the right way to think about how you're approaching the next few years? Or if I'm wrong there, please let me know if you guys have a different approach in terms of how we should be thinking about the numbers that you guys laid out.\nKristian Talvitie: Yeah. I mean, I think to a degree, right? For sure. I mean, setting aside and macro and the fact that we don't have a crystal ball there and everything like that. We're launching a major SaaS initiative, but don't have in our guide big assumptions it will hit this year. I think it will hit next year and hit even harder in the years that follow. But we haven't planned a lot into this year.  Partly because, again, we need to get this earnings call out there, we need to launch everything, we need to start the sales cycles, and then we need to close the orders. And if you put 6 to 9 month sales cycles on things and we're not exactly sure how long it will take, but 6 to 9 months lands you in Q3 or Q4 already. And so we're just not sure. Then when the start dates might be and all that type of stuff.  So we're fairly conservative about the cloud impact to fiscal '22, but quite bullish about it to fiscal '23, '24, '25, and beyond. The other thing is as we've said, we're a little bit conservative, more so than in past years as it relates to Rockwell. It could be wrong there, but we're just saying, let's not get ahead of ourselves in case they get distracted with this integration Plex. I don't think Rockwell thinks they'll get distracted, but again, we're just trying not to get out over [Indiscernible].\nMatthew Broome: And as far as all the sales motion that are going to change the 2 in the box, I guess have you had efficiently factored in potential disruption to this year as you guys worked through that or is it kind of these motions or just kind of typical PTC and you guys feel you can pivot on the fly here.\nJames Heppelmann: Yeah well, what's happening on the sales side of the two in the box is pretty typical stuff that happens every year and which is to say not that extreme. A few more resources here and shifting a little bit what are overlays and not overlays, things like that. That's pretty typical. And I don't see any unusual degree of risk there whatsoever. What's happening on the other side is a little bit more dramatic, but frankly, most of that is what happens after the customer buys from us.  And I actually think it's all good changes anyway. So I don't see that disrupting sales, I see it actually making customers happy because they stop getting passed around from one person to another and having to re-explain who they are and all that kind of stuff. So I don't know. I don't think it's a high-risk change. Certainly, I don't see it that way. And we're eager to go execute it.\nKen Wong: Got it. Great. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Matthew Broome of Mizuho Securities.\nJames Heppelmann: Okay Matt, sorry, we didn't get to you last time around. We're going to try to disconnect halfway through your questions.\nMatthew Broome: Nowhere to tell. My question was just about the $50 million in relative savings of FY21. You did mention saving money in your sales organization, but in what other areas that you're spending less to free that money out? And is that likely to affect any sort of revenue generating activities?\nJames Heppelmann: Yeah, no. Again I want to be clear it's not in sales. It's really in customer success, where we used to have many organizations that took turns talking to customer. They all had management change. They all had overlapping responsibilities, etc. So the place we've taken the most money out of would be in customer success.  The stuff that happens after the customer buys. And we're doing that not by just reducing capability, but by simply implementing a much more efficient model with many less silos, much less management involved, and so forth. So that's all, goodness. There are other places we'll have efficiencies. Let me give you an example. If you belong to a field organization working technical support, your mission is to make the customer happy even if it means solving the same problem dozens or hundreds of times quickly.  If you're part of the product organization, your goal is to go back and talk to the product guys and tell them, make this product go away in the SaaS offering quickly, so that no other customers are even aware that it ever did exist. You can see those real efficiencies in terms of how you solve customer problems.  Are you trying to make them happy while they have the problem? And repeat that hundreds of thousands of times or are you trying to make the problem go away so that the rest of the customers never knew it happened? Just to summarize. These are great efficiencies that we're going to go pursue.\nMatthew Broome: Now that makes a lot of sense. If I could also just ask just given the [Indiscernible] how the unfavorable change in relationships with the channel and does it change that rolling in anyway?\nKristian Talvitie: Yeah, I think if you look at the different classes of partners, it affects them differently. Let's start with Microsoft elated about this as you might expect, because it will bring a lot of business their way.  If you look at Rockwell, Rockwell too is leaning into SaaS, and frankly, all of our SaaS products are easier for Rockwell to digest and to deliver onto their customers then would be the on-premise variance. So I think Rockwell quite likes the strategy and maybe some of their own thinking about SaaS was born in our boardroom i don't know. You'd have to ask Blake that, but I might speculate.\nJames Heppelmann: And then I think if you look at our resellers, it'll change their world a little bit, they still need to go sell the software. They won't be as evolved in delivering it, but then they are very much involved in the implementation of it at the customer side. So I don't want you to think as it relates to resellers or SIs that SaaS companies don't have SI partners.  My God, Salesforce has a massive SI ecosystem. They just don't install software and perform upgrades at the customer site. They do system integration, they do adoption, and they do business process transformation. They do all that stuff which still has to happen. So that's kind of long term.  I think SIs have to take the posture they have relative to Salesforce and all those other SaaS companies, which will help them through and the bigger ones like Accenture already know that play. And then for the smaller resellers, the other thing worth noting is that most of our resellers sell Creo and Kepler. And those products are further out on the SaaS road map anyway, so that will be several years down the road before we even really come to that bridge.\nMatthew Broome: Right. Thanks, Jim.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jason Celino at KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nJames Heppelmann: Hi Jason.\nKristian Talvitie: Hi Jason.\nJason Celino: Hi guys. Thanks for fitting me in. A little deja vu here with the transition, but maybe sell the subscription transition on the pricing change. With that transition will be a deployment change. When we think about the Cloud opportunity for PLM, when we think about the sources of possible acceleration, will it be more of a share gain type story or a pricing uplift from the lift and shift?\nJames Heppelmann: Yes. I think it will be both, but let me first redefine pricing up lift so we don't confuse anybody. We will deliver more value to the customer and they will pay us more for that value while saving money on their side, above and beyond. So is that a pricing increase? I don't know. It's a value increase. And that could drive a tremendous amount of business.  Creo and Windchill are a billion-dollars and you could double $750 million of that over a decade with that $750 million of more value delivered to the customer base and monetize. However, what we're seeing with Arena and to a degree with Windchill is we have the cloudiest sassiest solutions in the market and that does help take share.  Every piece of business that Arena is winning. They're taken from somebody else or it's a start-up Company that they're winning on somebody else's expense. And Arena is a fastest growing P1 solution in the market right now. So I do think it's both, and you know exactly what the balance would be, I don't know. I do think monetizing the customer base by delivering more value is a high probability and it will drive a lot of growth by itself.\nJason Celino: Excellent. Thank you.\nJames Heppelmann: Welcome.\nOperator: The next question comes from Joe Vruwink of Baird.\nJames Heppelmann: Hey Joe.\nKristian Talvitie: Hi. Great. Hi everyone. Just focus on new Digital Thread Business Unit. It maybe seems like there is rising interest in both platform deals. I just think about the way Rockwell expanded, the scope of the partnership so with more products or even both. I think when they were talking about the big CAD PLM deal, they spoke about this better pairing with existing IoT they have set up in their clients.  So I'm just wondering, A, am I characterizing the demand environment correctly and then B, does the new business unit actually allow you to maybe better execute time cross-sold, done house than the case?\nJames Heppelmann: Yeah well, let me hit the second question first. The new business unit is fundamentally formed to help us better execute on cross sells, because we do see that platform deal structure happening more and more. The example you gave with Global, I could repeat a dozen more examples of that, of customers who started with 1 product and pretty soon they have 2 and then 3 and they're trying off the fourth one and so forth. And we think that our products Creo, Windchill ThingWorx, Vuforia work beautifully together.  Like voices in a choir, they make beautiful music together. And rather than selling these things separately, yes, we can use them all as entry points, but let's pursue entry points that then can be up-sold and cross-sold, And so, I think Troy Richardson was one of the first people to ask, why don't you guys configure differently -- us guys now that he's here, but why don't we configured differently and go pursue this harder, this cross-sell motion, so that's exactly what we're doing is that's a little bit how the name digital thread came to be.\nJoe Vruwink: Great thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tyler Radke of Citi.\nJames Heppelmann: Hey, Taylor.\nTyler Radke: Hey, good evening. I wanted to ask you a little bit more about the TLM SaaS transition. It sounds like that's starting now, so assume that in some ways that products already obviously, it's probably going to get better over time. But how are you thinking about pricing as a lever to push customers towards that? Whether it'd be price increases on the on-time side or maybe initial discounts to get early customers over to the SaaS offering.\nJames Heppelmann: Yes. Well, let me comment on the first part of your question and then the second part. So again, we've been on boarding customers' SaaS for a while with PLM. And think of it that they're coming in at one margin and what our goal is to make improvements behind the scenes that take them to another margin even at the same cost to the customer. So whether it's single-tenant, multi-tenant, if you're the customer on the customer end, you don't even know.  But we on the PTC end, we see the efficiencies we're gaining or not gaining, we do know. And so a lot of our investment is aimed at making the product more efficient for PTC to deliver, as opposed to different from the usage end at the customer side. Now that said, if you look what we did with the subscription program, we pulled every lever we could come up with. Do you remember that program when we used to talk about it, we used to say, and I don't know Kristian.  Kristian actually was the program executive. We had 28 work-streams and 300 people working on it. We changed pricing and packaging to favor subscription over at the time perpetual. We paid more commission on a perpetual deal. We had certain offerings they were only -- I'm sorry we paid more commission I said that wrong on a subscription deal.  We had certain offerings that were only available, attractive sexy offerings including the answer stuff by the way, there was only available subscription. So we basically stack the deck in every customer conversation in a way that everybody wanted it to go subscription. We got the band back together, we're putting the same program together, and we\u2019ll stack the deck again in favor of SaaS this time.\nTyler Radke: Thank you.\nOperator: Your Next question comes from Adam Borg of Stifel.\nJames Heppelmann: Hello, Adam.\nAdam Borg: Thanks so much for taking the question. Just real quickly on IoT, I think you mentioned during the prepared remarks that it was slightly below our expectations in the quarter. So maybe to talk a little bit more about what led to that. And the confidence you have in that improving in fiscal '22, maybe even in the context of DPM. Thanks so much.\nJames Heppelmann: Yes. So first Adam, let's be clear. Exactly what I said. Bookings in the quarter were very strong. However, much of the bookings in a Q4 does not land in the ARR in the Q4, it's back to that start base discussion. What I said is that ARR was less than we wanted it to be. It was mid-teens and frankly, we've said we wanted to have a 2 handle. Now, bookings in every quarter of fiscal '21 were higher than the previous year quarter in fiscal '20.  So there is some bookings momentum happening. And then another thing is we launched this DPM solution that frankly we've been working for 2 years. It's a major piece of software that we launched in, already has quite some customer interest. So we feel like the combination of the bookings momentum we have including and especially in Q4 and then the launch of DPM and the trends we're seeing. They bode well for what should happen next year.\nAdam Borg: Great, thanks so much.\nJames Heppelmann: Hi, Operator. I think we have time for maybe one more question.\nOperator: Certainly. Your final question comes from Blair Abernethy of Rosenblatt Securities.\nJames Heppelmann: Hey, Blair.\nKristian Talvitie: Hey, Blair.\nBlair Abernethy: Hey guys. Thanks for taking the time. Just two quick things. First on the DPM, Jim, what's sort of the -- is there a shift in the go-to-market with this solution of R and are their more solutions coming this year, next year in behind us.\nJames Heppelmann: Yeah, I think what she should I think first of all, is it DPM, will become a category of solutions. And what we're launching first is DPM for factory. Digital performance management of what happens in a factory. There will be solutions that are more focused on digital performance management of a fleet of products out in the field at customer sites.  But fundamentally what we are trying to do is move from selling a toolkit where the customer does the solutioning themselves to selling a turnkey solution with a very strong value proposition, sold to executives not to developers, sold on the basis of the business value it will generate, and then implemented quickly in the production.  So yeah, it's a very different sales motion. I mean, number one, we're selling to executives not selling to developers. Number 2, we're selling business value, not speeds and feeds, technical stuff. And I think it's really where we wanted to take this business for a while. So I'm very pleased with the solution.  It took us a while to develop it, as I said, but it's a powerful piece of software and it really gives us a new platform to build on going forward with IoT. It makes IoT f I could, a lot like how we sell PLM. We sell PLM to executives based on business value. We were selling IoT to developers as a toolkit, and now we'll sell PLM and DPM as business value to executives. Different executives mind you but executives. Great. Thank you. Well, Operator maybe I'll just take it from here. First again my apologies. This is like the strangest earnings call I've had again, and it's the 44th one as CEO. So it's a bit odd, but nonetheless, I think we got a lot of good information out there and you guys had some great questions and I appreciate it. So in closing, I mean, we're in a great place. I really like PTC setup going forward.  The changes we announced are good for growth, they're good for profitability. They're going to put us in a stronger position to hit both the top-line and bottom-line targets that we have out there. So we're looking forward to continuing a discussion with you on follow-up calls at investor conferences.  I'm going to be at the Berenberg Conference, at least virtually next week or I guess it's 2 weeks out maybe, it\u2019s No, it's next week. And we look forward to seeing you at our investor meeting on December 15th. So thanks, everybody, and have a good evening.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kristian Talvitie",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our results, I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance later in the discussion, and all growth rate references will be in constant currency. So turning to Slide 12. We delivered ARR growth at the high end of our guidance range. Fiscal '21 ARR of $1.47 billion increased 16% year-over-year, excluding Arena, ARR growth was 12%.  FX was a small $4 million headwind in fiscal '21 for us. As Jim highlighted earlier, our bookings were very strong in Q4. With this, we had an uptick in -- within this, we had an uptick in ramp deals. And that's why our bookings performance did not result in even stronger ARR growth.  Instead, the vast majority of our bookings up went into deferred ARR that will benefit future periods, primarily fiscal '23 [Indiscernible] Organic churn improved approximately a 130 basis points year-over-year, slightly ahead of our guidance of approximately a 100 basis points of improvement, primarily driven by strong execution and CAD, PLM, FSG, as well as modest continued improvement in both IoT and AR. Fiscal '21 free cash flow of $344 million grew 61% year-over-year and was slightly above our guidance.  Note that our free cash flow for the year included an unforecasted $18 million outflow related to a foreign tax dispute, $15 million in acquisition-related fees, and $15 million in restructuring payments. These one-time headwinds were offset by other one-time tailwinds, including some one-time tax benefits, Arena working capital, versus original expectations. Improvements in AR aging also helped drive a one-time uptick in free cash flow in '21. Fiscal '21 revenue of $1.81 billion increased 24% year-over-year as reported, or 20% in constant currency, and was above guidance. As we've discussed previously, revenues impacted by ASC606. So in Q4 and throughout fiscal '21, longer than anticipated contract duration and support to subscription conversions positively impacted the amount of upfront subscription revenue recognized in the quarter and in the year. I'd like to remind you that over the long term, ARR and recurring revenue growth rates should be approximately the same.  However, in any period, revenue is subject to much more volatility due to ASC606, which is why we feel that our, our annual run rate, which is also very close proxy for subscription billings is the true in better indicator of PTC's growth in fiscal 21 non-GAAP operating margins were a 35% and increased approximately 610 basis points over fiscal 20. This was due to the strong revenue performance I just mentioned, as well as maintaining good discipline on our operating expense structure. Non-GAAP EPS of $3.97 increased 58% year-over-year and was above guidance.  I'd like to point out that our GAAP results reflect a gain of $69 million related to our investment in Matterport, which we mark-to-market. And as you may recall, Matterport went public and begin trading on July 23. In addition, our GAAP results also included the release of $137 million valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets and a tax benefit of $42 million related to the Arena acquisition.  Moving to the next slide, another way to think about PT's performance is using the cash flow model we often share. And as you can see here on Slide 13, ARR plus perpetual revenue, plus professional services revenue equals our cash generation, which was $1.455 billion is up about $200 million over fiscal '20.  You can also see the total expenses of $1.173 billion. This was up about $138 million over fiscal '20, which leads to a net cash contribution margin of $473 million with an increase of about $62 million. Or if you think about cash contribution margin as a proxy for cash EBITDA EBITDA, we delivered a 29% cash contribution margin.  And this was up about a 100 basis points compared to fiscal '20. In this format, you can see most of the one-time headwinds and tailwinds I discussed earlier are below the line. As in terms of cash tax headwinds and tailwind, M&A related expenses, improvements in aging, which actually resulted in net positive working capital in fiscal '21, which one would normally expect to be negative in a growing business.  Moving to Slide 14, I'll begin with our balance sheet. We ended with fiscal '21 with cash and cash equivalents of 320 million. In addition, we had medium-term investments of $78 million primarily related to our investment in Matterport. Our gross debt was $1.45 billion with an aggregate interest rate of about 3.2%. During Q4. Before we paid down 40 million on our revolving credit facility.  And we also made our $19 million semi-annual bond interest payment. With our leverage ratio now less than 3 times, which we told you as our goal. We resumed our share repurchase program, that $30 million of cash we used to repurchase shares in Q4 was approximately equal to our free cash flow generation in the quarter. All-in-all Q4 wrapped up a solid year for PTC from both an ARR and the free cash flow perspective. With that, I'll turn it back to Jim. Thanks, James. I'll now take you through our financial guidance and go-forward reporting structure. Turning to Slide 24. First, let me reiterate how exciting a time this is for PTC. The restructuring that we're going through right now is really the single biggest somatic investment PTC has made that I can remember.  This reorganization is designed to better align PTC to our SaaS future, and as an interesting consequence it should also derisk our path towards delivering on the midterm ARR and cash flow growth targets we discussed at our Investor Day last November.  Starting with guidance on slide 24, we continue to target mid-teens ARR growth in the mid-term. Jim did a good job of outlining the many pathways we have to get into these targets with the SaaS opportunity in both the velocity and core businesses. With the addition of solutions to the portfolio starting with DPM, coupled with the general strength of the existing portfolio. More specifically, for fiscal22, we expect ARR of 1. Great. Thanks, Jim. So back to the financial guidance and go-forward reporting structure. First, let me reiterate how exciting time this is for PTC. The restructuring we're going through right now is really the single biggest somatic investment PTC has made that I can remember. This reorganization is designed to better align PTC to our SaaS future.  And as an interesting consequence, it should also de -risk our path to delivering on the mid-term ARR and cash flow growth targets we discussed at our Investor Day last November. So starting with guidance on Slide 24, we continue to target getting to mid-teens ARR growth in the mid-term.  Jim did a good job outlining many of the pathways we have to getting to these targets with the SaaS opportunity in both the velocity and core businesses with the addition of solutions to the portfolio starting with DPM, coupled with the general strength of the existing portfolio.  More specifically, for fiscal '22, we expect ARR of 1.615 billion to 1.66 billion. That's a growth rate of 10 to 13% on a constant currency basis. Following four consecutive years of double-digit ARR growth. It's also worth mentioning that we expect continued churn improvement in fiscal 22 and are targeting another 100 basis points improvement.  From a linearity perspective, we would again expect flattish ARR growth throughout the year on a constant currency basis. So using the midpoint of guidance that would imply about 11.5% ARR growth each quarter. Obviously this can fluctuate given bookings, performance, start dates, et cetera. But we believe we provided for that within the range outlined.  The one thing worth pointing out is that ARR growth in Q1 of '22 are expected to be approximately 15% since Q1 '21 did not include ARR for Arena. In order to help with the modeling, we've provided historical constant currency performance in the data tables, on the website and I'll touch more on this in a little bit. Turning to cash flow, we also continue to target approximately 25 to 30% annual free cash flow growth over the mid-term.  For fiscal '22 specifically, we're guiding for free cash flow of approximately $400 million. As a consequence of the restructuring, we're expecting cash outflows of approximately $50 million to $55 million with approximately 2/3 occurring in the first half and the majority of the remaining payments to be made in Q3.  Excluding restructuring, our expected free cash flow in fiscal '22 would be approximately $450 million, representing 25% growth compared to the $359 million we generated in fiscal '21 on the same basis. Doing some directional math and using round numbers on the mid-term targets, this means we would expect free cash flow in the $550 million to $600 million range in fiscal '23 and would expect $700 million to $750 million of free cash flow in fiscal '24.  Regarding the linearity of free cash flow in fiscal 22, excluding restructuring, we expect to see a similar pattern as in fiscal 21 with more than 60% of free cash flow generation in the first half of the year. Collections are stronger in the first half and we expect expenses to increase as we. And hiring and our SaaS investments throughout the year.  As Jim discussed, the restructuring not only creates strategic improvements in how we're organized, but also enhances our profitability profile. So we believe we'll be able to deliver strong free cash flow growth even if we don't accelerate the ARR. Come back to this point on the next slide.  And finally turning to revenue guidance on for fiscal '22 we're expecting revenue of $1.85 billion to $1.98 billion, which corresponds to a growth rate of 2% to 9% on an as-reported basis or 4% to 11% on a constant currency basis. ASC606 makes revenue fairly difficult to predict in the short term for on-premise subscription companies, hence the wide range.  Note that revenue has no impact on ARR or free cash flow as we continue to primarily bill customers annually upfront. And again, over the longer term, we expect recurring revenue growth to align with ARR growth, particularly as we transition the Company to SaaS and evolve towards increasingly ratable revenue recognition.  So moving onto Slide 25 using the same free cash flow model we showed earlier, this slide illustrates a directional view of what fiscal '22 could look like, assuming the approximate midpoint of our ARR guidance range. ARR here grows at approximately 11.5%. Cash generation is up $170 million.  We see continued growth and expenses but given the new operating model, as Jim pointed out earlier, our cash contribution margin expands almost 400 basis points. Said differently, the new operating model is expected to add more than a $120 million of cash contribution margin versus the 60 plus we add as last year on similar slightly less ARR growth.  On the expense front, as Jim mentioned, we're reducing spending in certain areas to fund investments to accelerate our SaaS transition. Additionally, there are some other items that will impact OpEx this year such as the accounting for commissions which is impacted by ASC606, increased travel merit, and so on.  So as far as the P&L is concerned, the net result is that we are guiding for fiscal 22 non-GAAP operating expense to grow by approximately 3% at the midpoint of guidance, which is certainly lower than the 50% of our targeted ARR growth for the year, even though we're significantly increasing our SaaS related spending.  On an organic basis, factoring in the Arena acquisition, which closed in Q2 of fiscal 21, we actually expect non-GAAP OpEx growth to be closer to 2% at the midpoint of our range. We also have a modest. $5 million uptick in CapEx this year. Hawaii cash taxes remained approximately flat and we see some expansion in the other category which is really the restructuring charge and change in working capital as the business grows.  Moving to Slide 26, as you know, we currently present our ARR and revenue in three product categories, core, FSG, and growth. Going forward, as Jim explained, we'll have 2 business units, digital thread and velocity, so to align our reporting with how we look at the business, we'll be changing our ARR and revenue reporting buckets accordingly.  Digital thread will consist of core FSG and also IoT and ARR from the current growth products. And when we report Digital Thread going forward we'll provide forward -- we'll provide the detailed split one level below. On the slide, the categories in bold taxed on the left represent our current disclosure, the categories on the right in bold green text represent our go-forward disclosure. And velocity will consist of Onshape and Arena from the current growth products.  Slide 27 shows what the recast ARR data looks like. I won't spend a lot of time on this as we publish 3 years of historical ARR and revenue data in our new format within the financial data tables file on the IR website. There are a couple of points I would make. First, please note that all of the historical constant-currency ARR figures have been calculated using our fiscal '22 plan FX rates.  Second, in addition to the digital thread and velocity recast, we did We did a small recast of a portion of our view for ARR business, which removes approximately $6 million of ARR in both fiscal 21 and fiscal '20 and $5 million in fiscal '19. We made this change because we've come to realize there are certain buyers with marketing oriented use cases who purchased Vuforia engine for short-term promotions without a true intention to use it on a recurring basis.  The bulk of the Vuforia Suite is unaffected and will continue to be sold on a recurring basis. We adjusted the historical amounts to enable go-forward comparability. And then lastly, just in terms of expectations for fiscal 22, starting with the digital thread core, we are targeting fiscal 22 ARR growth of 10% to 12%.  This is consistent with our historical performance for digital thread growth. We are targeting fiscal 22 ARR growth accelerating back into the 20% plus range. For digital thread FSG, we target fiscal 22 ARR growth of approximately flattish, again, consistent with historical performance and expectations. So in total for digital thread, we're targeting ARR growth of 10% to 12%.  For velocity, we're targeting fiscal 22 ARR growth in the 20 plus percent range given the strength of both Arena and Onshape. Moving on to Slide 28 and to provide some additional context, the highlight of our guidance assumptions. They're all listed in our press release and I've covered a few of them already, so I won't cover them all here. One point worth calling out is that we target to return approximately 50% of our cash flow to shareholders through share repurchases. In fiscal '22 we will also focus on delivering. Therefore, assuming $450 million of free cash flow, excluding restructuring, we would expect our buybacks to be about 25% of that amount with the rest going to delivering.  So wrapping up, we had strong financial performance in fiscal '21, delivered on 4 quarters of meeting our ARR and free cash flow guidance, and this was our fourth consecutive year of double-digit ARR growth, while maintaining discipline on the expense structure. And most importantly, of course, we believe we're well-positioned to deliver on the midterm targets we provided at our Investor Day last November. We're unlocking a significant multiyear catalyst by accelerating our SaaS transition.  And we're also optimizing how we go-to-market with our digital thread and velocity business units. I'm encouraged by how PTC continues to rapidly evolve to meet the needs of our customers. Moving on to Slide 29, we look forward to discussing today's news during the Q&A session and follow-up calls. Also, we will host an investor meeting on December 15th to further discuss our strategy and targets. Please save that date on your calendars. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator to begin Q&A. Yeah. I mean, I think to a degree, right? For sure. I mean, setting aside and macro and the fact that we don't have a crystal ball there and everything like that. We're launching a major SaaS initiative, but don't have in our guide big assumptions it will hit this year. I think it will hit next year and hit even harder in the years that follow. But we haven't planned a lot into this year.  Partly because, again, we need to get this earnings call out there, we need to launch everything, we need to start the sales cycles, and then we need to close the orders. And if you put 6 to 9 month sales cycles on things and we're not exactly sure how long it will take, but 6 to 9 months lands you in Q3 or Q4 already. And so we're just not sure. Then when the start dates might be and all that type of stuff.  So we're fairly conservative about the cloud impact to fiscal '22, but quite bullish about it to fiscal '23, '24, '25, and beyond. The other thing is as we've said, we're a little bit conservative, more so than in past years as it relates to Rockwell. It could be wrong there, but we're just saying, let's not get ahead of ourselves in case they get distracted with this integration Plex. I don't think Rockwell thinks they'll get distracted, but again, we're just trying not to get out over [Indiscernible]. Yeah, I think if you look at the different classes of partners, it affects them differently. Let's start with Microsoft elated about this as you might expect, because it will bring a lot of business their way.  If you look at Rockwell, Rockwell too is leaning into SaaS, and frankly, all of our SaaS products are easier for Rockwell to digest and to deliver onto their customers then would be the on-premise variance. So I think Rockwell quite likes the strategy and maybe some of their own thinking about SaaS was born in our boardroom i don't know. You'd have to ask Blake that, but I might speculate. Hi Jason. Hi. Great. Hi everyone. Just focus on new Digital Thread Business Unit. It maybe seems like there is rising interest in both platform deals. I just think about the way Rockwell expanded, the scope of the partnership so with more products or even both. I think when they were talking about the big CAD PLM deal, they spoke about this better pairing with existing IoT they have set up in their clients.  So I'm just wondering, A, am I characterizing the demand environment correctly and then B, does the new business unit actually allow you to maybe better execute time cross-sold, done house than the case? Hey, Blair."

            "name": "James Heppelmann",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt, and welcome again to PTC. It's been great to get you on board and thanks for your help in preparing for today's call. We have a lot of exciting news for our investors today, so we plan to allow a little more time than usual for the call. No doubt there will be follow-up interest, so we've also scheduled our Annual Investor Day.  In mid-December, and we expect to be active on the IR circuit in the weeks ahead. Starting then with Slide 4. Given the news, we're going to follow a somewhat different agenda for today's call. I'm going to start with highlights of our Q4 and fiscal 2021 performance. Then I will take you through an abbreviated version of our product line results. Next, Kristian will complete our discussion of Q4 and Fiscal 2021 with his financial reviews.  Then turning to the future, I'll address the changes we announced today, which are designed to accelerate our SaaS transition and margin expansion. Following that, Kristian will take you through our go-forward guidance and reporting structure. We've reserved extra time for your questions at the end. Moving to Slide 5, Q4 was an outstanding quarter for PTC and it capped off another strong year.  We came in at the high end of our guidance for ARR growth and we exceeded our free cash flow guidance. Despite the pandemic, every part of the business performed well in fiscal '21, with growth in every product line and in every geography. Fiscal '21 was our fourth consecutive year of double-digit organic ARR growth and we're guiding for fiscal '22 to be the fifth. Furthermore, by continuing our strong focus on operational discipline, we've been able to translate our top-line growth into strong bottom-line free cash flow performance. Kristian will take you through free cash flow in more detail later in the call. Taking a look at the key factors driving our top line performance, and turning to slide 6, our Q4 bookings results were outstanding. Bookings were up mid-teens organically, and high-teens overall from the blockbuster Q4 we had a year ago. Remember then in Q4 of fiscal '20, bookings bounced back sharply following a downturn in Q2 and Q3 during the depths of the pandemic.  Surpassing last year's strong Q4 number is a great accomplishment. Bookings were strong across all product lines and geographies. Because Q4 of fiscal '20 had been such an outlier, our plan targeted Q4 '21 organic bookings to be roughly flat to last year's number. Creo was slightly above plan, while everything else was well above.  FSG and Onshape led the way with bookings growth of more than 90% and 70%, respectively. IoT and ARR bookings were both up mid-teens year-over-year to record levels for each, with IoT bookings growing more than 120% sequentially while ARR bookings grew more than 60% sequentially. PLM bookings were up high-single digits year-over-year.  Keep in mind that a good percentage of our Q4 bookings, especially those done later in the quarter don't start until October or later. So they end up in what we used to call backlog but now call deferred ARR. Deferred ARR ended the year $20 million above the original plan we had for fiscal '21.  So in summary, not only did we hit the high end of our Fiscal '21 ARR guidance range by delivering 12 points of organic ARR growth, we also booked about a 0.5 more growth in the deferred ARR, which will benefit future periods. Turning to ARR on Slide 7, on a top-line basis, fiscal '21 was a big success. In Q4, we came in at 12% organic ARR excluding Arena, and 16% ARR growth overall. Looking at our core products in Q4, we continued to deliver market-leading growth.  Creo came in at low double-digit growth, while Windchill grew mid-teens. According to data published by Jay Vleeschhouwer, Creo and Windchill have significantly outperformed Siemens in DSOs, CAD and PLM businesses lately, as they are relatively flat with 2019, while we're up more than 20%.  We've been seeing a solid growth trend in our core CAD and PLM business for years now, and we expect this to continue. I'll come back to this important point during the second part of my prepared remarks. Next, looking at our growth products, IOT grew mid-teens coming in below our target.  However, bookings were strong in Q4 and we expect stronger ARR growth in Fiscal '22 following bookings momentum and the launch of our new digital performance management solution. Vuforia AR, Vuforia Augmented Reality grew mid-teens, which is better than it sounds when you factor in that this growth came on top of very strong 77% growth in our previous Q4 that we're comparing against. I'm happy with the roughly 40% [Indiscernible] over the past two years. In fiscal '22, we're positioned to continue good growth in AR based on our bookings momentum. Onshape grew over 50%.  It's now been 3 years since we acquired Onshape and we're very pleased with the acquisition and the progress made by the Onshape team. Arena grew over 20%. This represents good acceleration from mid-teens pre acquisition growth rates driven by go-to-market investments we've made coupled with synergies gained by being part of PTC. Turning to FSG, growth was 6% primarily driven by strong performance of our systems and software engineering offerings where we benefited from several large deals.  Turning to slide 8, while Creo and Windchill are powerful independently, these products generate even more value when leveraged together. A great example of this integrated story can be found in our recent announcement that the entire Volvo Group will adopt PTC's Creo product as their primary CAD solution, mirroring what they did several years ago with our Windchill PLM solution. This is a big competitive displacement for Creo.  In addition, our answers powered Creo simulation live technology, together with Creo ANSYS simulation, continues to drive customer interest in simulation. I've been saying for some time that as the product system of record, PLM is a critical element of any manufacturing Company's digital transformation strategy.  This is exactly what led to our largest ever PLM order in Q4 of '21 a multi - year committed ramp deal coming from a large global medical device Company. This too, was a competitive displacement for Windchill. nPLM, we saw our average deal sizes increasing with numerous expansions in the quarter.  In IoT this past week, we launched our digital performance management or DPM solution at our manufacturing live event. If you miss the event, by the way, you can find the replay on our Investor website. DPM is our new solution designed to be a comprehensive, turnkey, out-of-the-box solution that addresses our customer's biggest IoT value-creation opportunities.  It will be the perfect antidote to the so-called pilot programs to our problem the IoT industry has been discussing. You may have also noted separately the press release announcing that PTC is the only industrial IoT player recognized as a leader by all 4 major industry analyst firms. Also in the IoT space, Microsoft yesterday officially launched its Cloud for Manufacturing and we're thrilled to be a lead partner.  Our alliance with Microsoft continues to go well with Q4 being our best quarter to-date in terms of co-selling with Microsoft. Vuforia delivered a healthy mix of expansions, cross-sell and net new logos. We landed our largest ever AR order from a large pharmaceutical Company, which will use Vuforia to deliver augmented digital work instructions to improve the speed and quality of production line changeovers.  Also, with all the buzz you hear about Metaverse these days, you might enjoy watching the amazing, live industrial Metaverse demonstration that our CTO, Steve Dertein and I delivered as part of our manufacturing live keynote, using our Vuforia Spatial Toolbox technology. If you look carefully at the graphic on the right side of Slide 8, that is Steve and I standing in front of our anonymized digital representations whose movement and activity is being measured and analyzed in real-time.  This is a peek into our concept of Digital Taylorism, named after the famous work or Frederick Taylor, who was the father of industrial engineering more than a 100 years ago. Turning now to Onshape and Arena on Slide nine. Onshape performance has been driven by strong win rates against competitors, coupled with solid expansion rates.  Onshape captured nearly 1,000 new logos in Fiscal '21. During the year, churn improved by 10 points, while net retention improved by 15 points. And these metrics now look quite strong compared to similar sized SaaS peers of all types. Naturally smaller companies have been drawn to Onshape because it's lightweight SaaS footprint enables agile hardware development processes.  But thanks to 17 more product releases during the past year, Onshape's maturing functionality also led to several significant orders in Q4 from larger companies and the robotics and medical device fields, who love the product for similar reasons. The amazing adoption that Onshape experienced in the education market in fiscal '21 is icing on the cake. It contributed little to the financials, but sets the stage for mass adoption by the next-generation workforce in future years.  Arena saw numerous expansions driving larger deal sizes too. Arena is also proving to be a great acquisition. Like Onshape, Arena is the cloud-native market leader in PLM, with particular strength in TechCentric markets such as electronics and medical devices. We're on track with the integration plan that we laid out for the acquisition of Arena, with new sales capacity coming online in the U.S. and Europe.  The combination of Onshape and Arena makes PTC the clear market leader in Cloud-native, PLM and CAD solutions. And these offerings make a great pairing for fast-moving high-tech manufacturers who want to develop hardware using the same agile process methodology as software. Next, Slide 10, shows our geographic ARR performance.  America was up 19% led by double-digit growth in core products and Arena. Europe was up 13% led by high single-digit in core products, low 40's growth in growth products, and double-digit growth in FSG. And APAC was up 17% led by mid-teens growth in core products and low 30's growth in growth products. There are thousands of people at PTC that contributed to our outstanding fiscal '21, and I'd like to say thank you to all of them. With that, I'll hand it over to Kristian to complete the portion of today's call focused on Q4 and fiscal '21. Thanks, Kristian. PTC is at an exciting point in our history. Despite bumpy macro conditions, we have established a 4-year track record of double-digit, top-line organic growth based on a recurring revenue model, and driven by widely recognized technology leadership positions in an industry increasingly motivated by digital transformation. In parallel, our decade long track record of strong operational discipline has driven our margins up.  Enabling us to benefit significantly from leverage as we scale. You see that in the 61% free cash flow growth, I highlighted at the start of the call. Given the strength of our financial performance in Fiscal 2021, the restructuring we announced today might come as a surprise to some of you.  But sit tight because I think you will like what we're doing. For some time now, I've been telling investors about our plans to leverage the Atlas platform that we acquired with Onshape to pivot the whole Company toward a SaaS future. As I had previously discussed it, much of the upside benefits of the SaaS pivot would come in fiscal 2024 and beyond. Many of you have asked why we wouldn't invest more to get to that SaaS upside more quickly.  Frankly, that was a good question and one that we've thought long and hard about. We even hired Mckinsey that help us think through it and develop a strategy. Today, I will explain how, thanks to the changes we're making. We will invest substantially more in our SaaS initiatives while actually decreasing our overall run-rate spending projections significantly.  Let me hit the financial summary first on slide 16 and then explain the strategy and operational changes behind it. In terms of the financial view or the restructuring, we're reducing our spending run rate by approximately 60 million compared to fiscal 2021 as we improve the efficiency of our organizational structure. We've also eliminated about 30 million of previously contemplated new spending run rate from our fiscal '22 plans.  So compared to the plan for fiscal '22 that existed prior to the restructuring, we now have -- we now expect to reduce our planned fiscal '22 run-rate spending by approximately $9 million and then reinvest about half of that into initiatives that accelerate our transition to SaaS with the other half falling to the bottom line. Key SaaS investments will be used to increase capacity on the Atlas, to accelerate work to adopt Atlas into our core products and to operate those products as SaaS and into Onshape than Arena product development and sales capacity.  Despite what will be a very significant investment, we expect to expand cash margins by approximately 400 basis points in FY22.So we are accelerating both growth and margin expansion at the same time. Restructuring related cash outflows are expected to be approximately $50 million to $55 million with about 2/3 occurring in the first half of '22, and the majority of the remaining payments to be made in Q3.  In other words, the restructuring will obscure the great cash flow progress for the next 2 or 3 quarters, but the benefits will start shining through after that. Already by Q4 of fiscal '22, we should be seeing a net free cash flow tailwind as a consequence of the restructuring. Then as Kristian will outline, fiscal '23 and beyond will look great. Let's go to slide 17 and I will start by explaining why a SaaS pivot is so interesting to PTC.  There are three reasons why we think now is the time for PTC to align with and invest more in the SaaS transition. First the industrial software market wants to go to SaaS. COVID has greatly amplified the interest in SaaS. PTC is already the recognized SaaS leader in our industry.  Onshape and Arena have proven what's possible and they've dramatically elevated PTC's credibility. We are far ahead of competitors in terms of understanding what SaaS is and what it is not. Customers are looking for PTC to lead the whole industry through a transition to SaaS. We see the need to accelerate SaaS initiatives while better aligning with SaaS best practices in order to meet the needs of the market.  The investments we're making now will allow us to play offense to capture the market demand. Third, we believe our new SaaS strategy will accelerate a major growth driver for PTC. Giving us more pathways to mid-teens growth in the mid-term, and helping to de -risk our growth ambitions.  Meanwhile, cost savings from the restructuring itself are expected to de -risk our free cash flow growth targets even if the growth should prove slower to materialize than I expect. Turning to Slide 18, owning the industry's only cloud-native CAD and PLM combo has been a big advantage.  By comparing our Onshape and Arena businesses work as compared to the balance of BDC. We can see that certain ways in which PTC has been organized are quite inefficient. At the same time, we see an opportunity to serve customers better too, and that's why we're choosing to evolve our organization to be more SaaS-like. I'd like to review several of the larger changes.  Previously in addition to working with sales, our customers would have more than a half dozen touch points across our broad customer success organization, including renewal sales, pre sales, post-sales consulting, customer success management, technical support, our cloud organization, a group called customer experience and others. In comparison, most SaaS companies have a 2 in the box model where each customer has just 1 sales and 1 customer success contact.  Not only is PTC's current model inefficient, perhaps more importantly, customers hate being repeatedly passed from one contact to another as they proceed through their journey with PTC. So we are re-configuring to deploy the same tool box model, the SaaS companies utilize. This reconfiguration has no impact on the sales side of the equation. In fact, the sales side of the equation -- in fact, we're adding direct quota carrying capacity into the current model.  Aside from where we expand coverage, the vast majority of customers will retain the same sales contacts they know and love today. The bigger change for the customer will be that they now have one customer success contact rather than many. There's nothing but goodness here for everybody.  Customers prefer this model and it will save PTC a lot of money as it is much more scalable. The other major changes on the product development, delivery and support side. With Onshape and Arena or any true SaaS Company. This is all done by a single organization using modern DevOps practices.  But within the core PTC product lines the development, cloud delivery, and technical support organizations have been entirely separate. With the latter two belonging to the field organization. You simply can't get to SaaS that way. As part of our reorganization, we have merged our cloud delivery and technical support groups into the product organization to mirror the modern SaaS practices deployed by Onshape and Arena and everybody else in the SaaS world.  This too will create significant operating efficiencies and a much improved customer experience at the same time. Nothing but goodness here to. To better understand the demand drivers, let's take a look at an illustrative value proposition on slide 19, typical of what customers see in the transition from on-premise to SaaS.  For every dollar a customer pays PTC or any other vendor for on - prem PLM, they have an estimated additional $2 to $3 and cost of ownership associated with on-premise servers and store agent system administrators plus SI who help with on-site installations and upgrades and all that. Their total cost of ownership can be $3 to $4.  When the deployment, maintenance, and delivery responsibility for the software is shifted back to PTC, we can leverage significant efficiencies to serve that same functionality back to the customer for roughly an incremental dollar at margins that are attractive to us. Therefore, each dollar of on-premise software ARR today represents potentially $2 of future SaaS, ARR for PTC plus a savings of a dollar or 2 for the customer.  The customer also gets to enjoy the many other benefits of SaaS. It is device-agnostic. It's ideal for a hybrid work environment. Data is shared with employees and suppliers in real-time. Plus no more upgrades to do as everyone is always on the latest version. This value proposition for SaaS is not really new news to any of you, it's what Marc Benioff at salesforce.com has been espousing for 2 decades now.  More than half of the overall commercial software industry has already made this pivot. But that's not yet the case in our world of industrial software, where SaaS has low single-digit penetration. As Salesforce did in CRM, some Company will have to lead the way to SaaS and the CAD and PLM industry. We think the time is right for industrial companies to move to SaaS and PTC is best positioned to lead that transition.  Turning to Slide 20, we've been delivering more and more new PLM projects as SaaS in recent years, as customer preference has shifted there. But going forward, we will make SaaS our primary delivery model and deliver on-premise only when required by the customer. But we also have a large existing customer base with on-premise systems. In order for existing customers to get the SaaS, each customer has to go through a lift and shift process.  This process entails lifting the on-premise deployment, upgrading, and decustomizing it as necessary to eliminate technical debt, and then shifting it into the PTC Cloud from where we can serve it back to the customer as a service. We plan to focus the lift and shift program first on Windchill, where the biggest opportunity lies and bring Creo and other products into the fold in subsequent phases over time.  So you may be wondering, will, how will this. Helped to accelerate growth? The answer is that our organizational changes, and the associated wave of investment, enable us to scale up to make SaaS the default for new sales, and start to lift and shift process now, here in fiscal22, though the value proposition for transitioning to SaaS 's sound, we still have to go through a sales cycle of each customer.  Returning the sales teams lose now with this proposition, and we expect the first projects to begin showing up in the back half of fiscal 22, The Windchill SaaS capability will be deployed into Azure and into the manufacturing Cloud at that. So Microsoft is eager to help us sell this proposition. I'd like to think of this project as the last upgrade for each customer.  Because when the lift and shift projects done then PTC will take it forward from there. Therefore, a good time to sell this program is whenever customers start planning their next upgrade. Customers tend to upgrade Windchill systems, once every 2 or 3 years, so we get a shot at a good portion of the base each year and expect success to accelerate in fiscal 23 and beyond.  There are thousands of Windchill deployments out there, so I anticipate this process will take numerous years, perhaps a decade, and we won't get them all. Naturally we'll focus first on the most ready customers and work on the long tail further out. In the end, I expect we will ultimately get about 75% of the customers to transition and we'll continue to offer on-premise variance of the product. Born of the same code-stream on an indefinite basis for those who do not want SaaS. PTC is all-in on SaaS. The program we're launching is a major cross-functional effort on par with the highly successful program.  We executed the move from perpetual to where we are today with 98% of our software revenue now being subscription. Like that subscription program, the SaaS transition program involves numerous changes to our offerings, to our pricing and packaging, to compensation, and more. We have the same program leader driving it.  An important difference though, is that the SaaS transition program is all about growth acceleration within the recurring software business model, we currently have in place. Which means we will not have the same, same so-called valley of depth effect that our cash flow went back, that went through back then? Now we'll have all of the gain, but none of that pain.  Taking you deeper into the elements of this program will be a key agenda topic at our December Investor Day. One last related change we're making is to organize into two main business units as shown on Slide 21. With plans to leverage SaaS now in place and underway across the entire Company, it no longer makes sense to have a SaaS business unit per say.  Therefore, we plan to reunite Vuforia AR with the CAD PLM and IoT product lines into a business unit designed to promote higher levels across selling, across this integrated product portfolio. This new business unit, which focuses on the digital transformation driver, will be all about growing the base and leading them to SaaS.  It will be called the Digital Thread Business Unit to reflect the highly integrated nature of its portfolio of products. Troy Richardson has been our Chief Operating Officer for the past year, is being promoted to become a president of this business unit. Troy has already been managing them, go-to-market side of these businesses. But now the product developments are more important to him as well to drive tight alignment.  Naturally, I'll stay involved in the technology road map because as you probably know, that's where my passion lies. You'll get more time with Troy Richardson at the upcoming Investor Day. Onshape and Arena will remain together under their current President, Mike DiTullio.6 This will be called the velocity business unit, to reflect that the Cloud-native pure SaaS value proposition of Onshape and Arena is most attractive to companies who want to deploy agile product development processes and move fast.  This business unit is all about disrupting the competition and landing new logos, which in many cases are SMB customers. But we are seeing larger companies being drawn to Onshape and Arena solutions still because their existing vendor simply doesn't have anything that compares.  Companies like Gear Motion, for example, the $4 billion automotive turbocharger Company we've profiled at our fiscal 2020 Investor Day last year, who switched to Onshape from a high-end CAD competitor to gain increased business velocity. You'll have more time with Mike DiTullio too at the Investor Day. [Indiscernible] business unit's presidents report to me. I help drive their respective strategies while Troy and Mike preside over the operating cadence of each business unit.  A related change is that the Atlas platform will move under our very capable CTO, Steve Dertein, who will develop the shared platform to meet the needs of both units. Steve will continue to report to me. I know that was a lot of information to take in. Turning to Slide 22. Let me summarize and then I'll hand it back to Kristian for more specific go-forward guidance.  First from a top-line perspective, our SaaS acceleration pivot unlocks another powerful multiyear growth catalyst for PTC and our shareholders. Exiting fiscal '21 Creo and Windchill together represent more than $1 billion of ARR growing double-digits organically.  This growth pattern has been in place for 4 years now, right through the pandemic, with the strong performance driven by the role both products play in the digital transformation strategies of industrial companies. With the SaaS program that we're launching, we're layering an additional growth driver into this core business that we expect could last a decade.  Therefore, in our core business, we see double-digit ARR growth being sustainable well into the future. Together with the growth drivers in IoT and AR, plus Onshape and Arena, we're creating more pathways to drive ARR growth to the mid-teens. In my deal, PTC's growth story's alive and well. Second from a bottom-line perspective, the strategic improvements we're making will drive up our cash contribution margins considerably and help de -risk our cash flow targets under a broader range of ARR growth scenarios.  Kristian will expand on this. Given our confidence in growth coupled with the higher margins, we remain committed to the midterm free cash flow targets that we set at our Investor Day last year. Recall that our guidance was for mid-term free cash flow growth of approximately 25% to 30%. After we get beyond the restructuring payments, we expect to perform in that range. Perhaps earlier than you might have expected.  Our guidance for fiscal 22 assumes we'll get a small positive impact from the SaaS transition in the back half of the fiscal year, which is counterbalanced by slower assumed growth rates in FSG, and somewhat conservative assumptions we have around Rockwell has contribution as they work their way through the Plex integrate.  Let me be clear that our commitment to the partnership with Rockwell remains as strong as ever, and that we are energized to work together because of the great potential we see ahead. In particular, we see tremendous potential for the DPM offering sold through Rockwell and their Calypso consulting app. Kristian, back over to you. This is James Heppelmann, I think we apparently got dropped from the call, which is a brand new experience for us, but I understand this happened just as Kristian was starting out with our FY 2022 guidance. So Kristian, can you pick it up again from the beginning of the FY 2022 guidance discussion. Thanks. It will still be step-by-step? Yeah. However, it will start sooner and the phases will be dramatically compressed, thanks to $45 million in new spending, which is a lot of new spending. Thank you. Hey Matt. Maybe we should go to the next question. Yeah well, what's happening on the sales side of the two in the box is pretty typical stuff that happens every year and which is to say not that extreme. A few more resources here and shifting a little bit what are overlays and not overlays, things like that. That's pretty typical. And I don't see any unusual degree of risk there whatsoever. What's happening on the other side is a little bit more dramatic, but frankly, most of that is what happens after the customer buys from us.  And I actually think it's all good changes anyway. So I don't see that disrupting sales, I see it actually making customers happy because they stop getting passed around from one person to another and having to re-explain who they are and all that kind of stuff. So I don't know. I don't think it's a high-risk change. Certainly, I don't see it that way. And we're eager to go execute it. Okay Matt, sorry, we didn't get to you last time around. We're going to try to disconnect halfway through your questions. Yeah, no. Again I want to be clear it's not in sales. It's really in customer success, where we used to have many organizations that took turns talking to customer. They all had management change. They all had overlapping responsibilities, etc. So the place we've taken the most money out of would be in customer success.  The stuff that happens after the customer buys. And we're doing that not by just reducing capability, but by simply implementing a much more efficient model with many less silos, much less management involved, and so forth. So that's all, goodness. There are other places we'll have efficiencies. Let me give you an example. If you belong to a field organization working technical support, your mission is to make the customer happy even if it means solving the same problem dozens or hundreds of times quickly.  If you're part of the product organization, your goal is to go back and talk to the product guys and tell them, make this product go away in the SaaS offering quickly, so that no other customers are even aware that it ever did exist. You can see those real efficiencies in terms of how you solve customer problems.  Are you trying to make them happy while they have the problem? And repeat that hundreds of thousands of times or are you trying to make the problem go away so that the rest of the customers never knew it happened? Just to summarize. These are great efficiencies that we're going to go pursue. And then I think if you look at our resellers, it'll change their world a little bit, they still need to go sell the software. They won't be as evolved in delivering it, but then they are very much involved in the implementation of it at the customer side. So I don't want you to think as it relates to resellers or SIs that SaaS companies don't have SI partners.  My God, Salesforce has a massive SI ecosystem. They just don't install software and perform upgrades at the customer site. They do system integration, they do adoption, and they do business process transformation. They do all that stuff which still has to happen. So that's kind of long term.  I think SIs have to take the posture they have relative to Salesforce and all those other SaaS companies, which will help them through and the bigger ones like Accenture already know that play. And then for the smaller resellers, the other thing worth noting is that most of our resellers sell Creo and Kepler. And those products are further out on the SaaS road map anyway, so that will be several years down the road before we even really come to that bridge. Hi Jason. Yes. I think it will be both, but let me first redefine pricing up lift so we don't confuse anybody. We will deliver more value to the customer and they will pay us more for that value while saving money on their side, above and beyond. So is that a pricing increase? I don't know. It's a value increase. And that could drive a tremendous amount of business.  Creo and Windchill are a billion-dollars and you could double $750 million of that over a decade with that $750 million of more value delivered to the customer base and monetize. However, what we're seeing with Arena and to a degree with Windchill is we have the cloudiest sassiest solutions in the market and that does help take share.  Every piece of business that Arena is winning. They're taken from somebody else or it's a start-up Company that they're winning on somebody else's expense. And Arena is a fastest growing P1 solution in the market right now. So I do think it's both, and you know exactly what the balance would be, I don't know. I do think monetizing the customer base by delivering more value is a high probability and it will drive a lot of growth by itself. Welcome. Hey Joe. Yeah well, let me hit the second question first. The new business unit is fundamentally formed to help us better execute on cross sells, because we do see that platform deal structure happening more and more. The example you gave with Global, I could repeat a dozen more examples of that, of customers who started with 1 product and pretty soon they have 2 and then 3 and they're trying off the fourth one and so forth. And we think that our products Creo, Windchill ThingWorx, Vuforia work beautifully together.  Like voices in a choir, they make beautiful music together. And rather than selling these things separately, yes, we can use them all as entry points, but let's pursue entry points that then can be up-sold and cross-sold, And so, I think Troy Richardson was one of the first people to ask, why don't you guys configure differently -- us guys now that he's here, but why don't we configured differently and go pursue this harder, this cross-sell motion, so that's exactly what we're doing is that's a little bit how the name digital thread came to be. Hey, Taylor. Yes. Well, let me comment on the first part of your question and then the second part. So again, we've been on boarding customers' SaaS for a while with PLM. And think of it that they're coming in at one margin and what our goal is to make improvements behind the scenes that take them to another margin even at the same cost to the customer. So whether it's single-tenant, multi-tenant, if you're the customer on the customer end, you don't even know.  But we on the PTC end, we see the efficiencies we're gaining or not gaining, we do know. And so a lot of our investment is aimed at making the product more efficient for PTC to deliver, as opposed to different from the usage end at the customer side. Now that said, if you look what we did with the subscription program, we pulled every lever we could come up with. Do you remember that program when we used to talk about it, we used to say, and I don't know Kristian.  Kristian actually was the program executive. We had 28 work-streams and 300 people working on it. We changed pricing and packaging to favor subscription over at the time perpetual. We paid more commission on a perpetual deal. We had certain offerings they were only -- I'm sorry we paid more commission I said that wrong on a subscription deal.  We had certain offerings that were only available, attractive sexy offerings including the answer stuff by the way, there was only available subscription. So we basically stack the deck in every customer conversation in a way that everybody wanted it to go subscription. We got the band back together, we're putting the same program together, and we'll stack the deck again in favor of SaaS this time. Hello, Adam. Yes. So first Adam, let's be clear. Exactly what I said. Bookings in the quarter were very strong. However, much of the bookings in a Q4 does not land in the ARR in the Q4, it's back to that start base discussion. What I said is that ARR was less than we wanted it to be. It was mid-teens and frankly, we've said we wanted to have a 2 handle. Now, bookings in every quarter of fiscal '21 were higher than the previous year quarter in fiscal '20.  So there is some bookings momentum happening. And then another thing is we launched this DPM solution that frankly we've been working for 2 years. It's a major piece of software that we launched in, already has quite some customer interest. So we feel like the combination of the bookings momentum we have including and especially in Q4 and then the launch of DPM and the trends we're seeing. They bode well for what should happen next year. Hi, Operator. I think we have time for maybe one more question. Hey, Blair. Yeah, I think what she should I think first of all, is it DPM, will become a category of solutions. And what we're launching first is DPM for factory. Digital performance management of what happens in a factory. There will be solutions that are more focused on digital performance management of a fleet of products out in the field at customer sites.  But fundamentally what we are trying to do is move from selling a toolkit where the customer does the solutioning themselves to selling a turnkey solution with a very strong value proposition, sold to executives not to developers, sold on the basis of the business value it will generate, and then implemented quickly in the production.  So yeah, it's a very different sales motion. I mean, number one, we're selling to executives not selling to developers. Number 2, we're selling business value, not speeds and feeds, technical stuff. And I think it's really where we wanted to take this business for a while. So I'm very pleased with the solution.  It took us a while to develop it, as I said, but it's a powerful piece of software and it really gives us a new platform to build on going forward with IoT. It makes IoT f I could, a lot like how we sell PLM. We sell PLM to executives based on business value. We were selling IoT to developers as a toolkit, and now we'll sell PLM and DPM as business value to executives. Different executives mind you but executives. Great. Thank you. Well, Operator maybe I'll just take it from here. First again my apologies. This is like the strangest earnings call I've had again, and it's the 44th one as CEO. So it's a bit odd, but nonetheless, I think we got a lot of good information out there and you guys had some great questions and I appreciate it. So in closing, I mean, we're in a great place. I really like PTC setup going forward.  The changes we announced are good for growth, they're good for profitability. They're going to put us in a stronger position to hit both the top-line and bottom-line targets that we have out there. So we're looking forward to continuing a discussion with you on follow-up calls at investor conferences.  I'm going to be at the Berenberg Conference, at least virtually next week or I guess it's 2 weeks out maybe, it's No, it's next week. And we look forward to seeing you at our investor meeting on December 15th. So thanks, everybody, and have a good evening."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the PTC 2021 Third Quarter Conference Call. During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions.  I would now like to turn the call over to Emily Walt PTC's Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead Ma'am.\nEmily Walt: Thank you, Peter. Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us for PTC's conference call to discuss our third quarter 2021 financial results. On the call today are Jim Heppelmann, Chief Executive Officer; and Kristian Talvitie, Chief Financial Officer.  Before we get started, please note that today's comments included forward-looking statements, including statements regarding future financial guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in PTC's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. As a reminder, we will be referring to operating and non-GAAP financial measures during today's call. Discussion of our operating metrics and the items excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings press release and related Form 8-K. Lastly we\u2019ll be referencing our earnings presentation today, which you can find posted on our IR website.  And with that, let me turn the call over to Jim. \nJames Heppelmann: Thanks, Emily. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. I hope you and your families are well during these continued uncertain times. I'm pleased to share that PTC has welcomed many of our vaccinated employees back to our offices where requirements allow and we look forward to the day when we can do this on a global scale. Meanwhile, we're monitoring the growing concern with the Delta variant of the virus and hoping this new development doesn't lead to another round of business lockdowns. Before I dive into the quarter, I want to share some important news on the Investor Relations front. Emily is been doing a great job holding down the fort since Tim Fox left. But keeping up with IR demands is a big job and Emily was happy to hear that reinforcements are on the way. I'm pleased to announce the hiring of Matt Shamal [ph] as our new Senior VP of Investor Relations. Matt came to us as a recommendation from one of our largest investors and he came out on top following a thorough search process. Matt comes to us with a finance background in several successful stints on both the corporate side and the sell side of investor relations. He's a strategic thinker, and we're excited to bring him on Board. Turning to Slide four, with three quarters behind us, our guidance for FY '21 has us right on track to deliver mid-teens ARR growth and $340 million of free cash flow this year. That would be a fourth consecutive year of double digit top line ARR growth. And I anticipate we'll be discussing a fifth consecutive year of double digit ARR growth when we guide fiscal '22 in 90 days or so. While the stronger PMI numbers that we're seeing, can only be helpful. I'm pleased to see that PTC is earning a reputation as a company that can consistently perform at high levels in good times and in bad.  In preparing for this call, I thought back to where we were a year ago. With shutdown orders in place, empty offices and factories, and schools contemplating how to educate from home. Against that chaotic backdrop, I'm very pleased with the results that PTC has been able to deliver right through the pandemic.  Some years back in the days when our portfolio was narrower and sold in a perpetual model, our business was much more cyclical. But consistent, reliable performance is always what we strive for and we did the difficult work to earn that. The type of steady organic top line growth performance you see from PTC hasn't been the rule in our peer group, especially among our most direct CAD and PLM competitors. I attribute our superior performance to a better business model, to tremendous strength across our entire portfolio, and to growth drivers that are now more secular than cyclical. In terms of growth drivers, PTC is well positioned for the future. The new logo success of our Onshape and arena businesses demonstrates the growing demand for SAS technologies. We see PLM joining IoT and augmented reality is key digital transformation technologies for industrial companies and years of market outgrowth in the CAD business space to the innovation we've reignited there. Turning now to Slide five so we can get into the Q3 details. PTC delivered another strong performance in top line ARR and bottom line free cash flow in the third quarter. Bookings grew in the mid-30s, a strong rebound in comparison to a year ago when bookings declined. In the top line category, we had a very solid quarter, with ARR growth of 18% or 15% in constant currency to $1.42 billion. Growth was driven by solid performance in our growth businesses, continued momentum in our core business, where we again outpaced market growth, and by a solid contribution from Arena Solutions. On an organic basis ARR grew 14% or 11% in constant currency in Q3, in line with our guidance. To close out the top line category, revenue growth of 24% as reported was driven by strong execution, aided by the impact of ASC 606 revenue recognition policies, plus of course, the Arena contribution. Switching to the bottom line category, we delivered strong free cash flow of $85 million and non-GAAP EPS growth of 34%, reflecting a combination of strong top line results, combined with continued operating expense discipline, even while we also invest for growth. We continue to feel confident about our FY '21 target of $340 million in free cash flow. Moving to Slide six, digital transformation remains our main secular driver of growth. You may remember last quarter I shared our new tagline, digital transforms physical. These three words are captured in our logo, and embody how PTC thinks about our long-term strategy. PTC is a digital company, but our customers do business in the physical world, making physical products in physical factories, and servicing those products at physical customer sites.  In my live works keynote in June, and again at our global partner summit in July, I outlined the power of PTC's unique digital transformation story that has one foot in the digital world and one foot in the physical world. We tell customers that our digital transforms your physical, and by that we mean we help customers use digital to define, manage, connect and augment physical products. Our portfolio is already transformative. But now with SaaS PTC is at the very forefront of thinking about how customers will use digital to disrupt physical in terms of taking an entirely different approach across the hardware, software and system administration of their IT systems. SaaS is surely coming to our market, as it has so many other B2B software markets and PTC has carved out an enviable leadership position. We now have the most to gain from this disruptive force. With that as context, let's take a look at the respective contributions of the FSG, core and growth segments of our portfolio. Moving to Slide seven, you'll see that ARR in our Focused Solution Group showed growth of 4% or 1% constant currency, which aligns with that growth expectations for this segment. ARR growth for our core business was 14% or 11% at constant currency. Our growth segment saw 60% ARR growth with 23% organic constant currency growth, reflecting on one hand, some lingering hangover from COVID but counterbalanced by solid performances from our Onshape AR and Arena SaaS Solutions. Let's go a click deeper into the main elements of our large core and growth segments. Turning to Slide eight, our CAD team delivered another impressive quarter with ARR growth in the low double digits, reflecting growth across all geos and an improving demand environment. The additional features and functionalities that Creo 7 delivers, including Creo simulation live and Creo Ansys Simulation, continue to demonstrate the power and differentiation of Creo.  In addition, last quarter, we announced Creo 8, which includes the generative design extension module called GTX, which is based on our Atlas SaaS platform. While it's still early days for Creo leveraging Atlas, this module is a great example of how PTC plans to deliver innovative SaaS based capabilities as we systematically transition our core products to SaaS. On Slide nine, a great example of how CAD, generative design and real time simulation, making enormous impact can be found at HPE COXA, a provider of products engineering solutions, and technology projects for the performance automotive and motorsports sectors. The company designs and manufactures car components, and complete systems for some of the highest profile super premium sports car our brands around the globe. Inefficiencies in a multi-step, multi software approach to design were causing miscommunication between design and analysts teams, which delayed production times and cause customer satisfaction risks. By adopting fully integrated and streamlined generative simulation and additive technology workflows in Creo, HPE COXA simplified the design sequencing, reduced overall design and production time and improved design agility and time to market. Moving on to Slide 10, in our PLM business, you'll see that PLM continued to deliver very strong performance with another mid-teens ARR growth quarter. From a geographic perspective in Q3, we saw broad based strength across all our geos and in our customer base, with a solid quarter in the reseller channel. And we saw increased demand for PLM through the Microsoft alliance. Another proof point suggesting more customers are understanding the critical role that PLM plays in their digital transformation initiatives. Incidentally, during the quarter, we won three more Partner of the Year awards from Microsoft. On Slide 11 we profile a win with Cellcentric, a Daimler truck and Volvo joint venture, which helps hydrogen fuel cells or which develops hydrogen fuel cell systems and believes that PTC's PLM solution is best-in-class. As the deadline of becoming an independent entity loomed on the horizon, Cellcentric knew they needed a PLM backbone in place quickly. PTC delivered our cloud-based Windchill offering, establishing a best-in-class application landscape for PLM in a great competitive displacement. Moving on to our growth businesses, I'll begin with IoT on Slide 12. IoT delivered high-teens year-over-year ARR growth driven by strength in Europe and APAC. Rockwell was the largest reseller of IoT in the quarter. On Slide 13, we discussed how Eaton, a multinational power management company, saw the need to deploy a digital transformation strategy across their enterprise. Our factory insights as a service, IoT application helped to deliver quick wins, forming a digital foundation upon which they can easily add more use cases. Eaton was able to realize multiple improvements including improved OEE, reduction in unscheduled maintenance, reduction in manual efforts, and 100% worker compliance with SOPs. Let me shift to our augmented reality business on Slide 14, The Vuforia augmented reality team again delivered strong results in Q3, with ARR growing across all geos. We saw improving retention and expansion rates, and the opportunity to cross sell into the larger PTC portfolio is gaining momentum. This quarter we also announced the new ARR product, Vuforia Instruct, a unique Atlas based SaaS solution designed to enable enterprises to leverage 3D CAD data to deliver -- create, deliver and scale interactive AR work instructions to optimize inspection procedures. When you consider that two-thirds of manufacturers are still using paper based inspection processes, you can appreciate how Instruct delivers considerable value to our customers. Vuforia resonates with the customers we engaged through our alliance with Microsoft and one of the awards we won this quarter was Partner of the Year in mix reality. On Slide 15, you'll see an innovative example of the use of augmented reality that come from Stannah, a UK company dedicated to the design, production and service of residential and commercial stairlifts. Stairlifts are customized systems configured for and installed in the consumers' home to help those with difficulty navigating stairs, for example, to move from the first floor living room to the second floor bedroom. Stannah leveraged Vuforia to create an AR application that allows customers to see how a customized 3D hologram chairlift could fit in work in their homes.  With COVID, limiting the amount of face to face interaction by sales and service teams, Vuforia enabled a customer centric tool that could be used by sellers during the sales cycle, to help potential buyers visualize a residential stairlift in their home. Stannah saw increased purchase confidence, improved differentiation against competitors and shorter sales cycles through improved customer communication. Turning now to Slide 16, Onshape delivered a very strong quarter, with ARR growth of 40% year-over-year. We had a very strong bookings quarter in the Onshape core commercial business with larger deal sizes and stronger renewals, thanks to a maturing product. Onshape continues to gain share in the education market tool, as schools and students turn to SaaS based solutions for mobility and ease of everything.  Looking ahead to Q4 we see a strong pipeline for both the commercial and larger account enterprise business. Turning to Slide 17, is fun highlighting customer stories especially when that customer is solving a problem through innovation. Delta development in R&D companies specializing in military applications for cooling and heating systems in extreme environments was contracted to design and manufacture and autonomous portable refrigeration unit for deployment by medics on the battlefield. The company was seeking to reduce its IT overhead, which had been taking up 20% of the engineering team's product design time.  By moving from an on premise CAD system that took a lot of care and feeding to Onshape, the time loss associated with software installations, licensing and regular system upgrades was eliminated. They both reclaimed the 20% of their design capacity, and at the same time enabled real time collaboration on 3D designs across a distributed team environment. Moving to Arena on Slide 18. Arena continues its growth trajectory, delivering ARR growth of over 20%. Arena seeing strong traction with upselling as they increase penetration in the current customer environments, and keep retention rates high. By all measures Arena looks to be a great acquisition. I'm also pleased to note that we opened our first European Arena sales operation during the quarter. Turning to Slide 19 NEXTracker, a flex company is one of the fastest growing cleantech companies in solar, offering next generation solar power plants with smart solar trackers and energy storage solutions. The company lacked a single source to track and manage its engineering design and development processes. They needed a better way to manage product information across distributed teams to enable automated approvals and to improve tracking and accountability.  With Arena, NEXTracker was able to reduce review and approval times by nearly 60%. Eliminate time zone delays with global partners and accelerate product introductions by 25%. Arena has helped NEXTrackers significantly improve the way they design and get products to market. Naturally, I'm pleased that PTC has been able to complement the strong performance of Creo and Windchill in the traditional market, with breakout performance from Onshape and Arena in the burgeoning SAS market of tomorrow. The success we're having with Onshape and Arena in the small and mid-market is 100% complimentary to Creo and Windchill success in larger companies. Geographic performance was strong on a global basis. And as shown on Slide 20, reflecting the performance trends we've seen year-to-date, America's ARR growth of 21% was driven by solid core performance and Arena. Europe ARR grew 9% consistent with several prior quarters, with strength in CAD, PLM and improving growth in IoT, as we work toward full recovery from COVID there. APAC delivered the fourth quarter in a row of mid-teens ARR growth with strong performance in core and growth businesses. Summarizing the state of the business, on Slide 21. We're pleased with the general good health of PTC across all of its different dimensions and moving parts and we look forward to wrapping up a great year of ARR and free cash flow growth here in FY '21.  With that, I'll turn it over to Kristian to take you through more details on the financial results and guidance.\nKristian Talvitie: Thanks, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our results I'd like to note that I\u2019ll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance and most of the growth rate references will be in constant currency. So let me start off with a review of our third quarter results, and then we'll review guidance for fiscal '21.  Turning to Slide 23, fiscal Q3 ARR of $1.42 billion increased 15% year-over-year and on an organic basis ARR grew 11%. Q3 free cash flow of $85 million was solid and in line with our expectations. Q3 revenue of $436 million increased 24% year-over-year as reported, or 19% in constant currency.  Revenue performance was driven by strong execution, and also reflects the impact of ASC 606 on revenue recognition, as well as a modest contribution from Arena. The strong revenue growth along with continued financial discipline resulted in non-GAAP EPS growth of 34% year-over-year. Turning to page 24, I\u2019ll begin with the balance sheet. We ended Q3 with cash of $366 million and $1.5 billion of gross debt with an aggregate interest rate of about 3.1%. We paid down $30 million on our revolving credit facility during the quarter. With our leverage ratio, now less than three times which we told you as our goal, we expect to be in the market buying back shares in Q4. Now, turning to guidance, Slide 25 highlights a few of the key guidance assumptions and while our assumption on the impact of currency on ARR has changed from neutral to an approximately 60 basis point tailwind. The rest of our guidance assumptions remain the same as they have throughout the year. So putting our ARR guidance into perspective and turning to Slide 26. Last quarter, we told you that we expected fiscal '21 ARR to be 1.45 to 1.47 billion, a growth rate of 14% to 16%. This assumes 10% to 12% organic growth, 400 basis points from Arena and no FX impact. Our revised guidance range is now $1.45 billion to $1.47 billion, which is still 14% to 16% growth, and assumes 10% to 12% organic growth, 400 basis points from Arena and approximately 60 basis points of currency impact. Regarding ARR linearity in fiscal '21. We've delivered consistent organic constant currency growth around the middle of our guidance range for three quarters and we continue to expect the growth rate to be consistent in Q4 as we close out fiscal '21. Free cash flow is still expected to be approximately $340 million for the full year, growth of approximately 60% year-over-year. Our $340 million free cash flow target also includes approximately $15 million of acquisition related fees, an additional $5 million of incremental interest we expect to pay this year due to the Arena related debt. Approximately $18 million of an unforecasted payment due to a foreign tax dispute and also includes approximately $15 million of restructuring payments. This is offset by incremental cash flow from Arena and free cash flow free cash flow is also net of approximately $25 million of capital expenditures.  As a reminder, collections are stronger in the first half offset by timing of expenses and headcount ramping throughout the year. And as you know, our bond interest payment will hit in the fourth quarter. So we've already delivered more than 90% of the free cash flow target for the year, which is in line with our expectations and has been. Now turning to the P&L guidance, we are raising revenue guidance and EPS guidance for the year. Our prior guidance for fiscal '21 was $1.710 to $1.740 billion a growth rate of 17% to 19%. We're now expecting fiscal '21 revenue of $1.73 3 billion to $1.763 billion a growth rate of 19% to 21%, which includes approximately 200 basis points from Arena and approximately 100 basis points from FX. We're increasing operating margin guidance both on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, a GAAP operating margin increases from 15% to 17%, now to 17% to 19% and non-GAAP operating margin increases from 31% to 32%, now to 32 to 33%. Non-GAAP EPS guidance previously was $3.18 to $3.39 and our revised guidance is now expected to be $3.35 to $3.60. That's growth of 30% to 40%. Turning to Slide 27, our total ARR growth which includes deferred ARR was 12% on an organic basis in Q3, and we expect organic active ARR growth of 10% to 12% and are now expecting approximately $95 million in deferred ARR for the full year, which is up from what we told you last quarter of around $90 million. Wrapping up, we had strong financial performance again in Q3, we delivered double digit ARR growth, while maintaining discipline on our expense structure. As we continue to navigate what still remains a somewhat unsteady macro environment. Year-to-date our performance has positioned as well to deliver attractive double digit top line growth and very strong free cash flow growth for the year.  So with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator and we can begin the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And your first question will come from Saket Kalia with Barclays.\nSaket Kalia: Hey, guys, good afternoon, and thanks for taking my questions here. I'll keep it to one maybe for you, Jim. Lots of fun stuff to talk about with the business this quarter. But maybe just to get it out of the way, I think we all saw some of the announcements by Rockwell and PTC inter quarter. So I was wondering if we could get maybe your perspective on how some of those changes maybe sort of impact the economic relationship between you two and how if at all it may be impacts long-term PTC's long-term strategy, in your view. Does that make sense?\nJames Heppelmann: Yes, sure. Well, the biggest piece of news, of course, was Rockwell acquiring Plex for $2.2 billion or so. So I would say first of all, everybody should know that Plex is 100% complimentary to PTC, we have never ever competed with Plex at all. And, in fact, new Plex is pretty well, because it's run by Bill Berutti, who's one of my better friends in life and reported to me for a dozen years or so. So, Plex is a great company. We know who they were, we kind of had decided that wasn't quite the right fit for us to acquire. But actually, we're pleased to see Rockwell acquire them. And I think there's actually some opportunity for synergies between what Plex does and what PTC does. You might almost think that Rockwell's adding Plex in a way from my perspective to the innovation suite we build together. So I don't see any conflict at all. I think Rockwell will be probably sharing some attention cycles with Plex that maybe had been previously committed to PTC, so we'll have to see how that plays out. But in general, Rockwell is an important partner, they won a Partner of the Year award after they acquired Plex. So I think that the partnership is important. It's sort of built into the business as we run it today, and I don't see anything dramatic changing there going forward. There was also a question somebody else asked me, is Rockwell going to sell their PTC shares? And I would say you probably should ask Rockwell, but certainly they have not suggested to us they're going to and I think their public announcement said they were going to fund the Plex acquisition with new debt and cash on hand.  So I don't think anything really changes in the relationship other than something new came in and on one hand, it's bringing new capabilities that might help us against competitors collectively, and on the other hand we'll have to share attention cycles with it. So that would be my thought there Saket.\nSaket Kalia: Got it, very helpful. I'll hop back in queue. Thanks, Jim.\nJames Heppelmann: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question will come from Matthew Broome with Mizuho.\nMatthew Broome: Hi Jim and Kristian. I guess just on that, that general theme. It'd be interesting to see how you sort of updated thoughts on M&A and in particular given recent market events on how you view the electrical CAD market as an adjacent opportunity? Clearly you did make an acquisition in that space itself last year.\nJames Heppelmann: Yeah, so you're probably referring to some activity between Autodesk and Altium, I'm guessing. So Altium is one of three main printed circuit board designers -- software companies. And then of course, there are other companies that provide integrated circuit software. The integrated circuit software really doesn't have a touch point with our world of CAD and PLM, but the printed circuit board design software does. We have a partnership with Altium. I'd like to find ways to strengthen that partnership, I don't really see us trying to acquire them. For one thing, we'd have to top Autodesk price which I don't know that we're in the mood to do. And then secondarily, I don't think they want to be acquired. So I feel like there's a good opportunity there for us to do more in the partnership, both on one hand with Onshape and Arena, which are a nice fit in the lower part of the market with Altium, but also with Creo and Windchill, which are also a nice fit. So there are many Creo and Windchill customers who put circuit boards in there, otherwise mechanical products. And the same would be true of Onshape and Arena. So there's lots to do there in terms of a partnership, I don't see us trying to acquire them in the near term, given the circumstances, as I know them, We did make a small eCAD acquisition of actually a company called ECAD MCAD. But it really was a very small VL and it really was at the interface of ECAD and MCAD, it was not ECAD capabilities, but it was the ability to import in real time synchronizes between an MCAD product, like Onshape and an ECAD product like Altium. So it's actually going to prove useful in some of the integration activities that we want to do.  But anyway, Altium is a good company, I'm perfectly happy if they remain standalone. And we PTC you know, look forward to strengthening our partnership, because there's lots of synergy on both sides of that partnership.\nMatthew Broome: Got it, makes sense. And then I can maybe just quickly ask about, general interest and demand for generative design with the new customer base. Have you seen this option within Creo and how close are we to seeing GD become an integral part of any sort of mainstream design process for cars, and planes and so on?\nJames Heppelmann: Yeah, I think there's a lot of companies exploring it, trying it out, doing what ifs and proofs of concept. And frankly, they get some pretty good results. But you know, it is a very different way of doing engineering, we always thought of computer aided design, but actually, the computer wasn't so much aiding the designer, it was just simply documenting the ideas. But this really is computer aided design, where the software is providing ideas to the engineer, as opposed to just capturing the engineer's ideas.  That's a different process that people wrap their head around, I'll follow AI around. But like I said, the results are pretty spectacular sometime. So there's definitely a lot of interest. I think it'll take a while to mainstream, but certainly, it's going to be a wave of growth in mechanical CAD over the next five years. I don't think it will come on super strong in the near term.\nMatthew Broome: Alright, perfect. Thanks very much.\nOperator: And your next question will come from Jason Celino with KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open.\nJason Celino: Hey, thanks for taking my question. Jim Onshape and Video in gray [ph] 40% growth, very impressive. AR business doing also quite well. But the growth segment did beat salary the bit to that 23% organic constant currency growth level. Is the overhang spill on IoT side, what gets that the turnaround?\nJames Heppelmann: Yeah, well, if you look at scale, Jason about 75% of that growth segment in terms of scale as IoT. IoT is a much bigger business because we started bit sooner and really had a lot of success with it. So, in a way, right now, as IoT goes, it has a big influence on the overall performance of the overall gross segment. So most of the slower growth was in IoT and most of it is still related to hangovers from COVID. So if we kind of look at what's happening on the sales front with IoT, I mean, sales have improved year-over-year, they're still not back to where we want them to be. But in general, what we're seeing is a good quantity of deals, but smaller deal sizes, which I just attribute really conservatism around people doing IoT projects in factories, and in general as they come back to speed following COVID. You might remember to that, we mentioned clearly at the beginning of the year that we had a 2 point headwind to growth, in our deferred, what we at the time called backlog, but deferred ARR was a 2 point headwind. Well, a lot of that headwind landed in IoT, because that's the place where our sales were softest, last year. So some of that is now coming home to roost.  Now it's not just what we sell in the quarter, but it's how much backlog did we also take advantage of maturing in the quarter, and that's another pressure that we'll work our way out of as we kind of round trip to COVID impacts of the back half of fiscal '20 and the front half of fiscal '21. Let's say mostly in fiscal '20.\nJason Celino: Okay, great, excellent. Thank you for the call. I'll get back in queue.\nOperator: And your next question will come from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Your line is open. \nAndrew Obin: Yes, good afternoon.\nJames Heppelmann: Hey Andrew. \nAndrew Obin: Hey, how are you, Jim, Kristian. Question about actually, question about Onshape. You sort of talked about more mature model and sort of approaching larger enterprise customers? Can you just talk about where we are in sort of, A, how larger enterprises and where are you in sort of transitioning this product towards your more core customer base away from small and medium businesses? And if I understood you correctly. Thank you.\nJames Heppelmann: Okay, Andrew, those are good questions. So first of all, when I use the term enterprise, I was using it as defined by the Onshape team, which generally means an account would take 15 seats or more. It's kind of a small definition of enterprise, for the rest of us at PTC, but that's their definition. So I would say the definition of enterprise used by Onshape is a medium size company, and the commercial business is small companies.  Now, I would tell you that it's just a different buying market. And our Creo software and our Windchill software for that matter, does not participate effectively in the market where Onshape and Arena are making hay right now. So it's all complimentary. And in fact, honestly, we're borrowing a page from the so strategy of 20 years ago when they had SolidWorks in the mid-market and CATIA and ENOVIA in high end of the market. And those two products prospered side by side for 20 some years until they both do a bit old retired.  But it's a strategy that works its market segmentation. And so I don't think that you're going to see Onshape and Arena, put a dent into Creo and Windchill because amongst other things, Creo and Windchill are adopting the SaaS technology called Atlas that makes Onshape so special. So when Onshape stealing larger accounts, it's basically by and large stealing them from SolidWorks. And then cherry picking a few others here and there, but they're starting to get some accounts whose brands you recognize, you might remember we had Garrett Turbo present at an investor day, I believe it was, that's a pretty large company who went from CATIA to Onshape. And really went for all the qualities of SaaS that they love. And of course ease of use and other things of Onshape.  So I think Onshape is an attractive product, it needs to mature more before it really could be a viable replacement for the high end products, generally speaking, but I think it'll start to pick of a lot of medium size accounts and an occasional larger account, who may be is over served by the more expensive, more complicated technology they're otherwise using. \nAndrew Obin: That's a great answer. Thanks so much. I'll get back in the queue.\nJames Heppelmann: Thanks. Operator? Operator are you muted?\nOperator: And your next question will come from Ken Wong with Guggenheim. Your line is open.\nKen Wong : Operator came back just in time. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to circle back on Rockwell real quick. I saw you guys mentioned that Rockwell became the largest IoT reseller. Just wondering, is that a new dynamic there? And as we think through some of the earlier discussion points you had with Saket's question, is that a position that you think kind of sustains going forward, kind of based on what we know?\nJames Heppelmann: Yeah, well Rockwell as a reseller has been growing and growing and growing, and most of that reselling is in the field of IoT and AR, let's be clear on that. And we have many other resellers, but they're largely in CAD and PLM. So Rockwell has become an important reseller for sure of IoT and AR, and I don't see that ending. When I talked to Blake, about how this fits in with his strategy even post Plex.  Blake says, Hey, I need an IoT platform, I need an AR platform, I even want to have a CAD and PLM platform available to me when required, because his competitor, Siemens has that stuff, but not all of IoT and AR, but some IoT and lots of CAD and PLM. So, we remain important to Blake and there's nothing he acquired in the Plex acquisition that supplants any of the capabilities that PTC brought up in the Factory Talk innovation suite.  So I think its Blake and Rockwell strategy, as I understand it, to add Plex to what they're already doing with PTC. And I don't have any issue with that whatsoever, because I think it's complimentary and like I said, maybe even some upside opportunities. I just noted that we're going to be sharing some mindshare with Rockwell, who now has kind of another child in the family let's say, that's going to need some attention too. So I don't think it's going to materially change our partnership.\nKen Wong: Got it. Thanks. Thanks for the insight there Jim.\nOperator: And your next question will come from Blair Abernethy with Rosenblatt Securities.\nBlair Abernethy : Thanks. Hi, guys, Jim, nice quarter guys. Just want to dig in a little more on Arena, and now that you've ordered for 7ish months. Well, how are you thinking about the go-to-market there for the team? And as vis-\u00e0-vis Onshapes pipeline. Are you working those two in parallel, are they coming together. What sort of your thoughts there as we kind of move through into next year?\nJames Heppelmann: Okay, great question. So first of all, we're very pleased with the performance of Arena, it has, in fact, accelerated since required. Now, there are several things we're doing that I feel like, aren't fully in the game yet. One of them is a link to Onshape. And in fact, we've built some technical integration between the two products, which is easy to do, because they're both SaaS base. And that technical integration is generated some rave reviews from customers.  And if you think about it, any customer who wants SaaS for PLM, they have the religion, and they really want SaaS for everything, including CAD, and vice versa. So we do think there'll be some cross selling there. That might that benefit might accrue more to Onshape in the near term, because Arena accounts tend to be a little bigger, like wanting to see CAD accounts, that might not need PLM. But arena accounts could generate a fair number of KNCs [ph] 15 or more.  So I think there'll be some benefit in both directions, it might help Onshape first, but then the thing we can really do for Arena is to globalize the sales force, because Arena really is a U.S. based business, a tiny bit of business in Europe, and essentially none in Asia other than sometimes an American company might have some users nature, but they're not Asian companies. So we PTC, of course, are much more globally balanced and we have the capabilities to help them kind of spread their operation around the world pretty quickly. And that's underway and as I mentioned, we opened the European and sales operation.  By the way, arena and Onshape both have basically inside sales go-to-market operations, they don't have sales reps, all over the place, you still need a European operation and the right time zones and all that but it's a cost effective go-to-market model, as opposed to kind of a PTC larger accounts where we have outside reps living in all the different countries around the world next to the customers and so forth. So I think we're going to be able to generate some acceleration for Arena to even higher levels next year. But we still need to plan all that out, but we certainly have something to work with.\nBlair Abernethy: Great, thank you.\nOperator: And your next question will come from Adam Borg with Stifel. Your line is open.\nAdam Borg: Great. And thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe just first on the IoT business, can you talk a little bit about there being a hangover? Just curious if you could comment a little bit more about the pipeline as you head into the important fourth quarter?\nJames Heppelmann: Well, I think if you look at any ARR scream at PPC, its growth rate is a function of bookings, churn, but also start dates, backlog, price increases, and so forth. And again, where IoT has been held back is kind of in deal sizes on new bookings. And in sort of a softer, what we used to call backline -- backlog now called deferred ARR. So, when we look though, at the pipeline, the forecast, I mean, we feel pretty confident and it looks pretty good. So I think we're going to end the year on a strong note, I certainly expect that based on the forecast on the pipeline. And I think we're in better position going forward in the next year. Bookings certainly are up year-over-year. Like I said, just not back to where we want them to and that's more deal size than transaction count.\nAdam Borg: Super helpful. And maybe just as a quick follow-up, you talked to in earlier question about replatforming efforts in Creo and Windchill and obviously it\u2019s the non-trivial undertaking. So just curious kind of how that going and what percent of your R&D efforts are really focused on replatforming today and how that should evolve? Thanks, again.\nJames Heppelmann: Yeah, well, this is not going to be a big bang approach, it\u2019s going to be kind of a systematic module by module approach, and then in the end, we'll have it all replatform. But if you look at what we did with the generative design extension, that's a good model to explain what we're trying to do. And that is, we want to be able to take key subsystems from Creo, Windchill in particular, and build them on Atlas, and deliver better value, more capabilities, better cost profile to customers through SaaS, and then take another module.  And so a customer might incrementally buy more and more SaaS from us over time and we envision this taking a few years. And then at some point, just flip the switch and see, I'll just take it all the SaaS. So again, don't think of it as Big Bang, think of it as incremental. Yes, it's a big development effort.  The good news is, we're not trying to invent the platform, we're replatforming onto, that platform has been under development for seven or eight years for the Onshape guys, that's Atlas, and it's a fantastic platform, I mean, really great. So I feel like time will tell but in the end that Onshape we're going to get a really great SaaS base CAD system, but we're actually probably going to get something even bigger, which is the singular platform that powers PTC's next generation of software that's going to breathe another decade or so of growth into our Creo and Windchill product lines.\nAdam Borg: Excellent. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital.\nMatthew Swanson: Great. Thanks, guys. This is Matt Swanson on for Matt. So Jim really appreciated the commentary around the secular tailwinds towards digital transformation. But when we're starting to think about your customers, as they're presumably returning to on-premise, you've seen any changes in conversations around SaaS more broadly, and I guess, thinking more about, like, what's driving your customers towards that, and especially from that enterprise segment, so that might not be a good fit for Arena or Onshape? What those customers are kind of doing right now as maybe a long-term plan as they watch what you're developing on Arena?\nJames Heppelmann: Yeah, Matt, well, there's an interesting -- it's a good question and the interesting survey we do, where we reach out to our Creo and Windchill customers and test their receptivity towards SaaS and that receptivity expanded dramatically over last year, I mean, like, from a minority to a very strong majority of them are saying, I want SaaS.  Now, if you think about it, Creo and Windchill are very sticky products. So they're saying like, I want SaaS, but I don't want to switch because switching CAD systems, especially when you're a big user of a high end CAD system, and you've got years and years' worth of data. I mean, that's a project. But if I could, within Creo go to SaaS, that'd be wonderful. If within Windchill I could go to SaaS, that'd be wonderful.  Now, why did they want to go to SaaS? Well, they realize first of all, a mobile workforce and everybody have some hybrid working office strategy going forward. The thing is if the software, if your CAD software, for example, runs on a big desktop computer in the office, well then how do you work from home? Do you set up another big desktop computer at home? And then how do you shuffle the files back and forth. I mean, it's just hard, it'd be better if all this data was never on the desktop, it was always in the cloud, same with the application.  So for example, during the COVID, initial shutdowns Windchill worked great, because Windchill is web based and the data actually is in some web server somewhere. So you just go home and you jump on whatever computer you have there, even a phone or tablet and you log into your web browser and you're doing Windchill stuff.  Creo and everything like a Creo in the market, it's a different story. That's a big what we'd call a fat client executable. Typically, with a whole bunch of modules installed, typically integrated to other software on that same computer, it might be simulation, might be cam software, whatever. So there's a whole ecosystem of software set up on that computer, how do you recreate that at home, it's hard. And there's licensing obstacles and whatnot.  So a lot of people did, is they used virtual desktop infrastructure that is from a computer at home, you logged into the computer at work, ran the software on the computer at work and pipe the user interface onto the computer at home. If you did that, it really makes for a pretty crappy workday. This is not really the way to do things like CAD, CAD is optimized for graphics performance and so forth. And all that optimizations completely lost when you're piping the display across the internet.  So you really want something that's designed to never put the data in and ideally, don't put the application on the desktop computer in the first place, because if it's not there, that means you can move around. So with Windchill you can move around, but people like to offload more of the cost. These are complex systems. So mobility is one thing they want, work from anywhere, anytime, work from the office, three days of work, a week work from home two days a week. But the second real thing is cost. They'd like to get rid of the system administrators, they'd like to get rid of the servers, file servers, there's a lot of costs tied up in that stuff. And they're saying, if you guys could just let me pay for the value I get for the software and not for an infrastructure and the care and feeding of it would be great.  A third thing we talked about is real time collaboration. Again, CAD systems are kind of based on the premise of check-in and check-out that means I'll take the file, lock it, so you can look at it, but you can't change it until I declare I'm done changing it. Well, there's a lot of IP in one file and a lot of times people are saying, well I cannot. Any other kind of software, I'm used to, we're working in the same stuff at the same time, how come I can't do that with CAD, again, you can with SaaS.  So I can go on, there are more qualities that are important to people. But let's just say what Creo and Windchill customers really want is all the benefits of Onshape and Arena without switching from Creo and Windchill. And that's what we're trying to bring to them.\nMatthew Swanson: Yes, that makes a ton of sense. It's a really compelling value proposition. If I can add one more on digital transformation. You mentioned PLM, as kind of part of that, of that growth group there. Can you talk a little bit about the progress and moving deeper into customers with PLM, kind of beyond those traditional use cases? It's something we've been talking about for a long time and I think it's always seemed really interesting?\nJames Heppelmann: Yes, I think what's really come into light, it always was true, but it's really much more appreciated now, is that PLM is the system of record for products. So PLM, in an industrial company, it's absolutely as important as your CRM system, which is the system of record for your customers, or your HR system for employees, or whatever.  So, when companies think I really want these processes to be digitized and mobile, you become mobile and global and in all that. You realize, we need a reliable source of product data that everybody in engineering, manufacturing, service, marketing, sales, whatever can transact against. So we need one single system and we all need access to it. And so we're starting to hear that more and more that it's not about making the engineer's more efficient, which was kind of the first generation of PLM. This is more about making sure that everybody across the company has access to the right product data, because everybody is making decisions about products, pricing them, selling them, supporting them, manufacturing them, and we need to have accurate data and it needs to be two clicks away.  And that's what PLM is, now being recognized as the system of record for products and industrial companies can't get very far down the journey of digital transformation without saying, hey, shouldn't we have a system of record for our products? I mean, honestly, they are product companies. So I think PLM is really emerging into something different. Quick example would be that maybe contract we won, it's about product support, it's about everybody supporting ships, having access to data of all ships in the systems they contain, support data.  And so we're using PLM concepts to support the operation of ship, not the engineering of manufacturing, but actually, the operation of ships that were engineered, manufactured years ago. And it's kind of a good example of digital transformation versus engineering productivity.\nMatthew Swanson: Thanks for the time, guys.\nJames Heppelmann: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Your line is open. \nJay Vleeschhouwer: Thank you. Good evening. Jim, at your partner conference last week, aside from the sessions on sales programs and plans and the like it was a very interesting roadmap session, which is the thing I want to ask about. It noted that as part of your Creo strategy, you have what was called five dimensions and for Onshape, six dimensions to the strategy plus various dimensions for the strategy for PLM of course.  The question I have about the Creo and Onshape strategies is that's a fairly good list of executables. So how do you think about the ones that are perhaps most important on those lists for you to achieve, or perhaps the most difficult to achieve, which aren't necessarily the same thing?  And then secondly, you referred to Microsoft a number of times, they're on the cusp of launching their manufacturing cloud. And I'm wondering how you're thinking about the opportunity for you in terms of drafting along with what they do with manufacturing cloud?\nJames Heppelmann: Okay, so first on the priorities, Jay, I don't have those lists in front of me, and I hate that off the top my head, try to represent them all back to everybody. But what you should think of is, there are large engineering teams behind these products. In the case of Creo, 400 plus people working on it. In the case of Onshape, not near that many, because it's smaller tighter product, yet younger product. But there's room with the level of resources we have in these products, to have four or five priorities, that's down from 20 or 30 that they would otherwise do, they're trying to narrow down and focus on the key ones.  So I think we have the capacity to execute four or five initiatives at a time in both of these products. We can't execute 10 or 20, but certainly four or five big ones. And I guess you were wearing your hat as a partner that day on that conference. But we're just trying to share with our partners where we're going what we think is important, and frankly where we think the money is. So that's what's going on there.  With respect to Microsoft and their manufacturing cloud. There's a lot of conversations going on between PTC and Microsoft about how to align PTC with that manufacturing cloud, they want us to, we want to, it's just a question now of figuring out what to do to make that happen. The fact that our former Chief Strategy Officer, Kathleen Mitford, just went over there is actually quite helpful, because Kathleen and I are quite close and we've had some conversations since she's gone over there. And she's now able to help me, let's say, coach me, and I'm building culture to make the company\u2019s better aligned together.  So there's a lot of good stuff happening with Microsoft, again, three Partner of the Year awards. I think the manufacturing cloud will be good for us. But there's some work to figure out, once they put it out there, how do we tightly align with it.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Thank you, Jim.\nOperator: And that is all for our question-and-answer session for today. I will now hand it back over to Emily Walt, for the closing comments.\nEmily Walt: Thanks Peter. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on the call today. We'll be participating in a number of virtual investor events this quarter and you can find all the details on our investor website. We look forward to seeing you on the circuit in the coming months. And again, thank you for your interest in PTC and have a great evening. \nJames Heppelmann: Thanks, everybody. \nKristian Talvitie: Thank you. Have a good day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kristian Talvitie",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our results I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance and most of the growth rate references will be in constant currency. So let me start off with a review of our third quarter results, and then we'll review guidance for fiscal '21.  Turning to Slide 23, fiscal Q3 ARR of $1.42 billion increased 15% year-over-year and on an organic basis ARR grew 11%. Q3 free cash flow of $85 million was solid and in line with our expectations. Q3 revenue of $436 million increased 24% year-over-year as reported, or 19% in constant currency.  Revenue performance was driven by strong execution, and also reflects the impact of ASC 606 on revenue recognition, as well as a modest contribution from Arena. The strong revenue growth along with continued financial discipline resulted in non-GAAP EPS growth of 34% year-over-year. Turning to page 24, I'll begin with the balance sheet. We ended Q3 with cash of $366 million and $1.5 billion of gross debt with an aggregate interest rate of about 3.1%. We paid down $30 million on our revolving credit facility during the quarter. With our leverage ratio, now less than three times which we told you as our goal, we expect to be in the market buying back shares in Q4. Now, turning to guidance, Slide 25 highlights a few of the key guidance assumptions and while our assumption on the impact of currency on ARR has changed from neutral to an approximately 60 basis point tailwind. The rest of our guidance assumptions remain the same as they have throughout the year. So putting our ARR guidance into perspective and turning to Slide 26. Last quarter, we told you that we expected fiscal '21 ARR to be 1.45 to 1.47 billion, a growth rate of 14% to 16%. This assumes 10% to 12% organic growth, 400 basis points from Arena and no FX impact. Our revised guidance range is now $1.45 billion to $1.47 billion, which is still 14% to 16% growth, and assumes 10% to 12% organic growth, 400 basis points from Arena and approximately 60 basis points of currency impact. Regarding ARR linearity in fiscal '21. We've delivered consistent organic constant currency growth around the middle of our guidance range for three quarters and we continue to expect the growth rate to be consistent in Q4 as we close out fiscal '21. Free cash flow is still expected to be approximately $340 million for the full year, growth of approximately 60% year-over-year. Our $340 million free cash flow target also includes approximately $15 million of acquisition related fees, an additional $5 million of incremental interest we expect to pay this year due to the Arena related debt. Approximately $18 million of an unforecasted payment due to a foreign tax dispute and also includes approximately $15 million of restructuring payments. This is offset by incremental cash flow from Arena and free cash flow free cash flow is also net of approximately $25 million of capital expenditures.  As a reminder, collections are stronger in the first half offset by timing of expenses and headcount ramping throughout the year. And as you know, our bond interest payment will hit in the fourth quarter. So we've already delivered more than 90% of the free cash flow target for the year, which is in line with our expectations and has been. Now turning to the P&L guidance, we are raising revenue guidance and EPS guidance for the year. Our prior guidance for fiscal '21 was $1.710 to $1.740 billion a growth rate of 17% to 19%. We're now expecting fiscal '21 revenue of $1.73 3 billion to $1.763 billion a growth rate of 19% to 21%, which includes approximately 200 basis points from Arena and approximately 100 basis points from FX. We're increasing operating margin guidance both on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, a GAAP operating margin increases from 15% to 17%, now to 17% to 19% and non-GAAP operating margin increases from 31% to 32%, now to 32 to 33%. Non-GAAP EPS guidance previously was $3.18 to $3.39 and our revised guidance is now expected to be $3.35 to $3.60. That's growth of 30% to 40%. Turning to Slide 27, our total ARR growth which includes deferred ARR was 12% on an organic basis in Q3, and we expect organic active ARR growth of 10% to 12% and are now expecting approximately $95 million in deferred ARR for the full year, which is up from what we told you last quarter of around $90 million. Wrapping up, we had strong financial performance again in Q3, we delivered double digit ARR growth, while maintaining discipline on our expense structure. As we continue to navigate what still remains a somewhat unsteady macro environment. Year-to-date our performance has positioned as well to deliver attractive double digit top line growth and very strong free cash flow growth for the year.  So with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator and we can begin the Q&A. Thank you. Have a good day."

            "name": "James Heppelmann",
            "content": "Thanks, Emily. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. I hope you and your families are well during these continued uncertain times. I'm pleased to share that PTC has welcomed many of our vaccinated employees back to our offices where requirements allow and we look forward to the day when we can do this on a global scale. Meanwhile, we're monitoring the growing concern with the Delta variant of the virus and hoping this new development doesn't lead to another round of business lockdowns. Before I dive into the quarter, I want to share some important news on the Investor Relations front. Emily is been doing a great job holding down the fort since Tim Fox left. But keeping up with IR demands is a big job and Emily was happy to hear that reinforcements are on the way. I'm pleased to announce the hiring of Matt Shamal [ph] as our new Senior VP of Investor Relations. Matt came to us as a recommendation from one of our largest investors and he came out on top following a thorough search process. Matt comes to us with a finance background in several successful stints on both the corporate side and the sell side of investor relations. He's a strategic thinker, and we're excited to bring him on Board. Turning to Slide four, with three quarters behind us, our guidance for FY '21 has us right on track to deliver mid-teens ARR growth and $340 million of free cash flow this year. That would be a fourth consecutive year of double digit top line ARR growth. And I anticipate we'll be discussing a fifth consecutive year of double digit ARR growth when we guide fiscal '22 in 90 days or so. While the stronger PMI numbers that we're seeing, can only be helpful. I'm pleased to see that PTC is earning a reputation as a company that can consistently perform at high levels in good times and in bad.  In preparing for this call, I thought back to where we were a year ago. With shutdown orders in place, empty offices and factories, and schools contemplating how to educate from home. Against that chaotic backdrop, I'm very pleased with the results that PTC has been able to deliver right through the pandemic.  Some years back in the days when our portfolio was narrower and sold in a perpetual model, our business was much more cyclical. But consistent, reliable performance is always what we strive for and we did the difficult work to earn that. The type of steady organic top line growth performance you see from PTC hasn't been the rule in our peer group, especially among our most direct CAD and PLM competitors. I attribute our superior performance to a better business model, to tremendous strength across our entire portfolio, and to growth drivers that are now more secular than cyclical. In terms of growth drivers, PTC is well positioned for the future. The new logo success of our Onshape and arena businesses demonstrates the growing demand for SAS technologies. We see PLM joining IoT and augmented reality is key digital transformation technologies for industrial companies and years of market outgrowth in the CAD business space to the innovation we've reignited there. Turning now to Slide five so we can get into the Q3 details. PTC delivered another strong performance in top line ARR and bottom line free cash flow in the third quarter. Bookings grew in the mid-30s, a strong rebound in comparison to a year ago when bookings declined. In the top line category, we had a very solid quarter, with ARR growth of 18% or 15% in constant currency to $1.42 billion. Growth was driven by solid performance in our growth businesses, continued momentum in our core business, where we again outpaced market growth, and by a solid contribution from Arena Solutions. On an organic basis ARR grew 14% or 11% in constant currency in Q3, in line with our guidance. To close out the top line category, revenue growth of 24% as reported was driven by strong execution, aided by the impact of ASC 606 revenue recognition policies, plus of course, the Arena contribution. Switching to the bottom line category, we delivered strong free cash flow of $85 million and non-GAAP EPS growth of 34%, reflecting a combination of strong top line results, combined with continued operating expense discipline, even while we also invest for growth. We continue to feel confident about our FY '21 target of $340 million in free cash flow. Moving to Slide six, digital transformation remains our main secular driver of growth. You may remember last quarter I shared our new tagline, digital transforms physical. These three words are captured in our logo, and embody how PTC thinks about our long-term strategy. PTC is a digital company, but our customers do business in the physical world, making physical products in physical factories, and servicing those products at physical customer sites.  In my live works keynote in June, and again at our global partner summit in July, I outlined the power of PTC's unique digital transformation story that has one foot in the digital world and one foot in the physical world. We tell customers that our digital transforms your physical, and by that we mean we help customers use digital to define, manage, connect and augment physical products. Our portfolio is already transformative. But now with SaaS PTC is at the very forefront of thinking about how customers will use digital to disrupt physical in terms of taking an entirely different approach across the hardware, software and system administration of their IT systems. SaaS is surely coming to our market, as it has so many other B2B software markets and PTC has carved out an enviable leadership position. We now have the most to gain from this disruptive force. With that as context, let's take a look at the respective contributions of the FSG, core and growth segments of our portfolio. Moving to Slide seven, you'll see that ARR in our Focused Solution Group showed growth of 4% or 1% constant currency, which aligns with that growth expectations for this segment. ARR growth for our core business was 14% or 11% at constant currency. Our growth segment saw 60% ARR growth with 23% organic constant currency growth, reflecting on one hand, some lingering hangover from COVID but counterbalanced by solid performances from our Onshape AR and Arena SaaS Solutions. Let's go a click deeper into the main elements of our large core and growth segments. Turning to Slide eight, our CAD team delivered another impressive quarter with ARR growth in the low double digits, reflecting growth across all geos and an improving demand environment. The additional features and functionalities that Creo 7 delivers, including Creo simulation live and Creo Ansys Simulation, continue to demonstrate the power and differentiation of Creo.  In addition, last quarter, we announced Creo 8, which includes the generative design extension module called GTX, which is based on our Atlas SaaS platform. While it's still early days for Creo leveraging Atlas, this module is a great example of how PTC plans to deliver innovative SaaS based capabilities as we systematically transition our core products to SaaS. On Slide nine, a great example of how CAD, generative design and real time simulation, making enormous impact can be found at HPE COXA, a provider of products engineering solutions, and technology projects for the performance automotive and motorsports sectors. The company designs and manufactures car components, and complete systems for some of the highest profile super premium sports car our brands around the globe. Inefficiencies in a multi-step, multi software approach to design were causing miscommunication between design and analysts teams, which delayed production times and cause customer satisfaction risks. By adopting fully integrated and streamlined generative simulation and additive technology workflows in Creo, HPE COXA simplified the design sequencing, reduced overall design and production time and improved design agility and time to market. Moving on to Slide 10, in our PLM business, you'll see that PLM continued to deliver very strong performance with another mid-teens ARR growth quarter. From a geographic perspective in Q3, we saw broad based strength across all our geos and in our customer base, with a solid quarter in the reseller channel. And we saw increased demand for PLM through the Microsoft alliance. Another proof point suggesting more customers are understanding the critical role that PLM plays in their digital transformation initiatives. Incidentally, during the quarter, we won three more Partner of the Year awards from Microsoft. On Slide 11 we profile a win with Cellcentric, a Daimler truck and Volvo joint venture, which helps hydrogen fuel cells or which develops hydrogen fuel cell systems and believes that PTC's PLM solution is best-in-class. As the deadline of becoming an independent entity loomed on the horizon, Cellcentric knew they needed a PLM backbone in place quickly. PTC delivered our cloud-based Windchill offering, establishing a best-in-class application landscape for PLM in a great competitive displacement. Moving on to our growth businesses, I'll begin with IoT on Slide 12. IoT delivered high-teens year-over-year ARR growth driven by strength in Europe and APAC. Rockwell was the largest reseller of IoT in the quarter. On Slide 13, we discussed how Eaton, a multinational power management company, saw the need to deploy a digital transformation strategy across their enterprise. Our factory insights as a service, IoT application helped to deliver quick wins, forming a digital foundation upon which they can easily add more use cases. Eaton was able to realize multiple improvements including improved OEE, reduction in unscheduled maintenance, reduction in manual efforts, and 100% worker compliance with SOPs. Let me shift to our augmented reality business on Slide 14, The Vuforia augmented reality team again delivered strong results in Q3, with ARR growing across all geos. We saw improving retention and expansion rates, and the opportunity to cross sell into the larger PTC portfolio is gaining momentum. This quarter we also announced the new ARR product, Vuforia Instruct, a unique Atlas based SaaS solution designed to enable enterprises to leverage 3D CAD data to deliver -- create, deliver and scale interactive AR work instructions to optimize inspection procedures. When you consider that two-thirds of manufacturers are still using paper based inspection processes, you can appreciate how Instruct delivers considerable value to our customers. Vuforia resonates with the customers we engaged through our alliance with Microsoft and one of the awards we won this quarter was Partner of the Year in mix reality. On Slide 15, you'll see an innovative example of the use of augmented reality that come from Stannah, a UK company dedicated to the design, production and service of residential and commercial stairlifts. Stairlifts are customized systems configured for and installed in the consumers' home to help those with difficulty navigating stairs, for example, to move from the first floor living room to the second floor bedroom. Stannah leveraged Vuforia to create an AR application that allows customers to see how a customized 3D hologram chairlift could fit in work in their homes.  With COVID, limiting the amount of face to face interaction by sales and service teams, Vuforia enabled a customer centric tool that could be used by sellers during the sales cycle, to help potential buyers visualize a residential stairlift in their home. Stannah saw increased purchase confidence, improved differentiation against competitors and shorter sales cycles through improved customer communication. Turning now to Slide 16, Onshape delivered a very strong quarter, with ARR growth of 40% year-over-year. We had a very strong bookings quarter in the Onshape core commercial business with larger deal sizes and stronger renewals, thanks to a maturing product. Onshape continues to gain share in the education market tool, as schools and students turn to SaaS based solutions for mobility and ease of everything.  Looking ahead to Q4 we see a strong pipeline for both the commercial and larger account enterprise business. Turning to Slide 17, is fun highlighting customer stories especially when that customer is solving a problem through innovation. Delta development in R&D companies specializing in military applications for cooling and heating systems in extreme environments was contracted to design and manufacture and autonomous portable refrigeration unit for deployment by medics on the battlefield. The company was seeking to reduce its IT overhead, which had been taking up 20% of the engineering team's product design time.  By moving from an on premise CAD system that took a lot of care and feeding to Onshape, the time loss associated with software installations, licensing and regular system upgrades was eliminated. They both reclaimed the 20% of their design capacity, and at the same time enabled real time collaboration on 3D designs across a distributed team environment. Moving to Arena on Slide 18. Arena continues its growth trajectory, delivering ARR growth of over 20%. Arena seeing strong traction with upselling as they increase penetration in the current customer environments, and keep retention rates high. By all measures Arena looks to be a great acquisition. I'm also pleased to note that we opened our first European Arena sales operation during the quarter. Turning to Slide 19 NEXTracker, a flex company is one of the fastest growing cleantech companies in solar, offering next generation solar power plants with smart solar trackers and energy storage solutions. The company lacked a single source to track and manage its engineering design and development processes. They needed a better way to manage product information across distributed teams to enable automated approvals and to improve tracking and accountability.  With Arena, NEXTracker was able to reduce review and approval times by nearly 60%. Eliminate time zone delays with global partners and accelerate product introductions by 25%. Arena has helped NEXTrackers significantly improve the way they design and get products to market. Naturally, I'm pleased that PTC has been able to complement the strong performance of Creo and Windchill in the traditional market, with breakout performance from Onshape and Arena in the burgeoning SAS market of tomorrow. The success we're having with Onshape and Arena in the small and mid-market is 100% complimentary to Creo and Windchill success in larger companies. Geographic performance was strong on a global basis. And as shown on Slide 20, reflecting the performance trends we've seen year-to-date, America's ARR growth of 21% was driven by solid core performance and Arena. Europe ARR grew 9% consistent with several prior quarters, with strength in CAD, PLM and improving growth in IoT, as we work toward full recovery from COVID there. APAC delivered the fourth quarter in a row of mid-teens ARR growth with strong performance in core and growth businesses. Summarizing the state of the business, on Slide 21. We're pleased with the general good health of PTC across all of its different dimensions and moving parts and we look forward to wrapping up a great year of ARR and free cash flow growth here in FY '21.  With that, I'll turn it over to Kristian to take you through more details on the financial results and guidance. Yes, sure. Well, the biggest piece of news, of course, was Rockwell acquiring Plex for $2.2 billion or so. So I would say first of all, everybody should know that Plex is 100% complimentary to PTC, we have never ever competed with Plex at all. And, in fact, new Plex is pretty well, because it's run by Bill Berutti, who's one of my better friends in life and reported to me for a dozen years or so. So, Plex is a great company. We know who they were, we kind of had decided that wasn't quite the right fit for us to acquire. But actually, we're pleased to see Rockwell acquire them. And I think there's actually some opportunity for synergies between what Plex does and what PTC does. You might almost think that Rockwell's adding Plex in a way from my perspective to the innovation suite we build together. So I don't see any conflict at all. I think Rockwell will be probably sharing some attention cycles with Plex that maybe had been previously committed to PTC, so we'll have to see how that plays out. But in general, Rockwell is an important partner, they won a Partner of the Year award after they acquired Plex. So I think that the partnership is important. It's sort of built into the business as we run it today, and I don't see anything dramatic changing there going forward. There was also a question somebody else asked me, is Rockwell going to sell their PTC shares? And I would say you probably should ask Rockwell, but certainly they have not suggested to us they're going to and I think their public announcement said they were going to fund the Plex acquisition with new debt and cash on hand.  So I don't think anything really changes in the relationship other than something new came in and on one hand, it's bringing new capabilities that might help us against competitors collectively, and on the other hand we'll have to share attention cycles with it. So that would be my thought there Saket. Thank you. Yeah, so you're probably referring to some activity between Autodesk and Altium, I'm guessing. So Altium is one of three main printed circuit board designers -- software companies. And then of course, there are other companies that provide integrated circuit software. The integrated circuit software really doesn't have a touch point with our world of CAD and PLM, but the printed circuit board design software does. We have a partnership with Altium. I'd like to find ways to strengthen that partnership, I don't really see us trying to acquire them. For one thing, we'd have to top Autodesk price which I don't know that we're in the mood to do. And then secondarily, I don't think they want to be acquired. So I feel like there's a good opportunity there for us to do more in the partnership, both on one hand with Onshape and Arena, which are a nice fit in the lower part of the market with Altium, but also with Creo and Windchill, which are also a nice fit. So there are many Creo and Windchill customers who put circuit boards in there, otherwise mechanical products. And the same would be true of Onshape and Arena. So there's lots to do there in terms of a partnership, I don't see us trying to acquire them in the near term, given the circumstances, as I know them, We did make a small eCAD acquisition of actually a company called ECAD MCAD. But it really was a very small VL and it really was at the interface of ECAD and MCAD, it was not ECAD capabilities, but it was the ability to import in real time synchronizes between an MCAD product, like Onshape and an ECAD product like Altium. So it's actually going to prove useful in some of the integration activities that we want to do.  But anyway, Altium is a good company, I'm perfectly happy if they remain standalone. And we PTC you know, look forward to strengthening our partnership, because there's lots of synergy on both sides of that partnership. Yeah, I think there's a lot of companies exploring it, trying it out, doing what ifs and proofs of concept. And frankly, they get some pretty good results. But you know, it is a very different way of doing engineering, we always thought of computer aided design, but actually, the computer wasn't so much aiding the designer, it was just simply documenting the ideas. But this really is computer aided design, where the software is providing ideas to the engineer, as opposed to just capturing the engineer's ideas.  That's a different process that people wrap their head around, I'll follow AI around. But like I said, the results are pretty spectacular sometime. So there's definitely a lot of interest. I think it'll take a while to mainstream, but certainly, it's going to be a wave of growth in mechanical CAD over the next five years. I don't think it will come on super strong in the near term. Yeah, well, if you look at scale, Jason about 75% of that growth segment in terms of scale as IoT. IoT is a much bigger business because we started bit sooner and really had a lot of success with it. So, in a way, right now, as IoT goes, it has a big influence on the overall performance of the overall gross segment. So most of the slower growth was in IoT and most of it is still related to hangovers from COVID. So if we kind of look at what's happening on the sales front with IoT, I mean, sales have improved year-over-year, they're still not back to where we want them to be. But in general, what we're seeing is a good quantity of deals, but smaller deal sizes, which I just attribute really conservatism around people doing IoT projects in factories, and in general as they come back to speed following COVID. You might remember to that, we mentioned clearly at the beginning of the year that we had a 2 point headwind to growth, in our deferred, what we at the time called backlog, but deferred ARR was a 2 point headwind. Well, a lot of that headwind landed in IoT, because that's the place where our sales were softest, last year. So some of that is now coming home to roost.  Now it's not just what we sell in the quarter, but it's how much backlog did we also take advantage of maturing in the quarter, and that's another pressure that we'll work our way out of as we kind of round trip to COVID impacts of the back half of fiscal '20 and the front half of fiscal '21. Let's say mostly in fiscal '20. Hey Andrew. Okay, Andrew, those are good questions. So first of all, when I use the term enterprise, I was using it as defined by the Onshape team, which generally means an account would take 15 seats or more. It's kind of a small definition of enterprise, for the rest of us at PTC, but that's their definition. So I would say the definition of enterprise used by Onshape is a medium size company, and the commercial business is small companies.  Now, I would tell you that it's just a different buying market. And our Creo software and our Windchill software for that matter, does not participate effectively in the market where Onshape and Arena are making hay right now. So it's all complimentary. And in fact, honestly, we're borrowing a page from the so strategy of 20 years ago when they had SolidWorks in the mid-market and CATIA and ENOVIA in high end of the market. And those two products prospered side by side for 20 some years until they both do a bit old retired.  But it's a strategy that works its market segmentation. And so I don't think that you're going to see Onshape and Arena, put a dent into Creo and Windchill because amongst other things, Creo and Windchill are adopting the SaaS technology called Atlas that makes Onshape so special. So when Onshape stealing larger accounts, it's basically by and large stealing them from SolidWorks. And then cherry picking a few others here and there, but they're starting to get some accounts whose brands you recognize, you might remember we had Garrett Turbo present at an investor day, I believe it was, that's a pretty large company who went from CATIA to Onshape. And really went for all the qualities of SaaS that they love. And of course ease of use and other things of Onshape.  So I think Onshape is an attractive product, it needs to mature more before it really could be a viable replacement for the high end products, generally speaking, but I think it'll start to pick of a lot of medium size accounts and an occasional larger account, who may be is over served by the more expensive, more complicated technology they're otherwise using. Thanks. Operator? Operator are you muted? Yeah, well Rockwell as a reseller has been growing and growing and growing, and most of that reselling is in the field of IoT and AR, let's be clear on that. And we have many other resellers, but they're largely in CAD and PLM. So Rockwell has become an important reseller for sure of IoT and AR, and I don't see that ending. When I talked to Blake, about how this fits in with his strategy even post Plex.  Blake says, Hey, I need an IoT platform, I need an AR platform, I even want to have a CAD and PLM platform available to me when required, because his competitor, Siemens has that stuff, but not all of IoT and AR, but some IoT and lots of CAD and PLM. So, we remain important to Blake and there's nothing he acquired in the Plex acquisition that supplants any of the capabilities that PTC brought up in the Factory Talk innovation suite.  So I think its Blake and Rockwell strategy, as I understand it, to add Plex to what they're already doing with PTC. And I don't have any issue with that whatsoever, because I think it's complimentary and like I said, maybe even some upside opportunities. I just noted that we're going to be sharing some mindshare with Rockwell, who now has kind of another child in the family let's say, that's going to need some attention too. So I don't think it's going to materially change our partnership. Okay, great question. So first of all, we're very pleased with the performance of Arena, it has, in fact, accelerated since required. Now, there are several things we're doing that I feel like, aren't fully in the game yet. One of them is a link to Onshape. And in fact, we've built some technical integration between the two products, which is easy to do, because they're both SaaS base. And that technical integration is generated some rave reviews from customers.  And if you think about it, any customer who wants SaaS for PLM, they have the religion, and they really want SaaS for everything, including CAD, and vice versa. So we do think there'll be some cross selling there. That might that benefit might accrue more to Onshape in the near term, because Arena accounts tend to be a little bigger, like wanting to see CAD accounts, that might not need PLM. But arena accounts could generate a fair number of KNCs [ph] 15 or more.  So I think there'll be some benefit in both directions, it might help Onshape first, but then the thing we can really do for Arena is to globalize the sales force, because Arena really is a U.S. based business, a tiny bit of business in Europe, and essentially none in Asia other than sometimes an American company might have some users nature, but they're not Asian companies. So we PTC, of course, are much more globally balanced and we have the capabilities to help them kind of spread their operation around the world pretty quickly. And that's underway and as I mentioned, we opened the European and sales operation.  By the way, arena and Onshape both have basically inside sales go-to-market operations, they don't have sales reps, all over the place, you still need a European operation and the right time zones and all that but it's a cost effective go-to-market model, as opposed to kind of a PTC larger accounts where we have outside reps living in all the different countries around the world next to the customers and so forth. So I think we're going to be able to generate some acceleration for Arena to even higher levels next year. But we still need to plan all that out, but we certainly have something to work with. Well, I think if you look at any ARR scream at PPC, its growth rate is a function of bookings, churn, but also start dates, backlog, price increases, and so forth. And again, where IoT has been held back is kind of in deal sizes on new bookings. And in sort of a softer, what we used to call backline -- backlog now called deferred ARR. So, when we look though, at the pipeline, the forecast, I mean, we feel pretty confident and it looks pretty good. So I think we're going to end the year on a strong note, I certainly expect that based on the forecast on the pipeline. And I think we're in better position going forward in the next year. Bookings certainly are up year-over-year. Like I said, just not back to where we want them to and that's more deal size than transaction count. Yeah, well, this is not going to be a big bang approach, it's going to be kind of a systematic module by module approach, and then in the end, we'll have it all replatform. But if you look at what we did with the generative design extension, that's a good model to explain what we're trying to do. And that is, we want to be able to take key subsystems from Creo, Windchill in particular, and build them on Atlas, and deliver better value, more capabilities, better cost profile to customers through SaaS, and then take another module.  And so a customer might incrementally buy more and more SaaS from us over time and we envision this taking a few years. And then at some point, just flip the switch and see, I'll just take it all the SaaS. So again, don't think of it as Big Bang, think of it as incremental. Yes, it's a big development effort.  The good news is, we're not trying to invent the platform, we're replatforming onto, that platform has been under development for seven or eight years for the Onshape guys, that's Atlas, and it's a fantastic platform, I mean, really great. So I feel like time will tell but in the end that Onshape we're going to get a really great SaaS base CAD system, but we're actually probably going to get something even bigger, which is the singular platform that powers PTC's next generation of software that's going to breathe another decade or so of growth into our Creo and Windchill product lines. Yeah, Matt, well, there's an interesting -- it's a good question and the interesting survey we do, where we reach out to our Creo and Windchill customers and test their receptivity towards SaaS and that receptivity expanded dramatically over last year, I mean, like, from a minority to a very strong majority of them are saying, I want SaaS.  Now, if you think about it, Creo and Windchill are very sticky products. So they're saying like, I want SaaS, but I don't want to switch because switching CAD systems, especially when you're a big user of a high end CAD system, and you've got years and years' worth of data. I mean, that's a project. But if I could, within Creo go to SaaS, that'd be wonderful. If within Windchill I could go to SaaS, that'd be wonderful.  Now, why did they want to go to SaaS? Well, they realize first of all, a mobile workforce and everybody have some hybrid working office strategy going forward. The thing is if the software, if your CAD software, for example, runs on a big desktop computer in the office, well then how do you work from home? Do you set up another big desktop computer at home? And then how do you shuffle the files back and forth. I mean, it's just hard, it'd be better if all this data was never on the desktop, it was always in the cloud, same with the application.  So for example, during the COVID, initial shutdowns Windchill worked great, because Windchill is web based and the data actually is in some web server somewhere. So you just go home and you jump on whatever computer you have there, even a phone or tablet and you log into your web browser and you're doing Windchill stuff.  Creo and everything like a Creo in the market, it's a different story. That's a big what we'd call a fat client executable. Typically, with a whole bunch of modules installed, typically integrated to other software on that same computer, it might be simulation, might be cam software, whatever. So there's a whole ecosystem of software set up on that computer, how do you recreate that at home, it's hard. And there's licensing obstacles and whatnot.  So a lot of people did, is they used virtual desktop infrastructure that is from a computer at home, you logged into the computer at work, ran the software on the computer at work and pipe the user interface onto the computer at home. If you did that, it really makes for a pretty crappy workday. This is not really the way to do things like CAD, CAD is optimized for graphics performance and so forth. And all that optimizations completely lost when you're piping the display across the internet.  So you really want something that's designed to never put the data in and ideally, don't put the application on the desktop computer in the first place, because if it's not there, that means you can move around. So with Windchill you can move around, but people like to offload more of the cost. These are complex systems. So mobility is one thing they want, work from anywhere, anytime, work from the office, three days of work, a week work from home two days a week. But the second real thing is cost. They'd like to get rid of the system administrators, they'd like to get rid of the servers, file servers, there's a lot of costs tied up in that stuff. And they're saying, if you guys could just let me pay for the value I get for the software and not for an infrastructure and the care and feeding of it would be great.  A third thing we talked about is real time collaboration. Again, CAD systems are kind of based on the premise of check-in and check-out that means I'll take the file, lock it, so you can look at it, but you can't change it until I declare I'm done changing it. Well, there's a lot of IP in one file and a lot of times people are saying, well I cannot. Any other kind of software, I'm used to, we're working in the same stuff at the same time, how come I can't do that with CAD, again, you can with SaaS.  So I can go on, there are more qualities that are important to people. But let's just say what Creo and Windchill customers really want is all the benefits of Onshape and Arena without switching from Creo and Windchill. And that's what we're trying to bring to them. Yes, I think what's really come into light, it always was true, but it's really much more appreciated now, is that PLM is the system of record for products. So PLM, in an industrial company, it's absolutely as important as your CRM system, which is the system of record for your customers, or your HR system for employees, or whatever.  So, when companies think I really want these processes to be digitized and mobile, you become mobile and global and in all that. You realize, we need a reliable source of product data that everybody in engineering, manufacturing, service, marketing, sales, whatever can transact against. So we need one single system and we all need access to it. And so we're starting to hear that more and more that it's not about making the engineer's more efficient, which was kind of the first generation of PLM. This is more about making sure that everybody across the company has access to the right product data, because everybody is making decisions about products, pricing them, selling them, supporting them, manufacturing them, and we need to have accurate data and it needs to be two clicks away.  And that's what PLM is, now being recognized as the system of record for products and industrial companies can't get very far down the journey of digital transformation without saying, hey, shouldn't we have a system of record for our products? I mean, honestly, they are product companies. So I think PLM is really emerging into something different. Quick example would be that maybe contract we won, it's about product support, it's about everybody supporting ships, having access to data of all ships in the systems they contain, support data.  And so we're using PLM concepts to support the operation of ship, not the engineering of manufacturing, but actually, the operation of ships that were engineered, manufactured years ago. And it's kind of a good example of digital transformation versus engineering productivity. Thank you. Okay, so first on the priorities, Jay, I don't have those lists in front of me, and I hate that off the top my head, try to represent them all back to everybody. But what you should think of is, there are large engineering teams behind these products. In the case of Creo, 400 plus people working on it. In the case of Onshape, not near that many, because it's smaller tighter product, yet younger product. But there's room with the level of resources we have in these products, to have four or five priorities, that's down from 20 or 30 that they would otherwise do, they're trying to narrow down and focus on the key ones.  So I think we have the capacity to execute four or five initiatives at a time in both of these products. We can't execute 10 or 20, but certainly four or five big ones. And I guess you were wearing your hat as a partner that day on that conference. But we're just trying to share with our partners where we're going what we think is important, and frankly where we think the money is. So that's what's going on there.  With respect to Microsoft and their manufacturing cloud. There's a lot of conversations going on between PTC and Microsoft about how to align PTC with that manufacturing cloud, they want us to, we want to, it's just a question now of figuring out what to do to make that happen. The fact that our former Chief Strategy Officer, Kathleen Mitford, just went over there is actually quite helpful, because Kathleen and I are quite close and we've had some conversations since she's gone over there. And she's now able to help me, let's say, coach me, and I'm building culture to make the company's better aligned together.  So there's a lot of good stuff happening with Microsoft, again, three Partner of the Year awards. I think the manufacturing cloud will be good for us. But there's some work to figure out, once they put it out there, how do we tightly align with it. Thanks, everybody."

Turning to Slide 4. I'm pleased to share that we delivered another strong performance in the second quarter. Bookings grew in the mid-30s as compared to a Q2 period from a year ago when bookings declined 15% as the pandemic set in.  Organic bookings grew in the mid-20s. While much of the bookings strength contributed to the second quarter's performance, some of the bookings have start dates in later periods, and therefore went into backlog or what we will call deferred ARR going forward. I'm pleased to see that with several consecutive strong bookings quarters, deferred ARR has returned to pre-COVID levels as customers continue to make commitments to invest in their digital transformation initiatives over the long term. This deferred ARR gives PTC a foundation for growth going forward.  The economic environment across the globe continues to improve with PMI numbers returning to or exceeding pre-COVID levels in many regions. This data, coupled with the steady increase of vaccinations and stimulus plans from the current administration is encouraging. From our perspective, demand we see for our core products and SaaS offerings, combined with a strong pipeline heading into the second half of 2021, supports our outlook for the year. In the top line category, we had a very solid quarter with ARR growth of 18% or 15% in constant currency to $1.39 billion. Growth was driven by a combination of our growth business, which delivered strong results by continued momentum in our core business, where we again outpaced market growth and by strong performance from Arena Solutions in its first quarter being part of PTC.  On an organic and constant currency basis, we had 11% ARR growth in Q2 of '21, in line with our guidance. If you flip to Slide 5 for a minute, I'd like to remind you that when we use the term ARR, we are referring to the annualized run rate of the book of recurring revenue contracts that are currently active.  So ARR really means active ARR, and this important metric is what drives our cash flow. On top of that, we have the deferred ARR I mentioned earlier. Given the strong bookings we've had over the past 3 quarters, our total ARR growth, which includes deferred ARR, is up 12% on a constant currency organic basis in Q2.  As you know, timing of start dates, and the nature of ramp deals can impact when a booking moves into active ARR. Therefore, we feel it's important to look at total ARR, again the sum of active ARR plus deferred ARR. We've been guiding active ARR growth of 10% to 12%. And on top of that, we have been expecting approximately $80 million in deferred ARR as we exit fiscal 2021. We're now projecting more than $90 million in deferred ARR for the full year, which is because bookings in the first half of 2021 have been stronger than what you've seen reported in our reported active ARR results.  Given the uncertainty around start dates and the magnitude of ramp deals, if a higher mix of our bookings were to flow into deferred ARR rather than active ARR in future quarters, it could put some pressure on active ARR even while total ARR would remain constant. And of course, it could go the other way too with a mix that benefits active ARR.  We think that by providing more insight into total ARR growth rate, we can help show the true underlying performance of the business. By the way, anytime Kristian or I say ARR without a qualifier, we'll be referring to active ARR by default. That remains the most important metric.  We'll be able to -- or we'll be careful to explicitly call out any references to deferred ARR or total ARR. Coming back to Slide 4 for a moment, to close out the top line category, revenue growth of 28% was driven by strong execution as well as the impact of ASC 606 on revenue recognition, plus of course the Arena contribution.  Switching to the bottom-line category, we delivered strong free cash flow of $116 million and non-GAAP EPS growth of 83%, reflecting a combination of strong top line results combined with continued operating expense discipline. We did see unfavorable currency movement during the quarter, which impacts our guidance for the full year, but Kristian will share more details on that later in the call.  While the economic environment is improving, the big driver of PTC's growth continues to be our strong alignment with the digital transformation initiatives of our customers and prospects. As you can see on Slide 6, PTC's logo speaks directly to the idea that digital transforms physical, which is our simple way of saying that PTC's portfolio of digital solutions allow industrial companies to improve growth and profitability by making transformative changes to their physical products into the physical processes of engineering, manufacturing, and servicing them.  PTC's digital transformation story is deep and wide, and our portfolio is full of innovative digital capabilities that align with high-value customer use cases across our CAD, PLM, IoT, and AR segments. Our new SaaS strategy gives us another major vector with which to pursue new dimensions of digital transformation.  With that as context, let's take a look at the respective contributions of the FSG, core, and growth segments of our portfolio. Moving to Slide 7. You'll see that ARR in our Focused Solution Group, or FSG, was essentially flat, but I'm pleased to share that we did see a couple of significant wins in retail and defense, which will create a tailwind for ARR growth going forward.  ARR growth for our core business in constant currency was in the double-digit range, and the 27% organic constant currency year-over-year growth of our growth business is consistent with our guidance for the year. With every passing quarter, the growth business is becoming a larger percentage of our ARR, and as we discussed at our Investor Day last December, this can be expected to drive higher growth rates for the company over time.  With the inclusion of Arena, our growth business now has more than $250 million of ARR. Let's go quick deeper into the main elements of our core and growth segments. Turning to Slide 8, our CAD team delivered another impressive quarter with ARR growth in the high single digits. The rebound in the demand environment that we started to see in Q4 of 2020 continued this past quarter with strong performance across all our major geos. The response to the enhanced capabilities of Creo 7 and the growing interest in Creo Simulation Live and Creo ANSYS Simulation that we're seeing, clearly demonstrates that customers appreciate what optimizing design efficiency and accuracy can do for them.  We're not stopping there. Just today, we announced Creo 8, which includes the Creo generative design extension module called GDX, which is based on our Atlas SaaS platform. GDX on Atlas will deliver the most advanced AI-based generative design capabilities available, benefiting from elastic compute in the cloud with seamless integration to the desktop Creo CAD environment.  Creo 8 also expands our model based design capabilities, extends additive and subtractive manufacturing capabilities and delivers improvements to the ANSYS-powered simulation offerings. The importance of a strong connection between design and simulation is illustrated by Speed Consulting on Slide 9.  When the large aerospace customer needed expert design guidance, the real-time design feedback combined with full simulation capabilities, enabled the delivery of structural, thermal and vibration analyses in record time. This customer is a long time Creo customer who immediately recognize the value of the deep integration of CAD and simulation that we're offering in partnership with ANSYS.  Moving on to Slide 10 in our PLM business, you'll see that PLM continued to deliver very strong performance with another mid-teens ARR growth quarter. From a geographic perspective in Q2, PLM performance was broad-based with solid growth across all 3 major geographies led by Asia Pac. Thanks to the role it plays in digital transformation initiatives, PLM continues to be a major growth engine.  From a vertical perspective, our PLM business was strong across a number of verticals, including medical devices, industrials and FA&D. Plus, we landed a few large wins and competitive displacements during the quarter. A competitive displacement was at Kimberly Clark, seen here on Slide 11, which is a new logo for PTC. Who selected Windchill as their digital backbone for product development processes. The ability to tightly integrate Windchill with SAP allowed Kimberly Clark to optimize processes that span multiple systems.  Moving on to our growth business. I'll begin with IoT on Slide 12. IoT delivered a third consecutive quarter of improving year-over-year ARR growth with strong new logo growth, and bookings up nearly 50%, while ARR increased 20% from a year ago, we're seeing a good rebound from the slowdown caused by COVID-related travel restrictions and lockdowns that we saw a year ago.  Our pipeline remains strong and churn continues to modestly improve, putting us in a good position as we head into the second half of 2021. On Slide 13, Strama MPS, a provider of custom machinery and plant engineering. It's just 1 of many companies that pivoted to making PPE during the pandemic. With the challenge of moving from industrial machinery to delicate medical masks at high volume, ThingWorx was used to rapidly identify and fix anomalies on a legging production line and helps Strama complete the changeover process within approximately 1 month.  Let me shift to our augmented reality business on Slide 14. The Vuforia augmented reality team again delivered very strong results in Q2 and with ARR up 60% year-over-year, driven in particular by Vuforia studio and engine.  Expansions drove over 50% of the bookings in the quarter. Traction outside the Americas continued to gain momentum with strong growth in both Europe and APAC. I'm also pleased to share that Vuforia Expert Capture has been successfully replatformed onto Atlas and now benefits from the operational and technical scalability of the Atlas multi-tenant SaaS architecture.  Customers can now scale deployments across the enterprise, leverage the same collaboration, version control, content management, and approval workflows that you'd see in Onshape. This is functionality that would have taken much longer to deliver without Atlas. We'll be shipping another new Vuforia product called Vuforia Instruct here in Q2. And it, too, will be based on Atlas.  Turning to Slide 15. Here's a great proof point regarding the power of Vuforia Chalk this coming directly from our ecosystem. When a Rockwell customer needed to install new equipment to prevent a costly production shutdown during a time that Rockwell was constrained by travel restrictions, Rockwell engineers leveraged Vuforia Chalk to enable remote experts to see the equipment installation virtually and to provide digital coaching to the on-site engineers.  As a result, the customer maintained production levels without any revenue loss. Turning now to Slide 16. Onshape delivered a very strong quarter with strong bookings growth and a healthy mix of new logo activity and expansions. The bulk of the Onshape business continues to come from SolidWorks replacements.  Our education adoption remains strong, and we're starting to see the first education enterprise renewals following the first year free education program that we initiated last year as the pandemic set in. Onshape's ability to deliver seamless collaborative CAD capabilities is definitely meeting an unmet need in the market.  On Slide 17, Loop Medical is developing a painless blood collection technology needed for routine lab testing, while making the collection process safer and more economical. Thanks to the pure SaaS Atlas platform that underlies Onshape, Loop can run their CAD and data management platform on their current MAC environment without having to invest in clunky virtualization technology, and perhaps more importantly, Loop can offer real-time collaboration capabilities to their distributed global teams and accelerate the design process.  Finally, moving to Arena on Slide 19. It's exciting to see how well the Arena team performed in their first full quarter as part of PTC. ARR growth was in the mid-teens, while bookings were up more than 50%. Arena is seeing strong traction with upselling, while also increasing penetration into current customer environments and at the same time, keeping retention rates high. The integration is going smoothly and the road map to enable cross-sell programs to expand geographically and to move upmarket is on track.  Arena is engaging some really innovative companies. On Slide 19, you'll see that they've been working with RefleXion who's creating the first biology guided radiotherapy system. RefleXion needed a solution to scale in parallel with their medical device compliance and commercialization needs. By designating Arena as a system of record, charged with controlling product design and quality and then integrating it with RefleXion's ERP platform, the company was able to create a single source product and quality solution.  The momentum we're seeing in our growth business, both from an ARR standpoint and from a product innovation perspective, provides PTC with a great portfolio to drive long-term growth.  Turning to Slide 20. You've heard me reference our Atlas platform several times already with respect to Creo to Vuforia and to Onshape. What you're actually seeing are the first signs of our plan to SaaSify PTC's entire portfolio onto the Atlas platform over time. While we'll continue to offer on-premise versions of core products indefinitely, a growing number of our customers want to enjoy the great benefits of SaaS but at the same time, prefer not to switch off their current enterprise systems.  PTC is essentially doing with Creo and Windchill, what Microsoft has done with Office in 365. When an on-prem workload shifts to Saas, the ARR of that workload roughly doubles. So this is expected to become a significant source of growth for PTC in the mid to long term. Just as Office 365 has been for Microsoft.  The introduction of this new growth driver gives us confidence that we can sustain strong levels of growth in the core business for years to come. Let me provide some color on geographic performance, which was strong across the globe, and as shown on Slide 21, reflects continued recovery. Americas ARR growth of 21% was driven by Arena augmented reality and solid core performance.  Europe ARR grew 8%, consistent with prior several quarters with notable strength in AR and high-teens growth in IoT. APAC delivered the third quarter in a row of mid-teens ARR growth with strong performance across all segments.  With that, now let me turn to Slide 22 and touch on our key alliance partners. The Microsoft alliance delivered year-over-year bookings of 30%, driven by demand for AR and our joint deal count increasing 40% year-over-year, both of which are solid indicators that our alliance is further evolving. To support additional growth, we've also added PTC field resources in Asia Pac and Americas.  Before we move on from Microsoft, you probably saw the announcement yesterday that Kathleen Mitford is leaving PTC to join Microsoft. This is a great career opportunity for Kathleen, and I'm pleased she'll remain in our ecosystem.  Fortunately, we had a successor ready to go, and we promoted Catherine Kinekor, who goes by CK to be our new Chief Strategy Officer. Congratulations to Kathleen and to CK.  Moving on to Rockwell. We had 1 of the stronger bookings quarters to date in our alliance and showed significant growth year-over-year. It was a strong quarter for the Americas and APAC. More than 30% of the deals were net new logos to PTC and top verticals included manufacturing, distribution services and process manufacturing.  Our ANSYS alliance continued its momentum in Q2 with double-digit ARR growth. Last week, PTC was named 2020 ANSYS Growth Partner of the Year at their Simulation World Conference. As I alluded to earlier, the customer sentiment around Creo Simulation Live and Creo ANSYS Simulation has been very positive.  To wrap up and summarize my comments, turning to Slide 23. A we're in great shape at the midpoint of fiscal 21 as customers continue to embark on digital transformation initiatives, adopting more of the full PTC product portfolio as they proceed. In addition to being in great shape for FY '21, the strong growth in deferred ARR means we're already laying the foundation for solid growth in FY '22 and beyond.  And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Kristian, who will take you through a few more details on the financial results and guidance.\nKristian Talvitie: Great. Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our results, I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance, and all growth rate references will be in constant currency. Let me start off with a review of our second quarter results, then review our guidance for fiscal 21.  Turning to Slide 25. Fiscal Q2 ARR of $1.39 billion increased 15% year-over-year and organic ARR grew 11%. Strong Q2 free cash flow of $116 million was in line with our expectations. Q2 revenue of $462 million increased 22% year-over-year. The revenue performance was driven by strong execution and also reflects the impact of ASC 606 on revenue recognition as well as a modest contribution from Arena. The strong revenue growth, along with continued financial discipline resulted in non-GAAP EPS growth of 83% year-over-year.  Turning to Page 26. I'll begin with our balance sheet. We ended Q2 with cash of $326 million and $1.5 billion of gross debt with an aggregate interest rate of 3.1%. We paid down $80 million on our revolving credit facility during the quarter.  Now that our leverage ratio is below 3x, which we told you as our goal. We're evaluating the timing of reinstating our share repurchase program. Now turning to Slide 27. This slide really highlights a few of the key guidance assumptions. The only real change to our assumptions here is the impact of FX movements. And so with these assumptions as context, we're still expecting fiscal '21 bookings growth in the double digits year-over-year and putting our ARR guidance into perspective.  Now turning to Slide 28. Last quarter, we told you we expected fiscal '21 ARR to be $1.47 billion to $1.5 billion, a growth rate of 16% to 18%. This assumed 10% to 12% organic growth, 400 basis points from Arena and a 200 basis point tailwind from currency.  Our revised guidance range of $1.45 billion to $1.47 billion is 14% to 16%, which assumes 10% to 12% organic growth, same as before, 400 basis points from Arena, same as before, and now no impact from FX. Regarding ARR linearity in fiscal '21. On an organic constant currency basis, we continue to expect the growth rates to be fairly consistent each quarter throughout fiscal '21. Free cash flow is still expected to be approximately $340 million for the full year. This is growth of approximately 60% year-over-year. And as we said at the beginning of the year, we expected more than 60% of this free cash flow to come in the first half. As we finish the first half, we've delivered 2/3 of that target.  And just as a reminder, that $340 million free cash flow target also includes approximately $14 million of acquisition-related fees and additional $7.5 million of incremental interest we expect to pay this year due to the Arena-related debt, a $14 million unforecasted payment due to a foreign tax dispute. And also includes approximately $16 million of restructuring payments.  This is offset by incremental cash flow from Arena and a positive impact from FX as well of about $10 million. Free cash flow excludes about $25 million of capital expenditures as well. And as a reminder, collections are stronger in the first half, and this is offset by timing of expenses and headcount ramping throughout the year. And as you all know, we have our next bond interest payment due in the fourth quarter.  As such, we're expecting 65% to 75% of the remaining free cash flow for our target to come in the third quarter. Now turning to P&L guidance. We're raising our revenue and EPS guidance for the year. Our original guidance was $1.69 billion to $1.73 billion, a growth rate of 16% to 19%. We're now expecting fiscal '21 revenue of $1.71 billion to $1.74 billion, it's a growth rate of 17% to 19%, which includes about 250 basis points from Arena and no impact from -- or nominal impact, if you will, from FX.  We're increasing our operating margin guidance on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. GAAP operating margin increases from 15% to 16% to 15% to 17%. And non-GAAP operating margin increases from 31 -- 30% to 31% to 31% to 32%. Non-GAAP EPS guidance was $3.05 to $3.35. The revised guidance is now $3.18 to $3.39. That's growth of 24% to 32%.  So, wrapping up, we had strong financial performance again in Q2. We delivered double-digit ARR growth while maintaining discipline on our expense structure and continuing to navigate what's still a challenging macro environment. I think the first half positions us well to deliver attractive double-digit top line growth and strong free cash flow for the year.  With that, we'll turn it over to the operator to begin the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line Saket Kalia with Barclays.\nSaket Kalia: Tim, I'd love to zoom in on Slide 20 a bit, very useful slide. Understanding that, that diagram is a vision and not guidance per se. I'd love to hear how you sort of envision PTC's move to Saas. It looks like you'll have all your products available in a SaaS form -- well, the major products available in a SaaS form factor by fiscal '22. And so, is the question -- or rather, the question is, is this something you perhaps drive your customer base to or encourage them to adopt or is this something that you're going to let happen naturally?  And maybe the follow-on to that for Kristian is can you just talk about how this plan for SaaSifying the business long term, of course, maybe plays into that fiscal '24 free cash flow target? Sorry, a lot there, but does that make sense?\nJames Heppelmann: Yes, it does. And it's actually a good question. So, there's a lot you can read into this slide, but if you notice the other logos, then Onshape and Atlas, start a darker greener color and as they move to the right, become more or less the same color of Atlas and in -- or I'm sorry, Onshape. And that's because we call this strategy an insidious SaaSification strategy, which means it happens step-by-step.  And it's already started. Vuforia already has the first offerings on Onshape like expert capture, which is one of the biggest ones. We're about to ship the second Vuforia product on Atlas, which will be called Vuforia Instruct coming out later this quarter.  We mentioned that Creo is shipping a capability on Atlas now for generative design called Creo GDX, and you'll start to see that coming from Windchill and coming from Thingworx. So, what we're going to do is begin to offer incremental or, in some cases, replacement modules on Saas. And then over time, the whole suite of each product line will become available on Saas.  So, a customer could begin adopting a part of it, get comfortable with the idea, start to generate some incremental revenue for us. And then in year 2 or 3 or 4, even flip the switch and go 100% to Saas, so that's what that diagram intends to show you is that these products are all climbing on board, but it's not an all or nothing.  It's step-by-step moving toward that all state where they're fully based on Atlas, and we have really a dream unified SaaS portfolio. I'm so excited about that because a lot of these products have divergent heritages and they're on different architectures today integrated together, but still on different architectures. And we have like a spring-cleaning opportunity here, thanks to the power of Atlas to unify on a single platform.  And everybody at PTC is aligned behind this. So, we're making great progress. And if you think in a year or 2, Windchill and Creo will have $1 billion of ARR. So, if we can get some even modest degree of penetration on a 2 for 1 ARR uplift, it's a lot of growth in those businesses. So, it's not going to be a lot here this year, it's not going to be a lot next year, but by the time we get out to '24, '25 it is going to be a lot.  I will tell you, though, that any guidance we gave you doesn't really contemplate this. This is kind of a new factor. I mean, I'm maybe moving into Kristian's question here, but our original thinking on SaaSification would be there was more all or nothing, and then we decided that this so-called insidious strategy is much more interesting for everybody, customers and PTC.  And so, we're now factoring this into the next rev, if you will, of our long-range plan, and it's going to be impactful. But again, the real big impact is farther to the right even in years yet to come on this chart. So, it's going to be a big deal, but not a big deal in the near term. Anything you want to add to that?\nKristian Talvitie: No.\nJames Heppelmann: I answered your question for you. I was on a roll. Okay. Next question.\nOperator: Next question is from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets.\nMatthew Hedberg: Jim, what really stands out to me, the past several quarters, you've noted several CAD and PLM replacements, which is really great to hear. I'm wondering, can you talk a little bit more about what's driving that? Is it really kind of your SaaS vision versus other -- even though a lot of these displacements are on-prem at this point. But is it the customers see where you're taking the portfolio?  And then how do you think about the pipeline for these displacements? Could these even accelerate as we move on?\nJames Heppelmann: Yes. I think there's a couple of factors. One is all other things aside, Windchill is a very good PLM system. I mean, it works really well. It's best-in-class in every analyst survey. So, it's just independently a really great system. The second thing, though, is it's part of a really interesting portfolio. I mean if you go back to Slide 9, where I was talking hundred, I remember it was Slide 9, but where I was talking about the digital transforms physical conversation, I guess it was Slide 6.  On Slide 6, you see that our Windchill solution lives in and amongst a portfolio that is very unique. Other PLM vendors don't really have IoT and AR, and they don't really have an open architecture PLM system either like referring to Dassault in particular. So, I think that people like the product because it's a great product, and they like it again because it has -- it's part of a great larger portfolio. And then they like it because they do see PTC at the cutting-edge of technology and now at the cutting-edge of SaaS technology as well.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Jay Vleeschouwer with Griffin Securities.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Following up on the earlier question from Saket regarding portfolio development and evolution, when we think about the larger context of what's been going on now for a number of years in engineering software, we hear a great deal about so-called digital trends, but it would seem to be more interesting for a company to leave a digital fabric to overdo the analogy.  And maybe talk about how you think about that instead of a trend, but perhaps a more encompassing fabric of capabilities through or buy the portfolio. Maybe this is another way of asking you to comment on your closed-loop management strategy.\nJames Heppelmann: Yes. I mean, Jay, I think you're absolutely right. What's better than a thread is a bunch of threads working together in a fabric that's even stronger and covers more. And I think that really is an interesting strategy.  This closed-loop life cycle strategy that you and I both talk about is very unique to PTC. It's CAD and PLM, plus IoT and AR. And now this really interesting new dimension of Saas. That's a differentiated strategy. I always say our PLM competitors don't have IoT or IoT competitors don't have AR and so forth. And there's so much synergy between these products. We cross-sell all day long because customers like the value proposition.  So I think it's a differentiated strategy. And the products are independently good, but they show up as a team, and the team is phenomenal, the portfolio. And I think it's just really helped us. We have a story that customers like and it really relates, like you see on Slide 6, to their digital transformation strategies.  They see in PTC, a company who can solve a whole bunch or transform, if you will, a whole bunch of different aspects of their business in engineering, manufacturing, service, somewhat in sales and marketing, even the customer interaction with the product and the business model, there's a lot we can do that's unique to PTC.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink with Baird.\nJoseph Vruwink: I just wanted to get your thoughts maybe on how this fiscal year is evolving relative to your initial expectation. There's been a quite a bit of upside in the first half so far. And just given the guidance update, it actually seems like the year is going to be pretty front-end loaded in terms of growth.  We heard from this morning where they're seeing kind of this release of pent-up demand happening in 1Q and 2Q around large deals and so maybe normal seasonality is changing for them as well.  I guess, are you seeing things take place or transact in the first half where when you look to the second half, you're maybe mindful of things being pulled forward? Or is it just the case that you'd like to get a little bit closer to that time frame before maybe making more meaningful revisions to the full year outlook?\nJames Heppelmann: Yes. I think, honestly, like as we sit here at the midpoint of the year, performance to plan is in bookings is really pretty darn strong and the forecast for the back half. Part of the reasons we want to share this deferred ARR thing with you. Is to show you that some of the great bookings we've been landing, lands and deferred and rather than give you caution that start dates matter, we said, why don't we just be transparent and show you the data. Because it really is pretty impressive.  And while we're at the midpoint of guidance on active ARR, we're kind of at the high end of guidance on total or as we sit here at the midpoint. So I think a lot of it just is this delicate balance of deferred versus active inside the total. And we're just going to give you transparency to it, so you know where we're heading, and you can see the business for what it is.\nKristian Talvitie: Yes. It's Kristian. I mean, I think I'd add, we started off the year saying 9% to 12% ARR growth and $340 million in cash flow. After Q1, we upped it to 10% to 12% organic constant currency, $340 million in cash flow. Now we're sitting here, reiterating the same target. So I'm not 100% sure of what's changed. We've been saying that the linearity should be somewhere -- should be pretty consistent throughout the year, which if you take the midpoint of that, it's 11%.  We just delivered 11% ARR growth. So I guess I'm not 100% sure. 1 other thing I'd point out is, our business performed pretty well last year. And some of our comps, so in particular, if you take out the Medidata acquisition, posted some pretty negative numbers. In the parts of the business that compete with us. So they're showing less growth against serious declines, we're showing strong growth on strong growth.  So I feel like some of the companies who fell into a deep hole during COVID unlike BDC, we'll post bigger numbers as they just get back to where they were in the prior year. But if you look at our 2-year CAGR, everything is growing. Even through the COVID period. And a lot of our comps really aren't growing. They're posting numbers now that are still less than they were back in 2019.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Gal Munda with Berenberg.\nGal Munda: I just had a question around the generative design and the exciting news that you basically announced a couple of years after you acquired first of you launched it as part of Creo extension now. What I'm thinking about is how did these modules effectively increase your addressable market in terms of the pricing, maybe how you're thinking about what proportion of your customers are realistically potential customers of it?  And do you think that there would ever be a cross-sell into competitive CAD environments as well? Or do you think that's more of a view into kind of potentially getting replacements into, say, existing SolidWorks customers?\nJames Heppelmann: Yes. There's a couple of different things happening with generative design. And just to be clear, we first released it as part of the desktop application. And for compute horsepower, use the graphics card. That gets you quite a bit of compute horsepower for certain types of compute-intensive codes like generative design.  But what we've done now in the second iteration is put it on Atlas, where there's elastic compute, you can have the biggest computer in the world running your generative analyses for you. Let me also say, 1 of the next steps will be the pipe that generative design capability into Onshape. Because it's actually running on the same platform as Onshape now. We just got to build it out into the UI and the functionality of Onshape.  So what we'll do with generative design is, for sure, will go back to the Creo base. And we will upsell this new module. It's a purchase you add on. And then we'll go into the Onshape base, and we'll do the same thing. I think that generative design is a brand-new idea. It's a transformational idea, but some of these ideas started a little slow and then really take off once people understand what they can do.  So I expect we'll see that pattern. And then I do think it will give us more competitive alternatives because opportunities. Because I think what we have is unique and special. And I think that if somebody is thinking about switching off SolidWorks, if they want to go to a high end product, they'll be impressed by Creo. If they want to go to a simpler product that's simpler to own and so forth, they'll look at Onshape and say, wow.  So I think it does give us an opportunity to take some market share. But the first and primary opportunity is the opportunity to drive more growth in the installed base.\nOperator: And our next question is from Ken Wong [ph] with Guggenheim Securities.\nUnidentified Analyst: Jim, there's been a lot of talk, I guess, within your -- the design sector around infrastructure spend, potentially being a tailwind, especially for those of your peers that have AEC exposure. Would love to get your perspective on whether or not this is something that PTC would also stand to benefit from?\nJames Heppelmann: Yes. I think not so much in the AEC field, but where AEC booms so does construction vehicles and equipment like that. So about 1/3 of PTC's business comes from a category we call industrial. And that would be everything from Deere, Caterpillar, Bobcat style equipment. Volvo go on and on. 2 carrier HVAC equipment or products that end up in new buildings and so forth.  So I do think it will be helpful. I think that our industrial customers, in general, are really seeing a surge of growth right now, in part on the rebound from COVID and then might even see a little bit more with the infrastructure spending. So I think it will be helpful, but we haven't factored a lot of that in.  We're kind of sticking to the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year and executing well against it, could prove to be a tailwind or an upside. But at this point, we're not changing our guidance explicitly or specifically because of that factor.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America.\nAndrew Obin: Just a question about Onshape and Arena. What are the opportunities to accelerate ARRs from here? What steps can you take? And the bookings are good. So when could we see acceleration? What's the feedback from the customers?\nJames Heppelmann: Yes. I mean I think with both Onshape and Arena, Onshape actually has a very high-growth rate, both for bookings and for ARR. In Arena, and so we just need to keep adding sales capacity and continue building out the product and do all the things you do with the growth business is working.  Arena is a little bit of a different story because almost all of their sales come from the United States. And so the first thing we're going to do is globalize Arena and sell it around the world, just like all of our products, including Onshape is sold. A second thing we're going to do is integrate it to Onshape because customers that get excited about Onshape also get excited about arena and vice versa.  So I think there are some short-term investments like in globalization that we can do for Arena that will be productive quickly. And we're already moving to put those resources in place to open up branch offices, if you will, outside the U.S. and to add more sales capacity and so forth. Arena was owned by a private equity company, and they were managing it for cash flow. And I think you'll see us manage it for growth, knowing that the cash flow will follow. And we have the luxury and kind of know-how to build businesses like that. So that's what we're off doing right now with Arena.\nOperator: And your next question is from Matthew Broome with Mizuho Securities.\nMatthew Broome: So we've had some optimism in the channel regarding the potential for 5G networks to facilitate sort of remote sensor enablement and ultimately drive more demand ThingWorx over the next couple of years. Just how significant do you anticipate the 5G rollout could be to overall ThingWorx adoption in the near term?\nJames Heppelmann: Well, I think it's very helpful. It's 1 more reason why industrial companies should go back into their factories and look to make changes. If somebody's going to put in 5G, they're going to put in an application like ThingWorx at the same time because if you suddenly have all this access to data and mobility and high speed connectivity, what are you going to do with all the data? And that's really where ThingWorx and ultimately, Vuforia and products like that fit in. So I think 5G is helpful. It's a tailwind.  We've been building a decent business without 5G, but 5G is certainly in the category of nice tailwind more so than anything else.\nOperator: And your next question is from Adam Borg with Stifel.\nAdam Borg: Maybe for Jim, just on Rockwell, it was great to see the strength in the quarter on the partnership. And I was just curious, it's always been a couple of quarters since that new extended agreement that you guys have had, expanding beyond IoT. And I'm just curious, was this strength that you've seen, just focused on the IoT and AR side? Or was there any early green shoots around Rockwell being able to sell Windchill and Onshape?\nJames Heppelmann: No. I mean, honestly, and I would characterize it as IoT and AR. Rockwell, and I think I was transparent on this. That new agreement gave Rockwell the right to sell more products because sometimes they come across those opportunities. But it wasn't really changing the center of gravity of the partnership.  I think if you look at what's driving a little more momentum with Rockwell, it's 2 things. First of all, Rockwell brought in some new talent. And I'll just say from the sidelines as a partner, these guys are making a difference. They're shaking some things up and really creating some energy.  And then the second thing is Rockwell had a good quarter overall. Particularly on the orders front. I saw they announced today and their order book was up double digits and so forth. So I imagine some of those orders ended up flowing our way. So I think it's really more improving economic situation in the world of industrial automation, coupled by new talent.  It's not really a mix shift in the product line up to sell it.\nOperator: And next question is from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is mile on for Sterling. I was hoping you could just maybe give more of a demand breakdown between CAD, PLM, IoT and AR? And then are there any vertical end markets that you aren't seeing a bounce back in demand yet as the economy is reopening?\nJames Heppelmann: Okay. The first part of your question was breakdown demand between Creo and Windchill? Did I get that right? The whole portfolio? Well, I think the demand sort of mirrors the growth rates. As you might expect, some of the products with the highest growth rate, of course, in order to sustain those growth rates, they have the highest bookings. And in some cases, higher churn as well with newer technologies and so forth.  And then when you get to a product like Creo, churn is very low. So we can build a growth business of less aggressive bookings coming in the top. So I would say, yes, demand is strongest for Vuforia and Onshape. At the next level, it's really ThingWorx. And then below that, PLM and below that CAD, just in terms of demand.  But it's again a function of the maturity of these products. It's a function of the growth rate of the markets, which is sort of a function of the maturity of the markets and so forth. Hopefully, that hits your question. I guess it was the second part, I mean.\nOperator: And for our last question, we have Jason Celino with KeyBanc Capital.\nJason Celino: PLM, very helpful slide, as always, it's been quite strong for a couple of quarters now, but maybe taking a step down in terms of the strength, customer size wise? Any comments on is it enterprise, mid-market, SMB? Or is it truly more broad-based?\nJames Heppelmann: It truly is broad-based. And let me just say, Jason, that's 14 quarters in a row of double-digit growth in the core business. So it's not just a couple of quarters. It's 14 now. And it's always been PLM leading CAD and the 2 together, representing double digits and double digits right through COVID, by the way. So that's impressive. Certainly compared to some competitors who weren't posting numbers or anything like that.  But I'd say it's broad-based. I mean, there's a few pockets like medical device in med tech in general, which is a regulated industry around the globe. We're especially good at that. Windchill tends to take a large percentage of those deals in the larger accounts. And believe it or not, Arena takes a lot of those deals in the smaller accounts is kind of more of a mid-market solution. But they, too, in their market space, are particularly good at regulated markets.  But I mean, we've had good success in aerospace, good success in the automotive business. It's just really is pretty broad-based. It's a fair amount of expansions, but then a good number of new logos and competitive displacements, thanks to a differentiated story as well.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn it back over to Ms. Emily Walt for any closing remarks.\nEmily Walt: Thanks, Abigail. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on the call today. PTC will be participating in a number of virtual investor events this quarter, and you can find all the details on our investor website. We'd also like to highlight our LiveWorx series, which you can see the agenda and register or events@liveworx.com. We look forward to seeing you on the conference circuit in the coming months. And again, thank you for your interest in PTC. Have a great evening.\nJames Heppelmann: Thank you, everybody. We'll see you on the road or see you in 90 days.\nKristian Talvitie: Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kristian Talvitie",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our results, I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance, and all growth rate references will be in constant currency. Let me start off with a review of our second quarter results, then review our guidance for fiscal 21.  Turning to Slide 25. Fiscal Q2 ARR of $1.39 billion increased 15% year-over-year and organic ARR grew 11%. Strong Q2 free cash flow of $116 million was in line with our expectations. Q2 revenue of $462 million increased 22% year-over-year. The revenue performance was driven by strong execution and also reflects the impact of ASC 606 on revenue recognition as well as a modest contribution from Arena. The strong revenue growth, along with continued financial discipline resulted in non-GAAP EPS growth of 83% year-over-year.  Turning to Page 26. I'll begin with our balance sheet. We ended Q2 with cash of $326 million and $1.5 billion of gross debt with an aggregate interest rate of 3.1%. We paid down $80 million on our revolving credit facility during the quarter.  Now that our leverage ratio is below 3x, which we told you as our goal. We're evaluating the timing of reinstating our share repurchase program. Now turning to Slide 27. This slide really highlights a few of the key guidance assumptions. The only real change to our assumptions here is the impact of FX movements. And so with these assumptions as context, we're still expecting fiscal '21 bookings growth in the double digits year-over-year and putting our ARR guidance into perspective.  Now turning to Slide 28. Last quarter, we told you we expected fiscal '21 ARR to be $1.47 billion to $1.5 billion, a growth rate of 16% to 18%. This assumed 10% to 12% organic growth, 400 basis points from Arena and a 200 basis point tailwind from currency.  Our revised guidance range of $1.45 billion to $1.47 billion is 14% to 16%, which assumes 10% to 12% organic growth, same as before, 400 basis points from Arena, same as before, and now no impact from FX. Regarding ARR linearity in fiscal '21. On an organic constant currency basis, we continue to expect the growth rates to be fairly consistent each quarter throughout fiscal '21. Free cash flow is still expected to be approximately $340 million for the full year. This is growth of approximately 60% year-over-year. And as we said at the beginning of the year, we expected more than 60% of this free cash flow to come in the first half. As we finish the first half, we've delivered 2/3 of that target.  And just as a reminder, that $340 million free cash flow target also includes approximately $14 million of acquisition-related fees and additional $7.5 million of incremental interest we expect to pay this year due to the Arena-related debt, a $14 million unforecasted payment due to a foreign tax dispute. And also includes approximately $16 million of restructuring payments.  This is offset by incremental cash flow from Arena and a positive impact from FX as well of about $10 million. Free cash flow excludes about $25 million of capital expenditures as well. And as a reminder, collections are stronger in the first half, and this is offset by timing of expenses and headcount ramping throughout the year. And as you all know, we have our next bond interest payment due in the fourth quarter.  As such, we're expecting 65% to 75% of the remaining free cash flow for our target to come in the third quarter. Now turning to P&L guidance. We're raising our revenue and EPS guidance for the year. Our original guidance was $1.69 billion to $1.73 billion, a growth rate of 16% to 19%. We're now expecting fiscal '21 revenue of $1.71 billion to $1.74 billion, it's a growth rate of 17% to 19%, which includes about 250 basis points from Arena and no impact from -- or nominal impact, if you will, from FX.  We're increasing our operating margin guidance on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. GAAP operating margin increases from 15% to 16% to 15% to 17%. And non-GAAP operating margin increases from 31 -- 30% to 31% to 31% to 32%. Non-GAAP EPS guidance was $3.05 to $3.35. The revised guidance is now $3.18 to $3.39. That's growth of 24% to 32%.  So, wrapping up, we had strong financial performance again in Q2. We delivered double-digit ARR growth while maintaining discipline on our expense structure and continuing to navigate what's still a challenging macro environment. I think the first half positions us well to deliver attractive double-digit top line growth and strong free cash flow for the year.  With that, we'll turn it over to the operator to begin the Q&A. No. Yes. It's Kristian. I mean, I think I'd add, we started off the year saying 9% to 12% ARR growth and $340 million in cash flow. After Q1, we upped it to 10% to 12% organic constant currency, $340 million in cash flow. Now we're sitting here, reiterating the same target. So I'm not 100% sure of what's changed. We've been saying that the linearity should be somewhere -- should be pretty consistent throughout the year, which if you take the midpoint of that, it's 11%.  We just delivered 11% ARR growth. So I guess I'm not 100% sure. 1 other thing I'd point out is, our business performed pretty well last year. And some of our comps, so in particular, if you take out the Medidata acquisition, posted some pretty negative numbers. In the parts of the business that compete with us. So they're showing less growth against serious declines, we're showing strong growth on strong growth.  So I feel like some of the companies who fell into a deep hole during COVID unlike BDC, we'll post bigger numbers as they just get back to where they were in the prior year. But if you look at our 2-year CAGR, everything is growing. Even through the COVID period. And a lot of our comps really aren't growing. They're posting numbers now that are still less than they were back in 2019. Thank you."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "James Heppelmann",
            "content": "Thanks, Emily. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I hope that you and your families have continued to stay safe throughout the ongoing pandemic.  I'd like to begin by congratulating Tim Fox our long-time Senior VP of Investor Relations, who's left to pursue an exciting opportunity at ACV Auctions following the recent IPO. I worked closely with Tim for many years and feel he added tremendous value to our Investor Relations program.  While we'll certainly miss Tim, we wish him all the best in his new role. Turning to Slide 4. I'm pleased to share that we delivered another strong performance in the second quarter. Bookings grew in the mid-30s as compared to a Q2 period from a year ago when bookings declined 15% as the pandemic set in.  Organic bookings grew in the mid-20s. While much of the bookings strength contributed to the second quarter's performance, some of the bookings have start dates in later periods, and therefore went into backlog or what we will call deferred ARR going forward. I'm pleased to see that with several consecutive strong bookings quarters, deferred ARR has returned to pre-COVID levels as customers continue to make commitments to invest in their digital transformation initiatives over the long term. This deferred ARR gives PTC a foundation for growth going forward.  The economic environment across the globe continues to improve with PMI numbers returning to or exceeding pre-COVID levels in many regions. This data, coupled with the steady increase of vaccinations and stimulus plans from the current administration is encouraging. From our perspective, demand we see for our core products and SaaS offerings, combined with a strong pipeline heading into the second half of 2021, supports our outlook for the year. In the top line category, we had a very solid quarter with ARR growth of 18% or 15% in constant currency to $1.39 billion. Growth was driven by a combination of our growth business, which delivered strong results by continued momentum in our core business, where we again outpaced market growth and by strong performance from Arena Solutions in its first quarter being part of PTC.  On an organic and constant currency basis, we had 11% ARR growth in Q2 of '21, in line with our guidance. If you flip to Slide 5 for a minute, I'd like to remind you that when we use the term ARR, we are referring to the annualized run rate of the book of recurring revenue contracts that are currently active.  So ARR really means active ARR, and this important metric is what drives our cash flow. On top of that, we have the deferred ARR I mentioned earlier. Given the strong bookings we've had over the past 3 quarters, our total ARR growth, which includes deferred ARR, is up 12% on a constant currency organic basis in Q2.  As you know, timing of start dates, and the nature of ramp deals can impact when a booking moves into active ARR. Therefore, we feel it's important to look at total ARR, again the sum of active ARR plus deferred ARR. We've been guiding active ARR growth of 10% to 12%. And on top of that, we have been expecting approximately $80 million in deferred ARR as we exit fiscal 2021. We're now projecting more than $90 million in deferred ARR for the full year, which is because bookings in the first half of 2021 have been stronger than what you've seen reported in our reported active ARR results.  Given the uncertainty around start dates and the magnitude of ramp deals, if a higher mix of our bookings were to flow into deferred ARR rather than active ARR in future quarters, it could put some pressure on active ARR even while total ARR would remain constant. And of course, it could go the other way too with a mix that benefits active ARR.  We think that by providing more insight into total ARR growth rate, we can help show the true underlying performance of the business. By the way, anytime Kristian or I say ARR without a qualifier, we'll be referring to active ARR by default. That remains the most important metric.  We'll be able to -- or we'll be careful to explicitly call out any references to deferred ARR or total ARR. Coming back to Slide 4 for a moment, to close out the top line category, revenue growth of 28% was driven by strong execution as well as the impact of ASC 606 on revenue recognition, plus of course the Arena contribution.  Switching to the bottom-line category, we delivered strong free cash flow of $116 million and non-GAAP EPS growth of 83%, reflecting a combination of strong top line results combined with continued operating expense discipline. We did see unfavorable currency movement during the quarter, which impacts our guidance for the full year, but Kristian will share more details on that later in the call.  While the economic environment is improving, the big driver of PTC's growth continues to be our strong alignment with the digital transformation initiatives of our customers and prospects. As you can see on Slide 6, PTC's logo speaks directly to the idea that digital transforms physical, which is our simple way of saying that PTC's portfolio of digital solutions allow industrial companies to improve growth and profitability by making transformative changes to their physical products into the physical processes of engineering, manufacturing, and servicing them.  PTC's digital transformation story is deep and wide, and our portfolio is full of innovative digital capabilities that align with high-value customer use cases across our CAD, PLM, IoT, and AR segments. Our new SaaS strategy gives us another major vector with which to pursue new dimensions of digital transformation.  With that as context, let's take a look at the respective contributions of the FSG, core, and growth segments of our portfolio. Moving to Slide 7. You'll see that ARR in our Focused Solution Group, or FSG, was essentially flat, but I'm pleased to share that we did see a couple of significant wins in retail and defense, which will create a tailwind for ARR growth going forward.  ARR growth for our core business in constant currency was in the double-digit range, and the 27% organic constant currency year-over-year growth of our growth business is consistent with our guidance for the year. With every passing quarter, the growth business is becoming a larger percentage of our ARR, and as we discussed at our Investor Day last December, this can be expected to drive higher growth rates for the company over time.  With the inclusion of Arena, our growth business now has more than $250 million of ARR. Let's go quick deeper into the main elements of our core and growth segments. Turning to Slide 8, our CAD team delivered another impressive quarter with ARR growth in the high single digits. The rebound in the demand environment that we started to see in Q4 of 2020 continued this past quarter with strong performance across all our major geos. The response to the enhanced capabilities of Creo 7 and the growing interest in Creo Simulation Live and Creo ANSYS Simulation that we're seeing, clearly demonstrates that customers appreciate what optimizing design efficiency and accuracy can do for them.  We're not stopping there. Just today, we announced Creo 8, which includes the Creo generative design extension module called GDX, which is based on our Atlas SaaS platform. GDX on Atlas will deliver the most advanced AI-based generative design capabilities available, benefiting from elastic compute in the cloud with seamless integration to the desktop Creo CAD environment.  Creo 8 also expands our model based design capabilities, extends additive and subtractive manufacturing capabilities and delivers improvements to the ANSYS-powered simulation offerings. The importance of a strong connection between design and simulation is illustrated by Speed Consulting on Slide 9.  When the large aerospace customer needed expert design guidance, the real-time design feedback combined with full simulation capabilities, enabled the delivery of structural, thermal and vibration analyses in record time. This customer is a long time Creo customer who immediately recognize the value of the deep integration of CAD and simulation that we're offering in partnership with ANSYS.  Moving on to Slide 10 in our PLM business, you'll see that PLM continued to deliver very strong performance with another mid-teens ARR growth quarter. From a geographic perspective in Q2, PLM performance was broad-based with solid growth across all 3 major geographies led by Asia Pac. Thanks to the role it plays in digital transformation initiatives, PLM continues to be a major growth engine.  From a vertical perspective, our PLM business was strong across a number of verticals, including medical devices, industrials and FA&D. Plus, we landed a few large wins and competitive displacements during the quarter. A competitive displacement was at Kimberly Clark, seen here on Slide 11, which is a new logo for PTC. Who selected Windchill as their digital backbone for product development processes. The ability to tightly integrate Windchill with SAP allowed Kimberly Clark to optimize processes that span multiple systems.  Moving on to our growth business. I'll begin with IoT on Slide 12. IoT delivered a third consecutive quarter of improving year-over-year ARR growth with strong new logo growth, and bookings up nearly 50%, while ARR increased 20% from a year ago, we're seeing a good rebound from the slowdown caused by COVID-related travel restrictions and lockdowns that we saw a year ago.  Our pipeline remains strong and churn continues to modestly improve, putting us in a good position as we head into the second half of 2021. On Slide 13, Strama MPS, a provider of custom machinery and plant engineering. It's just 1 of many companies that pivoted to making PPE during the pandemic. With the challenge of moving from industrial machinery to delicate medical masks at high volume, ThingWorx was used to rapidly identify and fix anomalies on a legging production line and helps Strama complete the changeover process within approximately 1 month.  Let me shift to our augmented reality business on Slide 14. The Vuforia augmented reality team again delivered very strong results in Q2 and with ARR up 60% year-over-year, driven in particular by Vuforia studio and engine.  Expansions drove over 50% of the bookings in the quarter. Traction outside the Americas continued to gain momentum with strong growth in both Europe and APAC. I'm also pleased to share that Vuforia Expert Capture has been successfully replatformed onto Atlas and now benefits from the operational and technical scalability of the Atlas multi-tenant SaaS architecture.  Customers can now scale deployments across the enterprise, leverage the same collaboration, version control, content management, and approval workflows that you'd see in Onshape. This is functionality that would have taken much longer to deliver without Atlas. We'll be shipping another new Vuforia product called Vuforia Instruct here in Q2. And it, too, will be based on Atlas.  Turning to Slide 15. Here's a great proof point regarding the power of Vuforia Chalk this coming directly from our ecosystem. When a Rockwell customer needed to install new equipment to prevent a costly production shutdown during a time that Rockwell was constrained by travel restrictions, Rockwell engineers leveraged Vuforia Chalk to enable remote experts to see the equipment installation virtually and to provide digital coaching to the on-site engineers.  As a result, the customer maintained production levels without any revenue loss. Turning now to Slide 16. Onshape delivered a very strong quarter with strong bookings growth and a healthy mix of new logo activity and expansions. The bulk of the Onshape business continues to come from SolidWorks replacements.  Our education adoption remains strong, and we're starting to see the first education enterprise renewals following the first year free education program that we initiated last year as the pandemic set in. Onshape's ability to deliver seamless collaborative CAD capabilities is definitely meeting an unmet need in the market.  On Slide 17, Loop Medical is developing a painless blood collection technology needed for routine lab testing, while making the collection process safer and more economical. Thanks to the pure SaaS Atlas platform that underlies Onshape, Loop can run their CAD and data management platform on their current MAC environment without having to invest in clunky virtualization technology, and perhaps more importantly, Loop can offer real-time collaboration capabilities to their distributed global teams and accelerate the design process.  Finally, moving to Arena on Slide 19. It's exciting to see how well the Arena team performed in their first full quarter as part of PTC. ARR growth was in the mid-teens, while bookings were up more than 50%. Arena is seeing strong traction with upselling, while also increasing penetration into current customer environments and at the same time, keeping retention rates high. The integration is going smoothly and the road map to enable cross-sell programs to expand geographically and to move upmarket is on track.  Arena is engaging some really innovative companies. On Slide 19, you'll see that they've been working with RefleXion who's creating the first biology guided radiotherapy system. RefleXion needed a solution to scale in parallel with their medical device compliance and commercialization needs. By designating Arena as a system of record, charged with controlling product design and quality and then integrating it with RefleXion's ERP platform, the company was able to create a single source product and quality solution.  The momentum we're seeing in our growth business, both from an ARR standpoint and from a product innovation perspective, provides PTC with a great portfolio to drive long-term growth.  Turning to Slide 20. You've heard me reference our Atlas platform several times already with respect to Creo to Vuforia and to Onshape. What you're actually seeing are the first signs of our plan to SaaSify PTC's entire portfolio onto the Atlas platform over time. While we'll continue to offer on-premise versions of core products indefinitely, a growing number of our customers want to enjoy the great benefits of SaaS but at the same time, prefer not to switch off their current enterprise systems.  PTC is essentially doing with Creo and Windchill, what Microsoft has done with Office in 365. When an on-prem workload shifts to Saas, the ARR of that workload roughly doubles. So this is expected to become a significant source of growth for PTC in the mid to long term. Just as Office 365 has been for Microsoft.  The introduction of this new growth driver gives us confidence that we can sustain strong levels of growth in the core business for years to come. Let me provide some color on geographic performance, which was strong across the globe, and as shown on Slide 21, reflects continued recovery. Americas ARR growth of 21% was driven by Arena augmented reality and solid core performance.  Europe ARR grew 8%, consistent with prior several quarters with notable strength in AR and high-teens growth in IoT. APAC delivered the third quarter in a row of mid-teens ARR growth with strong performance across all segments.  With that, now let me turn to Slide 22 and touch on our key alliance partners. The Microsoft alliance delivered year-over-year bookings of 30%, driven by demand for AR and our joint deal count increasing 40% year-over-year, both of which are solid indicators that our alliance is further evolving. To support additional growth, we've also added PTC field resources in Asia Pac and Americas.  Before we move on from Microsoft, you probably saw the announcement yesterday that Kathleen Mitford is leaving PTC to join Microsoft. This is a great career opportunity for Kathleen, and I'm pleased she'll remain in our ecosystem.  Fortunately, we had a successor ready to go, and we promoted Catherine Kinekor, who goes by CK to be our new Chief Strategy Officer. Congratulations to Kathleen and to CK.  Moving on to Rockwell. We had 1 of the stronger bookings quarters to date in our alliance and showed significant growth year-over-year. It was a strong quarter for the Americas and APAC. More than 30% of the deals were net new logos to PTC and top verticals included manufacturing, distribution services and process manufacturing.  Our ANSYS alliance continued its momentum in Q2 with double-digit ARR growth. Last week, PTC was named 2020 ANSYS Growth Partner of the Year at their Simulation World Conference. As I alluded to earlier, the customer sentiment around Creo Simulation Live and Creo ANSYS Simulation has been very positive.  To wrap up and summarize my comments, turning to Slide 23. A we're in great shape at the midpoint of fiscal 21 as customers continue to embark on digital transformation initiatives, adopting more of the full PTC product portfolio as they proceed. In addition to being in great shape for FY '21, the strong growth in deferred ARR means we're already laying the foundation for solid growth in FY '22 and beyond.  And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Kristian, who will take you through a few more details on the financial results and guidance. Yes, it does. And it's actually a good question. So, there's a lot you can read into this slide, but if you notice the other logos, then Onshape and Atlas, start a darker greener color and as they move to the right, become more or less the same color of Atlas and in -- or I'm sorry, Onshape. And that's because we call this strategy an insidious SaaSification strategy, which means it happens step-by-step.  And it's already started. Vuforia already has the first offerings on Onshape like expert capture, which is one of the biggest ones. We're about to ship the second Vuforia product on Atlas, which will be called Vuforia Instruct coming out later this quarter.  We mentioned that Creo is shipping a capability on Atlas now for generative design called Creo GDX, and you'll start to see that coming from Windchill and coming from Thingworx. So, what we're going to do is begin to offer incremental or, in some cases, replacement modules on Saas. And then over time, the whole suite of each product line will become available on Saas.  So, a customer could begin adopting a part of it, get comfortable with the idea, start to generate some incremental revenue for us. And then in year 2 or 3 or 4, even flip the switch and go 100% to Saas, so that's what that diagram intends to show you is that these products are all climbing on board, but it's not an all or nothing.  It's step-by-step moving toward that all state where they're fully based on Atlas, and we have really a dream unified SaaS portfolio. I'm so excited about that because a lot of these products have divergent heritages and they're on different architectures today integrated together, but still on different architectures. And we have like a spring-cleaning opportunity here, thanks to the power of Atlas to unify on a single platform.  And everybody at PTC is aligned behind this. So, we're making great progress. And if you think in a year or 2, Windchill and Creo will have $1 billion of ARR. So, if we can get some even modest degree of penetration on a 2 for 1 ARR uplift, it's a lot of growth in those businesses. So, it's not going to be a lot here this year, it's not going to be a lot next year, but by the time we get out to '24, '25 it is going to be a lot.  I will tell you, though, that any guidance we gave you doesn't really contemplate this. This is kind of a new factor. I mean, I'm maybe moving into Kristian's question here, but our original thinking on SaaSification would be there was more all or nothing, and then we decided that this so-called insidious strategy is much more interesting for everybody, customers and PTC.  And so, we're now factoring this into the next rev, if you will, of our long-range plan, and it's going to be impactful. But again, the real big impact is farther to the right even in years yet to come on this chart. So, it's going to be a big deal, but not a big deal in the near term. Anything you want to add to that? I answered your question for you. I was on a roll. Okay. Next question. Yes. I think there's a couple of factors. One is all other things aside, Windchill is a very good PLM system. I mean, it works really well. It's best-in-class in every analyst survey. So, it's just independently a really great system. The second thing, though, is it's part of a really interesting portfolio. I mean if you go back to Slide 9, where I was talking hundred, I remember it was Slide 9, but where I was talking about the digital transforms physical conversation, I guess it was Slide 6.  On Slide 6, you see that our Windchill solution lives in and amongst a portfolio that is very unique. Other PLM vendors don't really have IoT and AR, and they don't really have an open architecture PLM system either like referring to Dassault in particular. So, I think that people like the product because it's a great product, and they like it again because it has -- it's part of a great larger portfolio. And then they like it because they do see PTC at the cutting-edge of technology and now at the cutting-edge of SaaS technology as well. Yes. I mean, Jay, I think you're absolutely right. What's better than a thread is a bunch of threads working together in a fabric that's even stronger and covers more. And I think that really is an interesting strategy.  This closed-loop life cycle strategy that you and I both talk about is very unique to PTC. It's CAD and PLM, plus IoT and AR. And now this really interesting new dimension of Saas. That's a differentiated strategy. I always say our PLM competitors don't have IoT or IoT competitors don't have AR and so forth. And there's so much synergy between these products. We cross-sell all day long because customers like the value proposition.  So I think it's a differentiated strategy. And the products are independently good, but they show up as a team, and the team is phenomenal, the portfolio. And I think it's just really helped us. We have a story that customers like and it really relates, like you see on Slide 6, to their digital transformation strategies.  They see in PTC, a company who can solve a whole bunch or transform, if you will, a whole bunch of different aspects of their business in engineering, manufacturing, service, somewhat in sales and marketing, even the customer interaction with the product and the business model, there's a lot we can do that's unique to PTC. Yes. I think, honestly, like as we sit here at the midpoint of the year, performance to plan is in bookings is really pretty darn strong and the forecast for the back half. Part of the reasons we want to share this deferred ARR thing with you. Is to show you that some of the great bookings we've been landing, lands and deferred and rather than give you caution that start dates matter, we said, why don't we just be transparent and show you the data. Because it really is pretty impressive.  And while we're at the midpoint of guidance on active ARR, we're kind of at the high end of guidance on total or as we sit here at the midpoint. So I think a lot of it just is this delicate balance of deferred versus active inside the total. And we're just going to give you transparency to it, so you know where we're heading, and you can see the business for what it is. Yes. There's a couple of different things happening with generative design. And just to be clear, we first released it as part of the desktop application. And for compute horsepower, use the graphics card. That gets you quite a bit of compute horsepower for certain types of compute-intensive codes like generative design.  But what we've done now in the second iteration is put it on Atlas, where there's elastic compute, you can have the biggest computer in the world running your generative analyses for you. Let me also say, 1 of the next steps will be the pipe that generative design capability into Onshape. Because it's actually running on the same platform as Onshape now. We just got to build it out into the UI and the functionality of Onshape.  So what we'll do with generative design is, for sure, will go back to the Creo base. And we will upsell this new module. It's a purchase you add on. And then we'll go into the Onshape base, and we'll do the same thing. I think that generative design is a brand-new idea. It's a transformational idea, but some of these ideas started a little slow and then really take off once people understand what they can do.  So I expect we'll see that pattern. And then I do think it will give us more competitive alternatives because opportunities. Because I think what we have is unique and special. And I think that if somebody is thinking about switching off SolidWorks, if they want to go to a high end product, they'll be impressed by Creo. If they want to go to a simpler product that's simpler to own and so forth, they'll look at Onshape and say, wow.  So I think it does give us an opportunity to take some market share. But the first and primary opportunity is the opportunity to drive more growth in the installed base. Yes. I think not so much in the AEC field, but where AEC booms so does construction vehicles and equipment like that. So about 1/3 of PTC's business comes from a category we call industrial. And that would be everything from Deere, Caterpillar, Bobcat style equipment. Volvo go on and on. 2 carrier HVAC equipment or products that end up in new buildings and so forth.  So I do think it will be helpful. I think that our industrial customers, in general, are really seeing a surge of growth right now, in part on the rebound from COVID and then might even see a little bit more with the infrastructure spending. So I think it will be helpful, but we haven't factored a lot of that in.  We're kind of sticking to the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year and executing well against it, could prove to be a tailwind or an upside. But at this point, we're not changing our guidance explicitly or specifically because of that factor. Yes. I mean I think with both Onshape and Arena, Onshape actually has a very high-growth rate, both for bookings and for ARR. In Arena, and so we just need to keep adding sales capacity and continue building out the product and do all the things you do with the growth business is working.  Arena is a little bit of a different story because almost all of their sales come from the United States. And so the first thing we're going to do is globalize Arena and sell it around the world, just like all of our products, including Onshape is sold. A second thing we're going to do is integrate it to Onshape because customers that get excited about Onshape also get excited about arena and vice versa.  So I think there are some short-term investments like in globalization that we can do for Arena that will be productive quickly. And we're already moving to put those resources in place to open up branch offices, if you will, outside the U.S. and to add more sales capacity and so forth. Arena was owned by a private equity company, and they were managing it for cash flow. And I think you'll see us manage it for growth, knowing that the cash flow will follow. And we have the luxury and kind of know-how to build businesses like that. So that's what we're off doing right now with Arena. Well, I think it's very helpful. It's 1 more reason why industrial companies should go back into their factories and look to make changes. If somebody's going to put in 5G, they're going to put in an application like ThingWorx at the same time because if you suddenly have all this access to data and mobility and high speed connectivity, what are you going to do with all the data? And that's really where ThingWorx and ultimately, Vuforia and products like that fit in. So I think 5G is helpful. It's a tailwind.  We've been building a decent business without 5G, but 5G is certainly in the category of nice tailwind more so than anything else. No. I mean, honestly, and I would characterize it as IoT and AR. Rockwell, and I think I was transparent on this. That new agreement gave Rockwell the right to sell more products because sometimes they come across those opportunities. But it wasn't really changing the center of gravity of the partnership.  I think if you look at what's driving a little more momentum with Rockwell, it's 2 things. First of all, Rockwell brought in some new talent. And I'll just say from the sidelines as a partner, these guys are making a difference. They're shaking some things up and really creating some energy.  And then the second thing is Rockwell had a good quarter overall. Particularly on the orders front. I saw they announced today and their order book was up double digits and so forth. So I imagine some of those orders ended up flowing our way. So I think it's really more improving economic situation in the world of industrial automation, coupled by new talent.  It's not really a mix shift in the product line up to sell it. Okay. The first part of your question was breakdown demand between Creo and Windchill? Did I get that right? The whole portfolio? Well, I think the demand sort of mirrors the growth rates. As you might expect, some of the products with the highest growth rate, of course, in order to sustain those growth rates, they have the highest bookings. And in some cases, higher churn as well with newer technologies and so forth.  And then when you get to a product like Creo, churn is very low. So we can build a growth business of less aggressive bookings coming in the top. So I would say, yes, demand is strongest for Vuforia and Onshape. At the next level, it's really ThingWorx. And then below that, PLM and below that CAD, just in terms of demand.  But it's again a function of the maturity of these products. It's a function of the growth rate of the markets, which is sort of a function of the maturity of the markets and so forth. Hopefully, that hits your question. I guess it was the second part, I mean. It truly is broad-based. And let me just say, Jason, that's 14 quarters in a row of double-digit growth in the core business. So it's not just a couple of quarters. It's 14 now. And it's always been PLM leading CAD and the 2 together, representing double digits and double digits right through COVID, by the way. So that's impressive. Certainly compared to some competitors who weren't posting numbers or anything like that.  But I'd say it's broad-based. I mean, there's a few pockets like medical device in med tech in general, which is a regulated industry around the globe. We're especially good at that. Windchill tends to take a large percentage of those deals in the larger accounts. And believe it or not, Arena takes a lot of those deals in the smaller accounts is kind of more of a mid-market solution. But they, too, in their market space, are particularly good at regulated markets.  But I mean, we've had good success in aerospace, good success in the automotive business. It's just really is pretty broad-based. It's a fair amount of expansions, but then a good number of new logos and competitive displacements, thanks to a differentiated story as well. Thank you, everybody. We'll see you on the road or see you in 90 days."

With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Jim.\nJames Heppelmann: Thanks, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I hope that you and your families continue to stay safe and well during this ongoing pandemic. Before jumping into our quarterly review, I would like to begin by discussing the news we shared two weeks ago about closing the Arena acquisition and some related organizational changes. Turning to Slide 4 in the deck. First, we are very pleased to have closed the acquisition and we would like to formally welcome the Arena employees to the PTC team. As we discussed at our recent Investor Day, we are excited to complement the strong momentum we have with Creo and Windchill in the traditional CAD and PLM market with the leading CAD and PLM solutions in the pure-SaaS market. Together Arena and Onshape represent a powerful pure-SaaS solution that's number one in technology, customers and revenue. With this combo, we are positioned to capture the rapidly emerging shift toward SaaS for product development, manufacturing and support. There is clear evidence that the global pandemic has been driving a new normal in our industry and we are now in a position to lead the product development market well into the future. We also announced an organization strategy that I am excited about. We are expanding our SaaS business unit initially built around Onshape and Vuforia to embrace Arena as well. This will put us in position to pursue technology, business process and revenue synergies across the SaaS portfolio. The expanded business unit, which now accounts for about $100 million of ARR and about 20% of PTC's bookings, will be led by long time PTC leader, Mike DiTullio. Mike will focus on integrating the Arena team and leveraging the tremendous talent and expertise we have across our SaaS portfolio. With his proven track record of aligning organizations to drive growth, I am confident that in this new role, Mike can help us fully capitalize on our SaaS leadership position. I am also pleased to announce that Jamie Pappas will succeed Mike as Head of Global Sales, reporting to our Chief Operating Officer, Troy Richardson. Jamie is an accomplished 25-year PTC sales veteran and he has led Regional Sales in Asia, Europe, and most recently in North America. Jamie has a tremendous track record of success at PTC. So I am confident in a smooth transition as he assumed his new role. With that, I'd like to turn to Slide 5 and review the three key elements of our strategy to deliver long-term shareholder value. First, let's cover the topic of market demand. We had outstanding bookings results in the first quarter, up more than 30% year-over-year versus the fiscal Q1 of last year that was largely unaffected by the pandemic. The bookings helped the Q1 results, but they also beefed up the future backlog. We see the booking strength is reflecting a continuation of the secular demand trends we experienced in fiscal 2020 as customers accelerated their digital transformation initiatives in response to the new way of doing business. Industrial companies are prioritizing initiatives like moving all product lifecycle processes online across their entire enterprise with PLM, remotely monitoring the products and factories with IoT, bringing digital productivity to their frontline production workers with AR and they are generally getting more and more interested in SaaS as they go forward. For PTC this all translates into more demand for our unique product portfolio and we see a strong pipeline heading into the balance of the fiscal year. Given that the global PMI number reached its highest point in three years in December, we also believe PTC's strong Q1 bookings may have reflected improved customer optimism around promising vaccine news, stimulus policies of the new administration in Washington and perhaps even some calendar year-end budget flush. We hope that optimization or optimism continues, but with mixed news related to the global pandemic, including concerns about new strains of the virus, we are not sure that we are out of the woods yet, and we continue to think that our outlook for the year is prudent. In the topline category, a combination of strong bookings and lower than expected churn translated into a very strong quarter with ARR growth of 16% or 12% in constant currency. This was at the high-end of our guidance range and was driven by continued momentum in our Core business and solid performance in the Growth business. Revenue growth of 20% was well above guidance, resulting from strong large deal activity in the quarter. In the bottom line category, we delivered strong free cash flow of $111 million and non-GAAP EPS growth of 70%, reflecting a combination of strong topline results combined with continued operating expense discipline. In the wake of this strong first quarter, we are increasing our guidance for the year and Kristian will share the details later in the call. With that as context, let's take a look at the respective contributions of the FSG, Core and Growth segments of our portfolio. Moving to Slide 6. You'll see that ARR in our Focused Solution Group or FSG was flat year-over-year, but ARR growth was robust in our much larger Core business once again and the mid 20s growth performance of our Growth business track to our guidance for the year. You might note visually that the Growth business has now reached roughly the same magnitude as FSG and with Arena coming into the picture, it will soon step up about 30% and then with its higher growth rates, it will soon become much larger driving the combined portfolio toward higher growth rates as well. Recall that our FSG segment has exposure to certain industries heavily impacted by the pandemic like retail and airline industries. However, our FSG products remain important and are very competitive and we continue to expect FSG to recover to low single-digit ARR growth in fiscal 2021 as economic conditions improve. We've seen some good progress in retail already, but as you know, the airline business remains difficult for everybody. Naturally, we are very pleased about the 12% ARR growth of our Core business, which materially outpaced the market growth again. Q1 was the 13th consecutive quarter that our Core business ARR growth rate has been in double-digits. As Jay Vleeschhouwer pointed out in the recent report, PTC has of late enjoyed the number one growth rate in the traditional CAD industry with Creo and our Windchill business has been doing even better. Meanwhile, our Growth business had another strong quarter with year-over-year bookings growth of nearly 40% and delivered ARR growth in the mid-20s in line with our guidance for the year. Let's go a click deeper into the main elements of our Core and Growth segments. Turning to Slide 7. Our Creo CAD team delivered another impressive quarter with ARR growth in the high-single digits. The improvement in the demand environment that we started to see in Q4 continued this past quarter with strong performance across all major geos and in a market that tends to see very little replacement activity, we had some notable CAD competitive displacements, which speaks to the technological strength of the Creo product suite. Our CAD technology leadership was further extended with the latest release of Creo 7, which incorporates our first Atlas-based offering, Creo Generative Design Extension or GDX as we call it, leverages the Frustum Generative Design Engine acquired in 2019 with the compute being uploaded to an Atlas pure-SaaS elastic computing environment from where it served to Creo sessions now and soon to Onshape sessions as well. We also released the high-fidelity mainstream simulation capabilities of ANSYS, fully integrated into Creo, creating another highly differentiated leg of growth for our CAD business. Speaking of ANSYS, on Slide 8, we highlight a great Creo and Creo Simulation Live or CSL win with SharkNinja. SharkNinja is becoming a household name and to respond to the growing demand for its products in a very competitive space, SharkNinja reevaluated its design technology and decided to phase-out competitive CAD systems and standardize on Creo, adding CSL to help accelerate the new product development cycle times. Moving on to Slide 9 in our PLM business. You'll see that PLM continued to deliver very strong performance with another mid-teens ARR growth quarter. From a geographic perspective in Q1, PLM performance was broad-based with double-digit growth across all three major geographies, led again by the APAC region. Thanks to its key role in digital transformation initiatives, PLM continues to be a major growth engine for PTC. From a vertical perspective, our PLM team continues to win big in the medical device space, but market traction in the first quarter was strong across a number of verticals, including automotive, aerospace and defense and high-tech. Turning to Slide 10. A great proof point in A&D was a major extension and expansion at Airbus, which also happen to include a competitive displacement in one of their division. Along with the Windchill footprint expansion, Airbus adopted ThingWorx and Vuforia in the manufacturing environment, which is another great example of the cross-sell opportunity within our product portfolio. Given today's difficult air transportation market, airframe companies are being careful with spending, but thanks to this deal PTC is locked into a substantial long-term relationship with Airbus. You see on Slide 11 that we had a great cloud-based Windchill win at Terumo in the medical device space. Terumo is replacing its paper-based FDA compliance system with an end-to-end digital thread based on Windchill's quality management solution. Moving on to our Growth segment, I'll begin with IoT on Slide 12. Following strong bookings performance in Q4, IoT had a solid start to the year with a promising uptick in new logo bookings and the area that was pressured over the last year due to travel restrictions and lockdown. Demand was broad-based across verticals and we had some sizable expansion deals in the process manufacturing space, which is greenfield for PTC. With the strong pipeline and encouraging signs of churn improvement in IoT as well, we expect to see continued solid ARR growth in fiscal 2021. On Slide 13, we have an example of ThingWorx in the process manufacturing space at Griffin Foods. Operating in a market that has relatively thin margin, Griffin Foods was looking for ways to accelerate efficiencies in its production environment. Leveraging the ThingWorx Smart Connected Operations or SCO solution, they are digitizing their production lines to capture key performance data and display it in a unified view to allow managers to see problems and make faster, more informed decisions on the plant floor. Let me shift to our AR business on Slide 14. The Vuforia augmented reality team again delivered very strong results in Q1 with bookings up 80% year-over-year. Expansions drove over 50% of bookings in the quarter with three deals greater than $500,000, which was a new record for the AR team. Traction outside the Americas continued to gain momentum with strong growth in both Europe and APAC. Let me share two examples that highlights the value of our broader AR suite. First, on Slide 15 is at BID Group, one of the largest integrated suppliers in the wood processing industry. The BID Group replaced a do-it-yourself or DIY approach for industrial IoT and then added Vuforia Chalk to the mix to improve workforce productivity, while reducing travel costs. Turning to Slide 16, a second great AR success story is Royal Enfield, the world's oldest motorcycle brand. As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded, Royal Enfield was forced to reimagine a planned physical event for launching a new motorcycle. Leveraging Vuforia Studio in under a month, they built a dynamic sales training capability and deliver this highly effective interactive augmented reality experience to more than 3,000 remote participants. Turning now to Slide 17, I'll wrap up my comments on our Growth business by discussing Onshape, which also delivered a very strong quarter. Onshape had record bookings up more than 150% from its initial quarter at PTC one-year ago, including a nice balance of new logo activity and expansion. Onshape's pure-SaaS CAD solution is quickly becoming a disruptive force in the SMB space, shaking up a mature market segment where PTC has been underrepresented for years. I'd like to update you on the exciting trends we are seeing in the education market with Onshape. As the COVID pandemic unfolded, we saw a real opportunity to help schools and universities because we have the only true school-from-home CAD solution that works on any device with no installed footprint. PTC's academic team decided to pivot their focus to Onshape and set an aggressive goal to try to reach 1 million total education users by the end of fiscal 2021. To put that in perspective, it's double the number of users that were participating in our education program across all PTC products at that time. I am happy to report that already in January, we've exceeded the goal of 1 million total Onshape education users, nine months ahead of schedule. Onshape is quickly becoming the education standard, thanks to one of the greatest sheer shifts I've experienced. Students and teachers love it. Clearly, we caught a wave as world events and the changing needs in education have accelerated this achievement. It's been incredibly rewarding to see how many educators and students have been able to take advantage of Onshape. Students who would not normally have access to CAD are now able to engage in STEM classes. Robotics teams are able to compete even when their season is canceled and educators have been able to seamlessly continue their instruction because of their access to Onshape. On Slide 18, we highlight one of the many school systems supporting their K12 STEM Education Program by adopting Onshape, in this case across the Charlottesville City School System. Gaining 1 million student users is a huge milestone with significant implications for PTC well into the future. Manufacturing companies at the very same needs a real-time collaboration and access to data from anywhere and on any device. I continue to think that COVID crisis is accelerating the SaaS tipping point for the engineering software industry by several years. On Slide 19, you'll see a great example of a commercial company Stirling Ultracold doing the same thing. They are adopting Onshape to streamline communication between mechanical designers, supply chain managers, manufacturing and quality assurance teams to avoid the delays associated with sending CAD data back and forth by email like they used to do. To wrap up on our Growth business, I think it's pretty clear that our solutions are uniquely positioned to help customers respond to the new normal they are facing today and they provide a very strong foundation for long-term growth for PTC. Let me provide some color on geographic performance, which was strong across the globe. On Slide 20, you'll see that APAC had strong performance with ARR growth of 16%, reflecting the earlier reopening of those economies and much improved churn rates as our subscription licensing model gains increased acceptance. Americas ARR growth of 13% was the second quarter in a row of double-digit growth, driven by broad-based demand across our Core and Growth segments, but partially offset by softness in FSG. Europe ARR growth of 8% faced a tough year-over-year comparison, but delivered very strong bookings performance in both our Core and Growth segments along with some notable competitive wins. With that, now let me turn to Slide 21 and touch on our key alliance partners. The Microsoft partnership had another strong quarter, delivering above plan for the third consecutive quarter and exceeding expectations in all geos. As you saw in their earnings release yesterday, Microsoft has a lot of momentum and we are drafting behind it. With a solid pipeline and field engagement strengthening across the globe, we remain bullish on the Microsoft Alliance opportunity. Rockwell delivered over 20 expansion deals and had transactions in 27 countries. The majority of Rockwell's deals continue to come from customers that are greenfield to PTC and in process industries that we have not traditionally targeted with our core products. I was pleased to see in their earnings release that Rockwell too is seeing a strong uptick in orders. If you follow Rockwell, you may be aware that they have reorganized to have a software-focused business unit that owns the PTC partnership and yesterday they announced that they have hired Brian Shepherd to head up that unit. Brian worked directly for me at PTC for a dozen years. So I know that Rockwell has found a very capable software leader and somebody who can help the PTC Rockwell relationship unleash its fullest potential. Congratulations to Brian. We are looking forward to working with him. Lastly, on the Alliance front, our ANSYS-powered solutions had a solid quarter with 20% bookings growth and very healthy expansion activity that drove around half of Q1 bookings. To complement CSL in the market, we launched the broader and deeper Creo ANSYS simulation suite. We are expecting these ANSYS-powered solutions to account for high single-digit percentage of our new CAD ACV in fiscal 2021. Before I wrap up, I'd like to highlight a great win we had with Microsoft on Slide 22. The Colruyt Group was looking for an IoT platform to support a complete digital transformation of their shops, food production, energy production and logistics. Microsoft received an RFP in a competitive bid process and turned to PTC to partner on the opportunity. We ultimately won together, resulting in a multi-phase hybrid cloud IIoT project. To wrap up and summarize my comments, turning to Slide 23. We are off to a great start in fiscal 2021 as customers continue to embark on digital transformation initiatives that leverage our full product portfolio. We had strong bookings in the quarter and churn performance was good as well. We delivered ARR at the high-end of guidance, while adding to the backlog, we saw a great performance in Core and Growth segments and in our channel. The demand environment appears to be improving globally and our strategic alliances continue to grow and mature. Plus, with the Arena team joining forces with Onshape, PTC is now positioned as the number one leader in SaaS-based CAD and PLM and along with Vuforia, the sizable pure-SaaS portfolio is paving the way toward an attractive future proof business model for PTC. As Kristian will detail shortly, we are pleased to be raising our fiscal 2021 guidance in recognition of solid execution that demonstrates our capability to deliver strong topline growth, margin expansion and free cash flow generation. The necessary ingredients to drive significant shareholder value for years to come. With that, I'll turn it over to you Kristian to take us through more details on the financial results and guidance.\nKristian Talvitie: Thanks, Jim and good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our results, I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance, and all growth rate references will be in constant currency. Let me start off with a brief review of our first quarter results and then spend the balance of the call on our revised outlook for fiscal 2021. Turning to Slide 25. Fiscal Q1 ARR of $1.34 billion increased 12% year-over-year. As Jim noted earlier, we had very strong bookings performance in Q1, resulting in new ACV above expectations and consistent with recent trends, demand for ramp deals was strong, which contributes to backlog in future periods, primarily fiscal 2022 and beyond. With solid new ACV results along with churn coming in better than expected, we were pleased to deliver constant currency ARR growth at the high-end of the guidance range. Reported ARR growth of 16% benefited from 400 basis points of currency, including a 200 basis point tailwind since the beginning of fiscal 2021. Strong Q1 free cash flow of $111 million was a record Q1 results for PTC. Q1 revenue of $429 million increased 20% year-over-year and was well above the annual guidance range we had provided last quarter. Revenue performance was driven by very strong large deal results in the quarter, many of which had long contract duration. As we've discussed previously, revenue was impacted by ASC 606, which in the case of Q1 drove a higher amount of upfront subscription revenue recognized in the quarter. Currency was also a modest revenue tailwind. The strong revenue growth along with continued financial discipline resulted in non-GAAP EPS growth of 70% year-over-year. Turning to Page 26, I'll begin with our balance sheet. We ended Q1 with cash of $399 million and $1 billion of gross debt with an aggregate interest rate of 3.8%. Subsequent to the first quarter, we financed the Arena acquisition with $600 million from our revolving credit facility and cash on hand. From a use of cash standpoint, we plan first to pay down the revolver until we are below our 3x debt-to-EBITDA ratio target, which should be within the next couple of quarters. Over the medium-term, we expect to continue to delever, while also resuming share repurchase. Now turning to guidance, I'll begin on Slide 27 by highlighting a few of the key guidance assumptions. We continue to expect the macro environment to remain stable in the near-term with conditions improving in the second half of the fiscal year. With this as context, we are also still expecting fiscal 2021 bookings growth in the double digits on a year-over-year basis. Given our strong Q1 performance, we are raising the low-end of our organic ARR growth from 9% to 10% resulting in a range of 10% to 12% growth for the fiscal year. We are expecting Arena to add approximately 400 basis points of ARR growth and currency to add approximately 200 basis points of ARR growth relative to our previous guidance. Regarding ARR in fiscal 2021, on a constant currency basis, we continue to expect growth rates to be fairly linear each quarter throughout the fiscal year. Now for the specifics. Turning to Slide 28. We are expecting fiscal 2021 ARR of $1.47 billion to $1.5 billion, that's a growth rate of 16% to 18%. Free cash flow is still expected to be approximately $340 million for the full-year, which is growth of approximately 60% year-over-year. Note that currency is also benefiting free cash flow by about $15 million. However, this benefit is being offset by an un-forecasted foreign tax assessment related to a matter that's been open for a few years. This tax matter is also reflected in our GAAP results as you'll note a $35 million charge that covers the periods from 2011 to 2020. This charge reflects the previous assessment paid in 2016, as well as the current expected assessment. We continue to believe that our position is correct and are fighting this issue in court and we do not expect a final resolution on the matter for at least another year. Our $340 million free cash flow target also includes approximately $15 million of acquisition-related fees and an additional $5 million of incremental interest we expect to pay this year due to the debt we took on to help finance the Arena acquisition. And as a reminder, fiscal 2021 free cash flow also includes approximately $15 million of restructuring payments related to primarily to the headquarters relocation, as well as to cost actions we took early in fiscal 2020, that\u2019s early last year. Regarding the linearity of free cash flow in fiscal 2021, we still expect to generate more than 60% of our annual free cash flow in the first half as collections are stronger in the first half and this is offset by expenses increasing as we ramp hiring throughout the year. Now turning to P&L guidance. We are raising our revenue and EPS guidance for the year. We are now expecting fiscal 2021 revenue of $1.69 billion to $1.73 billion, that's a growth rate of 16% to 19% and the increased revenue guidance is really driven by three main factors. First, the strong large deal activity and longer than anticipated contract durations that we saw in Q1, which as we've mentioned before because of ASC 606 is driving higher upfront revenue recognition. This ultimately is contributing about 400 basis points of growth. As a reminder, this change has no impact on ARR or free cash flow as we continue to build customers annually upfront. Second, the Arena acquisition, which will add approximately 300 basis points of growth. And lastly, FX or currency, which should add approximately 200 basis points of growth relative to our prior guidance. On the expense front, we are now expecting operating expense growth of approximately 16% in fiscal 2021. This is an increase of approximately 600 basis points. Half of the increase is related to the Arena acquisition and half related to currency. Non-GAAP EPS is now expected to be $3.05 to $3.25, which is growth of 19% to 26%. I'd also note here that GAAP guidance does not include the impact of Arena Solutions purchase accounting as the valuation of acquired assets and liabilities work is not yet been completed. Wrapping up, we had strong financial performance again here in Q1, we delivered double-digit ARR growth, while maintaining discipline on our expense structure and continue to navigate in a very challenging macro environment. The strong start to the year positions us well to deliver attractive double-digit topline growth and very strong free cash flow. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator and we can begin Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Your question please.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Thank you. Good evening. Jim, let me start with a technology question for you having to do with the Arena acquisition. With that you now arguably have three code basis for PLM, Arena, Windchill and Onshape that's not unprecedented in the industry. As you know, as a result of acquisitions in technical software. But could you talk about how you're thinking about the co-development or the conjoining of those technologies, particularly given the ultimate objective you seem to have had with Atlas of having a micro services architecture for example. And then for Kristian, at the analyst meeting, you put up a very interesting slide on your customer engagement model showing seven categories of customer that I don't think you've shown before. How does your guidance encompass you're thinking about those various categories in terms of growth and contribution to fiscal 2021. Thank you.\nJames Heppelmann: All right, great. Thanks, Jay. Kristian, you start thinking about the answer to that, while I answer him. Yes. So it's a good observation. I mean, we have Windchill then we acquired Onshape and they were two different things and now we acquired Arena. So yes, in fact, we have three. But actually we do have a very well understood strategy. So first of all, we will begin the process of looking at the best ways for Arena to use more and more of the Atlas platform that came to us with Onshape. And to be frank, Arena and Onshape don't do exactly the same things. Onshape is more like file management except not really files but more like data management and collaboration and Onshape is more like bill of material. So those two things do different things, but they will over time share more and more of a common architecture called Atlas. So then that leads to Windchill. So we have shared kind of a mid-term project that we are developing versions of Windchill and Creo that will use the Atlas platform to a great extent, so that they can be delivered in a SaaS model, but those products will retain full upward compatibility from the on-premise versions that exist today. Now, we will continue to maintain an on-premise version. So you might say, we're going from 3 to 2 to 1.5 or something like that, but there is a good strategy here for how this stuff evolves and none of it's going to be revolution because we're bringing all the customers with. But I definitely think this is a problem that will fade away and we've done that before. It's a problem that \u2013 I'm not sure it's a problem, but it's a situation that will be \u2013 that will evolve over time toward a cleaner kind of steady state in the end. Kristian?\nKristian Talvitie: Yes. Great. Jay, so I think what you're referring to is that S1 to S6 customer engagement model. I mean, I think here conceptually the right way to think about it is the largest piece of our ARR really comes from S1 \u2013 the S1 and S2 space that also actually where we still see a significant amount of new booking activity. Those are our largest and customers with the biggest growth prospects. We have a lot of stable ARR in kind of the S3 and S4 space. And the new \u2013 really the land and expand activity happens primarily within the S5 and S6 space. And so I mean, if I was going to think about this. I'd still put the largest chunk up in S1 and S2, we're seeing a lot of momentum in the S5 and S6. Tim or we actually mentioned in the \u2013 on the call that we've seen a little bit of a resurgence in new IoT customers coming back in the channel, which also operates in kind of the S5, S6 and the channel space continues to bring in new customers. That's obviously also where I think relationships like Rockwell are, who also continue to bring in a lot of new greenfield customers, which are the foundation, really for us to continue to expand upon those relationships over time. So I don't know if that answers your question, but...\nJames Heppelmann: Let me add some color to that, I think it's a easier way to see it. I think if you look at it by product, you get a different story because the size, the relatively larger size of some products kind of overwhelms that story. But Arena and Onshape are all about new accounts, they're basically competing in a space where we didn't previously have products competing. So there are almost entirely new accounts. If you go to IoT and AR that's kind of 50-50 because those are products we can sell to our traditional accounts, but of course, there's a lot of demand and interest in IoT and AR and we have new partners like Rockwell that also take us to a lot of new places. And then if you go back to Creo and Windchill, I mean, that would be majority of the bookings coming from companies we've been doing business with, but sometimes we knock one offer, there is a consolidation play or something like that and as well the channel is bringing this new accounts. So I think it's almost all new for Onshape and Arena, roughly half and half-ish for IoT and AR and sort of majority maybe 70/30 in favor of installed base with Creo and Windchill.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Borg with Stifel. Your question please.\nAdam Borg: Hey, guys, and thanks for taking the question. Maybe just two real quick. First on Arena. Can you just remind us on Arena's kind of international footprint and what's the plans to kind of expand that both direct and via channel? And then maybe two different answers. So thanks for the color of how you're thinking about Creo Simulation Live and Creo Simulation Growth over the back half of the year. But when you think more broadly, how addressable is the Creo Simulation technology to your broader installed-base. Thanks for that.\nJames Heppelmann: Yes. So let me say, on your first question Arena. Arena is predominantly a U.S. business, it's been almost \u2013 to a very great degree sold to American companies, although some American companies have users overseas. But it hasn't really been sold to companies overseas with just a small exception. So the first thing we're going to do with the Arena for sure is go international with it. I mean, that's a good piece of growth we ought to be able to go after as a synergy. And then of course cross selling between Onshape and Arena ought to produce another synergy. And I think our channel ought to produce yet another synergy. So I'm sort of the opinion that there is a lot of upside to Arena, if not this year, certainly in the coming years, as we can take this business places that Arena themselves going to gone so easily. So that's maybe the first part. Then second on ANSYS, if I remember we had quantified that we thought there was $100 million potential opportunity with Creo Simulation Live in our base. I think that's before. I don't know if, Tim, did that include this mainstream simulation products. No. So I haven't quantified that, but well more than $100 million because the rest of the ANSYS suite actually comes at a higher price point. We probably get less penetration because some of them might already have purchased it from ANSYS or one of their distributors. But certainly $100 million would be the floor in terms of opportunity. Will we ever get 100% of that, no? But certainly is a sizable ARR opportunity for us.\nAdam Borg: Great. Thanks again.\nKristian Talvitie: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Valera with Needham. Your question please.\nRichard Valera: Thank you. Good evening, gentlemen. First, just a quick follow-up on that ANSYS question. I know you have the target of high single-digit percentage of new CAD ACV for this year. Can you say where it was last year, just so we have some perspective on how much growth that was. And then for the IoT products, it sounds like a solid performance this quarter, but I know last quarter you talked about bookings doubling quarter-over-quarter. I'm just wondering you can give us any sense of the kind of quarter-over-quarter momentum you saw in that business from Q4 to Q1. Thank you.\nJames Heppelmann: Do you have a quantification Kristian on the size ANSYS would have been in terms of new ACV within CAD last year?\nKristian Talvitie: Nominal.\nJames Heppelmann: Nominal. I mean, it would have been some, because we had some initial sales.\nKristian Talvitie: Will get it, but it was nominal.\nJames Heppelmann: Yes. It would have been low-single digits. So I think they were going from low-single digits to high-single digits, would be our aspiration here.\nRichard Valera: Got it. That's helpful.\nJames Heppelmann: And then on the Q4 to Q1. Q1 IoT bookings didn't have the same growth rate that they had in Q4, but again it was a healthy number, I mean in Q4, it was a very healthy number. And in both cases, a lot of that went into backlog. So you're seeing a situation where the backlog deficit we started this year with had a fairly good representation in IoT and that's slowing down our IoT growth rate. And some of the goodness that we're bringing in with new bookings is going into backlog and it will help next year, but it doesn't necessarily overcoming the deficit we started the year with. So anyway, we're still on plan. So it's not a bad thing. But putting more bookings in the backlog for next year and the year after is a good thing.\nRichard Valera: That makes sense. Thanks, gentlemen.\nJames Heppelmann: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Your question please.\nJackson Ader: Hey, guys it's Jackson Ader on for Sterling tonight. Thanks for taking our questions. First one is a follow-up on the IoT bookings and kind of a good start to the year. Any particular verticals that really stuck out and maybe verticals that performed well outside of the Rockwell channel for IoT?\nJames Heppelmann: Yes. We looked at that data Jack and it really was pretty broad representation. Tim and I were studying that data and nothing really jumps out, it's sort of a little bit everywhere in more or less the percentage we kind of normally have. So broad based is how I would characterize that.\nJackson Ader: Okay. And then another bookings question and vertical question really on Onshape. If we think about the \u2013 up well over 150% from bookings, what if we stripped out education. What kind of mixes are the bookings coming from education versus non-education?\nJames Heppelmann: That's an easy one, Jack, because you don't have to strip it out. We've not been charging educational institutions for the software. However, we had a program that you can use it for free for the first year. So we do anticipate that as this school year ramps up and we move into next year, we're going to get a pretty decent conversion rate to pay. But in that good news that we have so far, it's all commercial sales.\nJackson Ader: Great. Okay. Thank you.\nKristian Talvitie: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Saket Kalia with Barclays. Your question please.\nSaket Kalia: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my \u2013 hey, Tim, Jim and Kristian, thanks for taking my question here. I'll just keep it to one. Jim maybe for you. I think the business that surprised us all last year and I think continues to do here in Q1 is the performance in PLM. Maybe the question is how much of this do you think is from maybe an industry wide refresh, right? That's may be coming from just more digital transformation as you sort of hinted out before versus market share gains.\nJames Heppelmann: Well, I mean, first of all, I do think there is some real strong market share gains. I don't think other vendors are performing at the same level as we have been and it's been a long time since and have you guys asked me when Aeris was disrupting us. We kind of haven't heard that name in ages. So I think they're losing some real momentum. So I think it really is more companies are realizing that they \u2013 if they have PLM, they need to have it more broadly and more people need to use it. Like maybe the procurement guy could walk down the hall and talk to the engineers. But now they are working from home, we can't. And so we need to see it. So I think some of it is existing companies broadening and deepening their implementation. And then, I think there's a lot of companies who like the Terumo example we gave, who was doing their FDA compliance literally on paper, saying, okay, that's not going to work, we need to get a PLM system. We need to get it fast. So I think there's a lot of companies whose appreciation of PLM has deepened greatly in the last couple of years. First for digital transformation in general and then for COVID requiring it. And I think that of those companies who get religion around PLM, we're certainly not going down more than our fair share. That's how I would characterize that.\nSaket Kalia: Got it. That's very helpful. I'll hop back in queue. Thanks.\nJames Heppelmann: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Vruwink with Baird. Your question please.\nJames Heppelmann: Hi, Joe.\nJoseph Vruwink: Hi, everyone. I'll try to squeeze into one more near-term from the mid-December comments on ARR the quarter definitely it's been a stronger than that communication. Is there any activity that came in at quarter end? I know you talked about maybe some year-end budget plus. But anything else, the fact that large deal signings seem to be working back into the mix where you had may be point to quarter activity and think it perhaps as early but these developments are new and maybe to be extrapolated into something changing. And then the second question, it kind of gets back to the PLM question that was just asked. But the verticals of high-tech, life sciences, aerospace and defense, these have been really strong for PTC pretty consistently and now you're adding Arena, which is strong in those verticals as well. So is there something specifically about those markets and how they're viewing PLM that really has benefited the fact that PTC has good exposure there?\nJames Heppelmann: Yes. So let's take the first one. Our mid-December comments Kristian said, he anticipated, we'd be in the middle of the 9% to 12% range and we came in at 12%. So I think to be frank, what happened is we review the forecast every single week on Friday's and we raised it four times in December. So by the time we had that meeting with you. We had raised at once, but a couple of days later, we raised it again and then twice more. So if you study the PLM performance, of course we do, what you'd see is that it wasn't done the backs of any one geography or any one vertical or any one big deal. It was just a lot of deals of all sizes in all geographies across a bunch of different verticals. I mean, it just felt like just good solid business everywhere as opposed to some surprise. I think if you go to the verticals question you asked, I think Arena is very strong in high-tech and very strong in general in SMB. Now high-tech does tend to have a lot of SMB customers. And the other thing about high-tech is product life cycles tend to be very short. If you make 777's like Boeing does, it's very hard to switch CAD systems, because those products last for decades. But if you're making consumer handheld devices, the life on one those things pretty darn short and the next version isn't based on the last version. So you can switch tools much more easily. So I think in general, electronics and high-tech is a fast cycle market and it's easier to get a share shift to happen there, which helps both Onshape and Arena by the way. Now PTC does well in the larger electronics and high-tech customers who probably are selling stuff that ends up in a rack in the data center and big machines that have a lot of electronics in them and so forth. That aren't necessarily so short cycle and whatnot. In the case of aerospace and defense, I mean, Arena does have some aerospace and defense accounts that are generally small suppliers to larger firms, but I would say probably, that's not necessarily the best spot to sell Arena, other than if you're low in the supply chain and there are a lot of small suppliers in the aerospace and defense supply chain in part because the government encourages that. So I think Onshape and we're also coming out with ITAR version of Onshape for the same reason that these smaller accounts need something and really just don't have the wherewithal for the bigger heavier enterprise systems that masters at the top of their supply chain would prefer. So I think maybe a long way of [indiscernible] Arena and Onshape are very complementary [indiscernible] Creo and Windchill, they do the same thing but they appeal to different segments of the market. And the low end of the market doesn't want the high-end products and the high end of the market today doesn't want the low end products. That may happen over time. But right now it's all incremental upside as far as I'm concerned.\nJoseph Vruwink: That's great. Thank you very much.\nJames Heppelmann: Thanks, Joe.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Your question please.\nJames Heppelmann: Hey, Matt.\nMatthew Hedberg: Hey, guys. Good evening. Congrats on a really strong quarter here in Q1. Jim, I wanted to ask you a question about some of the CAD replacement deals. Obviously, this is really good to hear and obviously difficult to pull off. I'm wondering if you could provide a few more details on what drove those? And thinking longer-term with all your investment in SaaS, CAD and Atlas, I mean, do you think we might be in a scenario where you might see even more disruption in the future. Some of these CAD replacements, considering what you've done with SaaS versus some of your peers.\nJames Heppelmann: Yes. So there is two in particular. I'll talk about one really with SharkNinja. But let me cover the other one first. It was a European OEM, I can't tell you who it was, I will be able to at some point, but not yet. I don't yet have permission. But an OEM who had both our software and our CAD software and the competitors and use them both as many large OEMs do. And they decided that they didn't like that anymore. And they would really prefer to have one tool and if they had to go from two to one they will go into Creo. So that was a pretty substantial displacement of a very well-known high-end product. And then the other case really was a displacement of a very well-known low-end product. Where this account said \u2013 SharkNinja said, we really like what Creo can do and we really like CSL and so forth and we too don't like having two sets of tools. And if we had to pick one, we pick Creo. So kind of at opposite ends of the Creo range, if you will, we're displacing different products from the same vendor. And that vendor, you can guess who it is, it has kind of left their customers a little frustrated. Some of their business policies, some of their technical strategies are well accepted by the customers and it's creating some discontent and some of that discontent turns into switching, especially if you're looking at two tools and you're saying, I wish we had one. Well, I really like those PTC guys, their tools are great and are better to work with.\nMatthew Hedberg: Thank you.\nJames Heppelmann: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gal Munda with Berenberg. Your question please.\nGal Munda: Hey. Yes, thank you for taking my question. Jim, I have a question for you in terms of the IoT. In the past you've said that a lot of your IoT growth in the future will be obviously rely on some of the partners and then bring on incremental new opportunities mainly talking about Rockwell obviously and also Microsoft. Recently, few days ago, you've announced kind of partnership with Fujitsu Smart Factory on the IoT initiative. And I was just wondering how much \u2013 how does that compared to something like Rockwell? And how complementary it is versus how much is it as a competitive channels or something like Rockwell as well, which clearly isn't exclusive for other. Thank you.\nJames Heppelmann: Yes. There is no exclusivity there would happened with Fujitsu, as I understand the story. First they implemented our software in their factories and it was quite successful. And then there is a system integrator arm of Fujitsu who said, we'd like to take this showcase we've built in our own company and take it down the road and sell it to other companies. And so that's the nature of that announcement. But Fujitsu as an SI is no Rockwell. So I don't really \u2013 they're much more localized in certain pockets and so forth. And they're important partner and we're glad to have them. But I don't think it's meaningful at the level of a Rockwell partnership, certainly not yet maybe we'll get there someday. But just think of them as two different tiers.\nGal Munda: Got you. But the idea is to really expand that channel partnership within the FY Q2 kind of [indiscernible].\nJames Heppelmann: Yes. I mean, a lot of SI's want to sell with us where we sell the software and they do the project. And that's motion has been working very well. And then some SI's, in some cases like Fujitsu say, well, could we just sell it, because we have some clients we'd like to go. Basically sell them what we've done in our own company and we'd like to take that order. But think that for every Fujitsu. There is multiple SI's that we sell with rather than thrilled.\nGal Munda: Got you. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question will be from Matthew Broome with Mizuho Securities. Your question please.\nMatthew Broome: Thanks very much. Hi Jim, Kristian and Tim. Thanks for squeezing me in. So just in terms of the new SaaS business unit. Is that more of an operational structure? Or is it also responsible for driving future SaaS strategy, including M&A and maybe the migration of your co-products?\nJames Heppelmann: Yes. I mean, it's a business unit that's quite complete. It has R&D and marketing and sales, doesn't really new services because we don't so much need that. But it's really a pretty complete business unit. It has the P&L, it has growth targets, we will make acquisitions for them. In fact, Arena was an example. But we've made a couple other little tuck-ins that we didn't announce because they were too small. But definitely, that's a business and the way I look at it, they are paving the path for a future PTC. Because at some point, our industry will really go to SaaS, I mean it's starting to and that's good, but at some point it will tip right over like other industries have. And at that point that business unit will be bigger and bigger and may in fact be the future inner gravity for PTC. It's not big enough at $100 million \u2013 let's call it $1.4 billion. So it's not yet 10% but you put Arena in there and it steps up closer to 10% and then you let that growth rate run for a while and it won't be long before it's quite meaningful to us. But that's what they're doing, their paving the path for a future PTC.\nMatthew Broome: Okay, that makes sense. And then maybe just quickly, could you give us any idea in terms of what the win rates are for Onshape versus the competition.\nJames Heppelmann: Yes. Well, I think what it really comes down to is does a customer want SaaS or not. If they want SaaS, then the win rates exceptionally high, but they might decide they don't want SaaS for whatever reason. And it might be that other people in their company already use SolidWorks or what have you. But think of Onshape as a really good CAD system on a completely different deployment and business model. And the deployment and business model is even more differentiated \u2013 is more differentiated in the product itself is. So I think, smaller companies, say, I really like the idea of being able to get to this data without having a server, without having a system administrator, without having \u2013 I'd like to be able to pick up my work at home on my Macintosh if I worked on at all day on a Windows workstations. I mean, that's great. I like the real-time collaboration. Onshape is a multi-user system were multiple users work together on the same designs at the same time as opposed to multiple users working independently and pass the data back and forth, which is how most other CAD systems work. So I think again, I often say, think of it like electric vehicles versus internal combustion engines, it's religion at some level. And very few people get down to a shortlist that has three of each. Somewhere in the decision making process they either say, I want to electric and now I'm down to a shortlist of electric vehicles or I don't want electric, I'm going to stay with internal combustion and they end up with that shortlist. But I'm saying for those customers who say, I think I want SaaS. This is a good chance, we're going to win that deal.\nMatthew Broome: Thanks. All right, thanks very much.\nKristian Talvitie: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this ends our Q&A session. I will turn the call back to Tim Fox for final remarks.\nTimothy Fox: Thanks, Karen, and thanks everybody for joining us today on the call. Will be out on the road virtually over the next quarter, participating in a number of events, please check out our website for details. And we do look forward to seeing you this over the next coming months and certainly in 90 days. And thank you for your interest in PTC. Have a great evening.\nJames Heppelmann: Thank you, everybody.\nKristian Talvitie: Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: And thank you for your participation in today's conference. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kristian Talvitie",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim and good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our results, I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance, and all growth rate references will be in constant currency. Let me start off with a brief review of our first quarter results and then spend the balance of the call on our revised outlook for fiscal 2021. Turning to Slide 25. Fiscal Q1 ARR of $1.34 billion increased 12% year-over-year. As Jim noted earlier, we had very strong bookings performance in Q1, resulting in new ACV above expectations and consistent with recent trends, demand for ramp deals was strong, which contributes to backlog in future periods, primarily fiscal 2022 and beyond. With solid new ACV results along with churn coming in better than expected, we were pleased to deliver constant currency ARR growth at the high-end of the guidance range. Reported ARR growth of 16% benefited from 400 basis points of currency, including a 200 basis point tailwind since the beginning of fiscal 2021. Strong Q1 free cash flow of $111 million was a record Q1 results for PTC. Q1 revenue of $429 million increased 20% year-over-year and was well above the annual guidance range we had provided last quarter. Revenue performance was driven by very strong large deal results in the quarter, many of which had long contract duration. As we've discussed previously, revenue was impacted by ASC 606, which in the case of Q1 drove a higher amount of upfront subscription revenue recognized in the quarter. Currency was also a modest revenue tailwind. The strong revenue growth along with continued financial discipline resulted in non-GAAP EPS growth of 70% year-over-year. Turning to Page 26, I'll begin with our balance sheet. We ended Q1 with cash of $399 million and $1 billion of gross debt with an aggregate interest rate of 3.8%. Subsequent to the first quarter, we financed the Arena acquisition with $600 million from our revolving credit facility and cash on hand. From a use of cash standpoint, we plan first to pay down the revolver until we are below our 3x debt-to-EBITDA ratio target, which should be within the next couple of quarters. Over the medium-term, we expect to continue to delever, while also resuming share repurchase. Now turning to guidance, I'll begin on Slide 27 by highlighting a few of the key guidance assumptions. We continue to expect the macro environment to remain stable in the near-term with conditions improving in the second half of the fiscal year. With this as context, we are also still expecting fiscal 2021 bookings growth in the double digits on a year-over-year basis. Given our strong Q1 performance, we are raising the low-end of our organic ARR growth from 9% to 10% resulting in a range of 10% to 12% growth for the fiscal year. We are expecting Arena to add approximately 400 basis points of ARR growth and currency to add approximately 200 basis points of ARR growth relative to our previous guidance. Regarding ARR in fiscal 2021, on a constant currency basis, we continue to expect growth rates to be fairly linear each quarter throughout the fiscal year. Now for the specifics. Turning to Slide 28. We are expecting fiscal 2021 ARR of $1.47 billion to $1.5 billion, that's a growth rate of 16% to 18%. Free cash flow is still expected to be approximately $340 million for the full-year, which is growth of approximately 60% year-over-year. Note that currency is also benefiting free cash flow by about $15 million. However, this benefit is being offset by an un-forecasted foreign tax assessment related to a matter that's been open for a few years. This tax matter is also reflected in our GAAP results as you'll note a $35 million charge that covers the periods from 2011 to 2020. This charge reflects the previous assessment paid in 2016, as well as the current expected assessment. We continue to believe that our position is correct and are fighting this issue in court and we do not expect a final resolution on the matter for at least another year. Our $340 million free cash flow target also includes approximately $15 million of acquisition-related fees and an additional $5 million of incremental interest we expect to pay this year due to the debt we took on to help finance the Arena acquisition. And as a reminder, fiscal 2021 free cash flow also includes approximately $15 million of restructuring payments related to primarily to the headquarters relocation, as well as to cost actions we took early in fiscal 2020, that's early last year. Regarding the linearity of free cash flow in fiscal 2021, we still expect to generate more than 60% of our annual free cash flow in the first half as collections are stronger in the first half and this is offset by expenses increasing as we ramp hiring throughout the year. Now turning to P&L guidance. We are raising our revenue and EPS guidance for the year. We are now expecting fiscal 2021 revenue of $1.69 billion to $1.73 billion, that's a growth rate of 16% to 19% and the increased revenue guidance is really driven by three main factors. First, the strong large deal activity and longer than anticipated contract durations that we saw in Q1, which as we've mentioned before because of ASC 606 is driving higher upfront revenue recognition. This ultimately is contributing about 400 basis points of growth. As a reminder, this change has no impact on ARR or free cash flow as we continue to build customers annually upfront. Second, the Arena acquisition, which will add approximately 300 basis points of growth. And lastly, FX or currency, which should add approximately 200 basis points of growth relative to our prior guidance. On the expense front, we are now expecting operating expense growth of approximately 16% in fiscal 2021. This is an increase of approximately 600 basis points. Half of the increase is related to the Arena acquisition and half related to currency. Non-GAAP EPS is now expected to be $3.05 to $3.25, which is growth of 19% to 26%. I'd also note here that GAAP guidance does not include the impact of Arena Solutions purchase accounting as the valuation of acquired assets and liabilities work is not yet been completed. Wrapping up, we had strong financial performance again here in Q1, we delivered double-digit ARR growth, while maintaining discipline on our expense structure and continue to navigate in a very challenging macro environment. The strong start to the year positions us well to deliver attractive double-digit topline growth and very strong free cash flow. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator and we can begin Q&A. Yes. Great. Jay, so I think what you're referring to is that S1 to S6 customer engagement model. I mean, I think here conceptually the right way to think about it is the largest piece of our ARR really comes from S1 \u2013 the S1 and S2 space that also actually where we still see a significant amount of new booking activity. Those are our largest and customers with the biggest growth prospects. We have a lot of stable ARR in kind of the S3 and S4 space. And the new \u2013 really the land and expand activity happens primarily within the S5 and S6 space. And so I mean, if I was going to think about this. I'd still put the largest chunk up in S1 and S2, we're seeing a lot of momentum in the S5 and S6. Tim or we actually mentioned in the \u2013 on the call that we've seen a little bit of a resurgence in new IoT customers coming back in the channel, which also operates in kind of the S5, S6 and the channel space continues to bring in new customers. That's obviously also where I think relationships like Rockwell are, who also continue to bring in a lot of new greenfield customers, which are the foundation, really for us to continue to expand upon those relationships over time. So I don't know if that answers your question, but... Thank you. Nominal. Will get it, but it was nominal. Thank you. Thanks, Matt. Thanks, everybody."

            "content": "Thanks, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I hope that you and your families continue to stay safe and well during this ongoing pandemic. Before jumping into our quarterly review, I would like to begin by discussing the news we shared two weeks ago about closing the Arena acquisition and some related organizational changes. Turning to Slide 4 in the deck. First, we are very pleased to have closed the acquisition and we would like to formally welcome the Arena employees to the PTC team. As we discussed at our recent Investor Day, we are excited to complement the strong momentum we have with Creo and Windchill in the traditional CAD and PLM market with the leading CAD and PLM solutions in the pure-SaaS market. Together Arena and Onshape represent a powerful pure-SaaS solution that's number one in technology, customers and revenue. With this combo, we are positioned to capture the rapidly emerging shift toward SaaS for product development, manufacturing and support. There is clear evidence that the global pandemic has been driving a new normal in our industry and we are now in a position to lead the product development market well into the future. We also announced an organization strategy that I am excited about. We are expanding our SaaS business unit initially built around Onshape and Vuforia to embrace Arena as well. This will put us in position to pursue technology, business process and revenue synergies across the SaaS portfolio. The expanded business unit, which now accounts for about $100 million of ARR and about 20% of PTC's bookings, will be led by long time PTC leader, Mike DiTullio. Mike will focus on integrating the Arena team and leveraging the tremendous talent and expertise we have across our SaaS portfolio. With his proven track record of aligning organizations to drive growth, I am confident that in this new role, Mike can help us fully capitalize on our SaaS leadership position. I am also pleased to announce that Jamie Pappas will succeed Mike as Head of Global Sales, reporting to our Chief Operating Officer, Troy Richardson. Jamie is an accomplished 25-year PTC sales veteran and he has led Regional Sales in Asia, Europe, and most recently in North America. Jamie has a tremendous track record of success at PTC. So I am confident in a smooth transition as he assumed his new role. With that, I'd like to turn to Slide 5 and review the three key elements of our strategy to deliver long-term shareholder value. First, let's cover the topic of market demand. We had outstanding bookings results in the first quarter, up more than 30% year-over-year versus the fiscal Q1 of last year that was largely unaffected by the pandemic. The bookings helped the Q1 results, but they also beefed up the future backlog. We see the booking strength is reflecting a continuation of the secular demand trends we experienced in fiscal 2020 as customers accelerated their digital transformation initiatives in response to the new way of doing business. Industrial companies are prioritizing initiatives like moving all product lifecycle processes online across their entire enterprise with PLM, remotely monitoring the products and factories with IoT, bringing digital productivity to their frontline production workers with AR and they are generally getting more and more interested in SaaS as they go forward. For PTC this all translates into more demand for our unique product portfolio and we see a strong pipeline heading into the balance of the fiscal year. Given that the global PMI number reached its highest point in three years in December, we also believe PTC's strong Q1 bookings may have reflected improved customer optimism around promising vaccine news, stimulus policies of the new administration in Washington and perhaps even some calendar year-end budget flush. We hope that optimization or optimism continues, but with mixed news related to the global pandemic, including concerns about new strains of the virus, we are not sure that we are out of the woods yet, and we continue to think that our outlook for the year is prudent. In the topline category, a combination of strong bookings and lower than expected churn translated into a very strong quarter with ARR growth of 16% or 12% in constant currency. This was at the high-end of our guidance range and was driven by continued momentum in our Core business and solid performance in the Growth business. Revenue growth of 20% was well above guidance, resulting from strong large deal activity in the quarter. In the bottom line category, we delivered strong free cash flow of $111 million and non-GAAP EPS growth of 70%, reflecting a combination of strong topline results combined with continued operating expense discipline. In the wake of this strong first quarter, we are increasing our guidance for the year and Kristian will share the details later in the call. With that as context, let's take a look at the respective contributions of the FSG, Core and Growth segments of our portfolio. Moving to Slide 6. You'll see that ARR in our Focused Solution Group or FSG was flat year-over-year, but ARR growth was robust in our much larger Core business once again and the mid 20s growth performance of our Growth business track to our guidance for the year. You might note visually that the Growth business has now reached roughly the same magnitude as FSG and with Arena coming into the picture, it will soon step up about 30% and then with its higher growth rates, it will soon become much larger driving the combined portfolio toward higher growth rates as well. Recall that our FSG segment has exposure to certain industries heavily impacted by the pandemic like retail and airline industries. However, our FSG products remain important and are very competitive and we continue to expect FSG to recover to low single-digit ARR growth in fiscal 2021 as economic conditions improve. We've seen some good progress in retail already, but as you know, the airline business remains difficult for everybody. Naturally, we are very pleased about the 12% ARR growth of our Core business, which materially outpaced the market growth again. Q1 was the 13th consecutive quarter that our Core business ARR growth rate has been in double-digits. As Jay Vleeschhouwer pointed out in the recent report, PTC has of late enjoyed the number one growth rate in the traditional CAD industry with Creo and our Windchill business has been doing even better. Meanwhile, our Growth business had another strong quarter with year-over-year bookings growth of nearly 40% and delivered ARR growth in the mid-20s in line with our guidance for the year. Let's go a click deeper into the main elements of our Core and Growth segments. Turning to Slide 7. Our Creo CAD team delivered another impressive quarter with ARR growth in the high-single digits. The improvement in the demand environment that we started to see in Q4 continued this past quarter with strong performance across all major geos and in a market that tends to see very little replacement activity, we had some notable CAD competitive displacements, which speaks to the technological strength of the Creo product suite. Our CAD technology leadership was further extended with the latest release of Creo 7, which incorporates our first Atlas-based offering, Creo Generative Design Extension or GDX as we call it, leverages the Frustum Generative Design Engine acquired in 2019 with the compute being uploaded to an Atlas pure-SaaS elastic computing environment from where it served to Creo sessions now and soon to Onshape sessions as well. We also released the high-fidelity mainstream simulation capabilities of ANSYS, fully integrated into Creo, creating another highly differentiated leg of growth for our CAD business. Speaking of ANSYS, on Slide 8, we highlight a great Creo and Creo Simulation Live or CSL win with SharkNinja. SharkNinja is becoming a household name and to respond to the growing demand for its products in a very competitive space, SharkNinja reevaluated its design technology and decided to phase-out competitive CAD systems and standardize on Creo, adding CSL to help accelerate the new product development cycle times. Moving on to Slide 9 in our PLM business. You'll see that PLM continued to deliver very strong performance with another mid-teens ARR growth quarter. From a geographic perspective in Q1, PLM performance was broad-based with double-digit growth across all three major geographies, led again by the APAC region. Thanks to its key role in digital transformation initiatives, PLM continues to be a major growth engine for PTC. From a vertical perspective, our PLM team continues to win big in the medical device space, but market traction in the first quarter was strong across a number of verticals, including automotive, aerospace and defense and high-tech. Turning to Slide 10. A great proof point in A&D was a major extension and expansion at Airbus, which also happen to include a competitive displacement in one of their division. Along with the Windchill footprint expansion, Airbus adopted ThingWorx and Vuforia in the manufacturing environment, which is another great example of the cross-sell opportunity within our product portfolio. Given today's difficult air transportation market, airframe companies are being careful with spending, but thanks to this deal PTC is locked into a substantial long-term relationship with Airbus. You see on Slide 11 that we had a great cloud-based Windchill win at Terumo in the medical device space. Terumo is replacing its paper-based FDA compliance system with an end-to-end digital thread based on Windchill's quality management solution. Moving on to our Growth segment, I'll begin with IoT on Slide 12. Following strong bookings performance in Q4, IoT had a solid start to the year with a promising uptick in new logo bookings and the area that was pressured over the last year due to travel restrictions and lockdown. Demand was broad-based across verticals and we had some sizable expansion deals in the process manufacturing space, which is greenfield for PTC. With the strong pipeline and encouraging signs of churn improvement in IoT as well, we expect to see continued solid ARR growth in fiscal 2021. On Slide 13, we have an example of ThingWorx in the process manufacturing space at Griffin Foods. Operating in a market that has relatively thin margin, Griffin Foods was looking for ways to accelerate efficiencies in its production environment. Leveraging the ThingWorx Smart Connected Operations or SCO solution, they are digitizing their production lines to capture key performance data and display it in a unified view to allow managers to see problems and make faster, more informed decisions on the plant floor. Let me shift to our AR business on Slide 14. The Vuforia augmented reality team again delivered very strong results in Q1 with bookings up 80% year-over-year. Expansions drove over 50% of bookings in the quarter with three deals greater than $500,000, which was a new record for the AR team. Traction outside the Americas continued to gain momentum with strong growth in both Europe and APAC. Let me share two examples that highlights the value of our broader AR suite. First, on Slide 15 is at BID Group, one of the largest integrated suppliers in the wood processing industry. The BID Group replaced a do-it-yourself or DIY approach for industrial IoT and then added Vuforia Chalk to the mix to improve workforce productivity, while reducing travel costs. Turning to Slide 16, a second great AR success story is Royal Enfield, the world's oldest motorcycle brand. As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded, Royal Enfield was forced to reimagine a planned physical event for launching a new motorcycle. Leveraging Vuforia Studio in under a month, they built a dynamic sales training capability and deliver this highly effective interactive augmented reality experience to more than 3,000 remote participants. Turning now to Slide 17, I'll wrap up my comments on our Growth business by discussing Onshape, which also delivered a very strong quarter. Onshape had record bookings up more than 150% from its initial quarter at PTC one-year ago, including a nice balance of new logo activity and expansion. Onshape's pure-SaaS CAD solution is quickly becoming a disruptive force in the SMB space, shaking up a mature market segment where PTC has been underrepresented for years. I'd like to update you on the exciting trends we are seeing in the education market with Onshape. As the COVID pandemic unfolded, we saw a real opportunity to help schools and universities because we have the only true school-from-home CAD solution that works on any device with no installed footprint. PTC's academic team decided to pivot their focus to Onshape and set an aggressive goal to try to reach 1 million total education users by the end of fiscal 2021. To put that in perspective, it's double the number of users that were participating in our education program across all PTC products at that time. I am happy to report that already in January, we've exceeded the goal of 1 million total Onshape education users, nine months ahead of schedule. Onshape is quickly becoming the education standard, thanks to one of the greatest sheer shifts I've experienced. Students and teachers love it. Clearly, we caught a wave as world events and the changing needs in education have accelerated this achievement. It's been incredibly rewarding to see how many educators and students have been able to take advantage of Onshape. Students who would not normally have access to CAD are now able to engage in STEM classes. Robotics teams are able to compete even when their season is canceled and educators have been able to seamlessly continue their instruction because of their access to Onshape. On Slide 18, we highlight one of the many school systems supporting their K12 STEM Education Program by adopting Onshape, in this case across the Charlottesville City School System. Gaining 1 million student users is a huge milestone with significant implications for PTC well into the future. Manufacturing companies at the very same needs a real-time collaboration and access to data from anywhere and on any device. I continue to think that COVID crisis is accelerating the SaaS tipping point for the engineering software industry by several years. On Slide 19, you'll see a great example of a commercial company Stirling Ultracold doing the same thing. They are adopting Onshape to streamline communication between mechanical designers, supply chain managers, manufacturing and quality assurance teams to avoid the delays associated with sending CAD data back and forth by email like they used to do. To wrap up on our Growth business, I think it's pretty clear that our solutions are uniquely positioned to help customers respond to the new normal they are facing today and they provide a very strong foundation for long-term growth for PTC. Let me provide some color on geographic performance, which was strong across the globe. On Slide 20, you'll see that APAC had strong performance with ARR growth of 16%, reflecting the earlier reopening of those economies and much improved churn rates as our subscription licensing model gains increased acceptance. Americas ARR growth of 13% was the second quarter in a row of double-digit growth, driven by broad-based demand across our Core and Growth segments, but partially offset by softness in FSG. Europe ARR growth of 8% faced a tough year-over-year comparison, but delivered very strong bookings performance in both our Core and Growth segments along with some notable competitive wins. With that, now let me turn to Slide 21 and touch on our key alliance partners. The Microsoft partnership had another strong quarter, delivering above plan for the third consecutive quarter and exceeding expectations in all geos. As you saw in their earnings release yesterday, Microsoft has a lot of momentum and we are drafting behind it. With a solid pipeline and field engagement strengthening across the globe, we remain bullish on the Microsoft Alliance opportunity. Rockwell delivered over 20 expansion deals and had transactions in 27 countries. The majority of Rockwell's deals continue to come from customers that are greenfield to PTC and in process industries that we have not traditionally targeted with our core products. I was pleased to see in their earnings release that Rockwell too is seeing a strong uptick in orders. If you follow Rockwell, you may be aware that they have reorganized to have a software-focused business unit that owns the PTC partnership and yesterday they announced that they have hired Brian Shepherd to head up that unit. Brian worked directly for me at PTC for a dozen years. So I know that Rockwell has found a very capable software leader and somebody who can help the PTC Rockwell relationship unleash its fullest potential. Congratulations to Brian. We are looking forward to working with him. Lastly, on the Alliance front, our ANSYS-powered solutions had a solid quarter with 20% bookings growth and very healthy expansion activity that drove around half of Q1 bookings. To complement CSL in the market, we launched the broader and deeper Creo ANSYS simulation suite. We are expecting these ANSYS-powered solutions to account for high single-digit percentage of our new CAD ACV in fiscal 2021. Before I wrap up, I'd like to highlight a great win we had with Microsoft on Slide 22. The Colruyt Group was looking for an IoT platform to support a complete digital transformation of their shops, food production, energy production and logistics. Microsoft received an RFP in a competitive bid process and turned to PTC to partner on the opportunity. We ultimately won together, resulting in a multi-phase hybrid cloud IIoT project. To wrap up and summarize my comments, turning to Slide 23. We are off to a great start in fiscal 2021 as customers continue to embark on digital transformation initiatives that leverage our full product portfolio. We had strong bookings in the quarter and churn performance was good as well. We delivered ARR at the high-end of guidance, while adding to the backlog, we saw a great performance in Core and Growth segments and in our channel. The demand environment appears to be improving globally and our strategic alliances continue to grow and mature. Plus, with the Arena team joining forces with Onshape, PTC is now positioned as the number one leader in SaaS-based CAD and PLM and along with Vuforia, the sizable pure-SaaS portfolio is paving the way toward an attractive future proof business model for PTC. As Kristian will detail shortly, we are pleased to be raising our fiscal 2021 guidance in recognition of solid execution that demonstrates our capability to deliver strong topline growth, margin expansion and free cash flow generation. The necessary ingredients to drive significant shareholder value for years to come. With that, I'll turn it over to you Kristian to take us through more details on the financial results and guidance. All right, great. Thanks, Jay. Kristian, you start thinking about the answer to that, while I answer him. Yes. So it's a good observation. I mean, we have Windchill then we acquired Onshape and they were two different things and now we acquired Arena. So yes, in fact, we have three. But actually we do have a very well understood strategy. So first of all, we will begin the process of looking at the best ways for Arena to use more and more of the Atlas platform that came to us with Onshape. And to be frank, Arena and Onshape don't do exactly the same things. Onshape is more like file management except not really files but more like data management and collaboration and Onshape is more like bill of material. So those two things do different things, but they will over time share more and more of a common architecture called Atlas. So then that leads to Windchill. So we have shared kind of a mid-term project that we are developing versions of Windchill and Creo that will use the Atlas platform to a great extent, so that they can be delivered in a SaaS model, but those products will retain full upward compatibility from the on-premise versions that exist today. Now, we will continue to maintain an on-premise version. So you might say, we're going from 3 to 2 to 1.5 or something like that, but there is a good strategy here for how this stuff evolves and none of it's going to be revolution because we're bringing all the customers with. But I definitely think this is a problem that will fade away and we've done that before. It's a problem that \u2013 I'm not sure it's a problem, but it's a situation that will be \u2013 that will evolve over time toward a cleaner kind of steady state in the end. Kristian? Let me add some color to that, I think it's a easier way to see it. I think if you look at it by product, you get a different story because the size, the relatively larger size of some products kind of overwhelms that story. But Arena and Onshape are all about new accounts, they're basically competing in a space where we didn't previously have products competing. So there are almost entirely new accounts. If you go to IoT and AR that's kind of 50-50 because those are products we can sell to our traditional accounts, but of course, there's a lot of demand and interest in IoT and AR and we have new partners like Rockwell that also take us to a lot of new places. And then if you go back to Creo and Windchill, I mean, that would be majority of the bookings coming from companies we've been doing business with, but sometimes we knock one offer, there is a consolidation play or something like that and as well the channel is bringing this new accounts. So I think it's almost all new for Onshape and Arena, roughly half and half-ish for IoT and AR and sort of majority maybe 70/30 in favor of installed base with Creo and Windchill. Yes. So let me say, on your first question Arena. Arena is predominantly a U.S. business, it's been almost \u2013 to a very great degree sold to American companies, although some American companies have users overseas. But it hasn't really been sold to companies overseas with just a small exception. So the first thing we're going to do with the Arena for sure is go international with it. I mean, that's a good piece of growth we ought to be able to go after as a synergy. And then of course cross selling between Onshape and Arena ought to produce another synergy. And I think our channel ought to produce yet another synergy. So I'm sort of the opinion that there is a lot of upside to Arena, if not this year, certainly in the coming years, as we can take this business places that Arena themselves going to gone so easily. So that's maybe the first part. Then second on ANSYS, if I remember we had quantified that we thought there was $100 million potential opportunity with Creo Simulation Live in our base. I think that's before. I don't know if, Tim, did that include this mainstream simulation products. No. So I haven't quantified that, but well more than $100 million because the rest of the ANSYS suite actually comes at a higher price point. We probably get less penetration because some of them might already have purchased it from ANSYS or one of their distributors. But certainly $100 million would be the floor in terms of opportunity. Will we ever get 100% of that, no? But certainly is a sizable ARR opportunity for us. Do you have a quantification Kristian on the size ANSYS would have been in terms of new ACV within CAD last year? Nominal. I mean, it would have been some, because we had some initial sales. Yes. It would have been low-single digits. So I think they were going from low-single digits to high-single digits, would be our aspiration here. And then on the Q4 to Q1. Q1 IoT bookings didn't have the same growth rate that they had in Q4, but again it was a healthy number, I mean in Q4, it was a very healthy number. And in both cases, a lot of that went into backlog. So you're seeing a situation where the backlog deficit we started this year with had a fairly good representation in IoT and that's slowing down our IoT growth rate. And some of the goodness that we're bringing in with new bookings is going into backlog and it will help next year, but it doesn't necessarily overcoming the deficit we started the year with. So anyway, we're still on plan. So it's not a bad thing. But putting more bookings in the backlog for next year and the year after is a good thing. Thank you. Yes. We looked at that data Jack and it really was pretty broad representation. Tim and I were studying that data and nothing really jumps out, it's sort of a little bit everywhere in more or less the percentage we kind of normally have. So broad based is how I would characterize that. That's an easy one, Jack, because you don't have to strip it out. We've not been charging educational institutions for the software. However, we had a program that you can use it for free for the first year. So we do anticipate that as this school year ramps up and we move into next year, we're going to get a pretty decent conversion rate to pay. But in that good news that we have so far, it's all commercial sales. Well, I mean, first of all, I do think there is some real strong market share gains. I don't think other vendors are performing at the same level as we have been and it's been a long time since and have you guys asked me when Aeris was disrupting us. We kind of haven't heard that name in ages. So I think they're losing some real momentum. So I think it really is more companies are realizing that they \u2013 if they have PLM, they need to have it more broadly and more people need to use it. Like maybe the procurement guy could walk down the hall and talk to the engineers. But now they are working from home, we can't. And so we need to see it. So I think some of it is existing companies broadening and deepening their implementation. And then, I think there's a lot of companies who like the Terumo example we gave, who was doing their FDA compliance literally on paper, saying, okay, that's not going to work, we need to get a PLM system. We need to get it fast. So I think there's a lot of companies whose appreciation of PLM has deepened greatly in the last couple of years. First for digital transformation in general and then for COVID requiring it. And I think that of those companies who get religion around PLM, we're certainly not going down more than our fair share. That's how I would characterize that. Thanks. Hi, Joe. Yes. So let's take the first one. Our mid-December comments Kristian said, he anticipated, we'd be in the middle of the 9% to 12% range and we came in at 12%. So I think to be frank, what happened is we review the forecast every single week on Friday's and we raised it four times in December. So by the time we had that meeting with you. We had raised at once, but a couple of days later, we raised it again and then twice more. So if you study the PLM performance, of course we do, what you'd see is that it wasn't done the backs of any one geography or any one vertical or any one big deal. It was just a lot of deals of all sizes in all geographies across a bunch of different verticals. I mean, it just felt like just good solid business everywhere as opposed to some surprise. I think if you go to the verticals question you asked, I think Arena is very strong in high-tech and very strong in general in SMB. Now high-tech does tend to have a lot of SMB customers. And the other thing about high-tech is product life cycles tend to be very short. If you make 777's like Boeing does, it's very hard to switch CAD systems, because those products last for decades. But if you're making consumer handheld devices, the life on one those things pretty darn short and the next version isn't based on the last version. So you can switch tools much more easily. So I think in general, electronics and high-tech is a fast cycle market and it's easier to get a share shift to happen there, which helps both Onshape and Arena by the way. Now PTC does well in the larger electronics and high-tech customers who probably are selling stuff that ends up in a rack in the data center and big machines that have a lot of electronics in them and so forth. That aren't necessarily so short cycle and whatnot. In the case of aerospace and defense, I mean, Arena does have some aerospace and defense accounts that are generally small suppliers to larger firms, but I would say probably, that's not necessarily the best spot to sell Arena, other than if you're low in the supply chain and there are a lot of small suppliers in the aerospace and defense supply chain in part because the government encourages that. So I think Onshape and we're also coming out with ITAR version of Onshape for the same reason that these smaller accounts need something and really just don't have the wherewithal for the bigger heavier enterprise systems that masters at the top of their supply chain would prefer. So I think maybe a long way of [indiscernible] Arena and Onshape are very complementary [indiscernible] Creo and Windchill, they do the same thing but they appeal to different segments of the market. And the low end of the market doesn't want the high-end products and the high end of the market today doesn't want the low end products. That may happen over time. But right now it's all incremental upside as far as I'm concerned. Thanks, Joe. Hey, Matt. Yes. So there is two in particular. I'll talk about one really with SharkNinja. But let me cover the other one first. It was a European OEM, I can't tell you who it was, I will be able to at some point, but not yet. I don't yet have permission. But an OEM who had both our software and our CAD software and the competitors and use them both as many large OEMs do. And they decided that they didn't like that anymore. And they would really prefer to have one tool and if they had to go from two to one they will go into Creo. So that was a pretty substantial displacement of a very well-known high-end product. And then the other case really was a displacement of a very well-known low-end product. Where this account said \u2013 SharkNinja said, we really like what Creo can do and we really like CSL and so forth and we too don't like having two sets of tools. And if we had to pick one, we pick Creo. So kind of at opposite ends of the Creo range, if you will, we're displacing different products from the same vendor. And that vendor, you can guess who it is, it has kind of left their customers a little frustrated. Some of their business policies, some of their technical strategies are well accepted by the customers and it's creating some discontent and some of that discontent turns into switching, especially if you're looking at two tools and you're saying, I wish we had one. Well, I really like those PTC guys, their tools are great and are better to work with. Thanks, Matt. Yes. There is no exclusivity there would happened with Fujitsu, as I understand the story. First they implemented our software in their factories and it was quite successful. And then there is a system integrator arm of Fujitsu who said, we'd like to take this showcase we've built in our own company and take it down the road and sell it to other companies. And so that's the nature of that announcement. But Fujitsu as an SI is no Rockwell. So I don't really \u2013 they're much more localized in certain pockets and so forth. And they're important partner and we're glad to have them. But I don't think it's meaningful at the level of a Rockwell partnership, certainly not yet maybe we'll get there someday. But just think of them as two different tiers. Yes. I mean, a lot of SI's want to sell with us where we sell the software and they do the project. And that's motion has been working very well. And then some SI's, in some cases like Fujitsu say, well, could we just sell it, because we have some clients we'd like to go. Basically sell them what we've done in our own company and we'd like to take that order. But think that for every Fujitsu. There is multiple SI's that we sell with rather than thrilled. Yes. I mean, it's a business unit that's quite complete. It has R&D and marketing and sales, doesn't really new services because we don't so much need that. But it's really a pretty complete business unit. It has the P&L, it has growth targets, we will make acquisitions for them. In fact, Arena was an example. But we've made a couple other little tuck-ins that we didn't announce because they were too small. But definitely, that's a business and the way I look at it, they are paving the path for a future PTC. Because at some point, our industry will really go to SaaS, I mean it's starting to and that's good, but at some point it will tip right over like other industries have. And at that point that business unit will be bigger and bigger and may in fact be the future inner gravity for PTC. It's not big enough at $100 million \u2013 let's call it $1.4 billion. So it's not yet 10% but you put Arena in there and it steps up closer to 10% and then you let that growth rate run for a while and it won't be long before it's quite meaningful to us. But that's what they're doing, their paving the path for a future PTC. Yes. Well, I think what it really comes down to is does a customer want SaaS or not. If they want SaaS, then the win rates exceptionally high, but they might decide they don't want SaaS for whatever reason. And it might be that other people in their company already use SolidWorks or what have you. But think of Onshape as a really good CAD system on a completely different deployment and business model. And the deployment and business model is even more differentiated \u2013 is more differentiated in the product itself is. So I think, smaller companies, say, I really like the idea of being able to get to this data without having a server, without having a system administrator, without having \u2013 I'd like to be able to pick up my work at home on my Macintosh if I worked on at all day on a Windows workstations. I mean, that's great. I like the real-time collaboration. Onshape is a multi-user system were multiple users work together on the same designs at the same time as opposed to multiple users working independently and pass the data back and forth, which is how most other CAD systems work. So I think again, I often say, think of it like electric vehicles versus internal combustion engines, it's religion at some level. And very few people get down to a shortlist that has three of each. Somewhere in the decision making process they either say, I want to electric and now I'm down to a shortlist of electric vehicles or I don't want electric, I'm going to stay with internal combustion and they end up with that shortlist. But I'm saying for those customers who say, I think I want SaaS. This is a good chance, we're going to win that deal. Thank you, everybody."

Thank you for standing by and welcome to the PTC 2022 Fourth Quarter Conference Call. During today\u2019s presentation all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation the conference will be open for questions. [Operator Instructions]. I will now like to turn the call over to Matt Shimao, PTC\u2019s Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMatt Shimao: Good afternoon. Thank you, Angela, and welcome to PTC\u2019s fourth and fiscal 2022 conference call. On the call today are Jim Heppelmann, Chief Executive Officer; and Kristian Talvitie, Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s conference call is being broadcast live through an audio webcast and a replay of the call will be available later today at www.ptc.com. During this call PTC will make forward-looking statements, including guidance as to future operating results. Because such statements deal with future events, after results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements can be found in PTC\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as in today\u2019s press release. The forward-looking statements, including guidance provided during this call are valid only as of today\u2019s date, November 2, 2022, and PTC assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. During the call PTC will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in today\u2019s press release made available on our website. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to PTC\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Jim Heppelmann.\nJim Heppelmann: Thanks, Matt. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I\u2019m pleased to report that PTC delivered an outstanding fourth quarter, which capped off a record year in fiscal \u201822.  Our top line metric of ARR and bottom line metric of free cash flow, both came in above the guidance ranges we issued 90 days ago. Execution was strong throughout fiscal \u201822 as full year results align well to the growth and margin expansion strategies we outlined at last December\u2019s Investor Day. Relative to top line and bottom line metrics across both absolute and relative improvement measures, fiscal \u201822 was PTC\u2019s best year in decades.  Before I dive in, I\u2019d like to point out that Kristian will cover the ongoing effects of the strong dollar later during his section of the call. So to simplify things, I\u2019ll focus my discussion on constant currency results where applicable. Turning to slide fourth, ARR and free cash flow results for Q4 were very strong and the strength was broad based across all segments and geographies. A particular note, we saw organic ARR growth continue at the accelerated pace of 15%, driven by strong performance across the board in Digital Thread Core, Digital Thread Growth, FSG and Velocity. Our Codebeamer acquisition had another strong quarter and contributed a point of inorganic ARR growth, taking PTC\u2019s total ARR to $1.71 billion, up 16% year-over-year. Our top line ARR growth was helped by the lowest churn the company has seen in many quarters, even better than last quarter.  Organic churn, excluding the impact from Russia, improved by 193 basis points, well better than the 100 basis points we guided to at the start of the year. Despite churning the entire Russian business, churn was lowest in Europe for both Q4 and the full year. Price increases provide a helpful tailwind to renewals globally, but the underlying gross churn improvement is what is carried today all year long.  Fiscal \u201822 was the fifth consecutive year of double digit ARR growth for PTC. It was also the second consecutive year of 16% ARR growth. But take note that the organic element of that growth mix has accelerated by 300 basis points from 12% in fiscal \u201821 to 15% in fiscal \u201822. Through our guidance, we expect to post a sixth consecutive year of double digit ARR growth in fiscal \u201923, even after a considerable allowance for a potential macro slowdown.  Free cash flow in Q4 was $29 million, ahead of our guidance. Free cash flow for fiscal \u201822 was $416 million, above our guidance and up 21% year-over-year despite an approximate $30 million or 700 basis points headwind due to the impact of FX on our operations, including $53 million of payments primarily related to our restructuring from a year ago and fees related to acquisitions, adjusted free cash flow was $468 million.  Next, on slide five. I want to reflect on the margin expansion initiatives we pursued over the past year, including both the restructuring related to our SaaS pivot announced a year ago, and the portfolio resource optimization we discussed on the last call. Both programs have proven very successful, because against the backdrop of a rocky economy we achieved about 3 percentage points of cash contribution margin expansion in fiscal \u201822, while simultaneously accelerating organic ARR growth rate by about 3 percentage points as well. That\u2019s 6 points of expansion against our Rule of 40 type measure in a single year.  We expect the ongoing effect of these profitability initiatives to lead the further cash contribution margin expansion in fiscal \u201823. With the restructuring costs behind us and cash contribution margins expanding on double digit ARR growth, we\u2019re expecting to drive free cash flow up about 35% to the $560 million level in fiscal \u201823. Moving to slide six, despite the scary headlines we continue to read every day, we saw record demand for our offerings in the fourth quarter. While we again experienced some macro related softness in smaller deals, notably in Europe, and some softness in China, these factors were offset by the strength in PLM, SaaS and larger deals.  As we previewed on the last call, organic bookings were up low single digits from a blockbuster Q4 last year, setting new record highs in Q4 and for fiscal \u201822. Q4 bookings were up 30% sequentially from the strong Q3 level, which reflects typical seasonality.  Bookings growth was strong in both the Digital Thread and Velocity units. The recent Codebeamer acquisition continues to perform exceptionally well with Q4 wins at a large German automaker, a large semiconductor company and a large Korean automaker among others. Turning to slide seven, in Q4 we again saw a strong ARR growth across all geographies. ARR growth for the Americas was 17%. In Europe ARR grew 16% despite the Russia exit in Q2, which still affects the growth rate given the trailing nature of our ARR metric. ARR growth in APAC was 13%.  Across all geographies, the largest ARR growth in terms of magnitude was driven by continued strong demand for our Creo CAD and Windchill PLM products within Digital Thread Core. We saw the strongest ARR growth in terms of percentage across all geographies for Velocity with our cloud-native Onshape CAD and Arena PLM products continuing to grow multiple times faster than the market rate.  Next, let\u2019s look at ARR performance of our business units, starting with the Digital Thread on slide eight. In our largest product segment, Digital Thread Core, we delivered another strong double-digit growth performance in Q4 with 14% ARR growth. Within this, CAD again grew low double digits, while PLM accelerated to 19% growth as Windchill continues to be a hot seller. Q4 represents the 20th consecutive quarter of double-digit ARR growth that we\u2019ve seen in the Core CAD and PLM business.  In Digital Thread growth, which is IoT and AR, growth sustained the 19% ARR growth rate and we were just a smidgen short of rounding up to that two handle growth rate goal we were hoping for; close enough in my view.  ThingWorx DPM had a decent quarter, including a nice expansion deal from a customer who first purchased DPM last quarter. FSG posted great results again in Q4, growing 9% organically and 19% inclusive of Codebeamer. Turning to slide nine, on the SaaS transformation front we landed several Windchill+ deals, including our first field lift and shift SaaS conversions with our partner DxP Services. The SaaS transition program is right on track.  Our win at Raymond Corporation illustrates the value proposition of Windchill+. Raymond Corp. is owned by Toyota Industries and they make a wide variety of forklift trucks, pallet jacks and warehousing products. Raymond conducted a study and found that with our Windchill+ SaaS solution, they can drive substantial savings in total cost of ownership, while avoiding the burden of maintaining the software system themselves. Raymond is now enabling their distributed workforce with Windchill+.  A reminder that Windchill+ is the tip of the iceberg of a bigger plus strategy, and you will see us follow with Creo+ and other similar premium SaaS offerings in fiscal \u201823 and beyond. We\u2019re aiming to launch Creo+ and this bigger plus strategy at LiveWorx in May.  Turning to the Velocity business on slide 10. Year-over-year ARR growth for the Velocity unit maintained the accelerated rate of 29% we saw last quarter, with Onshape and Arena again each growing multiple times faster than their respective market. Arena continues to mirror the PLM strength we see with Windchill and the mid-20s growth rate of Arena that we\u2019ve seen throughout fiscal \u201822 is more than 10 percentage points higher than Arena\u2019s pre-acquisition growth rate had been. Both Onshape and Arena have been great acquisitions for PTC.  The strength of these businesses, which are the cloud-native pioneers in our industry, gives us confidence that the future of our market will be SaaS, and the shift to SaaS will create strong growth tailwinds for PTC for years to come. Let\u2019s turn to slide 11 and talk about the future. Given the strength we\u2019ve seen in our business throughout fiscal \u201822 just opposed against the likelihood of a more difficult macro situation that is said to be headed our way, but has not yet arrived in a meaningful way, it\u2019s a real challenge to tell you with precision how our business will perform in fiscal \u201823.  But because of our recurring model, the fact that our software is very sticky and key to the digital transformation efforts than industrial companies around the world are pursuing, we think that the range of likely outcomes is fairly narrow at 10% to 14% ARR growth. Therefore, it\u2019s most likely that we\u2019ll see ARR growth in the double-digit range again in fiscal \u201823. At the high end of our 10% to 14% ARR organic growth guidance for fiscal \u201823, we would be looking at only modest bookings growth and no further improvement in churn, both somewhat disappointing outcomes versus the strength we\u2019ve seen in fiscal \u201822.  At the midpoint of the guidance range, we\u2019re looking at no growth at all in bookings, plus 100 basis points more churn. At the low end of the guidance range, we\u2019re looking at a 15% decline in bookings all year, plus the 100 basis points more churn. We feel that these are the most plausible outcomes for fiscal \u201823. But I want to be completely clear that as we sit here today, we have no indication whatsoever that bookings will actually decline or the churn will actually increase. We are simply adding a prudent safety factor to our guidance range, so we\u2019re all prepared for a downturn should it happen.  While we don\u2019t foresee even worse outcomes and thus have not included them in our guidance range. For the sake of illustration, a 30% decline in bookings all year, plus the 100 basis points more churn gets us to 7% ARR growth. And just to demonstrate the amazing resilience of our model, note that it would take a massive 75% year-over-year bookings decline on top of 200 basis points more churn to get to flat year-over-year ARR growth.  But even then, free cash flow would shows solid growth given cash contribution margin improvements already implemented, the restructuring payment that are now behind us and the spending austerity we\u2019d surely implement in response to a downturn of that magnitude. Bottom line is that we\u2019re very confident that the resilience of our model ensures strong fiscal \u201823 results.  While a potential macro downturn is on everybody\u2019s mind, the foreign exchange rates we\u2019re already experiencing is a bigger factor in our fiscal \u201823 free cash flow projections. The $560 million target for free cash flow correlates both to an ARR growth slowdown and to the very strong dollar that we\u2019re currently experiencing. At today\u2019s foreign exchange rates, which are the most unfavorable in two decades, the $560 million of free cash flow in fiscal \u201823 includes a roughly $60 million headwind versus what the same free cash flow would be at given our fiscal \u201822 plan rates.  The $560 million remains within the $550 million to $600 million free cash flow range we established back in 2019 when the world looked very different. But I trust you can see, if not for significant FX headwinds, we would in fact be guiding to a free cash flow number above that 2019 range due to the underlying strength in our business. Keep in mind that because our customer contracts are recurring, the same dollars flow through the system year-after-year.  While FX is a big headwind now, if exchange rates return to a more normal range in the future, then the headwind would dissipate and free cash flow would trend back toward the higher level of performance. On the other hand, if today\u2019s FX rates become a permanent new normal, then we\u2019ll give consideration to other strategies like regional pricing changes to compensate.  Obviously, the company is very well positioned, and while we\u2019re allowing that the macro situation could slow us down somewhat versus our true potential in fiscal \u201823, our strategy is clearly working; our execution has been stellar; and our resilient business model means we\u2019re positioned to produce attractive and differentiated performance in our top line ARR and bottom line free cash flow metrics, no matter what scenario unfolds. I shortened my typical customer anecdotes today, because I want to save time to discuss the new IR reporting model that we\u2019re adopting as we transition into fiscal \u201823.  Let\u2019s move to slide 12. As most of you know, with the Codebeamer acquisition landing in FSG last quarter, suddenly FSG has become a growth business, which doesn\u2019t really match our original conception of FSG as a low-growth cash count. In fact, with Digital Thread Core growth and FSG segments, all growing mid-teens or better, our current reporting model yields little insight into our growth drivers.  In thinking through what to do with FSG, we realize that the current segmentation also doesn\u2019t map very well to our strategy, and it doesn\u2019t map at all to industry market segments, which makes competitor performance comparisons difficult. Worse yet, by fragmenting parts of our PLM business across Digital Thread Core where Windchill lives, FSG where our retail FlexPLM business is based on Windchill lives and Velocity where we have Arena, our IR reporting structure has obfuscated our strong market position in PLM. Given how our business has evolved, we feel the current reporting model no longer serves any of us very well and it\u2019s time to evolve it too.  Turning to slide 13 to address these challenges going forward, we\u2019ve decided to adopt a simpler reporting model of CAD and PLM and to be completely transparent in how we\u2019re recasting our business into this model. I\u2019ve already discussed last year\u2019s growth rates using the existing four segments of Digital Thread Core growth in FSG plus Velocity. On slide 13, you\u2019ll see how the prior segments mapped to the new segmentation model.  The mapping is more simple than it appears. If we are referring to using a computer to aid in designing product information, then it is Computer Aided Design or CAD. If we are referring to aggregating product data in databases and managing the processes to interact with it across the product life cycle, then its Product Lifecycle Management or PLM. You can see that if we recast last year into the new model, then inside a $1.71 billion ARR company, growing 16% last year, we had a $756 million ARR CAD business growing 11%, and a $950 million ARR PLM business growing 20%.  In case it helps with competitor comparisons, total revenues were $1.137 billion for PLM and $796 million for CAD in fiscal \u201822. This new reporting model maps much better to how our analysts and competitors view the world. You can also see how we\u2019d allocate PTC\u2019s 10% to 14% ARR growth guidance for fiscal \u201823 using the old model, and how those same growth allocations were then mapped to the new model.  In the old IR segmentation model, we would have guided Digital Thread Core to grow 10% to 14%, Digital Thread Growth to grow 15% to 20%, FSG to grow 5% to 10% and Velocity to grow 20% to 25% in fiscal \u201823. I trust you find that all to be quite reasonable and consistent with the high level of the ranges correlating to fiscal \u201822 actuals and the low end of the range leaving room for macro slowdown. In the new model that same 10% to 14% company growth maps to CAD growing 8% to 10% and PLM growing 12% to 17%. Please view this bridge from the old model to the new model as a one-time event, because starting with the next earnings call, we will report using only the new CAD and PLM, IR segmentation model. It will make things much easier for all of us.  Turning to slide 14, I want to briefly remind you that while we\u2019re adopting a new reporting model, it is certainly not a new strategy. I trust it might even feel a little familiar to you. Indeed, we\u2019ve always been clear that it was our PLM strategy that led us to acquire Servigistics, ThingWorx, Arena, Codebeamer and others. We have said that at each step of the journey. You might even remember me saying IoT is PLM and introducing the closed loop PLM language back when we acquired ThingWorx. Perhaps you even remember a few years back we had a reporting category of extended PLM that included PLM, ALM and SLM.  We\u2019ve been pursuing a broad PLM vision for years and have made tremendous progress. Now we want to put it on display. We probably need a drum roll now, because this reporting model unveiled some really great news on slide 15 that\u2019s been true for some time, but masked by our reporting structure.  As the new segmentation clearly reveals with $981 million of PLM software revenue, I\u2019m ready to declare that PTC has become the clear category leader in the hot PLM market. Using apples-to-apples definition, similar to that of competitors, PTC is easily number one globally in terms of scale, ahead of number two Siemens and number three Dassault by some distance. Note that total PLM revenue at PTC is more than $1.1 billion when you include services, but being a software company we think it\u2019s most appropriate to focus on software. With a growth rate well ahead of these competitors in recent years, we are rapidly widening the leadership gap.  A primary reason why we\u2019ve been outpacing the market for years is because of the uniquely compelling PLM portfolio we\u2019ve built, but a second key reason is that we transitioned to a subscription business model years ago, whereas competitors remain largely perpetual in nature. While the valley of death which slowed PTC\u2019s growth for years has faded in our rearview mirror, it lies ahead for these competitors should they attempt to transition to our business model. That would only open the software revenue gap further. The takeaway is that just as surely as Dassault leads in CAD and ANSYS leads in simulation, PTC leads in PLM. Five consecutive years of PTC\u2019s accelerating PLM growth demonstrates that PLM supports a very attractive growth rate. I feel confident PTC can and will build on a strong leadership position in this great market segment for years to come. Turning to slide 16, today we\u2019re guiding the first quarter and full year of fiscal \u201823. At our virtual Investor Day just two weeks from now, we\u2019ll give you a bit more insight into our business strategy and operations in fiscal \u201823 and then guide how we expect that to play out across a longer period through fiscal \u201825. I don\u2019t want to preview that content today, but I think you\u2019ll like where the company is headed as we continue performing while transforming, as we\u2019ve consistently done over the past decade.  Then a bit further down the calendar, we hope you\u2019ll join us here in Boston for LiveWorx 2023 on May 15 and 16 of next year, where you have an opportunity to dive deep into all things PTC. LiveWorx will afford investors ample opportunity to interact with management, employees, customers and partners. Please block off both events on your calendars.  Wrapping up my part then on slide 17, as I reflect on fiscal \u201822, demand remained strong all year, and we\u2019ve seen only minor signs of a macro slowdown. Accelerating growth and expanding margins prove our strategy is working well, and strong execution has driven our top and bottom line performance to levels that are amongst the best across our industry peer group.  Transitioning into fiscal \u201823, I\u2019m excited about the opportunities to do even better as we push ahead with our SaaS and margin expansion initiatives. We\u2019re watching diligently for changes in the demand environment and feel well prepared for whatever lies ahead. Because of our business model and spending discipline, we expect to deliver solid top line growth and robust bottom line growth across any of the more plausible macro scenarios. I continue to believe the company has never been in a better position to create shareholder value. And with that, I\u2019m going to turn it over to Kristian for his more detailed commentary on financial results and guidance. \nKristian Talvitie: Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon everyone. Before I review our results, I\u2019d like to note that I\u2019ll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance, and ARR references will be in both constant currency and as reported.  Turning to slide 19. In fiscal \u201822 our ARR grew 16% on a constant currency basis and exceeded guidance. On an organic constant currency basis excluding Codebeamer, our ARR was $1.61 billion, up 15% year-over-year.  As Jim explained, our top line strength in Q4 was broad-based. We\u2019re executing well against our strategy and we\u2019re continuing to improve upon our strong market positions. Our SaaS businesses across our Digital Thread and Velocity groups saw continued solid ARR growth in Q4.  On an as reported basis we delivered 7% ARR growth, 6% organic due to the impact of FX headwinds, which were $134 million, substantially higher than the approximately $85 million of FX headwinds that we would have expected assuming Q3 ending exchange rates and at the midpoint of our guidance for Q4. Moving on to cash flow. Despite the FX headwinds, our cash flow results were strong, with Q4 and full year results coming in ahead of our guidance across all metrics. Solid collections performance and slower hiring helped to offset the incremental headwinds that materialized in Q4 and for the full year our restructuring cost controls and above planned perpetual license revenue primarily from Kepware also helped to offset the FX headwinds. When assessing and forecasting our free cash flow, it\u2019s also important to remember a few things. FX rates were more favorable in the first half of fiscal \u201822 and the majority of our collections occur in the first half of our fiscal year. Q4 is our lowest cash flow generation quarter and free cash flow is primarily a function of ARR rather than revenue. In fiscal \u201822 FX fluctuations created a headwind of approximately $30 million to our free cash flow results.  Q4 revenue of $508 million increased 6% year-over-year and fiscal \u201822 revenue was $1.933 billion, up 7%. As we\u2019ve discussed previously, revenue is impacted by ASC 606, so we do not believe that revenue growth rates are the best indicator of our underlying business performance, but would rather guide you to ARR as the best metric to understand our top line performance and cash generation. On a constant currency basis, our Q4 revenue was up 12% year-over-year and our fiscal \u201822 revenue was up 11%.  Before I move on to the balance sheet, I\u2019d like to provide some color on our non-GAAP operating margin as I did last quarter. We continue you to caution, because revenue is impacted by ASC 606. Other derivative metrics such as gross margin, operating margin, operating profit and EPS are all impacted as well. Still, it\u2019s worth mentioning that we\u2019re benefiting from the work that we\u2019ve done to optimize our cost structure. Our non-GAAP operating margin expanded by approximately 300 basis points to 38% in fiscal \u201822.  Moving to slide 20, we ended the fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $272 million. Our gross debt was $1.36 billion with an aggregate interest rate of 3.9%. During Q4 we repaid $75 million on our revolving credit facility.  Regarding our share repurchase program, as we\u2019ve communicated previously, we completed $125 million of repurchases at the front end of this fiscal year. Our long-term goal, assuming our debt to EBITDA ratio is below 3x, is to return approximately 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases, while also taking into consideration the interest rate environment and strategic opportunities. Next, slide 21 shows our ARR by product group. In the constant currency section on the top half of the slide, we use rates as of September 30, 2021 to calculate ARR for all periods. You can see on the slide how FX dynamics have resulted in differences between our constant currency ARR and as reported ARR over the past eight quarters. I provided a reminder on the previous call that when we set ARR guidance for fiscal \u201823, we would be providing that at the September 30, 2022 FX rates and restating history assuming those rates. Let\u2019s turn to that now.  Here on slide 22 we show the new reporting categories that Jim took you through with historical ARR results recasted using our FY \u201823 plan rate for all periods. We post a set of financial data tables to our IR website that has our financial statements, as well as these ARR tables. For comparative purposes, the constant currency historicals are at FY \u201823 plan rates and should be used when forecasting PTC\u2019s constant currency ARR results. This is important to consider in context of our guidance, because we provide ARR guidance on a constant currency basis. If exchange rates fluctuate significantly between the end of Q4 and the end of Q1, that would be reflected in our as reported ARR.  We believe constant currency is the best way to evaluate the top line performance of our business, because it removes FX fluctuations from the analysis, positive or negative. Given the sharp moves in FX that we\u2019ve seen recently, I thought it would be useful to provide an updated ARR sensitivity rule of thumb here on slide 23, and as you can see, in addition to the U.S. dollar we transact in euro, yen and more than 10 other additional currencies.  Using our Q4 FX rates, the impact of a $0.10 change in the euro would be approximately $38 million positive or negative and the impact of a \u00a510 change would be approximately $7 million, again positive or negative, and of course the estimated dollar impact to ARR is dependent on the size of the ARR base.  Turning to slide 24, since most of the sell-side forecasts have been built assuming September 30, 2021 rates, I thought it would be helpful to provide this slide as a reference point before I take you through our actual guidance on slide 25. Slide 24 illustrates what our guidance would have looked like if calculated using our fiscal \u201822 plan rates.  The year-over-year growth rate for ARR is the same 10% to 14% that you\u2019ll see on slide 25; however, the absolute values for ARR are higher given the FX rates versus the FY \u201823 plan rates. For revenue, the actuals we report and the guidance we provide are on an as reported basis, not on a constant currency basis. For illustrative purposes this slide shows our fiscal \u201822 revenue on a constant currency basis, assuming our fiscal \u201822 plan rates. On this basis the illustrative year-over-year growth rates for fiscal \u201823 are about 6% higher than the comparable numbers you\u2019ll see on the next slide. The range of revenue growth is lower on slide 25, because our reported revenue is based on monthly FX movements rather than a point in time set of rates, and we faced some tough comps in fiscal \u201823, particularly in the first half of the year. With that, I\u2019ll take you through our guidance on slide 25. Today I\u2019ll focus on FY \u201823 and Q1. In a couple of weeks when we have our Investor Day, we\u2019ll focus more on the medium term.  For all ARR guidance amount, we\u2019re using our fiscal \u201823 plan rates, the rates as of September 30, 2022. For fiscal \u201823 we expect constant currency ARR growth of 10% to 14%, which would make this the sixth consecutive year of double-digit growth. This corresponds to fiscal \u201823 constant currency ARR of $1.73 billion to $1.79 billion.  Churn is a key component of our ARR guidance and we significantly outperformed our churn guidance in fiscal \u201822 and ended the year with organic churn at 5.6% using our fiscal \u201822 plan rates. Our medium term target as stated back in 2019 was to get to the 6% level by fiscal \u201824, and we achieved this earlier than expected. Going forward, I think there\u2019s still room to improve our churn rate, but at the same time I want to be cognizant of the macro environment, and that\u2019s the rationale behind keeping our churn assumption essentially flat for fiscal \u201823.  Next, on cash flows for fiscal \u201823, we expect free cash flow of approximately $560 million, up about 35% and adjusted free cash flow of $562 million, up about 20%. This includes an estimated $60 million of headwind caused by FX impacts on our operations as compared to FY \u201822 FX rates. Our fiscal \u201822 restructuring is substantially behind us, so the difference between free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow is small for fiscal \u201823.  Our CapEx assumption for fiscal \u201823 is approximately $20 million, and therefore relative to free cash flow guidance of $560 million, we\u2019re guiding for cash from operations of $580 million. In a few minutes I\u2019ll take you through an illustrative FY \u201823 free cash flow model in more detail. Moving on to revenue guidance, for fiscal \u201823 we expect revenue of $1.91 billion to $1.99 billion, which corresponds to a growth rate of negative 1% to positive 3%. ASC 606 makes revenue fairly difficult to predict in the short term for on-premise subscription companies, hence the wide range. And remember, revenue does not reflect cash generation as we typically bill customers annually upfront regardless of contract term lengths. It\u2019s worth taking a few minutes to explain this. So let\u2019s go on a short detour from guidance and turn to slide 26.  This slide shows a hypothetical example with 10 contracts and different assumptions for four variables. Software type, which can be either on-premise subscription, perpetual support or cloud/SaaS.  Number two, upfront recognition percentage. To keep this model simple, we\u2019ll just assume that 50% of the on-premise subscription total contract value is recognized upfront under ASC 606. To be clear, this varies by company and even by product within each company, but here we\u2019re just trying to keep this simple to illustrate the point.  Number three, term length. This example uses term lengths ranging from one to four years; and four, contract size. This is really total contract value or TCV. In this example, TCV ranges from $1,000 to $4,000, but note, all of these contracts have the same ARR of $1,000.  Moving to slide 27, for certain contract types, namely SaaS and cloud and on-premise support contracts, revenue recognition is ratable over the term of the contract. For these contracts, term length and contract value do not have impact on revenue recognition and revenue aligns with ARR on an annual basis. You can see this here with $250 being recognized every quarter. On the next slide, slide 28, here is an example of a one year on-premise subscription that renews annually. Due to ASC 606, half of the contract value is recognized as upfront revenue and the remaining half is recognized ratably over the contract term. Since this is a one year subscription, revenue aligns with ARR on an annual basis. However, on a quarterly basis there is a difference because of the upfront revenue recognition was $625 in the first quarter and $125 in the next three quarters. Turning to slide 29. Here we\u2019re highlighting an example of a four year on-premise subscription. Again, under ASC 606, half the contract value is recognized as revenue upfront. However, ARR and cash invoicing are both done on an annual basis. In this example the amounts would be 1,000 per year. In contrast, as this example shows, we would recognize $2,000 of revenue upfront and the remaining $2,000 will be recognized ratably over the 16 quarters of the term. Moving to slide 30. The graph compares ARR and revenue for these 10 hypothetical contracts over a 12 year period. Over the 12 years this model assumes no growth, no price increases nor churn. There\u2019s no changing of term lengths, no migrating from support to on-premise subscription or from on-premise subscription to SaaS. Of course as you know, we actually have programs in place that actively drive each of these dynamics, but it would be much too complicated to start adding these kinds of dynamics into this super simple example. The green line which is ARR appropriately shows flat business performance, 10 contracts at $1,000 each for $10,000 in ARR each year, zero percent growth, whereas the blue line, which is revenue, shows a lot of volatility from year-to-year. Revenue growth rates vary from negative 33% to positive 69% in any given year, and again, while this example is overly simplistic, hopefully you can see why we keep saying that you can\u2019t really look at revenue to understand the underlying performance of our business, nor is it helpful when trying to understand free cash flow dynamics.  What is important to remember is that over the term of the contract, over the term of each contract, every dollar of ARR becomes $1 of revenue. However, how and when revenue is recognized is dependent on the mix of contracts starting and/or renewing in any given year and can vary significantly from period-to-period, and you can imagine what happens to margins and EPS under this kind of scenario. Next, on slide 31 is the conclusion. Due to ASC 606, the revenue trend is noise for companies like PTC that sell on-premise subscriptions. But the point here is, don\u2019t worry, because free cash flow is really a function of ARR, and this is why we focus on ARR and free cash flow and believe it to be the best way to assess our fundamental business performance. Now returning from that fun side trip to guidance on slide 32. For Q1 we\u2019re guiding for cash from operations of $170 million, free cash flow of $165 million and adjusted free cash flow of $166 million. There\u2019s one additional item worth noting related to the cash flow in Q1 and fiscal \u201823.  In Q1 we expect to make a $10 million foreign tax payment related to changes to the withholding tax policy of a foreign country. Since we also expect this to be substantially \u2013 substantially all of this to be refunded before the end of fiscal \u201923, there is no expected impact to the full year financials and we will not adjust for this. Aside from this item, as you model the quarters of fiscal \u201823, keep in mind that we expect the quarterly distribution to follow a similar pattern as in fiscal \u201822 and fiscal \u201821 for the cash flow metrics, with over 60% of our cash flow coming in the first half of the year and Q4 being our lowest cash flow generation quarter. Next, on slide 33, let\u2019s take a look at an illustrative model that uses the assumptions that Jim described earlier and illustrates what you need to believe to achieve the midpoint of our fiscal \u201823 constant currency ARR guidance at the midpoint of $1.76 billion. In this illustrative model, which is for 12% constant currency ARR growth, we\u2019ve assumed that churn worsens by approximately 100 basis points and we kept new ACV flat. While new ACV is not exactly the same as bookings due to dynamics such as ramp deals and in-year starts which we discussed before, it\u2019s a close enough proxy for this exercise.  I would point out that while the churn increase looks high, that is in fact the math of an approximate 100 basis point increase that we outlined earlier in the discussion, and while the macro environment may increase churn as you can see on the page, a 100 basis point increase would push absolute churn level \u2013 churn dollars above levels that we have not seen for quite some time, and we have some tailwinds on the churn front which include term lengths lengthening. In fact our expiring base in fiscal \u201823 is only slightly higher than in fiscal \u201922, despite more than $200 million of beginning ARR.  The price increase we implemented in May should also provide some tailwind throughout the year, and importantly our product portfolio continues to mature and some of the product segments that have higher churn like IoT and AR have seen steady improvement in churn over the past three years and still have lots of room for improvement to get to renewal rates more in line with for example, Creo and Windchill. On the flat new ACV assumption, I would also point out that we have slightly more deferred ARR starting in fiscal \u201823 than we did in fiscal \u201822. We will have a full year of new sales from Codebeamer versus the two quarters worth that we had in fiscal \u201922, and the price increases that went into effect should provide a modest tailwind on the new sales front as well. You can see that to hit the midpoint of $1.76 billion, we need to add $188 million of ARR in fiscal \u201823.  Balancing potential macro uncertainties with the momentum we\u2019ve been seeing in our business, our forecast, and given some of the considerations I just mentioned, we believe our fiscal \u201823 guidance is prudent. Turning to slide 34, here\u2019s an illustrative constant currency ARR model for Q1. You can see our results over the past eight quarters. In the far right column we\u2019ve modeled the midpoint of our constant currency Q1 ARR guidance. Because our ARR tends to see some seasonality, the most relevant comparison is Q1 \u201821 and Q1 \u201822.  The illustrative model indicates that to hit the midpoint of our Q1 \u201823 guidance of $1.59 billion, we need to add $18 million of ARR on a sequential basis. This is less than the $40 million we added in Q1 of \u201821 and the $37 million we added in Q1 of fiscal \u201822. Again, for the reasons I mentioned just a minute ago, we believe we\u2019ve set our Q1 \u201823 constant currency ARR guidance range prudently. Let\u2019s move on to slide 35, which shows an illustrative free cash flow model for fiscal \u201823. I know that most of you model free cash flow using the indirect method, which uses the P&L and balance sheet as a starting point. Given the complexities related to ASC 606 that we spent some time on earlier on this call, there are inherent challenges in using the indirect method to forecast free cash flow for PTC. The model on this slide is based on what we use internally. I know that looking at it in this way, may be unfamiliar to some of you, so please feel free to reach out if we can help. Starting at the top with ARR, note that the FY \u201822 ARR has been \u2013 is at the September 30, 2022 rates, and that for fiscal \u201823 we\u2019ve used the midpoint of our constant currency ARR guidance. Moving down the model, the primary reason why FY \u201823 professional services revenue is down is because of unfavorable FX developments we\u2019ve seen over the past year. In addition, we expect roughly a third of our professional services revenue to transition to DxP over time. Moving to cost of revenue and operating expenses, the FX developments over the past year have the opposite effect here. Compared to revenue for costs and expenses, the FX moves are beneficial. You can see the powerful leverage on our cash contribution, which is a characteristic outcome of a sticky recurring subscription business model, combined with operational discipline. As you can see, expected restructuring payments are materially lower in fiscal \u201923, because as Jim explained earlier, we completed the work related to the operational optimization announced a year ago and the related cash restructuring payments are now substantially behind us. We\u2019ve also completed the work to rebalance resources across the company to align with our growth opportunities and we did this without a restructuring charge. Moving on, you will see that other expense is higher in fiscal \u201823 compared to fiscal \u201922. This is primarily due to higher interest rate on our revolver given the higher interest rate environment. Cash taxes are also higher in this model and reflect both higher taxable income, as well as the impact of Section 174. And finally, the other category is also higher in FY \u201823. The main driver here is higher working capital to support continued growth. FY \u201822 also includes the impact of FX movements. All this sums up to expected free cash flow of $560 million, inclusive of the $134 million ARR headwind that materialized and consequent $60-ish million headwind to free cash flow. Jim explained earlier, we expect to deliver approximately $560 million under the most plausible ARR growth scenarios and I\u2019d like to reiterate that.  If the macro situation gets worse and our cash generation is impacted, you can expect us to moderate our spending. On the other hand, if the macro situation improves or the dollar strength reverses, this would be favorable for our cash generation, and in that scenario we\u2019d likely invest more aggressively in our business. As we start the year, we believe $560 million is a good target. And that\u2019s a good segue to slide 36.  First of all, we are prepared for a storm and expect to be resilient in the face of one. From a top line perspective, we serve industrial product companies and R&D at those companies tends to be quite resilient, so we have a supportive top line backdrop. We\u2019ve also transitioned successfully to a subscription business model and our products are very sticky with our customers. Just as importantly from a cost and operational perspective, we have done a lot of optimization in 2022 that will serve us well going forward; we\u2019ve already battened down the hatches.  Nevertheless, as we\u2019ve said in the past, we do not have a Pollyanna type view when it comes to the macro situation. We have a strong track record of disciplined operational management, and in the event of a meaningful downturn, we are prepared to pull additional spending levers to mitigate the impact on our cash flows. Variable compensation would automatically adjust and depending on the magnitude of the downturn, we would also curtail plant hires, look at backfilling attrition, marketing spend, travel spend, etc. So with that, I\u2019d like to wrap it up here and turn it over to the operator to begin Q-&-A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJim Heppelmann: Hello Steve!\nSteve Tusa: Hi! Good evening. How are you guys?\nJim Heppelmann: Good.\nSteve Tusa: Quite a comprehensive rundown there. Thanks for that, yeah. So the message is that you guys are ready, I guess that\u2019s the message.  Just on this customer behavior, I mean you went to great lengths once again to highlight how you\u2019re ready for whatever comes your way with the business model, and you know in those parts of the business that you did see, you know perhaps not as much growth in bookings in Europe and China. I mean there are obvious reasons for that probably. But what are you seeing in customer behavior there? Is it just kind of like deferrals of budgets, is it longer cycle times to close and how do you expect this to kind of progress here into the fourth quarter?\nJim Heppelmann: Yes. So first again, I want to remind you we had record sales in Q4. So while we saw some minor slowdowns, we also saw strength that more than offset in other places. But you know to answer your question, in China you know it\u2019s really COVID, it\u2019s geopolitical, it\u2019s all those kind of things and China is 5% of our business, so we don\u2019t have a lot of exposure there. In Europe it tends to be smaller companies, who are themselves battening down the hatches and they are trying to kick the can down the road and get a little bit more insight into what\u2019s going to happen to the economy. But I mean I know this is a general question for everybody, so let me elaborate a little bit.  It\u2019s a funny time, because you know on one hand you have the PMIs coming down and normally that slows down our bookings, but it hasn\u2019t here. We certainly read the papers like the rest of you do, but we also have customers everywhere who can\u2019t keep up with demand. I mean, we have a customer visit center here at PTC on the 17th floor, and it was completely packed today. We had six day-long meetings going on in parallel. We only have the capacity for six. I\u2019m on the board of an automotive supplier and recently we were reviewing the IHS forecast, and IHS is forecasting the auto industry to grow 2% to 6% next year. We\u2019re a big supplier to the defense companies. In fact, two of the companies that were here today were defense companies, and they can\u2019t keep up with the volume and you know their customers are asking for more and more and more.  I was in Europe last week and I visited a couple of clean energy companies, and again, because of what\u2019s going on in the energy industry, whether it\u2019s clean energy or not clean energy, there\u2019s a lot of action happening. You know people who used to ship gas through pipelines now need to ship it through ships and so that creates a whole bunch of new demand. For example, big compressors that sit on ships, we have a customer who makes those.  I visited a wind turbine company and they think their sales are going to triple over the next 10 years, because of their desire for clean energy. I went to a truck company, and they can\u2019t keep up with demand for diesel trucks, meanwhile they have enormous demand for electric trucks, because all these e-commerce companies, Amazon, Target, whatever, really want their packages delivered in electric vehicles and so all these fleets are trying to move to electric. So I\u2019m just saying Steve, like there\u2019s the headlines and then there\u2019s everything else we see and the everything else really is quite encouraging. But we\u2019re trying not to be Pollyanna; we\u2019re trying to be aware of the headlines that could in fact impact us, so we tried to model it in.\nSteve Tusa: One last quick one. On a look back to 2Q and any kind of impact from the price increases that you saw and kind of a postmortem on that?\nJim Heppelmann: Yes Kristian, have you tried to size it all, the impact of the price increase since Q2?\nKristian Talvitie: Yes, you know I think it\u2019s probably high single-digit million worth of impact in fiscal \u201822.\nJim Heppelmann: So that would be 0.5 percentage point of growth, let\u2019s call it.\nSteve Tusa: Okay great! Thanks a lot guys. I really appreciate all the detail. Very helpful. Thank you.\nJim Heppelmann: Yeah, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Wong with Oppenheimer & Co. please.\nKen Wong: Great! Just a quick question. I realize macro is going to get beat like a horse here, but you saw a little bit of SMB weakness in Europe. I guess what \u2013 has that been baked into potentially spreading elsewhere or are you guys fencing it off in Europe for now in terms of the guidance?\nJim Heppelmann: No, no. I think we\u2019re \u2013 if you look at our guidance scenario, the best case shows a substantial slowdown in bookings momentum, and the worst case shows a substantial decline in bookings. And that would have to happen somewhere and I could imagine it would start in SMB globally and work its way into bigger accounts.  So we\u2019re giving you a guidance range that the entire range is well below sort of the level of performance we\u2019ve had for a while now, and again, it\u2019s really just based on conservatism. There\u2019s not a lot of science though behind it, because like I said, there\u2019s no science, there\u2019s no data actually that supports taking the range down that low. It\u2019s just being prudent because of everything we read and everything we hear.\nKen Wong: Got it. Okay, really appreciate that Jim. I\u2019ll circle back in the queue. Thanks again.\nOperator: That is all the time we have for questions today. I will now turn the call back to Jim Heppelmann. I do apologize.\nJim Heppelmann: Yes, thanks Angela. So listen everybody, I\u2019m sorry we didn\u2019t give more time for questions today. We had a lot of content. We allowed Kristian to spend a little bit of time on an accounting lesson there, because you know we think people are going to ask the question, \u2018how do you get a 35% free cash flow growth of flat revenue and flat margins?\u2019 And the simple answer is revenues noise. Free cash flow at PTC is based on ARR and we have substantial increases in our free cash \u2013 you know our cash contribution margins against growing ARR. So the math works, but we want to make sure you understood that, so it didn\u2019t leave lingering questions. But anyway, we\u2019ll hopefully see most of you or all of you in two weeks when we have our Investor Day. We\u2019ll go a little bit deeper into the business strategy as I said, and then we\u2019ll get into some mid-term guidance. You know we\u2019re going to guide fiscal \u201823, \u201824 and \u201825. And again, I don\u2019t want to preview that content now, but I think it\u2019s a positive story. You probably can sense that we feel good about the business. So thanks a lot for your time. Sorry, we didn\u2019t have more time for questions, and you know we look forward to following up with you in two weeks or in whatever forums and venues happen before that. Thanks a lot.\nKristian Talvitie: Thanks all.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kristian Talvitie",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon everyone. Before I review our results, I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance, and ARR references will be in both constant currency and as reported.  Turning to slide 19. In fiscal \u201822 our ARR grew 16% on a constant currency basis and exceeded guidance. On an organic constant currency basis excluding Codebeamer, our ARR was $1.61 billion, up 15% year-over-year.  As Jim explained, our top line strength in Q4 was broad-based. We're executing well against our strategy and we're continuing to improve upon our strong market positions. Our SaaS businesses across our Digital Thread and Velocity groups saw continued solid ARR growth in Q4.  On an as reported basis we delivered 7% ARR growth, 6% organic due to the impact of FX headwinds, which were $134 million, substantially higher than the approximately $85 million of FX headwinds that we would have expected assuming Q3 ending exchange rates and at the midpoint of our guidance for Q4. Moving on to cash flow. Despite the FX headwinds, our cash flow results were strong, with Q4 and full year results coming in ahead of our guidance across all metrics. Solid collections performance and slower hiring helped to offset the incremental headwinds that materialized in Q4 and for the full year our restructuring cost controls and above planned perpetual license revenue primarily from Kepware also helped to offset the FX headwinds. When assessing and forecasting our free cash flow, it's also important to remember a few things. FX rates were more favorable in the first half of fiscal \u201822 and the majority of our collections occur in the first half of our fiscal year. Q4 is our lowest cash flow generation quarter and free cash flow is primarily a function of ARR rather than revenue. In fiscal \u201822 FX fluctuations created a headwind of approximately $30 million to our free cash flow results.  Q4 revenue of $508 million increased 6% year-over-year and fiscal \u201822 revenue was $1.933 billion, up 7%. As we've discussed previously, revenue is impacted by ASC 606, so we do not believe that revenue growth rates are the best indicator of our underlying business performance, but would rather guide you to ARR as the best metric to understand our top line performance and cash generation. On a constant currency basis, our Q4 revenue was up 12% year-over-year and our fiscal \u201822 revenue was up 11%.  Before I move on to the balance sheet, I'd like to provide some color on our non-GAAP operating margin as I did last quarter. We continue you to caution, because revenue is impacted by ASC 606. Other derivative metrics such as gross margin, operating margin, operating profit and EPS are all impacted as well. Still, it's worth mentioning that we're benefiting from the work that we've done to optimize our cost structure. Our non-GAAP operating margin expanded by approximately 300 basis points to 38% in fiscal \u201822.  Moving to slide 20, we ended the fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $272 million. Our gross debt was $1.36 billion with an aggregate interest rate of 3.9%. During Q4 we repaid $75 million on our revolving credit facility.  Regarding our share repurchase program, as we've communicated previously, we completed $125 million of repurchases at the front end of this fiscal year. Our long-term goal, assuming our debt to EBITDA ratio is below 3x, is to return approximately 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases, while also taking into consideration the interest rate environment and strategic opportunities. Next, slide 21 shows our ARR by product group. In the constant currency section on the top half of the slide, we use rates as of September 30, 2021 to calculate ARR for all periods. You can see on the slide how FX dynamics have resulted in differences between our constant currency ARR and as reported ARR over the past eight quarters. I provided a reminder on the previous call that when we set ARR guidance for fiscal \u201823, we would be providing that at the September 30, 2022 FX rates and restating history assuming those rates. Let's turn to that now.  Here on slide 22 we show the new reporting categories that Jim took you through with historical ARR results recasted using our FY \u201823 plan rate for all periods. We post a set of financial data tables to our IR website that has our financial statements, as well as these ARR tables. For comparative purposes, the constant currency historicals are at FY \u201823 plan rates and should be used when forecasting PTC's constant currency ARR results. This is important to consider in context of our guidance, because we provide ARR guidance on a constant currency basis. If exchange rates fluctuate significantly between the end of Q4 and the end of Q1, that would be reflected in our as reported ARR.  We believe constant currency is the best way to evaluate the top line performance of our business, because it removes FX fluctuations from the analysis, positive or negative. Given the sharp moves in FX that we've seen recently, I thought it would be useful to provide an updated ARR sensitivity rule of thumb here on slide 23, and as you can see, in addition to the U.S. dollar we transact in euro, yen and more than 10 other additional currencies.  Using our Q4 FX rates, the impact of a $0.10 change in the euro would be approximately $38 million positive or negative and the impact of a \u00a510 change would be approximately $7 million, again positive or negative, and of course the estimated dollar impact to ARR is dependent on the size of the ARR base.  Turning to slide 24, since most of the sell-side forecasts have been built assuming September 30, 2021 rates, I thought it would be helpful to provide this slide as a reference point before I take you through our actual guidance on slide 25. Slide 24 illustrates what our guidance would have looked like if calculated using our fiscal \u201822 plan rates.  The year-over-year growth rate for ARR is the same 10% to 14% that you'll see on slide 25; however, the absolute values for ARR are higher given the FX rates versus the FY \u201823 plan rates. For revenue, the actuals we report and the guidance we provide are on an as reported basis, not on a constant currency basis. For illustrative purposes this slide shows our fiscal \u201822 revenue on a constant currency basis, assuming our fiscal \u201822 plan rates. On this basis the illustrative year-over-year growth rates for fiscal \u201823 are about 6% higher than the comparable numbers you'll see on the next slide. The range of revenue growth is lower on slide 25, because our reported revenue is based on monthly FX movements rather than a point in time set of rates, and we faced some tough comps in fiscal \u201823, particularly in the first half of the year. With that, I'll take you through our guidance on slide 25. Today I'll focus on FY \u201823 and Q1. In a couple of weeks when we have our Investor Day, we'll focus more on the medium term.  For all ARR guidance amount, we're using our fiscal \u201823 plan rates, the rates as of September 30, 2022. For fiscal \u201823 we expect constant currency ARR growth of 10% to 14%, which would make this the sixth consecutive year of double-digit growth. This corresponds to fiscal \u201823 constant currency ARR of $1.73 billion to $1.79 billion.  Churn is a key component of our ARR guidance and we significantly outperformed our churn guidance in fiscal \u201822 and ended the year with organic churn at 5.6% using our fiscal \u201822 plan rates. Our medium term target as stated back in 2019 was to get to the 6% level by fiscal \u201824, and we achieved this earlier than expected. Going forward, I think there's still room to improve our churn rate, but at the same time I want to be cognizant of the macro environment, and that's the rationale behind keeping our churn assumption essentially flat for fiscal \u201823.  Next, on cash flows for fiscal \u201823, we expect free cash flow of approximately $560 million, up about 35% and adjusted free cash flow of $562 million, up about 20%. This includes an estimated $60 million of headwind caused by FX impacts on our operations as compared to FY \u201822 FX rates. Our fiscal \u201822 restructuring is substantially behind us, so the difference between free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow is small for fiscal \u201823.  Our CapEx assumption for fiscal \u201823 is approximately $20 million, and therefore relative to free cash flow guidance of $560 million, we're guiding for cash from operations of $580 million. In a few minutes I'll take you through an illustrative FY \u201823 free cash flow model in more detail. Moving on to revenue guidance, for fiscal \u201823 we expect revenue of $1.91 billion to $1.99 billion, which corresponds to a growth rate of negative 1% to positive 3%. ASC 606 makes revenue fairly difficult to predict in the short term for on-premise subscription companies, hence the wide range. And remember, revenue does not reflect cash generation as we typically bill customers annually upfront regardless of contract term lengths. It's worth taking a few minutes to explain this. So let's go on a short detour from guidance and turn to slide 26.  This slide shows a hypothetical example with 10 contracts and different assumptions for four variables. Software type, which can be either on-premise subscription, perpetual support or cloud/SaaS.  Number two, upfront recognition percentage. To keep this model simple, we'll just assume that 50% of the on-premise subscription total contract value is recognized upfront under ASC 606. To be clear, this varies by company and even by product within each company, but here we're just trying to keep this simple to illustrate the point.  Number three, term length. This example uses term lengths ranging from one to four years; and four, contract size. This is really total contract value or TCV. In this example, TCV ranges from $1,000 to $4,000, but note, all of these contracts have the same ARR of $1,000.  Moving to slide 27, for certain contract types, namely SaaS and cloud and on-premise support contracts, revenue recognition is ratable over the term of the contract. For these contracts, term length and contract value do not have impact on revenue recognition and revenue aligns with ARR on an annual basis. You can see this here with $250 being recognized every quarter. On the next slide, slide 28, here is an example of a one year on-premise subscription that renews annually. Due to ASC 606, half of the contract value is recognized as upfront revenue and the remaining half is recognized ratably over the contract term. Since this is a one year subscription, revenue aligns with ARR on an annual basis. However, on a quarterly basis there is a difference because of the upfront revenue recognition was $625 in the first quarter and $125 in the next three quarters. Turning to slide 29. Here we're highlighting an example of a four year on-premise subscription. Again, under ASC 606, half the contract value is recognized as revenue upfront. However, ARR and cash invoicing are both done on an annual basis. In this example the amounts would be 1,000 per year. In contrast, as this example shows, we would recognize $2,000 of revenue upfront and the remaining $2,000 will be recognized ratably over the 16 quarters of the term. Moving to slide 30. The graph compares ARR and revenue for these 10 hypothetical contracts over a 12 year period. Over the 12 years this model assumes no growth, no price increases nor churn. There's no changing of term lengths, no migrating from support to on-premise subscription or from on-premise subscription to SaaS. Of course as you know, we actually have programs in place that actively drive each of these dynamics, but it would be much too complicated to start adding these kinds of dynamics into this super simple example. The green line which is ARR appropriately shows flat business performance, 10 contracts at $1,000 each for $10,000 in ARR each year, zero percent growth, whereas the blue line, which is revenue, shows a lot of volatility from year-to-year. Revenue growth rates vary from negative 33% to positive 69% in any given year, and again, while this example is overly simplistic, hopefully you can see why we keep saying that you can't really look at revenue to understand the underlying performance of our business, nor is it helpful when trying to understand free cash flow dynamics.  What is important to remember is that over the term of the contract, over the term of each contract, every dollar of ARR becomes $1 of revenue. However, how and when revenue is recognized is dependent on the mix of contracts starting and/or renewing in any given year and can vary significantly from period-to-period, and you can imagine what happens to margins and EPS under this kind of scenario. Next, on slide 31 is the conclusion. Due to ASC 606, the revenue trend is noise for companies like PTC that sell on-premise subscriptions. But the point here is, don't worry, because free cash flow is really a function of ARR, and this is why we focus on ARR and free cash flow and believe it to be the best way to assess our fundamental business performance. Now returning from that fun side trip to guidance on slide 32. For Q1 we're guiding for cash from operations of $170 million, free cash flow of $165 million and adjusted free cash flow of $166 million. There's one additional item worth noting related to the cash flow in Q1 and fiscal \u201823.  In Q1 we expect to make a $10 million foreign tax payment related to changes to the withholding tax policy of a foreign country. Since we also expect this to be substantially \u2013 substantially all of this to be refunded before the end of fiscal '23, there is no expected impact to the full year financials and we will not adjust for this. Aside from this item, as you model the quarters of fiscal \u201823, keep in mind that we expect the quarterly distribution to follow a similar pattern as in fiscal \u201822 and fiscal \u201821 for the cash flow metrics, with over 60% of our cash flow coming in the first half of the year and Q4 being our lowest cash flow generation quarter. Next, on slide 33, let's take a look at an illustrative model that uses the assumptions that Jim described earlier and illustrates what you need to believe to achieve the midpoint of our fiscal \u201823 constant currency ARR guidance at the midpoint of $1.76 billion. In this illustrative model, which is for 12% constant currency ARR growth, we've assumed that churn worsens by approximately 100 basis points and we kept new ACV flat. While new ACV is not exactly the same as bookings due to dynamics such as ramp deals and in-year starts which we discussed before, it's a close enough proxy for this exercise.  I would point out that while the churn increase looks high, that is in fact the math of an approximate 100 basis point increase that we outlined earlier in the discussion, and while the macro environment may increase churn as you can see on the page, a 100 basis point increase would push absolute churn level \u2013 churn dollars above levels that we have not seen for quite some time, and we have some tailwinds on the churn front which include term lengths lengthening. In fact our expiring base in fiscal \u201823 is only slightly higher than in fiscal '22, despite more than $200 million of beginning ARR.  The price increase we implemented in May should also provide some tailwind throughout the year, and importantly our product portfolio continues to mature and some of the product segments that have higher churn like IoT and AR have seen steady improvement in churn over the past three years and still have lots of room for improvement to get to renewal rates more in line with for example, Creo and Windchill. On the flat new ACV assumption, I would also point out that we have slightly more deferred ARR starting in fiscal \u201823 than we did in fiscal \u201822. We will have a full year of new sales from Codebeamer versus the two quarters worth that we had in fiscal '22, and the price increases that went into effect should provide a modest tailwind on the new sales front as well. You can see that to hit the midpoint of $1.76 billion, we need to add $188 million of ARR in fiscal \u201823.  Balancing potential macro uncertainties with the momentum we've been seeing in our business, our forecast, and given some of the considerations I just mentioned, we believe our fiscal \u201823 guidance is prudent. Turning to slide 34, here's an illustrative constant currency ARR model for Q1. You can see our results over the past eight quarters. In the far right column we've modeled the midpoint of our constant currency Q1 ARR guidance. Because our ARR tends to see some seasonality, the most relevant comparison is Q1 \u201821 and Q1 \u201822.  The illustrative model indicates that to hit the midpoint of our Q1 \u201823 guidance of $1.59 billion, we need to add $18 million of ARR on a sequential basis. This is less than the $40 million we added in Q1 of \u201821 and the $37 million we added in Q1 of fiscal \u201822. Again, for the reasons I mentioned just a minute ago, we believe we've set our Q1 \u201823 constant currency ARR guidance range prudently. Let's move on to slide 35, which shows an illustrative free cash flow model for fiscal \u201823. I know that most of you model free cash flow using the indirect method, which uses the P&L and balance sheet as a starting point. Given the complexities related to ASC 606 that we spent some time on earlier on this call, there are inherent challenges in using the indirect method to forecast free cash flow for PTC. The model on this slide is based on what we use internally. I know that looking at it in this way, may be unfamiliar to some of you, so please feel free to reach out if we can help. Starting at the top with ARR, note that the FY \u201822 ARR has been \u2013 is at the September 30, 2022 rates, and that for fiscal \u201823 we've used the midpoint of our constant currency ARR guidance. Moving down the model, the primary reason why FY \u201823 professional services revenue is down is because of unfavorable FX developments we've seen over the past year. In addition, we expect roughly a third of our professional services revenue to transition to DxP over time. Moving to cost of revenue and operating expenses, the FX developments over the past year have the opposite effect here. Compared to revenue for costs and expenses, the FX moves are beneficial. You can see the powerful leverage on our cash contribution, which is a characteristic outcome of a sticky recurring subscription business model, combined with operational discipline. As you can see, expected restructuring payments are materially lower in fiscal '23, because as Jim explained earlier, we completed the work related to the operational optimization announced a year ago and the related cash restructuring payments are now substantially behind us. We've also completed the work to rebalance resources across the company to align with our growth opportunities and we did this without a restructuring charge. Moving on, you will see that other expense is higher in fiscal \u201823 compared to fiscal '22. This is primarily due to higher interest rate on our revolver given the higher interest rate environment. Cash taxes are also higher in this model and reflect both higher taxable income, as well as the impact of Section 174. And finally, the other category is also higher in FY \u201823. The main driver here is higher working capital to support continued growth. FY \u201822 also includes the impact of FX movements. All this sums up to expected free cash flow of $560 million, inclusive of the $134 million ARR headwind that materialized and consequent $60-ish million headwind to free cash flow. Jim explained earlier, we expect to deliver approximately $560 million under the most plausible ARR growth scenarios and I'd like to reiterate that.  If the macro situation gets worse and our cash generation is impacted, you can expect us to moderate our spending. On the other hand, if the macro situation improves or the dollar strength reverses, this would be favorable for our cash generation, and in that scenario we'd likely invest more aggressively in our business. As we start the year, we believe $560 million is a good target. And that's a good segue to slide 36.  First of all, we are prepared for a storm and expect to be resilient in the face of one. From a top line perspective, we serve industrial product companies and R&D at those companies tends to be quite resilient, so we have a supportive top line backdrop. We've also transitioned successfully to a subscription business model and our products are very sticky with our customers. Just as importantly from a cost and operational perspective, we have done a lot of optimization in 2022 that will serve us well going forward; we've already battened down the hatches.  Nevertheless, as we've said in the past, we do not have a Pollyanna type view when it comes to the macro situation. We have a strong track record of disciplined operational management, and in the event of a meaningful downturn, we are prepared to pull additional spending levers to mitigate the impact on our cash flows. Variable compensation would automatically adjust and depending on the magnitude of the downturn, we would also curtail plant hires, look at backfilling attrition, marketing spend, travel spend, etc. So with that, I'd like to wrap it up here and turn it over to the operator to begin Q-&-A. Yes, you know I think it's probably high single-digit million worth of impact in fiscal \u201822. Thanks all."

            "name": "Jim Heppelmann",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to report that PTC delivered an outstanding fourth quarter, which capped off a record year in fiscal \u201822.  Our top line metric of ARR and bottom line metric of free cash flow, both came in above the guidance ranges we issued 90 days ago. Execution was strong throughout fiscal \u201822 as full year results align well to the growth and margin expansion strategies we outlined at last December's Investor Day. Relative to top line and bottom line metrics across both absolute and relative improvement measures, fiscal \u201822 was PTC's best year in decades.  Before I dive in, I'd like to point out that Kristian will cover the ongoing effects of the strong dollar later during his section of the call. So to simplify things, I'll focus my discussion on constant currency results where applicable. Turning to slide fourth, ARR and free cash flow results for Q4 were very strong and the strength was broad based across all segments and geographies. A particular note, we saw organic ARR growth continue at the accelerated pace of 15%, driven by strong performance across the board in Digital Thread Core, Digital Thread Growth, FSG and Velocity. Our Codebeamer acquisition had another strong quarter and contributed a point of inorganic ARR growth, taking PTC's total ARR to $1.71 billion, up 16% year-over-year. Our top line ARR growth was helped by the lowest churn the company has seen in many quarters, even better than last quarter.  Organic churn, excluding the impact from Russia, improved by 193 basis points, well better than the 100 basis points we guided to at the start of the year. Despite churning the entire Russian business, churn was lowest in Europe for both Q4 and the full year. Price increases provide a helpful tailwind to renewals globally, but the underlying gross churn improvement is what is carried today all year long.  Fiscal \u201822 was the fifth consecutive year of double digit ARR growth for PTC. It was also the second consecutive year of 16% ARR growth. But take note that the organic element of that growth mix has accelerated by 300 basis points from 12% in fiscal \u201821 to 15% in fiscal \u201822. Through our guidance, we expect to post a sixth consecutive year of double digit ARR growth in fiscal '23, even after a considerable allowance for a potential macro slowdown.  Free cash flow in Q4 was $29 million, ahead of our guidance. Free cash flow for fiscal \u201822 was $416 million, above our guidance and up 21% year-over-year despite an approximate $30 million or 700 basis points headwind due to the impact of FX on our operations, including $53 million of payments primarily related to our restructuring from a year ago and fees related to acquisitions, adjusted free cash flow was $468 million.  Next, on slide five. I want to reflect on the margin expansion initiatives we pursued over the past year, including both the restructuring related to our SaaS pivot announced a year ago, and the portfolio resource optimization we discussed on the last call. Both programs have proven very successful, because against the backdrop of a rocky economy we achieved about 3 percentage points of cash contribution margin expansion in fiscal \u201822, while simultaneously accelerating organic ARR growth rate by about 3 percentage points as well. That's 6 points of expansion against our Rule of 40 type measure in a single year.  We expect the ongoing effect of these profitability initiatives to lead the further cash contribution margin expansion in fiscal \u201823. With the restructuring costs behind us and cash contribution margins expanding on double digit ARR growth, we're expecting to drive free cash flow up about 35% to the $560 million level in fiscal \u201823. Moving to slide six, despite the scary headlines we continue to read every day, we saw record demand for our offerings in the fourth quarter. While we again experienced some macro related softness in smaller deals, notably in Europe, and some softness in China, these factors were offset by the strength in PLM, SaaS and larger deals.  As we previewed on the last call, organic bookings were up low single digits from a blockbuster Q4 last year, setting new record highs in Q4 and for fiscal \u201822. Q4 bookings were up 30% sequentially from the strong Q3 level, which reflects typical seasonality.  Bookings growth was strong in both the Digital Thread and Velocity units. The recent Codebeamer acquisition continues to perform exceptionally well with Q4 wins at a large German automaker, a large semiconductor company and a large Korean automaker among others. Turning to slide seven, in Q4 we again saw a strong ARR growth across all geographies. ARR growth for the Americas was 17%. In Europe ARR grew 16% despite the Russia exit in Q2, which still affects the growth rate given the trailing nature of our ARR metric. ARR growth in APAC was 13%.  Across all geographies, the largest ARR growth in terms of magnitude was driven by continued strong demand for our Creo CAD and Windchill PLM products within Digital Thread Core. We saw the strongest ARR growth in terms of percentage across all geographies for Velocity with our cloud-native Onshape CAD and Arena PLM products continuing to grow multiple times faster than the market rate.  Next, let's look at ARR performance of our business units, starting with the Digital Thread on slide eight. In our largest product segment, Digital Thread Core, we delivered another strong double-digit growth performance in Q4 with 14% ARR growth. Within this, CAD again grew low double digits, while PLM accelerated to 19% growth as Windchill continues to be a hot seller. Q4 represents the 20th consecutive quarter of double-digit ARR growth that we've seen in the Core CAD and PLM business.  In Digital Thread growth, which is IoT and AR, growth sustained the 19% ARR growth rate and we were just a smidgen short of rounding up to that two handle growth rate goal we were hoping for; close enough in my view.  ThingWorx DPM had a decent quarter, including a nice expansion deal from a customer who first purchased DPM last quarter. FSG posted great results again in Q4, growing 9% organically and 19% inclusive of Codebeamer. Turning to slide nine, on the SaaS transformation front we landed several Windchill+ deals, including our first field lift and shift SaaS conversions with our partner DxP Services. The SaaS transition program is right on track.  Our win at Raymond Corporation illustrates the value proposition of Windchill+. Raymond Corp. is owned by Toyota Industries and they make a wide variety of forklift trucks, pallet jacks and warehousing products. Raymond conducted a study and found that with our Windchill+ SaaS solution, they can drive substantial savings in total cost of ownership, while avoiding the burden of maintaining the software system themselves. Raymond is now enabling their distributed workforce with Windchill+.  A reminder that Windchill+ is the tip of the iceberg of a bigger plus strategy, and you will see us follow with Creo+ and other similar premium SaaS offerings in fiscal \u201823 and beyond. We're aiming to launch Creo+ and this bigger plus strategy at LiveWorx in May.  Turning to the Velocity business on slide 10. Year-over-year ARR growth for the Velocity unit maintained the accelerated rate of 29% we saw last quarter, with Onshape and Arena again each growing multiple times faster than their respective market. Arena continues to mirror the PLM strength we see with Windchill and the mid-20s growth rate of Arena that we've seen throughout fiscal \u201822 is more than 10 percentage points higher than Arena's pre-acquisition growth rate had been. Both Onshape and Arena have been great acquisitions for PTC.  The strength of these businesses, which are the cloud-native pioneers in our industry, gives us confidence that the future of our market will be SaaS, and the shift to SaaS will create strong growth tailwinds for PTC for years to come. Let's turn to slide 11 and talk about the future. Given the strength we've seen in our business throughout fiscal \u201822 just opposed against the likelihood of a more difficult macro situation that is said to be headed our way, but has not yet arrived in a meaningful way, it's a real challenge to tell you with precision how our business will perform in fiscal \u201823.  But because of our recurring model, the fact that our software is very sticky and key to the digital transformation efforts than industrial companies around the world are pursuing, we think that the range of likely outcomes is fairly narrow at 10% to 14% ARR growth. Therefore, it's most likely that we'll see ARR growth in the double-digit range again in fiscal \u201823. At the high end of our 10% to 14% ARR organic growth guidance for fiscal \u201823, we would be looking at only modest bookings growth and no further improvement in churn, both somewhat disappointing outcomes versus the strength we've seen in fiscal \u201822.  At the midpoint of the guidance range, we're looking at no growth at all in bookings, plus 100 basis points more churn. At the low end of the guidance range, we're looking at a 15% decline in bookings all year, plus the 100 basis points more churn. We feel that these are the most plausible outcomes for fiscal \u201823. But I want to be completely clear that as we sit here today, we have no indication whatsoever that bookings will actually decline or the churn will actually increase. We are simply adding a prudent safety factor to our guidance range, so we're all prepared for a downturn should it happen.  While we don't foresee even worse outcomes and thus have not included them in our guidance range. For the sake of illustration, a 30% decline in bookings all year, plus the 100 basis points more churn gets us to 7% ARR growth. And just to demonstrate the amazing resilience of our model, note that it would take a massive 75% year-over-year bookings decline on top of 200 basis points more churn to get to flat year-over-year ARR growth.  But even then, free cash flow would shows solid growth given cash contribution margin improvements already implemented, the restructuring payment that are now behind us and the spending austerity we'd surely implement in response to a downturn of that magnitude. Bottom line is that we're very confident that the resilience of our model ensures strong fiscal \u201823 results.  While a potential macro downturn is on everybody's mind, the foreign exchange rates we're already experiencing is a bigger factor in our fiscal \u201823 free cash flow projections. The $560 million target for free cash flow correlates both to an ARR growth slowdown and to the very strong dollar that we're currently experiencing. At today's foreign exchange rates, which are the most unfavorable in two decades, the $560 million of free cash flow in fiscal \u201823 includes a roughly $60 million headwind versus what the same free cash flow would be at given our fiscal \u201822 plan rates.  The $560 million remains within the $550 million to $600 million free cash flow range we established back in 2019 when the world looked very different. But I trust you can see, if not for significant FX headwinds, we would in fact be guiding to a free cash flow number above that 2019 range due to the underlying strength in our business. Keep in mind that because our customer contracts are recurring, the same dollars flow through the system year-after-year.  While FX is a big headwind now, if exchange rates return to a more normal range in the future, then the headwind would dissipate and free cash flow would trend back toward the higher level of performance. On the other hand, if today's FX rates become a permanent new normal, then we'll give consideration to other strategies like regional pricing changes to compensate.  Obviously, the company is very well positioned, and while we're allowing that the macro situation could slow us down somewhat versus our true potential in fiscal \u201823, our strategy is clearly working; our execution has been stellar; and our resilient business model means we're positioned to produce attractive and differentiated performance in our top line ARR and bottom line free cash flow metrics, no matter what scenario unfolds. I shortened my typical customer anecdotes today, because I want to save time to discuss the new IR reporting model that we're adopting as we transition into fiscal \u201823.  Let's move to slide 12. As most of you know, with the Codebeamer acquisition landing in FSG last quarter, suddenly FSG has become a growth business, which doesn't really match our original conception of FSG as a low-growth cash count. In fact, with Digital Thread Core growth and FSG segments, all growing mid-teens or better, our current reporting model yields little insight into our growth drivers.  In thinking through what to do with FSG, we realize that the current segmentation also doesn't map very well to our strategy, and it doesn't map at all to industry market segments, which makes competitor performance comparisons difficult. Worse yet, by fragmenting parts of our PLM business across Digital Thread Core where Windchill lives, FSG where our retail FlexPLM business is based on Windchill lives and Velocity where we have Arena, our IR reporting structure has obfuscated our strong market position in PLM. Given how our business has evolved, we feel the current reporting model no longer serves any of us very well and it's time to evolve it too.  Turning to slide 13 to address these challenges going forward, we've decided to adopt a simpler reporting model of CAD and PLM and to be completely transparent in how we're recasting our business into this model. I've already discussed last year's growth rates using the existing four segments of Digital Thread Core growth in FSG plus Velocity. On slide 13, you'll see how the prior segments mapped to the new segmentation model.  The mapping is more simple than it appears. If we are referring to using a computer to aid in designing product information, then it is Computer Aided Design or CAD. If we are referring to aggregating product data in databases and managing the processes to interact with it across the product life cycle, then its Product Lifecycle Management or PLM. You can see that if we recast last year into the new model, then inside a $1.71 billion ARR company, growing 16% last year, we had a $756 million ARR CAD business growing 11%, and a $950 million ARR PLM business growing 20%.  In case it helps with competitor comparisons, total revenues were $1.137 billion for PLM and $796 million for CAD in fiscal \u201822. This new reporting model maps much better to how our analysts and competitors view the world. You can also see how we'd allocate PTC's 10% to 14% ARR growth guidance for fiscal \u201823 using the old model, and how those same growth allocations were then mapped to the new model.  In the old IR segmentation model, we would have guided Digital Thread Core to grow 10% to 14%, Digital Thread Growth to grow 15% to 20%, FSG to grow 5% to 10% and Velocity to grow 20% to 25% in fiscal \u201823. I trust you find that all to be quite reasonable and consistent with the high level of the ranges correlating to fiscal \u201822 actuals and the low end of the range leaving room for macro slowdown. In the new model that same 10% to 14% company growth maps to CAD growing 8% to 10% and PLM growing 12% to 17%. Please view this bridge from the old model to the new model as a one-time event, because starting with the next earnings call, we will report using only the new CAD and PLM, IR segmentation model. It will make things much easier for all of us.  Turning to slide 14, I want to briefly remind you that while we're adopting a new reporting model, it is certainly not a new strategy. I trust it might even feel a little familiar to you. Indeed, we've always been clear that it was our PLM strategy that led us to acquire Servigistics, ThingWorx, Arena, Codebeamer and others. We have said that at each step of the journey. You might even remember me saying IoT is PLM and introducing the closed loop PLM language back when we acquired ThingWorx. Perhaps you even remember a few years back we had a reporting category of extended PLM that included PLM, ALM and SLM.  We've been pursuing a broad PLM vision for years and have made tremendous progress. Now we want to put it on display. We probably need a drum roll now, because this reporting model unveiled some really great news on slide 15 that's been true for some time, but masked by our reporting structure.  As the new segmentation clearly reveals with $981 million of PLM software revenue, I'm ready to declare that PTC has become the clear category leader in the hot PLM market. Using apples-to-apples definition, similar to that of competitors, PTC is easily number one globally in terms of scale, ahead of number two Siemens and number three Dassault by some distance. Note that total PLM revenue at PTC is more than $1.1 billion when you include services, but being a software company we think it's most appropriate to focus on software. With a growth rate well ahead of these competitors in recent years, we are rapidly widening the leadership gap.  A primary reason why we've been outpacing the market for years is because of the uniquely compelling PLM portfolio we've built, but a second key reason is that we transitioned to a subscription business model years ago, whereas competitors remain largely perpetual in nature. While the valley of death which slowed PTC's growth for years has faded in our rearview mirror, it lies ahead for these competitors should they attempt to transition to our business model. That would only open the software revenue gap further. The takeaway is that just as surely as Dassault leads in CAD and ANSYS leads in simulation, PTC leads in PLM. Five consecutive years of PTC's accelerating PLM growth demonstrates that PLM supports a very attractive growth rate. I feel confident PTC can and will build on a strong leadership position in this great market segment for years to come. Turning to slide 16, today we're guiding the first quarter and full year of fiscal \u201823. At our virtual Investor Day just two weeks from now, we'll give you a bit more insight into our business strategy and operations in fiscal \u201823 and then guide how we expect that to play out across a longer period through fiscal \u201825. I don't want to preview that content today, but I think you'll like where the company is headed as we continue performing while transforming, as we've consistently done over the past decade.  Then a bit further down the calendar, we hope you'll join us here in Boston for LiveWorx 2023 on May 15 and 16 of next year, where you have an opportunity to dive deep into all things PTC. LiveWorx will afford investors ample opportunity to interact with management, employees, customers and partners. Please block off both events on your calendars.  Wrapping up my part then on slide 17, as I reflect on fiscal \u201822, demand remained strong all year, and we've seen only minor signs of a macro slowdown. Accelerating growth and expanding margins prove our strategy is working well, and strong execution has driven our top and bottom line performance to levels that are amongst the best across our industry peer group.  Transitioning into fiscal \u201823, I'm excited about the opportunities to do even better as we push ahead with our SaaS and margin expansion initiatives. We're watching diligently for changes in the demand environment and feel well prepared for whatever lies ahead. Because of our business model and spending discipline, we expect to deliver solid top line growth and robust bottom line growth across any of the more plausible macro scenarios. I continue to believe the company has never been in a better position to create shareholder value. And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Kristian for his more detailed commentary on financial results and guidance. Hello Steve! Good. Yes. So first again, I want to remind you we had record sales in Q4. So while we saw some minor slowdowns, we also saw strength that more than offset in other places. But you know to answer your question, in China you know it's really COVID, it's geopolitical, it's all those kind of things and China is 5% of our business, so we don't have a lot of exposure there. In Europe it tends to be smaller companies, who are themselves battening down the hatches and they are trying to kick the can down the road and get a little bit more insight into what's going to happen to the economy. But I mean I know this is a general question for everybody, so let me elaborate a little bit.  It's a funny time, because you know on one hand you have the PMIs coming down and normally that slows down our bookings, but it hasn't here. We certainly read the papers like the rest of you do, but we also have customers everywhere who can't keep up with demand. I mean, we have a customer visit center here at PTC on the 17th floor, and it was completely packed today. We had six day-long meetings going on in parallel. We only have the capacity for six. I'm on the board of an automotive supplier and recently we were reviewing the IHS forecast, and IHS is forecasting the auto industry to grow 2% to 6% next year. We're a big supplier to the defense companies. In fact, two of the companies that were here today were defense companies, and they can't keep up with the volume and you know their customers are asking for more and more and more.  I was in Europe last week and I visited a couple of clean energy companies, and again, because of what's going on in the energy industry, whether it's clean energy or not clean energy, there's a lot of action happening. You know people who used to ship gas through pipelines now need to ship it through ships and so that creates a whole bunch of new demand. For example, big compressors that sit on ships, we have a customer who makes those.  I visited a wind turbine company and they think their sales are going to triple over the next 10 years, because of their desire for clean energy. I went to a truck company, and they can't keep up with demand for diesel trucks, meanwhile they have enormous demand for electric trucks, because all these e-commerce companies, Amazon, Target, whatever, really want their packages delivered in electric vehicles and so all these fleets are trying to move to electric. So I'm just saying Steve, like there's the headlines and then there's everything else we see and the everything else really is quite encouraging. But we're trying not to be Pollyanna; we're trying to be aware of the headlines that could in fact impact us, so we tried to model it in. Yes Kristian, have you tried to size it all, the impact of the price increase since Q2? So that would be 0.5 percentage point of growth, let's call it. Yeah, thank you. No, no. I think we're \u2013 if you look at our guidance scenario, the best case shows a substantial slowdown in bookings momentum, and the worst case shows a substantial decline in bookings. And that would have to happen somewhere and I could imagine it would start in SMB globally and work its way into bigger accounts.  So we're giving you a guidance range that the entire range is well below sort of the level of performance we've had for a while now, and again, it's really just based on conservatism. There's not a lot of science though behind it, because like I said, there's no science, there's no data actually that supports taking the range down that low. It's just being prudent because of everything we read and everything we hear. Yes, thanks Angela. So listen everybody, I'm sorry we didn't give more time for questions today. We had a lot of content. We allowed Kristian to spend a little bit of time on an accounting lesson there, because you know we think people are going to ask the question, \u2018how do you get a 35% free cash flow growth of flat revenue and flat margins?' And the simple answer is revenues noise. Free cash flow at PTC is based on ARR and we have substantial increases in our free cash \u2013 you know our cash contribution margins against growing ARR. So the math works, but we want to make sure you understood that, so it didn't leave lingering questions. But anyway, we'll hopefully see most of you or all of you in two weeks when we have our Investor Day. We'll go a little bit deeper into the business strategy as I said, and then we'll get into some mid-term guidance. You know we're going to guide fiscal \u201823, \u201824 and \u201825. And again, I don't want to preview that content now, but I think it's a positive story. You probably can sense that we feel good about the business. So thanks a lot for your time. Sorry, we didn't have more time for questions, and you know we look forward to following up with you in two weeks or in whatever forums and venues happen before that. Thanks a lot."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by and welcome to the PTC 2022 Third Quarter Conference Call. During today\u2019s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. And I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Shimao, PTC\u2019s Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMatt Shimao: Good afternoon. Thank you, Savannah and welcome to PTC\u2019s fiscal 2022 third quarter conference call. On the call today are; Jim Heppelmann, Chief Executive Officer; and Kristian Talvitie, Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s conference call is being broadcast live through an audio webcast, and the replay of the call will be available later today at www.ptc.com. During this call, PTC will make forward-looking statements including guidance as to future operating results. Because such statements deal with future events after results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements can be found in PTC\u2019s annual report on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as in today\u2019s press release. The forward-looking statements including guidance provided during this call are valid only as of today\u2019s date, July 27, 2022. And PTC assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. During the call, PTC will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in today\u2019s press release made available on our website. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to PTC\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Jim Heppelmann.\nJim Heppelmann: Great. Thanks, Matt. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. I\u2019m pleased to report that PTC delivered an outstanding third quarter, with top line ARR results and bottom line free cash flow results above our guidance, and we\u2019re raising our guidance for the third time this year. Before I dive in, I\u2019d like to point out that Kristian will cover the effects of the strengthening dollar later during his section of the call. So to simplify things, I will focus my discussion of top line growth metrics on constant currency results. Turning to Slide 4, ARR and free cash flow results were very strong and the strength was broad-based across all segments and geographies. Of particular note, we saw organic ARR growth further accelerate to 15%, driven by the acceleration we saw across the board in Digital Thread Core, Digital Thread Growth, FSG and Velocity units. ARR growth was helped by the lowest churn the company has seen in many quarters. I\u2019m pleased to see PTC\u2019s organic growth rate move into that mid-teens range we\u2019ve been targeting. We closed the Intland acquisition during Q3. I\u2019ll refer to this business as Codebeamer going forward, because that is the product name we will retain. Codebeamer had an outstanding first quarter at PTC and added a point of inorganic ARR growth, taking PTC\u2019s ARR to $1.63 billion, up 16% year-over-year. In Q3, we complemented our top line growth with even stronger bottom line growth. Despite strong FX headwinds and nearly $20 million of restructuring and M&A transaction payments, our free cash flow performance was strong at $112 million, which was ahead of our guidance and up 33% year-over-year. Remember that the restructuring we implemented at the end of last fiscal year was designed to drive a more aggressive and efficient SaaS strategy. At the time it was announced, we viewed the charges as short-term pain for long-term gain. Now, we\u2019re at the inflection point where most of the pain is behind us, leaving us with a cost structure that\u2019s in great shape, while the operational changes continue to generate the positive results we expected. I\u2019m going to circle back on the margin topic in a few minutes when I reflect on macro scenarios. Moving to Slide 5, despite the scary headlines we read every day, we\u2019ve continued to see solid global demand for our offerings. We did see some minor indications of macro-related softness in smaller European reseller accounts and in China due to COVID-related lockdowns, but this proved immaterial as organic bookings were up 29% year-over-year, roughly double the organic ARR growth rate. Europe bookings grew 20%. As I mentioned, renewals were also strong and we\u2019re raising our FY \u201822 organic churn guidance as we\u2019re trending slightly better than expected. Growth was strong in both Digital Thread and Velocity units and across all three geographies. Q3 was the seventh consecutive quarter that bookings have grown faster than ARR, which together with improving renewal rates is driving the accelerating ARR growth we\u2019ve been delivering all year. To help you appreciate the resilience of PTC, as you think about any potential macro volatility that may lie ahead. On Slide 6, I\u2019d like to briefly again review our business model dynamics to help investors understand why, despite the uncertainty, we have confidence in our financial targets for the remainder of the year. On the left-hand of the slide, you can see that the 16% ARR growth we delivered in Q3 was based not just on our Q3 performance, but performance over the prior three quarters as well. Given our definition of ARR is the annualized value of the book of active recurring software contracts, ARR growth is effectively a trailing four-quarter metric. When we say ARR grew 16% in the third quarter, we mean that on average ARR has now grown 16% over each of the past four quarters, because the entire book of active recurring businesses now 16% larger than it was at this time last year. While this trailing dynamic serves to dampen the impact of bookings in any single quarter, such as the strong results in Q3 where bookings grew roughly twice the speed of ARR. It also provides a tremendous foundation of stability for the company. We are raising our ARR guidance for the full year, because three of the four quarterly results that will comprise FY \u201822 ARR growth are already known. And we feel sufficiently confident about Q4. Kristian will elaborate during his guidance reveal. As you think about macro scenarios and their effect on PTC, remember the basic rule of thumb that\u2019s a longest bookings exceed churn over the trailing four quarters, ARR will grow and so too should free cash flow. Bookings currently exceed churn by a wide margin, roughly 3:1. To demonstrate the resilience of our model, I\u2019ll quickly review the same big round directionally accurate numbers I supplied last quarter for you to run scenarios against. Think of PTC having around $1.5 billion in ARR and on a run-rate basis we\u2019re adding $300 million in annual bookings, while seeing $100 million in annual churn. That\u2019s the 3:1 ratio I spoke of. Over the next year, the $1.5 billion of ARR would step up by $300 million in bookings, and step down by $100 million in churn to grow to $1.7 billion, which is 13% growth. That\u2019s roughly consistent with our current run rate performance though our actual 15% ARR growth level reflects that we\u2019re running slightly favorable on both bookings and churn. I\u2019ll skip the details this time around, but on the right-side of the slide, let me remind you of the hypothetical scenarios I shared last quarter. The first scenario has booking slow 30% for four quarters, like we experienced in 2009. And the second scenario has booking slow 30% for two quarters, like we experienced in 2020. In both cases, churn has held flat, consistent with experience in both periods. Across those scenarios, ARR grows upper single-digits to low-teens. Now, to understand profitability in a downturn, let\u2019s take a fresh look at Slide 7, which I burrowed and updated from our December Investor Day presentation. Whether top line growth remains strong as it has been or slows a bit due to macro developments, we expect to see significant margin expansion going forward. Margin expansion starts with the scale advantages we get by growing the top line faster than spending. Fiscal year-to-date, ARR is up 16%, while non-GAAP OpEx is basically flat, but we have several margin expansion programs that go further. The first margin expansion program is reflected in the actions we successfully implemented at the end of FY \u201821, which is shown on the left half of the page. Those changes that worth several hundred basis points of margin expansion, once the restructuring is complete, and it now largely is. By the time we enter FY \u201823, we have the bulk of the operating costs and the restructuring costs removed from our results. In addition to that, we\u2019ve also initiated a second margin expansion program, which is shifting resources within our portfolio in a way that addresses key staffing needs, while driving up the profitability of our J-Curve businesses as shown on the right half of the slide. By reassigning some sales in R&D resources, and I\u2019m talking about the actual people from IoT and AR, where growth has been lower than expected into other parts of the portfolio like CAD and PLM, where growth has been exceeding expectations, we\u2019re able to accommodate much of the company\u2019s resourcing needs, while canceling more than half of the 800 open positions we had a quarter ago. This program will not involve layoffs or restructuring charges, just new assignments for existing employees. The avoidance of new hires and their previously budgeted costs is expected to yield a couple hundred basis points of margin expansion over time. Note that a nice side effect of these resourcing shifts is that the Digital Thread growth unit comprised of IoT and AR is now crossing into profitability. We expect to see further margin expansion that comes naturally, as these businesses continue scaling beyond the current $214 million in ARR. In addition to the margin expansion programs that are well underway, there\u2019s a third margin expansion opportunity. If we were to encounter signs of a significant macro slowdown, like the scenarios I mentioned, we would quickly implement new hiring restrictions against the balance of the open positions we have, as well as other spending restrictions. This too would further help margins. The summary is that our cost structure is in great shape as we contemplate scenarios of what might lie ahead. Given the cost lever we\u2019ve already pulled with the restructuring at the end of last year, the lever we\u2019re pulling now by rebalancing resources within the portfolio and the additional lever that remains incrementally available to us if we see signs of a downturn, we\u2019re looking at substantial margin expansion drivers that make us confident, we can deliver free cash flow growth in the mid-20s or better at Q3 FX levels and across most plausible ARR growth scenarios. A mid-20s free cash flow growth rates supports the longer-term free cash flow guidance we currently have out there. So we continue to feel good about that even in this shaky environment. Because we have products that are compelling and sticky, sold into good markets using a recurring revenue model, coupled with a longstanding reputation for spending discipline, PTC is in a good position to drive differentiated free cash flow growth no matter what macro scenario plays out. Getting back to Q3, let\u2019s take a quick look at our ARR performance by geography on Slide 8, before turning to our business units. In Q3, we again saw a strong ARR growth across all geographies. ARR growth in the Americas was 14%. In Europe, our ARR growth was 17% despite the Russia exit in Q2, which still affects the growth rate, given the trailing nature of our ARR metric. Our ARR growth in APAC was 16%. Knowing that investors are concerned about the macro environment, I\u2019d like to reiterate that we are continuing to see strong bookings and renewal performance globally and in Europe, and giving our recurring business model, ARR is likely to grow in all, but the most extreme downturn scenarios one can imagine. Next, let\u2019s take a look at the ARR performance of our business units starting with Digital Thread on Slide 9. In our largest product segment, Digital Thread Core, we delivered another strong double-digit growth performance in Q3 with 14% ARR growth. Within this, once again, CAD grew low double-digits, while PLM grew 17%. Bookings grew faster in both cases. Q3 was the best performance yet across the known 19 consecutive quarters of double-digit ARR growth we\u2019ve seen in the Core CAD and PLM business. On the SaaS transformation front, Windchill+ is in its early days, but we had a solid SaaS quarter for Windchill based primarily on a good mix of SaaS in new projects. We continue to expect to see a growing SaaS impact from lift and shift conversions as that phenomenon ramps in FY \u201823 and beyond. A reminder too that Windchill+ is the tip of the iceberg of a bigger plus strategy and you\u2019ll see us follow with Creo+ and similar premium SaaS offerings in FY \u201823 and beyond. In Digital Thread Growth, which is IoT and AR, we were pleased to see ARR growth accelerate to 19%. In the neighborhood of that two-handle growth rate we\u2019re targeting. ThingWorx DPM had a solid quarter, including a multimillion dollar ramp deal with a leading global contract manufacturer for a 30 factory DPM rollout following a successful proof of concept. With ThingWorx DPM, we believe we have a turnkey IoT solution with strong product market fit and this deal represents an excellent proof point. FSG posted great results again in Q3, accelerating to 9% ARR growth organically and growing 17% inclusive of Codebeamer. Within FSG, retail PLM, Arbortext and Servigistics all performed notably well, driven by solid results in terms of both bookings and renewals. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 10 and double-click on Codebeamer. As the driver of the inorganic growth of FSG, Codebeamer had an outstanding quarter, beating its plan even before landing a mid seven-figures ramp deal with a European automotive supplier that\u2019s standardizing on Codebeamer across its thousands of software engineers. This transaction was actually the largest order PTC booked in the third quarter, which is quite an accomplishment for a business that currently represents 1% of our ARR. The Codebeamer product has best-in-class ALM capabilities, and is seeing high demand because these capabilities are critical to manufacturers whose products contain embedded software. That\u2019s especially true in industries like automotive and medical devices that are regulated, because an errant software chain \u2013 change somewhere in the supply chain could lead to an unexpected product behavior that might kill people. Codebeamer is often an amazing start and early returns are very encouraging. We have combined Codebeamer with our previous ALM offering called Integrity and elevated this consolidated ALM business to be a key product line alongside CAD, PLM, IoT and AR in the Digital Thread portfolio. Codebeamer will continue to be sold standalone and will sell it with PLM as well. In addition to the strong standalone ALM sales that Codebeamer has been experiencing, adding it to PTC\u2019s portfolio, is expected to drive incremental revenue and cost synergies. To keep our reporting simple in the near-term, we will continue to report the ALM business in the FSG line item, placing the high-growth Codebeamer business in the FSG reporting line item should take FSG from being a low single-digit grower to a sustainable mid single-digit grower going forward, which of course helps to elevate PTC\u2019s overall growth rate as well. Before I turn to our Velocity business unit, let me run through a customer story on Slide 11 that illustrates how customers are leveraging our digital transformation capabilities. With more than 29,000 employees, Vestas is a key global provider of sustainable energy solutions to the energy industry. Vestas is a great PTC customer, and they use our software across their Digital Thread, as they design, manufacture, install and service onshore and offshore wind turbines around the globe. To meet the unique needs of each customer and each deployment, Vestas has embraced digital transformation. Vestas has literally taken an electrical mechanical wind turbine and turned it into a highly tailorable software controlled, connected powerhouse of clean and affordable energy. For Vestas, the first step was to establish a strong PLM foundation in engineering. Now Vestas is leveraging the end-to-end configuration management capabilities of Creo, Windchill and ThingWorx to drive process improvements across engineering and manufacturing. By eliminating manual handoffs and redundant work, Vestas is unlocking a step function improvement in product and process quality, while shortening lead times. Vestas is driving closed-loop innovation using data from a large number of connected wind turbines in the field to generate engineering insights. PTC\u2019s unique portfolio was well aligned to support Vestas along their digital transformation journey, and their future plans include increasing use of ThingWorx and Vuforia as they continue to develop their best-in-class wind power solutions. Turning to the Velocity business unit on Slide 12, year-over-year ARR growth for our Velocity unit accelerated slightly to 29% in Q3, with Onshape and Arena again, growing multiple times faster than their market. These cloud-native businesses each a pioneering leader in its respective category continue to give us proof points that suggest the future of the product lifecycle software market will be SaaS. With Velocity, PTC has the best pure-play SaaS strategy in our market. It really is the industry benchmark for how SaaS should be done. And with the Atlas platform, born of Onshape and now powering Windchill+ in the broader plus strategy, we are implementing SaaS across the entire portfolio. We expect the SaaS strategy to create strong growth tailwinds in the Core business for years to come. Let\u2019s move to Slide 13, where I\u2019d like to take you through a Velocity customer story. Wavemaker Labs is a product development accelerator known for product development excellence in automation applications. They have a portfolio of companies and they help these companies build disruptive technologies. Photo you see on the slide is the Flippy 2 Automated Frying Robot from Miso Robotics, which is one of Wavemaker\u2019s portfolio companies. Miso Robotics is leveraging automation to revolutionize commercial food service, and their customers include Jack in the Box, Chipotle and White Castle, all favorites of Kristian Talvitie I\u2019m sure. To help Miso Robotics and their portfolio companies drive high velocity product development, Wavemaker Labs has chosen Onshape and Arena. Speed, agility and flexible scalability are top priorities for Wavemaker Labs, making Onshape and Arena a natural fit. The unique analytics and management reporting capabilities of Onshape helps Wavemaker Labs to better understand the efficiency and the engagement of their engineers. Also with their high velocity mindset, Wavemaker Labs is focused on driving frictionless collaboration from start to finish. They\u2019re looking forward to being one of the first customers to deploy the new Onshape-Arena connection feature, which is in customer test now and will be released shortly. This connector will launch the industry\u2019s first integrated pure-SaaS, CAD and PLM suite, which enables improved collaboration and a seamless flow of product data across engineering, supply chain and manufacturing or contract manufacturing activities. For a final topic, turning to Slide 14, there are two upcoming investor events I want to raise to your attention. First, we plan to hold a Virtual FY \u201823 Investor Day event on November 17th, where we\u2019ll give you a deeper view into PTC\u2019s financial plans for FY \u201823 and beyond. Second, we plan to host a large LiveWorx Ecosystem event on May 15th and 16th of 2023, that assuming COVID cooperates, we expect will bring together thousands of customers, partners, investors and employees in a live event at the Boston Convention and Expo Center near our Seaport headquarters. We\u2019re hoping that many of you will attend the LiveWorx event where we\u2019ll have a dedicated investor track that allows you to participate in keynotes and investor sessions, plus gives you ample opportunity to interact directly with management, customers and partners across the PTC ecosystem. To make it easier for you, we plan to make the November event both shorter and virtual, with the intention to give you what you need for your models to tide you over to the bigger LiveWorx event in May, where you can get a full dose of strategy and customer exposure. Please watch for our Hold the Date invitation from our Investor Relations Team regarding both events. To wrap up on Slide 15, demand remains strong in Q3 and we\u2019ve seen only minor signs of a macro slowdown. But we\u2019re watching diligently and we\u2019re well prepared for whatever lies ahead. Because of our resilient business model and spending discipline, we expect to deliver solid top and bottom line growth across any of the more plausible macro scenarios. Overall, I\u2019m very pleased with PTC\u2019s position, our strategy is working well. We\u2019ve driven both our growth and profitability to levels that are near the top of our peer group and I\u2019m excited about the opportunities to do even better as we push ahead in parallel with a growth and margin expansion initiatives. Throughout the first three quarters of FY \u201822, bookings and renewals have been very strong. Growth has been accelerating all year, which is why we\u2019re raising our guidance for the third time. And we\u2019re entering the fourth quarter of what will be our fifth consecutive year of double-digit organic ARR growth. I think the company\u2019s never been in better position to create shareholder value. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to the Kristian for more details on the financial results.\nKristian Talvitie: Thanks, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our results, I\u2019d like to note that I\u2019ll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance and ARR references will be in both constant currency and as reported. Turning to Slide 17. As a reminder, when we provided guidance last quarter, we specifically excluded the Codebeamer and DxP transactions, which had not closed at that point. Codebeamer contributed $16 million of ARR in Q3. On an organic constant currency basis, our ARR was $1.61 billion, up 15% year-over-year, and ahead of the comparable guidance range we provided which was $1.58 billion to $1.595 billion. Including Codebeamer, our constant currency ARR was $1.625 billion, up 16% year-over-year. Aside from a non-operating cash inflow, the DxP transaction did not impact our results as most of the in-flight services contracts are still on our paper. We expect the transition of these services contracts to happen gradually over time, and will be reflected in future guidance as we provide it. However, we expect the impact to ARR and free cash flow to be de minimis. As Jim explained, our top line strength in Q3 was broad-based. We\u2019re executing well against our strategy and we\u2019re continuing to improve upon strong market position. Our SaaS businesses across our Digital Thread and Velocity groups saw continued solid ARR growth in Q3. On an as reported basis, we delivered 9% ARR growth, 8% organic due to the impact of FX headwinds, which were approximately $81 million, substantially higher than the $32 million of FX headwinds we estimated a quarter ago using Q2 ending exchange rates. Despite the FX headwinds, our cash flow results were strong coming in ahead of our guidance, increased ARR, solid collections performance, slower hiring and above planned perpetual license revenue from Kepware helped to offset the incremental headwinds that materialized in Q3. When assessing and forecasting our quarterly cash flow, it\u2019s also important to remember a few things. The majority of our collections occur in the first half of our fiscal year. Q4 is our lowest cash flow generation quarter. And free cash flow is primarily a function of ARR rather than revenue. Q3 revenue of $462 million increased 6% year-over-year, as we\u2019ve discussed previously, revenue has impacted by ASC 606. So we do not believe that revenue growth rates are the best indicator of our underlying business performance, but would rather guide you to ARR as the best metric to understand our top line performance and cash generation. FX impacted revenue by $18 million in Q3. So our revenue on a constant currency basis was $480 million, up 12% year-over-year. Before I move on to the balance sheet, I\u2019d like to provide some color on our non-GAAP operating margin as I did last quarter. We continue to caution that because revenue is impacted by 606, other derivative metrics such as gross margin and operating margin, operating profit, EPS are all impacted as well. Still it\u2019s worth mentioning that we\u2019re benefiting from the work we\u2019ve done to optimize our cost structure, following our restructuring announcement last November. In Q3 \u201822, our non-GAAP operating expenses were slightly less than in Q3 \u201821. Yet we delivered significantly higher ARR, free cash flow and revenue, and our margin percentage also expanded compared to a full year ago. As I indicated last quarter, we believe the improvements we\u2019ve driven are sustainable, and we remain on track to deliver operating margin expansion for the full year and expect to end the year with operating margins in the high 30% range. Moving to Slide 18, we ended the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $322 million. Our gross debt was $1.43 billion with an aggregate interest rate of 3.5%. During Q3, the amount drawn on our revolving credit facility increased by $159 million on a net basis to $434 million. This was due to the financing of the Codebeamer acquisition, partially offset by paying down $105 million on our revolver. Regarding our share repurchase program, as we\u2019ve communicated on the previous two calls, we\u2019ve completed $125 million of repurchases in Fiscal \u201822. Our long-term goal assuming our debt-to-EBITDA ratio is below 3 turns, is to return approximately 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases, while also taking into consideration the interest rate environment and strategic opportunities. Next, Slide 19 shows our ARR by product group. We post the set of financial data tables to our IR website that has our financial statements as well as ARR details. In that file, we share both constant currency and as reported ARR. As a reminder, when we calculate constant currency figures, we use our current year plan FX rates, which are as of September 30, 2021 for all periods. You can see on the slide how FX dynamics have resulted in differences between our constant currency ARR and as reported ARR over the past seven quarters. Based on exchange rates at the end of Q3, reported ARR for fiscal \u201822 would be approximately $85 million less than our constant currency ARR guidance. This is important to consider in the context of our guidance, because we provide ARR guidance on a constant currency basis. If exchange rates fluctuate significantly between the end of Q3 and the end of Q4, the impact to our as reported ARR would also change. We believe constant currency is the best way to evaluate top line performance of our business, because it removes FX fluctuations from the analysis positive or negative. As a reminder, as we said our ARR guidance for fiscal \u201823 on our next call, we\u2019ll be providing that at the September 30, 2022, our foreign exchange rates and restating history assuming those rates. Moving on to the next slide. Given the sharp moves in FX that we\u2019ve seen recently, I thought it would be useful to provide an updated ARR sensitivity rule of thumb so to speak here on Slide 20. In addition to the US dollar, we transact in euro, yen and more than 10 other additional currencies. Using our Q3 FX rates, the impact of a $0.10 change in the euro to USD rate would be $38 million positive or negative. And the impact to a JPY0.10 change in the US dollar to yen rate would be about $8 million. Of course, the estimated dollar impact to ARR is depended on the size of the ARR base. Turning to Slide 21. We\u2019re pleased to have closed both the Codebeamer and DxP transactions in the third quarter. Let me explain the financial impacts starting with ARR. At the end of Q3, Codebeamer\u2019s ARR was $16 million reported as part of FSG. We expect solid ARR growth from Codebeamer and this should help FSG grow consistently in the mid single-digit range going forward. The DxP transaction will not impact ARR, but it is instead expected to result in lower professional services revenue. This will happen over time as the services contracts move to DxP from PTC. In Q3, the impact was de minimis. And since our services business is not high margin, we do not expect a material impact to our profitability as the business gets smaller over time. Next, from a free cash flow perspective, we expect Codebeamer and DxP to have an immaterial impact in fiscal \u201822 and to be accretive in fiscal \u201823. In fiscal \u201822, the incremental operational cash flows essentially offset incremental transaction-related fees and incremental interest expense. With that, I\u2019ll move on to guidance on Slide 22. I\u2019ll start by pointing out that our previous guidance did not include the financial impact of Codebeamer or DxP, and our updated guidance now does. As I just explained, this positively impacts ARR. But is immaterial for our other guidance items. We\u2019re raising our fiscal \u201822 constant currency ARR guidance based on our strong year-to-date new and renewal bookings performance, the addition of Codebeamer, and despite our exit from Russia in Q2 of this year. The new range is now $1.66 billion to $1.69 billion, which translates to constant currency ARR growth of 13% to 15% for fiscal \u201822. At the midpoint, we\u2019re raising ARR guidance by $23 million, approximately $16 million of the raise is attributable to the addition of Codebeamer ARR, with the rest being driven by our strong business performance. Given the macro uncertainties, we\u2019re providing a wider range for ARR than we usually would at this point in our fiscal year. The low end contemplates a 2020 recession kind of scenario where bookings will be down 30% and we\u2019d see a modest increase in churn. This is primarily to illustrate the resiliency of our model. As Jim mentioned, we did not really see any material impact for the macro environment in Q3. So if that trend continues, we would beat the low end handily. It\u2019s also worth noting that we\u2019re increasing our expectation for organic churn improvement in fiscal \u201822 from approximately 100 basis points of improvement to approximately 150 basis points of improvement, excluding the impact of our exit from Russia. Even including the inorganic Arena churn and additional Russia-related churn, we\u2019re expecting approximately 100 basis points of churn improvement. And while we don\u2019t guide to bookings, I know that we sometimes reference bookings performance. And Jim mentioned earlier that our bookings growth has outpaced our ARR growth for seven quarters in a row. This will not continue in the fourth quarter, given the exceptionally strong bookings performance we add in Q4 of fiscal \u201821. As Jim also mentioned in our Digital Thread Growth segment, our IoT and AR product lines, ARR accelerated again in the third quarter, as we achieve 19% year-over-year growth. We expect fiscal \u201822 ARR growth for this segment to be 20% plus or minus. Next, on cash flows, we\u2019re raising our free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow guidance for fiscal \u201822. Our strong year-to-date execution includes growing ARR at the high end of our guidance range, especially in the first half of the year, which helped us to generate the majority of our FY \u201822 collections when FX rates were more favorable. Additionally, Kepware continues to perform very well and our perpetual license bookings are also above plan. Given our operational discipline, and the macro environment, our hiring has also been somewhat slower than anticipated. And as we think about Q4, the internal resource reallocation Jim discussed earlier will also further slow hiring. These tailwinds are helping us to offset various headwinds including FX or Russia exit, modestly higher compensation and incremental acquisition and interest-related costs due to the Codebeamer and DxP transactions. Finally, regarding Q4, we continue to expect our normal seasonal pattern of cash flow generation, primarily driven by invoicing seasonality. Moving to revenue, because of the sharp moves in FX over the past three months, we\u2019re reducing the midpoint of our full year revenue guidance by $15 million. So for fiscal \u201822, our new revenue guidance is $1.9 billion to $1.95 billion and the year-over-year growth we are guiding to is now 5% to 8%. ASC 606 makes revenue very difficult to predict for on-premise subscription companies, hence the wide range. Note, that revenue does not influence ARR or cash generation, as we typically bill customers annually upfront, regardless of contract term lengths. I\u2019ll close out my prepared remarks today by taking you through an illustrative constant currency ARR model on Slide 23. Here, we\u2019re showing our ARR progression over the past seven quarters, and an illustration of what is needed to get to the midpoint of our constant currency ARR guidance for fiscal \u201822. Focusing on the last line in the chart, organic sequential ARR growth. The trend that is developed in fiscal \u201822 shows better organic ARR growth year-to-date compared to fiscal \u201821. Next, calling your attention to the green box. This model shows targeted ending ARR at $1.67 billion for Q4 to the midpoint of our guidance range. As you can see, to hit the midpoint of guidance, we need to add $50 million of organic ARR in Q4. This is less than the $63 million we added in Q4 of fiscal \u201821. We believe we\u2019re well positioned to do that, given our pipeline and forecast, and also in part, because we have more deferred ARR starting in Q4 of \u201822, than we did last year. And with the context of macro concerns, we\u2019ve set a low end that contemplates a severe downturn in the global economy. Putting all this together, we believe we\u2019ve set our guidance prudently. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to the operator to begin Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We do ask that you can limit yourself to one question only and then you rejoin the queue for additional questions. Our first question will come from Matthew Broome with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Broome: Thanks very much. Hi, Jim and Kristian. So congratulations on the large DPM ramp deal. Just how would you characterize the pipeline for that particular solution?\nJim Heppelmann: The pipeline is quite good. I mean, there\u2019s a lot of interest in this solution. And in fact, we\u2019ve already had a couple of follow-on orders from some of the earliest orders we received. So, I think it\u2019s a good solution. You know there\u2019s a lot going on in the world of manufacturing these days. So there\u2019s a lot of competition for mindshare, but I think we have a very good solution and there\u2019s a lot of interest in it.\nMatthew Broome: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Saket Kalia with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nSaket Kalia: Okay, great. Hey, Jim. Hey, Kristian, Thanks for \u2013 thanks for taking my questions here or question. Kristian, maybe \u2013 maybe I\u2019ll direct this one to you. Can you just talk a little bit about any pricing changes you know that PTC has done you know in the last year or so? How you\u2019ve sort of you know approached pricing you know as \u2013 as part of this year\u2019s guide? And just any anything on pricing that you would say with respect to this year\u2019s ARR guide?\nKristian Talvitie: Yeah, sure. Hey, a second. Thanks for the question. So you know like most of our peers, we evaluate pricing typically on an annual \u2013 annual basis and you know generally contemplate price increases around the October, kind of November timeframe. That\u2019s been our pattern here for the past \u2013 past few years, depending on the overall macro environment and you know competitive environment, we try to take those things into consideration, as we \u2013 as we think about price increases. So for example you know, during COVID, we actually did a much smaller price increase than we normally would. And \u2013 and this year, we actually given the macro environment, we actually pulled the price increase forward a little bit. So you know effective in May, we did a price increase that was also slightly larger than normal, reflecting the macroeconomic situation that we\u2019re all in right now. In terms of its impact to this year\u2019s guidance and performance, I would say it\u2019s been a modest, if you will, at best tailwind for fiscal \u201822. But we think that it\u2019s one that will persist in the fiscal \u201823. And I think the way to think about that is if the price increase was effective in \u2013 you know effective in May, any quotes that were already in play would have had old pricing and so on. So you\u2019re \u2013 you\u2019re really talking about quotes that are going out after the price increase. So primarily impacting you know Q4 and beyond.\nJim Heppelmann: And maybe to add on renewals. As we\u2019ve discussed, our average term lengths around two years, which would mean each quarter on average, an eighth of renewals are up. And \u2013 and then actually a majority of those have contractual price increases uninfluenced by inflation or by price increases we did to the product. So, it was not a major factor. In fact, it was a pretty de minimis factor in Q3, but it will be helpful as we \u2013 as we get into next year.\nSaket Kalia: Okay, got it. Very helpful, guys. Thank you.\nJim Heppelmann: Thanks.\nKristian Talvitie: Thanks, Saket.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Andrew Obin with Bank of America.\nAndrew Obin: Yes, good afternoon. Good afternoon.\nJim Heppelmann: Hi, Andrew. Hi.\nAndrew Obin: Hi. Jim, Kristian. Just the question on Windchill-SaaS transition. Sounds like Windchill+ is more attractive to new logos versus lift and shift existing clients. How is the pipeline for lift and shift building relative to your expectations?\nJim Heppelmann: I\u2019m quite pleased with it. There\u2019s a lot of interest. But you know it\u2019s a project that has to be sold and planned and so forth. Sometimes I call it the last upgrade. Because you know, there\u2019s a process to de-customize this system and upgrade it and then merge it into the running SaaS system. So there\u2019s a lot of interest. But I think we never really didn\u2019t feel like that\u2019d be fast out of the blocks. What\u2019s easier to do is if a new customers buying Windchill, we say, well would you like it SaaS and they say, sure, why not. So it\u2019s a lot easier for us to get out of the blocks faster with new projects than with these lift and shifts. But the interest level, I assure you is quite high. And in fact, the growth rate in Windchill is strong overall, but it\u2019s stronger you know as you would expect on a SaaS side than on the on-premise side.\nAndrew Obin: Thanks a lot.\nJim Heppelmann: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Blair Abernethy with Rosenblatt Securities. Please go ahead.\nBlair Abernethy: Thanks very much. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Jim, I just wanted to maybe dig in a little more on the Digital Thread Growth that you sort of mentioned the IoT business and AR business, you know maybe not \u2013 not quite where you want them to be at. Can you just talk a little bit about what\u2019s kind of happening in those end markets? And sort of what \u2013 you know what the competitive landscape is looking like for you guys these days?\nJim Heppelmann: Yeah, sure. Blair. So yeah, I mean, I think all year you know we\u2019ve over-performed in a long list of things. And there\u2019s \u2013 and there\u2019s one part of the business has a little bit underperformed, even though it\u2019s growing at a rate that\u2019s accretive to company growth. But that\u2019s IoT and AR. And I think it\u2019s really a \u2013 mostly a market issue, not a competitive issue. In fact, I\u2019d say it\u2019s not at all a competitive issue. There\u2019s this factor that I call the hair-on-fire factor, which is a lot of this stuff is sold into environments that are in chaos right now. You know, if you run a factory, and we\u2019re trying to tell you how we can make it more productive, you say, well, it\u2019s shut down, because I don\u2019t have any inventory. Or I\u2019m in a lockdown mode or \u2013 or I have too much inventory or you know there\u2019s just a lot of noise right now that, again, is competing for mindshare, and it\u2019s not just competing for PTC\u2019s mindshare, it\u2019s competing for competitors\u2019 mindshare too. So I\u2019m unaware of anybody we compete with who has higher performance than we do in this environment. I think this environment will pass and we\u2019ll get more momentum down the road. But meanwhile, what we said is, we have you know, we \u2013 we put our resourcing plans in place according to our growth plans. And the places that are surpassing that growth plan need more resources and the places that are behind I mean, honestly, we have too many resources stacked in there. So we\u2019re just moving them around, it doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re given up on anything we \u2013 we hope to get to and achieve this 20% growth rate, but I think as we look to next year, I think we feel like 20% would be a pretty good growth rate for next year. I\u2019m not guiding to that here, but I\u2019m just saying I don\u2019t think the market supports more than 20% growth rate at this point in time, because of those hair-on-fire issues I\u2019m talking about.\nBlair Abernethy: Great, thanks for the color, Jim.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Adam Borg with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nAdam Borg: Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe just to follow-up along just the Thread from the last question. So as you allocate these resources from IoT and AR and presumably to CAD and PLM, how do we think about the ramp from the sales and marketing perspective to get these guys productive? I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s a hell of a lot easier to be more productive given they already familiar with the technology and the company versus a brand new reps. I\u2019d love to hear more about the productivity of those reps as \u2013 as you make that transition.\nJim Heppelmann: Yeah, for sure. I mean, I think it\u2019s the absolute most effective and efficient way to bring more resources to bear, because these are people who are already in the PTC sales organization, they already know the management team, they already know the customers, we\u2019re just saying, hey, sell this product instead of that one to the same people in many cases. Not in every case, but certainly to the same types of people in every case. So I think it\u2019s quite \u2013 it\u2019s quite an effective way to ramp new capacity. And meanwhile, I don\u2019t see much risk on the IoT and AR side, because we have ample capacity left to keep up with the demand we see. We simply or have too much capacity to be frank in IoT and AR selling. And so we\u2019re shifting that over putting a couple of different products in their big and send them back onto the playing field. So I think it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s smart. I think it\u2019s going to work well. And I think there\u2019s very little risk.\nAdam Borg: Great, thanks so much.\nJim Heppelmann: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Yeah, okay. Thank you. Hello, Jim. Hello, Kristian. Jim, you alluded in your comments to share gain in your Core CAD and PLM businesses. And I think that\u2019s a reasonable observation. In addition to which you noted the strength in ALM, at least with the acquisition. And if perhaps raises a larger question of how the technical software market is evolving yet again, perhaps moving beyond what has historically been very [technical difficulty] centric industry to increasingly now with a \u2013 I think it\u2019s simulation-centric industry in terms of revenue and process. So you know if that evolution continues you know where the world becomes simulation-driven, plus CAD and PLM. You know how do you \u2013 how do you think that positions or leaves PTC in terms of you know your growth, your \u2013 your competitiveness, your resource allocation et cetera?\nJim Heppelmann: Yeah. Well, I sort of agree with you, but I\u2019m not sure I agree with every piece of it. But let me \u2013 let me just talk about a few of them. So first of all, on taking share. Clearly PTC you know, Dassault had their earnings report yesterday, and you can go line item by line item in the CAD and PLM world. And our results are better than theirs. I think the SolidWorks\u2019 business grew 8% and our Velocity business grew 29%. If I remember correctly, the Enovia and Catia business grew 11% and ours grew 14%. So, certainly on a dollars basis, we\u2019re taking share. Now, I\u2019ve always attributed some of that to a better business model. So I think we\u2019re monetizing customer relationships better. And we may be taking more wallet share than sheet share, but we\u2019re certainly not given up any share. There\u2019s just no math that would get you there. So I think we\u2019re doing well. Now, is simulation important? Absolutely. But you know so too is PLM. I mean, I don\u2019t know, do you know what simulation company that\u2019s growing like our Windchill PLM business at 17%? I\u2019m not really aware of one. So I think that PLM is a much more strategic product and then people have given a credit for it. It\u2019s sort of the age of PLM right now. Now, it may also be the age of simulation. And you know we have a great simulation partner in ANSYS, fantastic partner. And you know when a customer says simulation is important, we say great, let me tell you about our best-in-class simulation capabilities built right into Creo that come from ANSYS. So you know I\u2019m happy if the customer thinks simulation is important, but I but I think at least is frequently, they think PLM is important and ALM too. And that\u2019s really our strong suit. We\u2019re absolutely best-in-class at PLM, Vernon.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Thank you, Jim.\nJim Heppelmann: Thank you, Jay.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And again, we do ask that you limit yourself to one question and rejoin queue for follow-up. Our next question will come from Joe Vruwink with Baird. Please go ahead.\nJoe Vruwink: Great. Hi, everyone. You know, Jim, you brought up Dassault, but I think this topic has extended beyond just the strength a lot of your peers are seeing with the enterprise-type buyer and actually that type of account wanting to forge ahead if making new commitments and actually maybe pursuing things that are newer or more strategic you know cloud adoption has been coming up at the enterprise level. I\u2019m just wondering is that true at PTC as well? And if this divergence was maybe happening, enterprise versus SMB? Does it cause PTC to maybe deviate some of the strategies that the company has been you know talking about and pursuing recently?\nJim Heppelmann: Well, first of all, I think, Joe, that your thesis is at least directionally correct, that there certainly is a lot of interest amongst the larger enterprises, in digital transformation and in cloud. And those are places where PTC is well positioned. And you know kind of historically, we\u2019ve had more exposure to the enterprise market than to the SMB market. You know, Creo and Windchill kind of don\u2019t have near the representation in the SMB market that other products have from say, you know, Dassault or \u2013 or Autodesk or whomever. Now, with \u2013 with our Velocity unit, that\u2019s really an SMB business. And that\u2019s doing pretty well. And I think that\u2019s all cloud-driven. You know what I mean? That\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s a subset of the market who says, I really want to go to cloud, and PTC\u2019s Onshape and Arena Solutions are virtually unmatched for those types of customers. But I think in general, yeah, the enterprise market really is leaning into digital transformation. I think COVID was very helpful for this. And I think it\u2019s most helpful to PLM, because you just really can\u2019t have a hybrid workforce. If people working at home can\u2019t find the data, they need to do their work today, and they can\u2019t walk down the hall to talk to somebody, because they\u2019re not in the building. And even if they were in the building, the person they want to talk to is not in the building. So you really need a system, a system of record, and a system of engagement to allow you to you know do your job from anywhere in the office today, from home tomorrow, whatever. And \u2013 and PLM is that system. So you know, Dassault\u2019s PLM results are pretty good. And ours were even better. And I think that\u2019s indicative of you know a market that\u2019s pretty healthy, which I think was the basic thesis, you know of your question.\nJoe Vruwink: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nMatt Swanson: Yeah, thanks. This is Matt Swanson on for Matt. Congratulations on the results for starters. And then another really strong guide, and in particular, the constant currency ARR. And that obviously accounts for FX. But you know as you mentioned, Jim, a lot of investor focus going into this earnings season was on the macro. And I think a lot of people are going to be surprised that there weren\u2019t you know some greater demand headwinds from that macro. So can you just comment a little bit more on that environment? You know, it sounds like the hair-on-fire comments in IoT and AR, maybe that\u2019s a little bit of macro, but you\u2019re obviously overcoming it in a lot of other areas. So if you guys give us a little bit more color on that?\nJim Heppelmann: We are definitely overcoming it. And even with IoT and AR, we did see a nice acceleration in the quarter. So I think if you look at our bookings, they were up strong sequentially. They were up strong year-over-year. You know if I think ahead to our Q4 forecast that is very strong sequentially. It\u2019s not up year-over-year, because as Kristian said, we have a monster comparison in the \u2013 in the prior year, but it\u2019s up quite strong sequentially from quite a strong quarter this quarter. So, right now our forecast looks good. Now, Kristian, and I say okay, I mean, I hope it comes in like that. But you know, if it doesn\u2019t, we\u2019re prepared for that, too. And that\u2019s a little bit why I took you through the business model and the margin programs and so forth, because we want to win no matter what happens. But so far, honestly, the news is all pretty good. It\u2019s just we don\u2019t want to be a Pollyanna here. And you know, say this downturns never going to touch us. I mean, maybe it will, and if it does, I tried to show you we\u2019re ready for it.\nMatt Swanson: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jason Celino with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Participant: Hi, Jim. Hi, Kristian. This is actually [Devine] [ph] on for Jason tonight. Thanks for taking our question. I want to ask about APAC, despite a lockdown there in certain area of the region, PTC still posted a pretty strong growth there, 16%. Just want to ask if there\u2019s anything you can call out around sales cycle, any changes there or any sort of particular strength that you saw from a specific customers or product groups? Thank you.\nJim Heppelmann: Yeah. The strength, first of all was in our Core CAD and PLM business you know the so called Digital Thread Core, which is doing well everywhere. And we did see some, I mentioned this in the commentary, we did see some China lockdown issues, where you know companies just for whatever reason didn\u2019t want to talk to us. But nonetheless, results were still good. You know we kind of had other good news to offset that. I think the key thing in China to know, if you don\u2019t know this now is it\u2019s now 5% of our business, 5% of our ARR. So we have very little exposure. It had previously been as high as I don\u2019t know, 7% or 8%. But you know when President Trump was in the office, he went to war, as you know with our, let\u2019s say, battle with our largest customer, which was Huawei. And by the time the dust settled on that, Huawei was Dassault\u2019s customer. And you know because they pretty much got the message not to do business with American companies. And that hurt us in China, generally, all the \u2013 you know a large amount of the Chinese manufacturing market is state-owned. And having watched what Trump was doing with Huawei, an American suppliers like us that was not helpful. But you know good news is, we\u2019re down to 5% exposure. And China\u2019s not that material to PTC, which I actually feel kind of good about right now given you know, the \u2013 the scariness and the outlook of what might happen there in the coming years.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Yun Kim with Loop Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJim Heppelmann: Hey, Yun.\nYun Kim: Hey. Hey, Jim and Kristian. Congrats on a strong quarter. Obviously from the results and the guide, your business is accelerating. Looks like the macro is not really impacting you guys as much. Given your strong product positioning and a large core customer \u2013 customer base that continues to increase their investments in your solutions. Can you just talk about how aggressively are you cross-selling your products, especially if you look down next couple of years with your Windchill+ migration plan you know, how aggressive do you plan to cross-sell your IoT, AR into your Core CAD and PLM install base? Thanks.\nJim Heppelmann: Yeah, well, Yun, those are good questions. So first on the specific question about cross-sell. I mean, that\u2019s actually a pretty well developed muscle inside of PTC. You know, we built our PLM business largely by cross-selling from CAD and \u2013 and then other things we\u2019ve sold have kind of been cross-sold from PLM. So definitely, we\u2019re trying to make IoT and AR more focused on what we call the Digital Thread story, which is, it\u2019s not only about solving problems with IoT, but it\u2019s about solving problems with IoT using PLM data, which would include of course, CAD, digital markups and visualization and so forth. And then our Augmented Reality, of course, is a huge consumer of 3D data, because it trains its computer vision models against 3D, digital markup configurations, not to get too technical on you guys. But anyway, there\u2019s a great cross-sell opportunity. It\u2019s a \u2013 it\u2019s a big, big focus. But you know, one thing I did want to say, your \u2013 your comment at the beginning said that our guide suggests we\u2019re not that affected by the macro. I actually just want to say to all of our investors, you need to reconfigure your opinion of PTC a little bit, because we\u2019re not a cyclical name anymore. And in fact, our guide, the low end of our guide contemplates a 30% decline in new sales in Q4. It\u2019s just that our model is so resilient, that even a 30% decline in new sales still lands with 13% ARR growth. So like sometimes I read in a report that PTC is a cyclical name, and I say, show me a piece of data that supports that, because for five years, we\u2019ve been steady as she goes, in good times and bad. And I just feel like we have a business model that\u2019s underappreciated. And you know the worst that downturn is going to get, the bigger performance differential you\u2019re going to see between us and people you compare us to you know particularly in our own industry here, because we\u2019re \u2013 you know, our software\u2019s 98% recurring, that\u2019s substantially greater than ANSYS, than Dassault, than Siemens then basically any of the companies you might directly compare us against you know in the same market, let\u2019s say.\nYun Kim: Okay, great. Thank you so much, Jim.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Tyler Radke with Citi. Please go ahead.\nTyler Radke: Yeah, Hey, Jim. Hey, Kristian. Just wanted to follow-up on a couple of points. So first just on the price increase, just wanted to clarify that there was no tailwind to that in Q3. And then, you know, secondly, wanted to just hear how you know, customers so far are kind of taking that price increase if there\u2019s you know, any \u2013 any pushback just given inflation concerns. And then finally for Kristian, as we think about free cash flow obviously you\u2019ve been able to maintain and if not raised the guide for several quarters here despite currency headwinds, but \u2013 but obviously currency does impact ARR which \u2013 which drives free cash flow. So how are you just thinking about the cumulative currency impacts on \u2013 on your free cash flow targets and your ability to offset those either through slower hiring or you know other manners? Thank you.\nJim Heppelmann: Let \u2013 let me hit the first question and you can take the second one. So the first question was about, was there any pricing tailwind? Yeah, sure, but it just was not significant. So there was a little bit of pricing tailwind. But again to go back through the kind of calculations here, only a small amount of our book of business came up in Q3 for renewal and most of these contracts have pre-negotiated price increases that we would get, despite whatever level of inflation is out there. There is a minority that you can argue, we have rights to raise the prices higher, and then some are actually tied to CPI, but most of our contracts are actually pre-negotiated fixed \u2013 fixed price increases. So we\u2019d get them no matter what the economy and the inflation was. And then again, on the new sales, it\u2019s just that our sales cycles are longer than two months. And so when you put a quote in front of a customer and you raise the price, you can\u2019t take that quote back and stick a more expensive quote in front of them, because they get kind of angry. If they don\u2019t take that deal. Well, now you can raise it or when you go meet the next customer, you can go in with a higher quote. But it\u2019s just that we didn\u2019t have enough time to work that price increase through our sales cycle, to have it be meaningful to what happened you know in terms of new sales. So you know like for example, Pepsi raised the growth rate by two points, because they raised the price of potato chips, and you walk in the store and they\u2019re more than they used to be and you pay it, but we\u2019re not selling potato chips, we\u2019re selling complex software that has multi-quarter sales cycles.\nKristian Talvitie: Okay, thanks. Hey, Tyler on the free cash flow. So, it \u2013 it \u2013 yes is a function of \u2013 of ARR as well as some other things, and also a function of timing. So as we think about free cash flow for the year you know, again, well over half of our \u2013 of our collections actually happened in the first half of the year when FX rates were much more favorable than they are right now. And as we think about you know the second half of the year, there are a number of dynamics that \u2013 that have contributed. One, we actually had ARR over-performance in the first half. Some of which shows up in you know, we\u2019ll call it second half collection. So that also helps. That helps. We\u2019ve had slower than anticipated hiring which is you know we\u2019ll call it a cost offset which also helps on the \u2013 on the free cash flow generation. And then you know we\u2019ve had modestly better perpetual license performance, Kepware is performing quite well, that\u2019s really the only thing that \u2013 that\u2019s left that we sell it even partially perpetual basis. So that \u2013 that\u2019s been you know another \u2013 another tailwind. So, you net all those out and we\u2019ve actually been able to outperform the free cash flow targets here now, three quarters in a row. And I think we have \u2013 you know we raised the \u2013 raised the outlook for Q4 and I think we have a good \u2013 good setup for that as well.\nTyler Radke: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: And our last question will come from Ken Wong with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nKristian Talvitie: Hello, Ken.\nKen Wong: Thanks for taking me in and [technical difficulty]. Just wanted to touch on FSG, I guess you know when you guys had a good performance previously, it seemed like a one-off and now this low single-digit business is going 9% organic, just wondering kind of what is the cause of that? Is it just ALM in there? Any color on FSG would be \u2013 would be fantastic.\nJim Heppelmann: Yeah. It\u2019s a good question, Ken. Because we did set an expectation, low single-digit growth and now it\u2019s kind of put along in pretty high single-digit growth. I think you know we\u2019ve just seen better demand than we had anticipated. So for example, if you look at some of the building blocks, Servigistics is a service parts management software and they\u2019re having a great year. And then there\u2019s what we call, FlexPLM, which is a special version of Windchill that we sell to retail companies, big box stores and clothing and you know apparel and footwear companies. And win rates been good and the demand has been good. There\u2019s Arbortext you know our technical documentation type of technology that does structured documents and automated publishing and so forth, and that\u2019s performed well. So I think there\u2019s actually some good demand and frankly, pretty good execution. The renewal rates in all cases have improved too. So that\u2019s also helpful. So, I don\u2019t know maybe \u2013 maybe we shouldn\u2019t say that FSG will be able to perform in mid single-digits, you know post-Codebeamer when it\u2019s already doing better than that pre-Codebeamer. But you know we\u2019ll try not to get ahead of ourselves. We\u2019re pleased with what\u2019s going on and with Codebeamer in there, you know we\u2019re pretty sure it\u2019s going to be kind of mid single-digits at least going forward.\nKen Wong: Got it. Great, fantastic. Yeah, keep chugging along guys.\nJim Heppelmann: Okay, is that the last question? All right, so Matt\u2019s given me the \u2013 give me the signal here. I just want to thank everybody for spending time with us today. Appreciate you know you hanging in there and we look forward to seeing you in 90 days, if not before. Hopefully the economy will kind of \u2013 the macro situation will stay as it has been and we\u2019ll have some really great news for you and if not, you know, I think will be \u2013 will be okay anyway. So I look forward to seeing you and have a good evening.\nKristian Talvitie: Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: And that will conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kristian Talvitie",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our results, I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance and ARR references will be in both constant currency and as reported. Turning to Slide 17. As a reminder, when we provided guidance last quarter, we specifically excluded the Codebeamer and DxP transactions, which had not closed at that point. Codebeamer contributed $16 million of ARR in Q3. On an organic constant currency basis, our ARR was $1.61 billion, up 15% year-over-year, and ahead of the comparable guidance range we provided which was $1.58 billion to $1.595 billion. Including Codebeamer, our constant currency ARR was $1.625 billion, up 16% year-over-year. Aside from a non-operating cash inflow, the DxP transaction did not impact our results as most of the in-flight services contracts are still on our paper. We expect the transition of these services contracts to happen gradually over time, and will be reflected in future guidance as we provide it. However, we expect the impact to ARR and free cash flow to be de minimis. As Jim explained, our top line strength in Q3 was broad-based. We're executing well against our strategy and we're continuing to improve upon strong market position. Our SaaS businesses across our Digital Thread and Velocity groups saw continued solid ARR growth in Q3. On an as reported basis, we delivered 9% ARR growth, 8% organic due to the impact of FX headwinds, which were approximately $81 million, substantially higher than the $32 million of FX headwinds we estimated a quarter ago using Q2 ending exchange rates. Despite the FX headwinds, our cash flow results were strong coming in ahead of our guidance, increased ARR, solid collections performance, slower hiring and above planned perpetual license revenue from Kepware helped to offset the incremental headwinds that materialized in Q3. When assessing and forecasting our quarterly cash flow, it's also important to remember a few things. The majority of our collections occur in the first half of our fiscal year. Q4 is our lowest cash flow generation quarter. And free cash flow is primarily a function of ARR rather than revenue. Q3 revenue of $462 million increased 6% year-over-year, as we've discussed previously, revenue has impacted by ASC 606. So we do not believe that revenue growth rates are the best indicator of our underlying business performance, but would rather guide you to ARR as the best metric to understand our top line performance and cash generation. FX impacted revenue by $18 million in Q3. So our revenue on a constant currency basis was $480 million, up 12% year-over-year. Before I move on to the balance sheet, I'd like to provide some color on our non-GAAP operating margin as I did last quarter. We continue to caution that because revenue is impacted by 606, other derivative metrics such as gross margin and operating margin, operating profit, EPS are all impacted as well. Still it's worth mentioning that we're benefiting from the work we've done to optimize our cost structure, following our restructuring announcement last November. In Q3 \u201822, our non-GAAP operating expenses were slightly less than in Q3 \u201821. Yet we delivered significantly higher ARR, free cash flow and revenue, and our margin percentage also expanded compared to a full year ago. As I indicated last quarter, we believe the improvements we've driven are sustainable, and we remain on track to deliver operating margin expansion for the full year and expect to end the year with operating margins in the high 30% range. Moving to Slide 18, we ended the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $322 million. Our gross debt was $1.43 billion with an aggregate interest rate of 3.5%. During Q3, the amount drawn on our revolving credit facility increased by $159 million on a net basis to $434 million. This was due to the financing of the Codebeamer acquisition, partially offset by paying down $105 million on our revolver. Regarding our share repurchase program, as we've communicated on the previous two calls, we've completed $125 million of repurchases in Fiscal \u201822. Our long-term goal assuming our debt-to-EBITDA ratio is below 3 turns, is to return approximately 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases, while also taking into consideration the interest rate environment and strategic opportunities. Next, Slide 19 shows our ARR by product group. We post the set of financial data tables to our IR website that has our financial statements as well as ARR details. In that file, we share both constant currency and as reported ARR. As a reminder, when we calculate constant currency figures, we use our current year plan FX rates, which are as of September 30, 2021 for all periods. You can see on the slide how FX dynamics have resulted in differences between our constant currency ARR and as reported ARR over the past seven quarters. Based on exchange rates at the end of Q3, reported ARR for fiscal \u201822 would be approximately $85 million less than our constant currency ARR guidance. This is important to consider in the context of our guidance, because we provide ARR guidance on a constant currency basis. If exchange rates fluctuate significantly between the end of Q3 and the end of Q4, the impact to our as reported ARR would also change. We believe constant currency is the best way to evaluate top line performance of our business, because it removes FX fluctuations from the analysis positive or negative. As a reminder, as we said our ARR guidance for fiscal \u201823 on our next call, we'll be providing that at the September 30, 2022, our foreign exchange rates and restating history assuming those rates. Moving on to the next slide. Given the sharp moves in FX that we've seen recently, I thought it would be useful to provide an updated ARR sensitivity rule of thumb so to speak here on Slide 20. In addition to the US dollar, we transact in euro, yen and more than 10 other additional currencies. Using our Q3 FX rates, the impact of a $0.10 change in the euro to USD rate would be $38 million positive or negative. And the impact to a JPY0.10 change in the US dollar to yen rate would be about $8 million. Of course, the estimated dollar impact to ARR is depended on the size of the ARR base. Turning to Slide 21. We're pleased to have closed both the Codebeamer and DxP transactions in the third quarter. Let me explain the financial impacts starting with ARR. At the end of Q3, Codebeamer's ARR was $16 million reported as part of FSG. We expect solid ARR growth from Codebeamer and this should help FSG grow consistently in the mid single-digit range going forward. The DxP transaction will not impact ARR, but it is instead expected to result in lower professional services revenue. This will happen over time as the services contracts move to DxP from PTC. In Q3, the impact was de minimis. And since our services business is not high margin, we do not expect a material impact to our profitability as the business gets smaller over time. Next, from a free cash flow perspective, we expect Codebeamer and DxP to have an immaterial impact in fiscal \u201822 and to be accretive in fiscal \u201823. In fiscal \u201822, the incremental operational cash flows essentially offset incremental transaction-related fees and incremental interest expense. With that, I'll move on to guidance on Slide 22. I'll start by pointing out that our previous guidance did not include the financial impact of Codebeamer or DxP, and our updated guidance now does. As I just explained, this positively impacts ARR. But is immaterial for our other guidance items. We're raising our fiscal \u201822 constant currency ARR guidance based on our strong year-to-date new and renewal bookings performance, the addition of Codebeamer, and despite our exit from Russia in Q2 of this year. The new range is now $1.66 billion to $1.69 billion, which translates to constant currency ARR growth of 13% to 15% for fiscal \u201822. At the midpoint, we're raising ARR guidance by $23 million, approximately $16 million of the raise is attributable to the addition of Codebeamer ARR, with the rest being driven by our strong business performance. Given the macro uncertainties, we're providing a wider range for ARR than we usually would at this point in our fiscal year. The low end contemplates a 2020 recession kind of scenario where bookings will be down 30% and we'd see a modest increase in churn. This is primarily to illustrate the resiliency of our model. As Jim mentioned, we did not really see any material impact for the macro environment in Q3. So if that trend continues, we would beat the low end handily. It's also worth noting that we're increasing our expectation for organic churn improvement in fiscal \u201822 from approximately 100 basis points of improvement to approximately 150 basis points of improvement, excluding the impact of our exit from Russia. Even including the inorganic Arena churn and additional Russia-related churn, we're expecting approximately 100 basis points of churn improvement. And while we don't guide to bookings, I know that we sometimes reference bookings performance. And Jim mentioned earlier that our bookings growth has outpaced our ARR growth for seven quarters in a row. This will not continue in the fourth quarter, given the exceptionally strong bookings performance we add in Q4 of fiscal \u201821. As Jim also mentioned in our Digital Thread Growth segment, our IoT and AR product lines, ARR accelerated again in the third quarter, as we achieve 19% year-over-year growth. We expect fiscal \u201822 ARR growth for this segment to be 20% plus or minus. Next, on cash flows, we're raising our free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow guidance for fiscal \u201822. Our strong year-to-date execution includes growing ARR at the high end of our guidance range, especially in the first half of the year, which helped us to generate the majority of our FY \u201822 collections when FX rates were more favorable. Additionally, Kepware continues to perform very well and our perpetual license bookings are also above plan. Given our operational discipline, and the macro environment, our hiring has also been somewhat slower than anticipated. And as we think about Q4, the internal resource reallocation Jim discussed earlier will also further slow hiring. These tailwinds are helping us to offset various headwinds including FX or Russia exit, modestly higher compensation and incremental acquisition and interest-related costs due to the Codebeamer and DxP transactions. Finally, regarding Q4, we continue to expect our normal seasonal pattern of cash flow generation, primarily driven by invoicing seasonality. Moving to revenue, because of the sharp moves in FX over the past three months, we're reducing the midpoint of our full year revenue guidance by $15 million. So for fiscal \u201822, our new revenue guidance is $1.9 billion to $1.95 billion and the year-over-year growth we are guiding to is now 5% to 8%. ASC 606 makes revenue very difficult to predict for on-premise subscription companies, hence the wide range. Note, that revenue does not influence ARR or cash generation, as we typically bill customers annually upfront, regardless of contract term lengths. I'll close out my prepared remarks today by taking you through an illustrative constant currency ARR model on Slide 23. Here, we're showing our ARR progression over the past seven quarters, and an illustration of what is needed to get to the midpoint of our constant currency ARR guidance for fiscal \u201822. Focusing on the last line in the chart, organic sequential ARR growth. The trend that is developed in fiscal \u201822 shows better organic ARR growth year-to-date compared to fiscal \u201821. Next, calling your attention to the green box. This model shows targeted ending ARR at $1.67 billion for Q4 to the midpoint of our guidance range. As you can see, to hit the midpoint of guidance, we need to add $50 million of organic ARR in Q4. This is less than the $63 million we added in Q4 of fiscal \u201821. We believe we're well positioned to do that, given our pipeline and forecast, and also in part, because we have more deferred ARR starting in Q4 of \u201822, than we did last year. And with the context of macro concerns, we've set a low end that contemplates a severe downturn in the global economy. Putting all this together, we believe we've set our guidance prudently. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator to begin Q&A. Yeah, sure. Hey, a second. Thanks for the question. So you know like most of our peers, we evaluate pricing typically on an annual \u2013 annual basis and you know generally contemplate price increases around the October, kind of November timeframe. That's been our pattern here for the past \u2013 past few years, depending on the overall macro environment and you know competitive environment, we try to take those things into consideration, as we \u2013 as we think about price increases. So for example you know, during COVID, we actually did a much smaller price increase than we normally would. And \u2013 and this year, we actually given the macro environment, we actually pulled the price increase forward a little bit. So you know effective in May, we did a price increase that was also slightly larger than normal, reflecting the macroeconomic situation that we're all in right now. In terms of its impact to this year's guidance and performance, I would say it's been a modest, if you will, at best tailwind for fiscal \u201822. But we think that it's one that will persist in the fiscal \u201823. And I think the way to think about that is if the price increase was effective in \u2013 you know effective in May, any quotes that were already in play would have had old pricing and so on. So you're \u2013 you're really talking about quotes that are going out after the price increase. So primarily impacting you know Q4 and beyond. Thanks, Saket. Okay, thanks. Hey, Tyler on the free cash flow. So, it \u2013 it \u2013 yes is a function of \u2013 of ARR as well as some other things, and also a function of timing. So as we think about free cash flow for the year you know, again, well over half of our \u2013 of our collections actually happened in the first half of the year when FX rates were much more favorable than they are right now. And as we think about you know the second half of the year, there are a number of dynamics that \u2013 that have contributed. One, we actually had ARR over-performance in the first half. Some of which shows up in you know, we'll call it second half collection. So that also helps. That helps. We've had slower than anticipated hiring which is you know we'll call it a cost offset which also helps on the \u2013 on the free cash flow generation. And then you know we've had modestly better perpetual license performance, Kepware is performing quite well, that's really the only thing that \u2013 that's left that we sell it even partially perpetual basis. So that \u2013 that's been you know another \u2013 another tailwind. So, you net all those out and we've actually been able to outperform the free cash flow targets here now, three quarters in a row. And I think we have \u2013 you know we raised the \u2013 raised the outlook for Q4 and I think we have a good \u2013 good setup for that as well. Hello, Ken. Thanks, everybody."

            "name": "Jim Heppelmann",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Matt. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to report that PTC delivered an outstanding third quarter, with top line ARR results and bottom line free cash flow results above our guidance, and we're raising our guidance for the third time this year. Before I dive in, I'd like to point out that Kristian will cover the effects of the strengthening dollar later during his section of the call. So to simplify things, I will focus my discussion of top line growth metrics on constant currency results. Turning to Slide 4, ARR and free cash flow results were very strong and the strength was broad-based across all segments and geographies. Of particular note, we saw organic ARR growth further accelerate to 15%, driven by the acceleration we saw across the board in Digital Thread Core, Digital Thread Growth, FSG and Velocity units. ARR growth was helped by the lowest churn the company has seen in many quarters. I'm pleased to see PTC's organic growth rate move into that mid-teens range we've been targeting. We closed the Intland acquisition during Q3. I'll refer to this business as Codebeamer going forward, because that is the product name we will retain. Codebeamer had an outstanding first quarter at PTC and added a point of inorganic ARR growth, taking PTC's ARR to $1.63 billion, up 16% year-over-year. In Q3, we complemented our top line growth with even stronger bottom line growth. Despite strong FX headwinds and nearly $20 million of restructuring and M&A transaction payments, our free cash flow performance was strong at $112 million, which was ahead of our guidance and up 33% year-over-year. Remember that the restructuring we implemented at the end of last fiscal year was designed to drive a more aggressive and efficient SaaS strategy. At the time it was announced, we viewed the charges as short-term pain for long-term gain. Now, we're at the inflection point where most of the pain is behind us, leaving us with a cost structure that's in great shape, while the operational changes continue to generate the positive results we expected. I'm going to circle back on the margin topic in a few minutes when I reflect on macro scenarios. Moving to Slide 5, despite the scary headlines we read every day, we've continued to see solid global demand for our offerings. We did see some minor indications of macro-related softness in smaller European reseller accounts and in China due to COVID-related lockdowns, but this proved immaterial as organic bookings were up 29% year-over-year, roughly double the organic ARR growth rate. Europe bookings grew 20%. As I mentioned, renewals were also strong and we're raising our FY \u201822 organic churn guidance as we're trending slightly better than expected. Growth was strong in both Digital Thread and Velocity units and across all three geographies. Q3 was the seventh consecutive quarter that bookings have grown faster than ARR, which together with improving renewal rates is driving the accelerating ARR growth we've been delivering all year. To help you appreciate the resilience of PTC, as you think about any potential macro volatility that may lie ahead. On Slide 6, I'd like to briefly again review our business model dynamics to help investors understand why, despite the uncertainty, we have confidence in our financial targets for the remainder of the year. On the left-hand of the slide, you can see that the 16% ARR growth we delivered in Q3 was based not just on our Q3 performance, but performance over the prior three quarters as well. Given our definition of ARR is the annualized value of the book of active recurring software contracts, ARR growth is effectively a trailing four-quarter metric. When we say ARR grew 16% in the third quarter, we mean that on average ARR has now grown 16% over each of the past four quarters, because the entire book of active recurring businesses now 16% larger than it was at this time last year. While this trailing dynamic serves to dampen the impact of bookings in any single quarter, such as the strong results in Q3 where bookings grew roughly twice the speed of ARR. It also provides a tremendous foundation of stability for the company. We are raising our ARR guidance for the full year, because three of the four quarterly results that will comprise FY \u201822 ARR growth are already known. And we feel sufficiently confident about Q4. Kristian will elaborate during his guidance reveal. As you think about macro scenarios and their effect on PTC, remember the basic rule of thumb that's a longest bookings exceed churn over the trailing four quarters, ARR will grow and so too should free cash flow. Bookings currently exceed churn by a wide margin, roughly 3:1. To demonstrate the resilience of our model, I'll quickly review the same big round directionally accurate numbers I supplied last quarter for you to run scenarios against. Think of PTC having around $1.5 billion in ARR and on a run-rate basis we're adding $300 million in annual bookings, while seeing $100 million in annual churn. That's the 3:1 ratio I spoke of. Over the next year, the $1.5 billion of ARR would step up by $300 million in bookings, and step down by $100 million in churn to grow to $1.7 billion, which is 13% growth. That's roughly consistent with our current run rate performance though our actual 15% ARR growth level reflects that we're running slightly favorable on both bookings and churn. I'll skip the details this time around, but on the right-side of the slide, let me remind you of the hypothetical scenarios I shared last quarter. The first scenario has booking slow 30% for four quarters, like we experienced in 2009. And the second scenario has booking slow 30% for two quarters, like we experienced in 2020. In both cases, churn has held flat, consistent with experience in both periods. Across those scenarios, ARR grows upper single-digits to low-teens. Now, to understand profitability in a downturn, let's take a fresh look at Slide 7, which I burrowed and updated from our December Investor Day presentation. Whether top line growth remains strong as it has been or slows a bit due to macro developments, we expect to see significant margin expansion going forward. Margin expansion starts with the scale advantages we get by growing the top line faster than spending. Fiscal year-to-date, ARR is up 16%, while non-GAAP OpEx is basically flat, but we have several margin expansion programs that go further. The first margin expansion program is reflected in the actions we successfully implemented at the end of FY \u201821, which is shown on the left half of the page. Those changes that worth several hundred basis points of margin expansion, once the restructuring is complete, and it now largely is. By the time we enter FY \u201823, we have the bulk of the operating costs and the restructuring costs removed from our results. In addition to that, we've also initiated a second margin expansion program, which is shifting resources within our portfolio in a way that addresses key staffing needs, while driving up the profitability of our J-Curve businesses as shown on the right half of the slide. By reassigning some sales in R&D resources, and I'm talking about the actual people from IoT and AR, where growth has been lower than expected into other parts of the portfolio like CAD and PLM, where growth has been exceeding expectations, we're able to accommodate much of the company's resourcing needs, while canceling more than half of the 800 open positions we had a quarter ago. This program will not involve layoffs or restructuring charges, just new assignments for existing employees. The avoidance of new hires and their previously budgeted costs is expected to yield a couple hundred basis points of margin expansion over time. Note that a nice side effect of these resourcing shifts is that the Digital Thread growth unit comprised of IoT and AR is now crossing into profitability. We expect to see further margin expansion that comes naturally, as these businesses continue scaling beyond the current $214 million in ARR. In addition to the margin expansion programs that are well underway, there's a third margin expansion opportunity. If we were to encounter signs of a significant macro slowdown, like the scenarios I mentioned, we would quickly implement new hiring restrictions against the balance of the open positions we have, as well as other spending restrictions. This too would further help margins. The summary is that our cost structure is in great shape as we contemplate scenarios of what might lie ahead. Given the cost lever we've already pulled with the restructuring at the end of last year, the lever we're pulling now by rebalancing resources within the portfolio and the additional lever that remains incrementally available to us if we see signs of a downturn, we're looking at substantial margin expansion drivers that make us confident, we can deliver free cash flow growth in the mid-20s or better at Q3 FX levels and across most plausible ARR growth scenarios. A mid-20s free cash flow growth rates supports the longer-term free cash flow guidance we currently have out there. So we continue to feel good about that even in this shaky environment. Because we have products that are compelling and sticky, sold into good markets using a recurring revenue model, coupled with a longstanding reputation for spending discipline, PTC is in a good position to drive differentiated free cash flow growth no matter what macro scenario plays out. Getting back to Q3, let's take a quick look at our ARR performance by geography on Slide 8, before turning to our business units. In Q3, we again saw a strong ARR growth across all geographies. ARR growth in the Americas was 14%. In Europe, our ARR growth was 17% despite the Russia exit in Q2, which still affects the growth rate, given the trailing nature of our ARR metric. Our ARR growth in APAC was 16%. Knowing that investors are concerned about the macro environment, I'd like to reiterate that we are continuing to see strong bookings and renewal performance globally and in Europe, and giving our recurring business model, ARR is likely to grow in all, but the most extreme downturn scenarios one can imagine. Next, let's take a look at the ARR performance of our business units starting with Digital Thread on Slide 9. In our largest product segment, Digital Thread Core, we delivered another strong double-digit growth performance in Q3 with 14% ARR growth. Within this, once again, CAD grew low double-digits, while PLM grew 17%. Bookings grew faster in both cases. Q3 was the best performance yet across the known 19 consecutive quarters of double-digit ARR growth we've seen in the Core CAD and PLM business. On the SaaS transformation front, Windchill+ is in its early days, but we had a solid SaaS quarter for Windchill based primarily on a good mix of SaaS in new projects. We continue to expect to see a growing SaaS impact from lift and shift conversions as that phenomenon ramps in FY \u201823 and beyond. A reminder too that Windchill+ is the tip of the iceberg of a bigger plus strategy and you'll see us follow with Creo+ and similar premium SaaS offerings in FY \u201823 and beyond. In Digital Thread Growth, which is IoT and AR, we were pleased to see ARR growth accelerate to 19%. In the neighborhood of that two-handle growth rate we're targeting. ThingWorx DPM had a solid quarter, including a multimillion dollar ramp deal with a leading global contract manufacturer for a 30 factory DPM rollout following a successful proof of concept. With ThingWorx DPM, we believe we have a turnkey IoT solution with strong product market fit and this deal represents an excellent proof point. FSG posted great results again in Q3, accelerating to 9% ARR growth organically and growing 17% inclusive of Codebeamer. Within FSG, retail PLM, Arbortext and Servigistics all performed notably well, driven by solid results in terms of both bookings and renewals. Let's turn to Slide 10 and double-click on Codebeamer. As the driver of the inorganic growth of FSG, Codebeamer had an outstanding quarter, beating its plan even before landing a mid seven-figures ramp deal with a European automotive supplier that's standardizing on Codebeamer across its thousands of software engineers. This transaction was actually the largest order PTC booked in the third quarter, which is quite an accomplishment for a business that currently represents 1% of our ARR. The Codebeamer product has best-in-class ALM capabilities, and is seeing high demand because these capabilities are critical to manufacturers whose products contain embedded software. That's especially true in industries like automotive and medical devices that are regulated, because an errant software chain \u2013 change somewhere in the supply chain could lead to an unexpected product behavior that might kill people. Codebeamer is often an amazing start and early returns are very encouraging. We have combined Codebeamer with our previous ALM offering called Integrity and elevated this consolidated ALM business to be a key product line alongside CAD, PLM, IoT and AR in the Digital Thread portfolio. Codebeamer will continue to be sold standalone and will sell it with PLM as well. In addition to the strong standalone ALM sales that Codebeamer has been experiencing, adding it to PTC's portfolio, is expected to drive incremental revenue and cost synergies. To keep our reporting simple in the near-term, we will continue to report the ALM business in the FSG line item, placing the high-growth Codebeamer business in the FSG reporting line item should take FSG from being a low single-digit grower to a sustainable mid single-digit grower going forward, which of course helps to elevate PTC's overall growth rate as well. Before I turn to our Velocity business unit, let me run through a customer story on Slide 11 that illustrates how customers are leveraging our digital transformation capabilities. With more than 29,000 employees, Vestas is a key global provider of sustainable energy solutions to the energy industry. Vestas is a great PTC customer, and they use our software across their Digital Thread, as they design, manufacture, install and service onshore and offshore wind turbines around the globe. To meet the unique needs of each customer and each deployment, Vestas has embraced digital transformation. Vestas has literally taken an electrical mechanical wind turbine and turned it into a highly tailorable software controlled, connected powerhouse of clean and affordable energy. For Vestas, the first step was to establish a strong PLM foundation in engineering. Now Vestas is leveraging the end-to-end configuration management capabilities of Creo, Windchill and ThingWorx to drive process improvements across engineering and manufacturing. By eliminating manual handoffs and redundant work, Vestas is unlocking a step function improvement in product and process quality, while shortening lead times. Vestas is driving closed-loop innovation using data from a large number of connected wind turbines in the field to generate engineering insights. PTC's unique portfolio was well aligned to support Vestas along their digital transformation journey, and their future plans include increasing use of ThingWorx and Vuforia as they continue to develop their best-in-class wind power solutions. Turning to the Velocity business unit on Slide 12, year-over-year ARR growth for our Velocity unit accelerated slightly to 29% in Q3, with Onshape and Arena again, growing multiple times faster than their market. These cloud-native businesses each a pioneering leader in its respective category continue to give us proof points that suggest the future of the product lifecycle software market will be SaaS. With Velocity, PTC has the best pure-play SaaS strategy in our market. It really is the industry benchmark for how SaaS should be done. And with the Atlas platform, born of Onshape and now powering Windchill+ in the broader plus strategy, we are implementing SaaS across the entire portfolio. We expect the SaaS strategy to create strong growth tailwinds in the Core business for years to come. Let's move to Slide 13, where I'd like to take you through a Velocity customer story. Wavemaker Labs is a product development accelerator known for product development excellence in automation applications. They have a portfolio of companies and they help these companies build disruptive technologies. Photo you see on the slide is the Flippy 2 Automated Frying Robot from Miso Robotics, which is one of Wavemaker's portfolio companies. Miso Robotics is leveraging automation to revolutionize commercial food service, and their customers include Jack in the Box, Chipotle and White Castle, all favorites of Kristian Talvitie I'm sure. To help Miso Robotics and their portfolio companies drive high velocity product development, Wavemaker Labs has chosen Onshape and Arena. Speed, agility and flexible scalability are top priorities for Wavemaker Labs, making Onshape and Arena a natural fit. The unique analytics and management reporting capabilities of Onshape helps Wavemaker Labs to better understand the efficiency and the engagement of their engineers. Also with their high velocity mindset, Wavemaker Labs is focused on driving frictionless collaboration from start to finish. They're looking forward to being one of the first customers to deploy the new Onshape-Arena connection feature, which is in customer test now and will be released shortly. This connector will launch the industry's first integrated pure-SaaS, CAD and PLM suite, which enables improved collaboration and a seamless flow of product data across engineering, supply chain and manufacturing or contract manufacturing activities. For a final topic, turning to Slide 14, there are two upcoming investor events I want to raise to your attention. First, we plan to hold a Virtual FY \u201823 Investor Day event on November 17th, where we'll give you a deeper view into PTC's financial plans for FY \u201823 and beyond. Second, we plan to host a large LiveWorx Ecosystem event on May 15th and 16th of 2023, that assuming COVID cooperates, we expect will bring together thousands of customers, partners, investors and employees in a live event at the Boston Convention and Expo Center near our Seaport headquarters. We're hoping that many of you will attend the LiveWorx event where we'll have a dedicated investor track that allows you to participate in keynotes and investor sessions, plus gives you ample opportunity to interact directly with management, customers and partners across the PTC ecosystem. To make it easier for you, we plan to make the November event both shorter and virtual, with the intention to give you what you need for your models to tide you over to the bigger LiveWorx event in May, where you can get a full dose of strategy and customer exposure. Please watch for our Hold the Date invitation from our Investor Relations Team regarding both events. To wrap up on Slide 15, demand remains strong in Q3 and we've seen only minor signs of a macro slowdown. But we're watching diligently and we're well prepared for whatever lies ahead. Because of our resilient business model and spending discipline, we expect to deliver solid top and bottom line growth across any of the more plausible macro scenarios. Overall, I'm very pleased with PTC's position, our strategy is working well. We've driven both our growth and profitability to levels that are near the top of our peer group and I'm excited about the opportunities to do even better as we push ahead in parallel with a growth and margin expansion initiatives. Throughout the first three quarters of FY \u201822, bookings and renewals have been very strong. Growth has been accelerating all year, which is why we're raising our guidance for the third time. And we're entering the fourth quarter of what will be our fifth consecutive year of double-digit organic ARR growth. I think the company's never been in better position to create shareholder value. And with that, I'll turn it over to the Kristian for more details on the financial results. The pipeline is quite good. I mean, there's a lot of interest in this solution. And in fact, we've already had a couple of follow-on orders from some of the earliest orders we received. So, I think it's a good solution. You know there's a lot going on in the world of manufacturing these days. So there's a lot of competition for mindshare, but I think we have a very good solution and there's a lot of interest in it. And maybe to add on renewals. As we've discussed, our average term lengths around two years, which would mean each quarter on average, an eighth of renewals are up. And \u2013 and then actually a majority of those have contractual price increases uninfluenced by inflation or by price increases we did to the product. So, it was not a major factor. In fact, it was a pretty de minimis factor in Q3, but it will be helpful as we \u2013 as we get into next year. Thanks. Hi, Andrew. Hi. I'm quite pleased with it. There's a lot of interest. But you know it's a project that has to be sold and planned and so forth. Sometimes I call it the last upgrade. Because you know, there's a process to de-customize this system and upgrade it and then merge it into the running SaaS system. So there's a lot of interest. But I think we never really didn't feel like that'd be fast out of the blocks. What's easier to do is if a new customers buying Windchill, we say, well would you like it SaaS and they say, sure, why not. So it's a lot easier for us to get out of the blocks faster with new projects than with these lift and shifts. But the interest level, I assure you is quite high. And in fact, the growth rate in Windchill is strong overall, but it's stronger you know as you would expect on a SaaS side than on the on-premise side. Thank you. Yeah, sure. Blair. So yeah, I mean, I think all year you know we've over-performed in a long list of things. And there's \u2013 and there's one part of the business has a little bit underperformed, even though it's growing at a rate that's accretive to company growth. But that's IoT and AR. And I think it's really a \u2013 mostly a market issue, not a competitive issue. In fact, I'd say it's not at all a competitive issue. There's this factor that I call the hair-on-fire factor, which is a lot of this stuff is sold into environments that are in chaos right now. You know, if you run a factory, and we're trying to tell you how we can make it more productive, you say, well, it's shut down, because I don't have any inventory. Or I'm in a lockdown mode or \u2013 or I have too much inventory or you know there's just a lot of noise right now that, again, is competing for mindshare, and it's not just competing for PTC's mindshare, it's competing for competitors' mindshare too. So I'm unaware of anybody we compete with who has higher performance than we do in this environment. I think this environment will pass and we'll get more momentum down the road. But meanwhile, what we said is, we have you know, we \u2013 we put our resourcing plans in place according to our growth plans. And the places that are surpassing that growth plan need more resources and the places that are behind I mean, honestly, we have too many resources stacked in there. So we're just moving them around, it doesn't mean we're given up on anything we \u2013 we hope to get to and achieve this 20% growth rate, but I think as we look to next year, I think we feel like 20% would be a pretty good growth rate for next year. I'm not guiding to that here, but I'm just saying I don't think the market supports more than 20% growth rate at this point in time, because of those hair-on-fire issues I'm talking about. Yeah, for sure. I mean, I think it's the absolute most effective and efficient way to bring more resources to bear, because these are people who are already in the PTC sales organization, they already know the management team, they already know the customers, we're just saying, hey, sell this product instead of that one to the same people in many cases. Not in every case, but certainly to the same types of people in every case. So I think it's quite \u2013 it's quite an effective way to ramp new capacity. And meanwhile, I don't see much risk on the IoT and AR side, because we have ample capacity left to keep up with the demand we see. We simply or have too much capacity to be frank in IoT and AR selling. And so we're shifting that over putting a couple of different products in their big and send them back onto the playing field. So I think it's \u2013 it's smart. I think it's going to work well. And I think there's very little risk. Thank you. Yeah. Well, I sort of agree with you, but I'm not sure I agree with every piece of it. But let me \u2013 let me just talk about a few of them. So first of all, on taking share. Clearly PTC you know, Dassault had their earnings report yesterday, and you can go line item by line item in the CAD and PLM world. And our results are better than theirs. I think the SolidWorks' business grew 8% and our Velocity business grew 29%. If I remember correctly, the Enovia and Catia business grew 11% and ours grew 14%. So, certainly on a dollars basis, we're taking share. Now, I've always attributed some of that to a better business model. So I think we're monetizing customer relationships better. And we may be taking more wallet share than sheet share, but we're certainly not given up any share. There's just no math that would get you there. So I think we're doing well. Now, is simulation important? Absolutely. But you know so too is PLM. I mean, I don't know, do you know what simulation company that's growing like our Windchill PLM business at 17%? I'm not really aware of one. So I think that PLM is a much more strategic product and then people have given a credit for it. It's sort of the age of PLM right now. Now, it may also be the age of simulation. And you know we have a great simulation partner in ANSYS, fantastic partner. And you know when a customer says simulation is important, we say great, let me tell you about our best-in-class simulation capabilities built right into Creo that come from ANSYS. So you know I'm happy if the customer thinks simulation is important, but I but I think at least is frequently, they think PLM is important and ALM too. And that's really our strong suit. We're absolutely best-in-class at PLM, Vernon. Thank you, Jay. Well, first of all, I think, Joe, that your thesis is at least directionally correct, that there certainly is a lot of interest amongst the larger enterprises, in digital transformation and in cloud. And those are places where PTC is well positioned. And you know kind of historically, we've had more exposure to the enterprise market than to the SMB market. You know, Creo and Windchill kind of don't have near the representation in the SMB market that other products have from say, you know, Dassault or \u2013 or Autodesk or whomever. Now, with \u2013 with our Velocity unit, that's really an SMB business. And that's doing pretty well. And I think that's all cloud-driven. You know what I mean? That's \u2013 that's a subset of the market who says, I really want to go to cloud, and PTC's Onshape and Arena Solutions are virtually unmatched for those types of customers. But I think in general, yeah, the enterprise market really is leaning into digital transformation. I think COVID was very helpful for this. And I think it's most helpful to PLM, because you just really can't have a hybrid workforce. If people working at home can't find the data, they need to do their work today, and they can't walk down the hall to talk to somebody, because they're not in the building. And even if they were in the building, the person they want to talk to is not in the building. So you really need a system, a system of record, and a system of engagement to allow you to you know do your job from anywhere in the office today, from home tomorrow, whatever. And \u2013 and PLM is that system. So you know, Dassault's PLM results are pretty good. And ours were even better. And I think that's indicative of you know a market that's pretty healthy, which I think was the basic thesis, you know of your question. We are definitely overcoming it. And even with IoT and AR, we did see a nice acceleration in the quarter. So I think if you look at our bookings, they were up strong sequentially. They were up strong year-over-year. You know if I think ahead to our Q4 forecast that is very strong sequentially. It's not up year-over-year, because as Kristian said, we have a monster comparison in the \u2013 in the prior year, but it's up quite strong sequentially from quite a strong quarter this quarter. So, right now our forecast looks good. Now, Kristian, and I say okay, I mean, I hope it comes in like that. But you know, if it doesn't, we're prepared for that, too. And that's a little bit why I took you through the business model and the margin programs and so forth, because we want to win no matter what happens. But so far, honestly, the news is all pretty good. It's just we don't want to be a Pollyanna here. And you know, say this downturns never going to touch us. I mean, maybe it will, and if it does, I tried to show you we're ready for it. Yeah. The strength, first of all was in our Core CAD and PLM business you know the so called Digital Thread Core, which is doing well everywhere. And we did see some, I mentioned this in the commentary, we did see some China lockdown issues, where you know companies just for whatever reason didn't want to talk to us. But nonetheless, results were still good. You know we kind of had other good news to offset that. I think the key thing in China to know, if you don't know this now is it's now 5% of our business, 5% of our ARR. So we have very little exposure. It had previously been as high as I don't know, 7% or 8%. But you know when President Trump was in the office, he went to war, as you know with our, let's say, battle with our largest customer, which was Huawei. And by the time the dust settled on that, Huawei was Dassault's customer. And you know because they pretty much got the message not to do business with American companies. And that hurt us in China, generally, all the \u2013 you know a large amount of the Chinese manufacturing market is state-owned. And having watched what Trump was doing with Huawei, an American suppliers like us that was not helpful. But you know good news is, we're down to 5% exposure. And China's not that material to PTC, which I actually feel kind of good about right now given you know, the \u2013 the scariness and the outlook of what might happen there in the coming years. Hey, Yun. Yeah, well, Yun, those are good questions. So first on the specific question about cross-sell. I mean, that's actually a pretty well developed muscle inside of PTC. You know, we built our PLM business largely by cross-selling from CAD and \u2013 and then other things we've sold have kind of been cross-sold from PLM. So definitely, we're trying to make IoT and AR more focused on what we call the Digital Thread story, which is, it's not only about solving problems with IoT, but it's about solving problems with IoT using PLM data, which would include of course, CAD, digital markups and visualization and so forth. And then our Augmented Reality, of course, is a huge consumer of 3D data, because it trains its computer vision models against 3D, digital markup configurations, not to get too technical on you guys. But anyway, there's a great cross-sell opportunity. It's a \u2013 it's a big, big focus. But you know, one thing I did want to say, your \u2013 your comment at the beginning said that our guide suggests we're not that affected by the macro. I actually just want to say to all of our investors, you need to reconfigure your opinion of PTC a little bit, because we're not a cyclical name anymore. And in fact, our guide, the low end of our guide contemplates a 30% decline in new sales in Q4. It's just that our model is so resilient, that even a 30% decline in new sales still lands with 13% ARR growth. So like sometimes I read in a report that PTC is a cyclical name, and I say, show me a piece of data that supports that, because for five years, we've been steady as she goes, in good times and bad. And I just feel like we have a business model that's underappreciated. And you know the worst that downturn is going to get, the bigger performance differential you're going to see between us and people you compare us to you know particularly in our own industry here, because we're \u2013 you know, our software's 98% recurring, that's substantially greater than ANSYS, than Dassault, than Siemens then basically any of the companies you might directly compare us against you know in the same market, let's say. Let \u2013 let me hit the first question and you can take the second one. So the first question was about, was there any pricing tailwind? Yeah, sure, but it just was not significant. So there was a little bit of pricing tailwind. But again to go back through the kind of calculations here, only a small amount of our book of business came up in Q3 for renewal and most of these contracts have pre-negotiated price increases that we would get, despite whatever level of inflation is out there. There is a minority that you can argue, we have rights to raise the prices higher, and then some are actually tied to CPI, but most of our contracts are actually pre-negotiated fixed \u2013 fixed price increases. So we'd get them no matter what the economy and the inflation was. And then again, on the new sales, it's just that our sales cycles are longer than two months. And so when you put a quote in front of a customer and you raise the price, you can't take that quote back and stick a more expensive quote in front of them, because they get kind of angry. If they don't take that deal. Well, now you can raise it or when you go meet the next customer, you can go in with a higher quote. But it's just that we didn't have enough time to work that price increase through our sales cycle, to have it be meaningful to what happened you know in terms of new sales. So you know like for example, Pepsi raised the growth rate by two points, because they raised the price of potato chips, and you walk in the store and they're more than they used to be and you pay it, but we're not selling potato chips, we're selling complex software that has multi-quarter sales cycles. Yeah. It's a good question, Ken. Because we did set an expectation, low single-digit growth and now it's kind of put along in pretty high single-digit growth. I think you know we've just seen better demand than we had anticipated. So for example, if you look at some of the building blocks, Servigistics is a service parts management software and they're having a great year. And then there's what we call, FlexPLM, which is a special version of Windchill that we sell to retail companies, big box stores and clothing and you know apparel and footwear companies. And win rates been good and the demand has been good. There's Arbortext you know our technical documentation type of technology that does structured documents and automated publishing and so forth, and that's performed well. So I think there's actually some good demand and frankly, pretty good execution. The renewal rates in all cases have improved too. So that's also helpful. So, I don't know maybe \u2013 maybe we shouldn't say that FSG will be able to perform in mid single-digits, you know post-Codebeamer when it's already doing better than that pre-Codebeamer. But you know we'll try not to get ahead of ourselves. We're pleased with what's going on and with Codebeamer in there, you know we're pretty sure it's going to be kind of mid single-digits at least going forward. Okay, is that the last question? All right, so Matt's given me the \u2013 give me the signal here. I just want to thank everybody for spending time with us today. Appreciate you know you hanging in there and we look forward to seeing you in 90 days, if not before. Hopefully the economy will kind of \u2013 the macro situation will stay as it has been and we'll have some really great news for you and if not, you know, I think will be \u2013 will be okay anyway. So I look forward to seeing you and have a good evening."

During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode, and following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Shimao, PTC's Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMatt Shimao: Good afternoon. Thank you Savannah and welcome to PTC's 2022 second quarter conference call. On the call today are Jim Heppelmann, Chief Executive Officer; and Kristian Talvitie, Chief Financial Officer. Today's conference call is being broadcast live through an audio webcast and a replay of the call will be available later today at www.ptc.com. During this call, PTC will make forward-looking statements including guidance as to future operating results. Because such statements deal with future events actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements can be found in PTC's annual report on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission as well as in today's press release. The forward-looking statements including guidance provided during this call are valid only as of today's date April 27, 2022 and PTC assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. During the call, PTC will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in the quarters with generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in today's press release made available on our website. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to PTC's, Chief Executive Officer, Jim Heppelmann.\nJim Heppelmann: Thanks Matt. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. To simplify things, please note that throughout my commentary I will be discussing all growth rates in constant currency. Turning to slide 4. I'm pleased to share that PTC delivered another strong financial performance in fiscal Q2. All of our metrics came in above our guidance and the strength was broad-based across all segments and geographies. Of particular note, we saw organic ARR growth accelerate to 13% despite the self-inflicted churn caused by our decision to exit the Russian market. We ended Q2 with $1.56 billion of ARR. Bookings grew faster than ARR and renewals were very strong. We also continued our track record of translating top line growth into even better bottom line growth. In Q2 our adjusted free cash flow performance was strong at $158 million, up 22% year-over-year and ahead of our guidance. The non-GAAP operating margin of 42% in the quarter was the highest we've seen. The margin expansion strategies we outlined at our December Investor Day are generating the results we expected. Moving to slide 5. While we're monitoring the global macro and geopolitical situation carefully, we continue to see strong global demand environment for our offerings. Driving digital transformation across the product life cycle remains an important priority for our customers. Bookings were up mid-teens year-over-year and the strength was broad-based. Growth was strong in both digital thread and velocity and across all three geographies. Q2 was the sixth consecutive quarter that bookings have grown faster than ARR, which together with improving renewal rates, creates an acceleration bias for ARR growth. To help you understand the resilience of PTC as you think about any potential macro volatility that may lie ahead, I'd like to expand on our business model dynamics, to ensure you appreciate why our business model provides us with confidence in our ability to achieve our financial targets in the back half of the year. Let's take a look at slide 6. On the left-hand side of the slide, you can see that the 13% ARR growth we delivered in Q2 was based, not just on Q2 performance but also on the momentum we built over the previous three quarters as well. ARR growth is a rolling four-quarter metric. So when we say ARR grew 13% in the second quarter, we mean the entire book of recurring business is now 13% larger than it was at this time last year. While this rolling dynamic dampens the impact of bookings in any single quarter, such as the strong results in Q2, it also provides the foundation of stability and resiliency for the company. Remember that, so long as bookings exceed churn ARR will grow. Bookings currently exceed churn by a wide margin. To help you run your own scenarios, let me simplify the math, by giving you some big round directional numbers to work with. Let's say PTC has around $1.5 billion, in ARR. And on a run rate basis, we're adding $300 million in annual bookings, while seeing $100 million in annual churn. Over the next year the $1.5 billion of ARR would step up by $300 million and stepped down by $100 million to grow to $1.7 billion, which is 13% growth. That's consistent with our run rate performance. Note that, because PTC provides sticky enterprise software, our history in 2009 and again in 2020, shows renewals remain steady through a macro downturn. To better understand the sensitivity then of ARR to macro changes, let's start with a hypothetical scenario where bookings stopped growing and remained flat indefinitely at $300 million. In that case, with churn being steady, ARR would experience double-digit growth for several years and high-single digit for several more years after that. If you're concerned about a downturn in Europe which represents 40% of our business, you could create an alternate model where 40% of our bookings declined by 25% for two quarters and then bounced back, in which case we'd still deliver 12% ARR growth over the forthcoming year. If you want to run a more draconian global macro downturn scenario, you could model a 25% reduction across all bookings for the next four quarters, in which case you still get 8% ARR growth over the next year. Frankly no matter what scenarios you might model, you'll consistently see that PTC has a very resilient business. Keep in mind that those were hypothetical examples, because the actual results are considerably better. When bookings grow faster than ARR, as we've seen quarterly since the COVID rebound, it creates an acceleration effect for ARR. Improvement in renewal rates, which we've also been seeing are helpful as well. PTC is experiencing the benefit of these dual acceleration effects right now, which is why we're raising our ARR guidance for the full year. In summary, while the company is in position to accelerate ARR growth assuming conditions remain as they have been, we're also in good position to power through any potential macro slowdown with strong results, as we did in 2020, when bookings design declined sharply for several quarters due to the pandemic before rebounding again. PTC's FY 2020 ARR growth of 11% compared very favorably to our more cyclical industry peers, who don't have the same recurring business model. Some of whom even experienced top line declines in their comparable business lines. The takeaway from this discussion is that our subscription model, which took us years of hard work to put in place is a wonderful thing, and it will keep PTC in a growth leadership position in our industry for years to come. Moving on, let's take a quick look at our Q2 ARR performance by geography on Slide 7 before turning to our business units. In Q2, we saw strong ARR growth across all geographies. Our ARR growth in Americas was 12%. All product segments grew with the main growth drivers being continued strength in our core PLM and CAD segments and another strong contribution from our Velocity business. In Europe, our ARR growth was 15% despite the Russia exit. We saw strong results across the board in Europe with growth primarily driven by our core PLM and CAD businesses and strong growth in the IoT and AR segment. In addition, our velocity and FSG businesses delivered solid growth in Europe in Q2. Europe has the largest mix of channel versus direct and the resellers continue to perform well. I know that investors are concerned about exposure to Europe and the macro environment there, so I'd like to reiterate that: first, we're continuing to see strong bookings performance in Europe; and second, as I've demonstrated quantitatively, our model is highly resilient. Our ARR growth in APAC was 14% with our core CAD and PLM businesses again being the main drivers. Next, let's look at the ARR performance of our business units starting with digital thread on Slide 8. In our largest product segment, Digital Thread Core, we delivered another double-digit growth performance in Q2 with 13% growth. Within this, CAD grew low double digits, while PLM grew mid-teens. Bookings grew faster in each case, reflecting on Q2 across the now 18 consecutive quarters of double-digit ARR growth that we've seen in the core CAD and PLM business. This was the best performance yet, which I attribute to a combination of strong demand for digital transformation, best-in-class sticky solutions sold in the recurring revenue model with low churn rights and the growth tailwinds from our SaaS initiatives. In our core business, our solutions are very strategic and we're executing well and taking market share. You may have noted, we also launched Windchill+ during the quarter, which is our next-generation differentiated core SaaS PLM solution. Windchill+ contains the technology and operational improvements that enable higher profitability and is now becoming our lead Windchill sales play. Windchill+ is just the tip of the iceberg of a bigger plus strategy. And you'll see us follow with Creo Plus and similar premium SaaS offerings in FY 2023 and beyond. In Digital Thread, growth we saw ARR growth of 15%. While the sequential acceleration was modest, we made good operational progress and remain on track to get growth to a two handle by the end of the year. Following the launch of our new ThingWorx Digital Performance Management Solution, which we abbreviate as DPM, in Q2, we landed our first nine deals across various different industries, including aerospace and defense, high-tech, automotive and food and beverage. Though these were started deals, average initial deal size was six figures. Rockwell brought in several of these DPM deals and the DPM pipeline for both companies looks good going into the back half of the year. FSG had a great Q2 with 8% ARR growth. Servigistics retail PLM and Arbortext all performed well, helping to drive solid results in terms of renewals and churn. Growth was particularly strong in the Americas and Europe. With FSG, our strategy is to keep delivering value to customers by having dedicated focus on each of these products. And I'm pleased to see that strategy produced another strong quarter. Before I turn to our Velocity business unit, let me run through a couple of quick customer stories that will give you a taste of how customers are leveraging our digital transformation capabilities. I'll start with Bosch on slide nine. Bosch is a massive global supplier of technologies and services. With 400,000 employees, including 75,000 engineers, a key challenge for Bosch is how to drive end-to-end digital transformation at scale. Bosch is leveraging their Windchill PLM system as a backbone in combination with Creo and ThingWorx to enable new and improved workflows. This specific example is about Bosch using model-based design capabilities of Creo Windchill. By moving beyond the world of 2D drawings and leveraging enhanced 3D Creo data across engineering, manufacturing and inspection processes, Bosch is driving improved productivity and bringing products to market faster. Next, on slide 10, Cummins is the world's largest independent diesel and gas engine manufacturer and an interesting ESG story that we help enable. Cummins has long made it a company goal to reduce their environmental impact and digital transformation is a critical part of their journey. By using generative design and ANSYS-powered simulation upfront in their Creo-based design process, Cummins has been able to reduce material usage, create better products and accelerate time to market. Turning to the Velocity business on slide 11. Year-over-year, ARR growth for our Velocity segment was 27% in Q2, with both Onshape and Arena growing multiple times faster than the market, which demonstrates there's a distinct and vibrant segment of the CAD and PLM market that prioritize SaaS and agile product development as their number one buying criteria. With Onshape and Arena, PTC has a unique ability to serve this market segment and we're continuing to ramp both our Velocity product and go-to-market investments. Let's move to slide 12 where I'd like to take you through a Velocity example showing how Arena is empowering Filtronics global team to deliver innovative products faster. Filtronic is using Arena's SaaS PLM solution to control product design and supporting documentation and to enable collaboration across globally-distributed teams. The benefits of providing complete visibility into critical product and quality processes are significant. For example, engineering change cycle time was cut by 50% and the issue resolution time has been cut in half as well. Turning to slide 13. We announced two transactions last week and I'd like to recap both and provide some additional context. First we announced an agreement to acquire Intland Software, a next-generation application life cycle management or ALM company for $280 million. For background, PTC entered the ALM market a decade ago, when we acquired MKS and their integrity suite. ALM has become an important and well-established offering within PTC's portfolio and is sold both standalone and as a key subsystem of our Windchill PLM offering. The Codebeamer family of software products from Intland is a next-generation ALM suite that's fast becoming the new standard in safety critical and regulated industries, especially in the large automotive industries where products are increasingly differentiated by the software. Bringing Codebeamer into our ALM suite will bolster both ALM and PLM growth potential by significantly increasing our product strength and market momentum. Intland is a great company who matches their strong product with strong growth and surprisingly good profitability for their size. We expect to achieve both revenue and cost synergies with this acquisition. When it closes, the acquisition is expected to add roughly a percentage point of inorganic growth to our FY 2022 ARR results. Intland will join our existing ALM unit, so Codebeamer ARR will be reported as part of our FSG segment. We expect this acquisition will increase the growth rates of FSG going forward which we now expect to be consistently growing in the mid-single-digit range. Second, we announced an agreement to sell a portion of our professional services business to long-time partner ITC Infotech to further power our SaaS strategy. This moves a continuation of a long-term strategy we've been executing to focus PTC's efforts on high-margin software, while we look to a partner ecosystem to deliver the professional services that unlock the value of that software in the customer setting. As we ramp up the SaaS initiatives we described at our December Investor Day, a key component of the program is the lift and shift efforts required to move on-premise customer deployments into our SaaS cloud. With a large installed base, we're looking at the need for potentially thousands of services projects in the coming years. These are projects where PTC needs to play a direct role because at the end of each project we will be taking ownership of the running system and carrying it forward. Rather than put our own professional services organization back on to a growth vector as we scale up to perform these projects, we're instead planning to transition some of our key PLM talent into a new ITCI unit called DxPServices, thereby allowing the lift and ship capacity to scale on ITC's P&L rather than ours. This new DxPServices unit will be our partner to run joint lift and ship projects with DXP doing the upgrade and de customization work that happens at the customer site and PTC assuming the resulting system into our centralized SaaS operations. This is a professional services transaction so it has no bearing on ARR. Kristian will comment further on the expected financial impact of these two transactions. We expect both will close in Q3. To wrap-up then on slide 14, I'm very pleased with PTC's position and the opportunity that lies ahead. Our portfolio of products is unique and compelling and it aligns well to customer demand. Throughout the first half of FY 2022, bookings and renewals have been strong and growth is accelerating as we enter the second half of what will be our fifth consecutive year of double-digit ARR growth. We're poised to further accelerate growth as SaaS tailwinds blow harder in the coming quarters and as we gain momentum with DPM and other IoT and ARR initiatives. Our profitability continues to expand following the changes we implemented at the start of the year and as our start-up businesses continue to mature up in J curves. Our model has proven to be highly resilient even in the face of a slowdown like during the pandemic in 2020. We're raising our guidance for the second quarter in a row and I think the company has never been in a better position to create shareholder value. With that, I'll turn it over to Kristian for more details on the financial results. Kristian?\nKristian Talvitie: Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our results, I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance and ARR references will be in both constant currency and as reported. Turning to Slide 16. At the end of Q2, our constant currency ARR was $1.564 billion, up 13% year-over-year. Our SaaS businesses in both the digital thread and Velocity business groups saw continued solid ARR growth in Q2 and represented a larger mix of our overall business both year-over-year and sequentially. We delivered above the ARR guidance range we provided for Q2, which was for constant currency ARR of $1.54 billion to $1.55 billion. On an as-reported basis, year-over-year ARR growth was 11%. Foreign exchange was a $32 million headwind and our as reported ARR in Q2 was $1.532 billion. In March, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, we announced that we would discontinue business operations and sales in Russia. Exiting Russia had a $4 million adverse impact on our Q2 ARR. We've accounted for the $4 million impact as churn in Q2. Cash from operations of $142 million in Q2 was in line with our guidance. Considering the $32 million foreign exchange headwind to ARR, this was a strong outcome reflecting expected seasonality and another quarter of solid collections performance. In Q2, free cash flow of $140 million grew 21% year-over-year and included $18 million in restructuring and other related payments. Adjusted free cash flow was $158 million, up 22% year-on-year. Free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow were both ahead of our guidance due to strong cash from operations and also because CapEx in Q2 came in slightly lower than we had anticipated. The main takeaway on cash flow is that despite the headwinds related to foreign exchange, we've been executing well and delivering on our targets. Q2 revenue of $505 million increased 9% year-over-year. As we've discussed previously revenue is impacted by ASC 606. So we don't believe that revenue growth rates are the best indicator of our underlying business performance, but would rather guide you to ARR as the best metric to understand our top line performance and cash generation. FX impacted revenue by about $6 million in Q2 and our revenue on a constant currency basis was $511 million. Before I move on to the balance sheet, I'd like to provide some color on our non-GAAP operating margin which expanded to 42% in Q2 as Jim noted earlier. This compares to 37% a year ago. Revenue is impacted by ASC 606. So other derivative metrics such as gross margin, operating margin and EPS are all impacted as well. Still, it's worth mentioning that our costs in Q2 benefited from the restructuring we announced in Q4. Six months ago we set an expectation that we would be eliminating some duplicative functions in our field organization and that our operating expense mix would shift towards R&D in alignment with our SaaS acceleration strategy. You can see the progress we've made in our Q2 results. We now have a more optimized operating structure. And we believe the improvements we've driven are sustainable and will enable us to deliver non-GAAP operating margin for fiscal 2022 roughly in line with our year-to-date performance. Moving to Slide 17. We ended Q2 with cash and cash equivalents of $307 million. Our gross debt was $1.28 billion with an aggregate interest rate of about 3.4%. During the second quarter, we generated cash proceeds of $43 million through the sale of our equity investment in Matterport. This in conjunction with cash from operations we used to pay down $175 million on our revolving credit facility in the second quarter. Regarding our share repurchase program as we communicated last quarter, we've completed our planned repurchases for fiscal 2022 with $5 million settling in Q2. And for the remainder of the year we'll focus on delevering. Looking forward to fiscal 2023 and on a go-forward basis assuming our debt-to-EBITDA ratio remains below three times. Our goal is to return approximately 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases. Next Slide 18 shows our ARR by product group. We post a set of financial data tables to our IR website that has our financial statements as well as ARR details. In that file we share both constant currency and as-reported ARR. As a reminder, when we calculate constant currency figures, we use our current year plan FX rates for all periods. Our fiscal 2022 plan FX rates are based on foreign exchange rates as of September 30, 2021. We're using these rates to calculate constant currency figures for all quarters in fiscal 2022 and for all prior periods as well. To illustrate, you can see on the slide that we expect to report \u2013\u2013 we expect as reported ARR to be lower than constant currency ARR for Q3 and fiscal 2022. This is because of the FX headwinds and rate movements which have moved significantly since September 30, 2021. Based on the exchange rates at the end of Q2, we expect as reported ARR for Q3 to be impacted by $32 million. And for fiscal 2022, we expect the FX headwind to be approximately $34 million. This is important to remember in context of our guidance because we provide ARR on a constant currency basis. And if the exchange rates fluctuate significantly between now and the end of Q3, the expected impact to our reported ARR would also change. We do believe constant currency is the best way to evaluate the top line performance of our business because it removes foreign exchange fluctuations from the analysis positive or negative. With that I'll move on to guidance on Slide 19. We're raising our fiscal 2022 constant currency ARR guidance, based on our strong performance in the first half and despite our exit from Russia. The new range is now $1.64 billion to $1.665 billion, which translates to constant currency ARR growth of 12% to 13% for fiscal 2022. For Q3, we're guiding constant currency ARR to be $1.58 billion to $1.595 billion. At the midpoint this equates to 13% constant currency growth. We continue to expect IoT and AR to reach ARR growth of 20% or more by the end of the year. And our FSG and Velocity businesses continue to do very well in the market. That all said the main driver of our fiscal 2022 ARR guidance raise is the strong customer demand we're seeing in our core CAD and PLM offerings, which represented 70% of our ARR in Q2. We're maintaining guidance for fiscal 2022 cash from operations at approximately $430 million as our strong execution and operational discipline are helping us to offset FX headwinds and the Russia exit. Our guidance for Q3 cash from operations is approximately $110 million. We've updated our CapEx guidance for fiscal 2022 to approximately $25 million, which is down from about $30 million that we set at the beginning of the year. And we're expecting approximately $5 million of CapEx spend for Q3. Therefore, we're raising our full year free to cash flow target to approximately $405 million and guiding for Q3 free cash flow of approximately $105 million. We continue to expect our normal seasonal pattern in our fiscal 2022 cash flow generation primarily driven by invoicing seasonality. The majority of our collections occur in the first half of our fiscal year and we continue to expect expenses to increase in the second half fiscal 2022 as we ramp hiring in our SaaS investments because of these dynamics Q4 is expected to be our lowest cash flow generation quarter. Our free cash flow guidance for fiscal 2022, includes $40 million to $45 million of restructuring payments compared to our expectation a quarter ago of $45 million to $50 million as some employees have otherwise departed at PTC and some employees that were expected to depart have moved into new roles where we've been looking at. Both of these are good things. We have less restructuring payments and have been able fill new open roles with good people in a challenging hiring environment. In addition, our fiscal 2022 guidance assumes approximately $5 million of transaction-related payments that were incurred in the first half of fiscal 2022. Therefore consistent with raising our free cash flow guidance, we're also raising our adjusted free cash flow target to approximately $455 million. For Q3, we expect approximately $10 million of restructuring payments and approximately $5 million of transaction-related payments which were incurred in the first half bringing our adjusted free cash flow to approximately $120 million. Moving on to revenue. Despite foreign exchange headwinds and our Russia exit, we're taking the low end of our full year revenue guidance up by $25 million based on our Q2 beat and forecast for the remainder of fiscal 2022. So our new revenue guidance range is $1.905 billion to $1.975 billion. The year-over-year growth we're guiding to now is 5% to 9%. ASC 606 makes revenue difficult to predict for an on-premise subscription company hence the wide range. Note revenue does not influence ARR or cash generation as we typically bill customers annually upfront regardless of contract term lengths. Turning to Slide 20. Jim provided some highlights earlier in terms of the financial impact we expect from the Intland Software and ITC Infotech transactions we announced last week. While both transactions are expected to close during Q3, we have not incorporated the expected financial impacts to our guidance because these deals haven't closed yet. We will officially update all financial metrics and guidance when we report our Q3 earnings.  In the meantime, directionally for constant currency ARR we expect these transactions to have a positive impact of approximately $15 million in fiscal '22. We will report Intland in our FSG product group along with our other ALM assets. And regarding free cash flow, we expect the transactions to have an immaterial impact to free cash flow in fiscal '22 as incremental operational cash flows are expected to offset the incremental transaction-related fees and increased interest expense in the second half. And we expect these transactions to be accretive in fiscal '23. Going forward as Jim explained, we expect these two deals to help us drive the adoption of our SaaS offerings. And over time ITC -- the ITC Infotech transaction is expected to result in lower professional services revenue, but not expected to have a material impact on our profitability. Again, we'll provide a lot more detail at Q3 when we report our results and update all guidance metrics at that point. I'll close out my prepared remarks today by taking you through an illustrative constant currency ARR model on Slide 21. Here we're showing our ARR progression over the past six quarters and an illustration of what is needed to get to the midpoint of our constant currency ARR guidance for Q3 and fiscal '22. First of all, recall that in Q2 of fiscal 2021 our ARR growth benefited due to the acquisition of Arena. So taking that into consideration, in the first half of fiscal '22 we added approximately $25 million more ARR on an organic basis compared to the first half of fiscal 2021. Next calling your attention to the green box. This model shows targeted ending ARR at $1.588 billion for Q3 and $1.653 billion for Q4 both at the midpoint of our guidance ranges. The illustration shows a sequential ARR that's needed in Q3 and Q4 to hit the guidance midpoints. As you can see in the second half of fiscal '22, we need to add about the same amount of new ACV as we did in the second half of fiscal 2021 in order to hit the mid point of constant currency guidance. We believe we're well positioned to do that, even given some of the macro concerns and noting that we also have more deferred ARR starting in the second half of fiscal \u201922 that we did in fiscal \u201921. So hopefully that's helpful and with that we'll turn it over to the operator and begin Q&A. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Joe Vruwink with Baird. Please go ahead. \nJoe Vruwink: Hey, thanks. Hi everyone. I guess I'll start with a question on macro and obviously I appreciate the backdrop as dynamic and your model at this point is built to a stand but withstand a lot of what I'm about to ask. But can you maybe just contrast how customers are maybe talking to you about strategic investments and some of your more complex implementation areas like PLM or IoT. Maybe contrast how this is different today than it would have been in mid-2020 or other periods that maybe have parallels to the past? And does it seem like customers are kind of separating strategic from the macro appreciating that the things they're committing to today do have longer-term benefits. And so that just kind of scope of conversation is different than it has been in the past?\nJim Heppelmann: Yes. I mean absolutely Joe, Jim here. Keep in mind that PTC is really helping customers plan and engineer and plan the production processes for products. We're not helping them to actually by and large we're not helping them much to produce the product. So the supply chain problems really are production problems. And if you're having production problems, most companies don't see that as a reason to stop planning the next generation of products because suddenly a production problem will be solved at some point. And then you'll be competing for who has the best next-generation product and I hope you didn't take the year off. So we don't really see any connection. And frankly, we didn't see much connection in 2020 either in that particular way. So I think the pandemic in 2020, put a lot of momentum into digital transformation. People realize you can't execute a hybrid work for us for example, without a system of record for product data. It just doesn't work. So that momentum is carrying through and people are forging ahead with their strategies to implement for example PLM and CAD to advance their digital transformation initiative even if their factories are idle because they're waiting on semiconductors or in some cases wire harnesses that used to come from Ukraine and all that type of stuff. So actually I was in Germany, in the last week of the quarter. And the customers I talked to were full speed ahead as it related to the PTC project. And we mentioned that we had a very strong bookings quarter in Europe. And again that's net of a fairly if you put all that churn from Russia in Europe it's material. It's like probably a point of growth I'm just in for Europe. So I think we're doing well and sort of feel like actually conditions look pretty good. And at the same time we can withstand a lot and still really deliver some impressive growth and free cash flow numbers.\nJoe Vruwink : Okay. That's great. One follow-up just on how your approach to the Windchill transition to SaaS might be evolving just as you publicly announced that now have had a chance to have conversations. It seems like a lot of your peers are talking about six up their own cloud migration efforts one specifically said things have accelerated recently. I'm just wondering if you're kind of getting the inkling that that could play out for PTC as you're dedicated to Windchill this point onwards? \nJim Heppelmann: Yes. If you go back to our Investor Day I'll remind you that we really feel like we're starting the third phase of our SaaS project. And the Windchill part of it started back in the first phase. So for us we've had a lot of success with cloud. And it's one of the growth drivers for Windchill. It has been over the last 18 quarters. I think the difference is, we didn't like the profitability of the cloud part of the Windchill cloud business as we used to do it. So this Windchill+ is really our shift to the multi-tenant model, which to the customer doesn't look much different. But to PTC it looks quite a bit different and produces quite a different outcome in terms of profitability. So, I think, customers like the Windchill in the cloud before. They still like Windchill in the cloud, because PTC likes Windchill in the cloud better now. And that's causing us to open the floodgates a little more, because it's a more attractive business for us now.\nJoseph Vruwink: Great. Thank you very much.\nJim Heppelmann: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question Adam Borg with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nJim Heppelmann: Hello, Adam.\nAdam Borg: Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe just on IoT and AR, you talked about it last quarter and even in the slide deck today you talked about a continued focus on upselling and cross-selling the installed base. I love an update here on kind of what you're thinking about just the strategy going forward for upsells and cross-sells, as well as what -- just remind us of the synergies to customers in terms of combining PTC's core CAD and PLM with your IoT and ARR? Thanks, again.\nJim Heppelmann: Yes. I mean, the key thing -- let's focus mostly on IoT, because it's much larger. The key thing is there's two key use cases for IoT -- three key use cases actually. One is smart connected products, which are the products you manufacture. The second one is smart connected factories or we call it, smart connected operations. That's the products you buy and operate in your factories. And then the third one is, really this Navigate strategy of bringing in information from a lot of different systems, kind of, an environment that just makes lightweight users more productive and so forth. But anyway, all of our discrete manufacturers produce products and they all operate factories. So what we really said is, for efficiency reasons and success reasons, all that stuff, we ought to focus on selling to our customer base with more veracity than just selling to anybody. And so Troy Richardson put in place a stronger focus on cross-sell. And we're starting to see some, let's say, green shoots, particularly in DPM, Rockwell sold through the Rockwell base, but all the deals we sold really came from the customer base in PTC. That's good. And we think there's something there. So, keep in mind, when we think about IoT and AR in Q3 and Q4, there's a couple of things I want to point out. First of all ARR is a rolling four-quarter metric. So three of the four data points that say what's going to happen in Q3 are already in. And two of the four data points that say what's going to happen in Q4 are already in. So we have some visibility. But now, what we -- what the rest of it hinges on is, bookings churn and backlog or deferred ARR. And so, we're looking at all this stuff. We look at the pipeline, we look at the forecast. We try to estimate bookings. And we don't have a crystal ball. And sometimes we're not perfectly right. But anyway, we have a read on what we think churn will be and that's what we're looking at. And we're confident that that's going to get us to that two handle by the end of the year.\nAdam Borg: That's great. And maybe just as a very quick follow-up. It's great to hear the early success on DPM and just on the Rockwell partnership as well and seeing some success there. Maybe just two seconds on the state of the union on where we are with Rockwell overall. Thanks, again.\nJim Heppelmann: Yes. Well, coincidentally Scott Genereux, the Chief Revenue Officer from Rockwell happened to be at PTC today, so I had lunch with him and we talked it over. And the truth is, DPM is a better fit for Rockwell than is ThingWorx as a platform, an IoT platform. And -- so, Rockwell is leaning in and their consulting arm Calypso is really leaning in and PTC is leaning in. So I think there's some promising again green shoots there. We were pleased to see Rockwell participate in DPM success right from the start. And I think, it gives us a better foundation, if you will to build success. It's a better fit for what both PTC and Rockwell are capable of. We're both solution providers. This is a solution versus a platform.\nAdam Borg: Excellent. Thanks again.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.\nJim Heppelmann: Hi Jay.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Hi, Jim, Kristian how are you? Jim, starting with you on the Intland acquisition, could you contrast the rationale for that acquisition and the addressable market from that acquisition as compared with the rationales you spoke of 11 years ago almost at a day when you bought MKS, which ultimately became a relatively small part of the business. So what's different now in terms of let's say an ALM arms race that makes Intland genuinely compelling and perhaps put it in the context of the overall closed-loop life cycle management strategy. And then secondly for you Kristian by the end of the fiscal year when you net out the effects of the restructuring particularly in the field, minus a service headcount with the ITC transaction, the add back from Intland, where do you think your headcount ultimately lands at the end of the fiscal year?\nJim Heppelmann: Okay. I'll take the first one on Intland versus Integrity. I mean Jay it is fundamentally the same story. And I think we've had reasonable success with the Integrity product. But we had some challenges with the Integrity product that I think are fixed in this next-generation Codebeamer offering. Keep in mind that ALM is both a business by itself and it's a key subsystem of our PLM system, which therefore means it fuels our PLM success as well. But when I look at Integrity versus COVID there's a couple of things that stand out. Number one is SaaS. We didn't have a SaaS solution. We didn't have a path to a SaaS solution with integrity. It's much older technology. That's one thing. The second thing is Integrity had its own built-in source code management tools. And the entire development community has really shifted to tools like GitHub and so forth. It's very, very hard to sell against things like GitHub, which amongst other things tend to be free. So it turns out that the Codebeamer is designed to work with all these other modern tools out there. And then the third thing is Codebeamer is really viewed as a sexy, best-in-class user experience all that kind of stuff. So we're really with Codebeamer leapfrogging far ahead of where we were with Integrity, leapfrogging the competition and we now have an offering that allows us to go back on the offense, back into automotive companies, back into medical device companies, aerospace and defense companies, inning where people put safety critical or regulated software into products. The thing in an automobile setting and this is what I would have said 10 years ago is you got to manage the software very carefully in the context of the automobile. You have a set of requirements for a new automobile. Many of those requirements get implemented into mechanical systems, but a bunch of them and more every day get implemented into software. And a bug in the software is as bad or even worse than a failure in a mechanical part. And so this deep concern by these automotive companies and then there's regulations around it that says if anybody in the supply chain changes the line of code. You need to know, which line of code they change. You need to know why they changed it and you need to have a test approved they didn't break anything. And so it's a very, very difficult software management environment that frankly doesn't apply to a software company like PTC. We don't have any mechanical parts. So it's us, it's just software, but they're a software in the context of a physical product managed in CAD and PLM and that all needs to be integrated back together. So basically Intland is a next-generation leapfrog move within our ALM and PLM strategies. Kristian?\nKristian Talvitie: Yes. Hey, Jay. Given all the moving parts and it's obviously difficult to pinpoint precisely, but I'd say we're probably somewhere in the 6,700 range.\nJay Vleeschhouwer : Okay. So headcount would probably end up being flat net by the end of the fiscal year, but on a larger base of revenue.\nKristian Talvitie : Should be -- do you mean flat year-over-year?\nJay Vleeschhouwer : Right, right. Because you ended fiscal 2021 at 6,700, so that's where you think you'll end up, but you'll be a bigger company in terms of revenue. \nKristian Talvitie : Yes, that's right. And I mean I'm also trying to factor in the somewhat challenging hiring environment. If possible we'd like to see that we could say 6,700 to 6,800. I'm just trying to be pragmatic.\nJay Vleeschhouwer : Right.\nJim Heppelmann : Yes. I mean, Jay, you look at this data, you know we have a lot of positions open on one hand. We have attrition on another hand and then we're spending some employees out through this transaction. So it is a little hard to net those out, because it's difficult to pin down attrition and pin down hiring success. But headcount won't go up dramatically here in the context of all that, it will probably be flattish. I mean, as a reasonable approximation. \nJay Vleeschhouwer : Okay. Great. Thank you, both.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Yun Kim with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.\nYun Kim: Great. Thank you.\nJim Heppelmann: Hey, Yun.\nYun Kim: Jim -- hey, Jim. Hey. You expect the amount of professional services work to increase as part of the Windchill+ adoption over the next several years. Obviously, you are taking advantage of that opportunity and offloading some of the professional services business to partners and whatnot and your transaction with ITC illustrate that. But given the tight IT labor market out there, do you feel comfortable that you have enough professional services capacity to meet the potential demand for the - around the Windchill+ lift and ship adoption that you expect over the next several years? And overall, if you can just revisit the state of your partner ecosystem around implementation and deployment capacity? And if you have any kind of investments that you're making beyond this transaction you announced today?\nJim Heppelmann: Yes. So I think we have tremendous scalability in ecosystem. But just for the benefit of everybody, let's turn the clock back a little bit. If you go back 10 years about a third of our revenue was services. And now it's 9% going to, I don't know, 6% or so as a result of this transaction. And what happened over those years in our quest for margins, which was very successful, we said, let's stop chasing services. Let's give it to the ecosystem. The ecosystem took that differential from us and added 10 times that on their own. So literally the ecosystem is doing billions of dollars of services around our stuff. It's not a one partner. It's in many, many, many partners. With some of them having names like Accenture and Deloitte and Cognos and not Cognos, Cognizant and Calypso and on and on and on many having smaller firms you never heard of. So there's a lot of capacity out there. The thing is these projects we can't just give to a partner, because in the end we're taking the systems into our running system. It has to be done very carefully. We have for many, many years subcontracted work to ITCI. We could have subcontracted these projects to ITCI, but I said, I don't really want that in our P&L, because subcontracted projects tend to have even less margin than projects we do with our own employees, of course, there's two margins there. So rather than build up a subcontracting business, because we didn't really want to go hire all those people, we just entered into this arrangement. It's a great win-win-win. ITCI is happy to grow the services business. That's the business they're in. By the way, they're fundamentally an Indian company. So they have a deep reservoir of access to lower-cost labor in India and that \u2013 a lot of these projects will end up being done in India with their Indian capacity. And it will give us the talent, because we're seeding DxP with the best in the industry which are PTC's own services employees. So DxP could have been a joint venture or something like that, could have been a subcontracting approach. We just said, you know, what we're a software company. We want to be high margin, high-growth software, let's PTC focus on that and this is a good way to solve that lift and ship service to pave new problem.\nYun Kim: Okay. Great. And then just a quick question, I don't think anybody asked yet, but Jim what is your expectation regarding the Windchill+ adoption at least the \u2013 over the next several quarters in terms of the pace of the adoption?\nJim Heppelmann: Well, we've been doing a lot of adoption of Windchill in the cloud that phase one offering. So we're just going to pivot that to Windchill+ now. Windchill+ by the way, so is not just Windchill in the cloud. It's Windchill+ a bunch of things plus cloud plus all the Atlas benefits plus single sign-in across the suite plus our workflow engine, our BPM workflow engine, plus our visualization in the cloud capabilities. So we're really trying to create a differentiated offering in part to help justify the higher price point, but also to make it more attractive to go to the cloud. Just for fun I tell people think of like a first class seat then in an airplane versus a coach seat. It isn't just at the seats bigger. And you wouldn't want somebody to say, well, I want to sit in coach but have a bigger seat at a lower price point. That's sort of like saying could I have a system integrator put my Windchill system into cloud for me? So what we're doing is offering a bundle of things. It's a bigger seat. It's a bigger TV, it's better food. You get to board first. You got plenty of room for your luggage, quicker access to the restroom. I mean, all those stuff that would be associated with a first-class seat and can't be unbundled and bought off a Chinese menu. So that's really what we're doing with Windchill+ and then we're going to follow the same strategy with the rest of the products as we're ready.\nYun Kim: Okay. Great. Thank you so much.\nJim Heppelmann: Yeah. Thank you, Yun.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jason Celino with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\nJason Celino: Great. Thanks for fitting me in. When I think about PTC's main segments on the SaaS acquisitions that we've seen over the last few years, we saw in Shape for CAD arena for PLM and no influence for ALM. What other areas may PTC need to upgrade via make or buy for SaaS?\nJim Heppelmann: Well, keep in mind, there's a difference between things we have to do and being opportunistic when you find a really great company that's profitable and all that kind of stuff. I think that, the main basis of CAD and PLM are covered. And then our IoT and AR stuff is already quite savvy. About half of AR is sold as SaaS and more than half of -- I'm sorry about half of IoT is sold as SaaS and more than half of AR. You might remember, we announced the AR capabilities available on the Atlas platform some time ago. So I think \u2013 I don't think we need to acquire anything, there's no gaping holes. Probably integrity was the last important hole that we wanted to fill. And I don't think we would have bought Intland if it weren't such a strong company. It's disruptive in the market. It's growing fast, and it's highly profitable. And that allows us to bring it in, in a short-term free cash flow neutral, mid and long-term free cash flow accretive kind of way, which works for us. So, that's how we think about it, more strategic and opportunistic as opposed to its time to acquire something, what should we go get next?\nMatt Shimao: And Savannah, we'll take our final question for today.\nOperator: And our final question will come from Matt Broome with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.\nJim Heppelmann: Hey, Matt.\nKristian Talvitie: Hey, Matt.\nMatt Broome: Hey, Jim and Kristian. Thanks for -- thanks following me up a question. I guess where are you in terms of expanding tape and arena sort of go-to-market activity across your reseller channel globally. And does that become easier now that SaaS is sort of going more mainstream, so to speak now that Windchill Plus is here.\nJim Heppelmann: Yeah. Well, first let me say that most of Arena is sold direct, to be frank, with an inside sales model. So there's not a big outside for us. So what we've really been expanding to drive Arena sales with some success is to globalize that largely inside model. An inside model is a great thing if you can get it to work. And PLM's, particular big PLM systems are kind of complex and we probably require a higher touch model. But with Arena so far so good. We've been able to scale this inside model. And so that's really what we're doing. Now, our resellers are interested in selling it. And I think as Arena goes up market and the deals get more complex, there'll be a need for a higher touch selling process. And yes probably our existing resellers at some point will play a bigger role with Arena and Onshape. But right now, that low touch inside sales model is working and it's a great thing to -- it's a great model to have if you can make it work. And so far it sounds like we might be able to.\nMatt Broome: Perfect. Thanks very much.\nJim Heppelmann: Okay. I think that was our last question Matt, right? So thank you all for spending some time with us here today. And Matt tells me, we're going to be very active on the circuit here in the next 90 days. We're going to be at like half a dozen different conferences. I'm going to a few myself and Matt and Kristian will be at others. So we might see you on the road and I hope so I haven't seen a lot of you in a long time. It would be nice to see you face-to-face. And if not, we'll look forward to talking to you again in 90 days. As you can see we really feel good about the business. We've put in place a lot of strategic moves. They're mostly working. We've put in place profitability moves that are working pretty well and that's a good combination to have strong growth and strong profitability, and it bodes well for us, particularly given the resilience of our model in good times and in bad. So, I'll leave you with that thought and look forward to seeing you sometime in the next 90 days. Bye-bye.\nKristian Talvitie: Thanks everybody.\nOperator: And that concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kristian Talvitie",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our results, I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance and ARR references will be in both constant currency and as reported. Turning to Slide 16. At the end of Q2, our constant currency ARR was $1.564 billion, up 13% year-over-year. Our SaaS businesses in both the digital thread and Velocity business groups saw continued solid ARR growth in Q2 and represented a larger mix of our overall business both year-over-year and sequentially. We delivered above the ARR guidance range we provided for Q2, which was for constant currency ARR of $1.54 billion to $1.55 billion. On an as-reported basis, year-over-year ARR growth was 11%. Foreign exchange was a $32 million headwind and our as reported ARR in Q2 was $1.532 billion. In March, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, we announced that we would discontinue business operations and sales in Russia. Exiting Russia had a $4 million adverse impact on our Q2 ARR. We've accounted for the $4 million impact as churn in Q2. Cash from operations of $142 million in Q2 was in line with our guidance. Considering the $32 million foreign exchange headwind to ARR, this was a strong outcome reflecting expected seasonality and another quarter of solid collections performance. In Q2, free cash flow of $140 million grew 21% year-over-year and included $18 million in restructuring and other related payments. Adjusted free cash flow was $158 million, up 22% year-on-year. Free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow were both ahead of our guidance due to strong cash from operations and also because CapEx in Q2 came in slightly lower than we had anticipated. The main takeaway on cash flow is that despite the headwinds related to foreign exchange, we've been executing well and delivering on our targets. Q2 revenue of $505 million increased 9% year-over-year. As we've discussed previously revenue is impacted by ASC 606. So we don't believe that revenue growth rates are the best indicator of our underlying business performance, but would rather guide you to ARR as the best metric to understand our top line performance and cash generation. FX impacted revenue by about $6 million in Q2 and our revenue on a constant currency basis was $511 million. Before I move on to the balance sheet, I'd like to provide some color on our non-GAAP operating margin which expanded to 42% in Q2 as Jim noted earlier. This compares to 37% a year ago. Revenue is impacted by ASC 606. So other derivative metrics such as gross margin, operating margin and EPS are all impacted as well. Still, it's worth mentioning that our costs in Q2 benefited from the restructuring we announced in Q4. Six months ago we set an expectation that we would be eliminating some duplicative functions in our field organization and that our operating expense mix would shift towards R&D in alignment with our SaaS acceleration strategy. You can see the progress we've made in our Q2 results. We now have a more optimized operating structure. And we believe the improvements we've driven are sustainable and will enable us to deliver non-GAAP operating margin for fiscal 2022 roughly in line with our year-to-date performance. Moving to Slide 17. We ended Q2 with cash and cash equivalents of $307 million. Our gross debt was $1.28 billion with an aggregate interest rate of about 3.4%. During the second quarter, we generated cash proceeds of $43 million through the sale of our equity investment in Matterport. This in conjunction with cash from operations we used to pay down $175 million on our revolving credit facility in the second quarter. Regarding our share repurchase program as we communicated last quarter, we've completed our planned repurchases for fiscal 2022 with $5 million settling in Q2. And for the remainder of the year we'll focus on delevering. Looking forward to fiscal 2023 and on a go-forward basis assuming our debt-to-EBITDA ratio remains below three times. Our goal is to return approximately 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases. Next Slide 18 shows our ARR by product group. We post a set of financial data tables to our IR website that has our financial statements as well as ARR details. In that file we share both constant currency and as-reported ARR. As a reminder, when we calculate constant currency figures, we use our current year plan FX rates for all periods. Our fiscal 2022 plan FX rates are based on foreign exchange rates as of September 30, 2021. We're using these rates to calculate constant currency figures for all quarters in fiscal 2022 and for all prior periods as well. To illustrate, you can see on the slide that we expect to report \u2013\u2013 we expect as reported ARR to be lower than constant currency ARR for Q3 and fiscal 2022. This is because of the FX headwinds and rate movements which have moved significantly since September 30, 2021. Based on the exchange rates at the end of Q2, we expect as reported ARR for Q3 to be impacted by $32 million. And for fiscal 2022, we expect the FX headwind to be approximately $34 million. This is important to remember in context of our guidance because we provide ARR on a constant currency basis. And if the exchange rates fluctuate significantly between now and the end of Q3, the expected impact to our reported ARR would also change. We do believe constant currency is the best way to evaluate the top line performance of our business because it removes foreign exchange fluctuations from the analysis positive or negative. With that I'll move on to guidance on Slide 19. We're raising our fiscal 2022 constant currency ARR guidance, based on our strong performance in the first half and despite our exit from Russia. The new range is now $1.64 billion to $1.665 billion, which translates to constant currency ARR growth of 12% to 13% for fiscal 2022. For Q3, we're guiding constant currency ARR to be $1.58 billion to $1.595 billion. At the midpoint this equates to 13% constant currency growth. We continue to expect IoT and AR to reach ARR growth of 20% or more by the end of the year. And our FSG and Velocity businesses continue to do very well in the market. That all said the main driver of our fiscal 2022 ARR guidance raise is the strong customer demand we're seeing in our core CAD and PLM offerings, which represented 70% of our ARR in Q2. We're maintaining guidance for fiscal 2022 cash from operations at approximately $430 million as our strong execution and operational discipline are helping us to offset FX headwinds and the Russia exit. Our guidance for Q3 cash from operations is approximately $110 million. We've updated our CapEx guidance for fiscal 2022 to approximately $25 million, which is down from about $30 million that we set at the beginning of the year. And we're expecting approximately $5 million of CapEx spend for Q3. Therefore, we're raising our full year free to cash flow target to approximately $405 million and guiding for Q3 free cash flow of approximately $105 million. We continue to expect our normal seasonal pattern in our fiscal 2022 cash flow generation primarily driven by invoicing seasonality. The majority of our collections occur in the first half of our fiscal year and we continue to expect expenses to increase in the second half fiscal 2022 as we ramp hiring in our SaaS investments because of these dynamics Q4 is expected to be our lowest cash flow generation quarter. Our free cash flow guidance for fiscal 2022, includes $40 million to $45 million of restructuring payments compared to our expectation a quarter ago of $45 million to $50 million as some employees have otherwise departed at PTC and some employees that were expected to depart have moved into new roles where we've been looking at. Both of these are good things. We have less restructuring payments and have been able fill new open roles with good people in a challenging hiring environment. In addition, our fiscal 2022 guidance assumes approximately $5 million of transaction-related payments that were incurred in the first half of fiscal 2022. Therefore consistent with raising our free cash flow guidance, we're also raising our adjusted free cash flow target to approximately $455 million. For Q3, we expect approximately $10 million of restructuring payments and approximately $5 million of transaction-related payments which were incurred in the first half bringing our adjusted free cash flow to approximately $120 million. Moving on to revenue. Despite foreign exchange headwinds and our Russia exit, we're taking the low end of our full year revenue guidance up by $25 million based on our Q2 beat and forecast for the remainder of fiscal 2022. So our new revenue guidance range is $1.905 billion to $1.975 billion. The year-over-year growth we're guiding to now is 5% to 9%. ASC 606 makes revenue difficult to predict for an on-premise subscription company hence the wide range. Note revenue does not influence ARR or cash generation as we typically bill customers annually upfront regardless of contract term lengths. Turning to Slide 20. Jim provided some highlights earlier in terms of the financial impact we expect from the Intland Software and ITC Infotech transactions we announced last week. While both transactions are expected to close during Q3, we have not incorporated the expected financial impacts to our guidance because these deals haven't closed yet. We will officially update all financial metrics and guidance when we report our Q3 earnings.  In the meantime, directionally for constant currency ARR we expect these transactions to have a positive impact of approximately $15 million in fiscal '22. We will report Intland in our FSG product group along with our other ALM assets. And regarding free cash flow, we expect the transactions to have an immaterial impact to free cash flow in fiscal '22 as incremental operational cash flows are expected to offset the incremental transaction-related fees and increased interest expense in the second half. And we expect these transactions to be accretive in fiscal '23. Going forward as Jim explained, we expect these two deals to help us drive the adoption of our SaaS offerings. And over time ITC -- the ITC Infotech transaction is expected to result in lower professional services revenue, but not expected to have a material impact on our profitability. Again, we'll provide a lot more detail at Q3 when we report our results and update all guidance metrics at that point. I'll close out my prepared remarks today by taking you through an illustrative constant currency ARR model on Slide 21. Here we're showing our ARR progression over the past six quarters and an illustration of what is needed to get to the midpoint of our constant currency ARR guidance for Q3 and fiscal '22. First of all, recall that in Q2 of fiscal 2021 our ARR growth benefited due to the acquisition of Arena. So taking that into consideration, in the first half of fiscal '22 we added approximately $25 million more ARR on an organic basis compared to the first half of fiscal 2021. Next calling your attention to the green box. This model shows targeted ending ARR at $1.588 billion for Q3 and $1.653 billion for Q4 both at the midpoint of our guidance ranges. The illustration shows a sequential ARR that's needed in Q3 and Q4 to hit the guidance midpoints. As you can see in the second half of fiscal '22, we need to add about the same amount of new ACV as we did in the second half of fiscal 2021 in order to hit the mid point of constant currency guidance. We believe we're well positioned to do that, even given some of the macro concerns and noting that we also have more deferred ARR starting in the second half of fiscal '22 that we did in fiscal '21. So hopefully that's helpful and with that we'll turn it over to the operator and begin Q&A. Yes. Hey, Jay. Given all the moving parts and it's obviously difficult to pinpoint precisely, but I'd say we're probably somewhere in the 6,700 range. Should be -- do you mean flat year-over-year? Yes, that's right. And I mean I'm also trying to factor in the somewhat challenging hiring environment. If possible we'd like to see that we could say 6,700 to 6,800. I'm just trying to be pragmatic. Hey, Matt. Thanks everybody."

            "content": "Thanks Matt. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. To simplify things, please note that throughout my commentary I will be discussing all growth rates in constant currency. Turning to slide 4. I'm pleased to share that PTC delivered another strong financial performance in fiscal Q2. All of our metrics came in above our guidance and the strength was broad-based across all segments and geographies. Of particular note, we saw organic ARR growth accelerate to 13% despite the self-inflicted churn caused by our decision to exit the Russian market. We ended Q2 with $1.56 billion of ARR. Bookings grew faster than ARR and renewals were very strong. We also continued our track record of translating top line growth into even better bottom line growth. In Q2 our adjusted free cash flow performance was strong at $158 million, up 22% year-over-year and ahead of our guidance. The non-GAAP operating margin of 42% in the quarter was the highest we've seen. The margin expansion strategies we outlined at our December Investor Day are generating the results we expected. Moving to slide 5. While we're monitoring the global macro and geopolitical situation carefully, we continue to see strong global demand environment for our offerings. Driving digital transformation across the product life cycle remains an important priority for our customers. Bookings were up mid-teens year-over-year and the strength was broad-based. Growth was strong in both digital thread and velocity and across all three geographies. Q2 was the sixth consecutive quarter that bookings have grown faster than ARR, which together with improving renewal rates, creates an acceleration bias for ARR growth. To help you understand the resilience of PTC as you think about any potential macro volatility that may lie ahead, I'd like to expand on our business model dynamics, to ensure you appreciate why our business model provides us with confidence in our ability to achieve our financial targets in the back half of the year. Let's take a look at slide 6. On the left-hand side of the slide, you can see that the 13% ARR growth we delivered in Q2 was based, not just on Q2 performance but also on the momentum we built over the previous three quarters as well. ARR growth is a rolling four-quarter metric. So when we say ARR grew 13% in the second quarter, we mean the entire book of recurring business is now 13% larger than it was at this time last year. While this rolling dynamic dampens the impact of bookings in any single quarter, such as the strong results in Q2, it also provides the foundation of stability and resiliency for the company. Remember that, so long as bookings exceed churn ARR will grow. Bookings currently exceed churn by a wide margin. To help you run your own scenarios, let me simplify the math, by giving you some big round directional numbers to work with. Let's say PTC has around $1.5 billion, in ARR. And on a run rate basis, we're adding $300 million in annual bookings, while seeing $100 million in annual churn. Over the next year the $1.5 billion of ARR would step up by $300 million and stepped down by $100 million to grow to $1.7 billion, which is 13% growth. That's consistent with our run rate performance. Note that, because PTC provides sticky enterprise software, our history in 2009 and again in 2020, shows renewals remain steady through a macro downturn. To better understand the sensitivity then of ARR to macro changes, let's start with a hypothetical scenario where bookings stopped growing and remained flat indefinitely at $300 million. In that case, with churn being steady, ARR would experience double-digit growth for several years and high-single digit for several more years after that. If you're concerned about a downturn in Europe which represents 40% of our business, you could create an alternate model where 40% of our bookings declined by 25% for two quarters and then bounced back, in which case we'd still deliver 12% ARR growth over the forthcoming year. If you want to run a more draconian global macro downturn scenario, you could model a 25% reduction across all bookings for the next four quarters, in which case you still get 8% ARR growth over the next year. Frankly no matter what scenarios you might model, you'll consistently see that PTC has a very resilient business. Keep in mind that those were hypothetical examples, because the actual results are considerably better. When bookings grow faster than ARR, as we've seen quarterly since the COVID rebound, it creates an acceleration effect for ARR. Improvement in renewal rates, which we've also been seeing are helpful as well. PTC is experiencing the benefit of these dual acceleration effects right now, which is why we're raising our ARR guidance for the full year. In summary, while the company is in position to accelerate ARR growth assuming conditions remain as they have been, we're also in good position to power through any potential macro slowdown with strong results, as we did in 2020, when bookings design declined sharply for several quarters due to the pandemic before rebounding again. PTC's FY 2020 ARR growth of 11% compared very favorably to our more cyclical industry peers, who don't have the same recurring business model. Some of whom even experienced top line declines in their comparable business lines. The takeaway from this discussion is that our subscription model, which took us years of hard work to put in place is a wonderful thing, and it will keep PTC in a growth leadership position in our industry for years to come. Moving on, let's take a quick look at our Q2 ARR performance by geography on Slide 7 before turning to our business units. In Q2, we saw strong ARR growth across all geographies. Our ARR growth in Americas was 12%. All product segments grew with the main growth drivers being continued strength in our core PLM and CAD segments and another strong contribution from our Velocity business. In Europe, our ARR growth was 15% despite the Russia exit. We saw strong results across the board in Europe with growth primarily driven by our core PLM and CAD businesses and strong growth in the IoT and AR segment. In addition, our velocity and FSG businesses delivered solid growth in Europe in Q2. Europe has the largest mix of channel versus direct and the resellers continue to perform well. I know that investors are concerned about exposure to Europe and the macro environment there, so I'd like to reiterate that: first, we're continuing to see strong bookings performance in Europe; and second, as I've demonstrated quantitatively, our model is highly resilient. Our ARR growth in APAC was 14% with our core CAD and PLM businesses again being the main drivers. Next, let's look at the ARR performance of our business units starting with digital thread on Slide 8. In our largest product segment, Digital Thread Core, we delivered another double-digit growth performance in Q2 with 13% growth. Within this, CAD grew low double digits, while PLM grew mid-teens. Bookings grew faster in each case, reflecting on Q2 across the now 18 consecutive quarters of double-digit ARR growth that we've seen in the core CAD and PLM business. This was the best performance yet, which I attribute to a combination of strong demand for digital transformation, best-in-class sticky solutions sold in the recurring revenue model with low churn rights and the growth tailwinds from our SaaS initiatives. In our core business, our solutions are very strategic and we're executing well and taking market share. You may have noted, we also launched Windchill+ during the quarter, which is our next-generation differentiated core SaaS PLM solution. Windchill+ contains the technology and operational improvements that enable higher profitability and is now becoming our lead Windchill sales play. Windchill+ is just the tip of the iceberg of a bigger plus strategy. And you'll see us follow with Creo Plus and similar premium SaaS offerings in FY 2023 and beyond. In Digital Thread, growth we saw ARR growth of 15%. While the sequential acceleration was modest, we made good operational progress and remain on track to get growth to a two handle by the end of the year. Following the launch of our new ThingWorx Digital Performance Management Solution, which we abbreviate as DPM, in Q2, we landed our first nine deals across various different industries, including aerospace and defense, high-tech, automotive and food and beverage. Though these were started deals, average initial deal size was six figures. Rockwell brought in several of these DPM deals and the DPM pipeline for both companies looks good going into the back half of the year. FSG had a great Q2 with 8% ARR growth. Servigistics retail PLM and Arbortext all performed well, helping to drive solid results in terms of renewals and churn. Growth was particularly strong in the Americas and Europe. With FSG, our strategy is to keep delivering value to customers by having dedicated focus on each of these products. And I'm pleased to see that strategy produced another strong quarter. Before I turn to our Velocity business unit, let me run through a couple of quick customer stories that will give you a taste of how customers are leveraging our digital transformation capabilities. I'll start with Bosch on slide nine. Bosch is a massive global supplier of technologies and services. With 400,000 employees, including 75,000 engineers, a key challenge for Bosch is how to drive end-to-end digital transformation at scale. Bosch is leveraging their Windchill PLM system as a backbone in combination with Creo and ThingWorx to enable new and improved workflows. This specific example is about Bosch using model-based design capabilities of Creo Windchill. By moving beyond the world of 2D drawings and leveraging enhanced 3D Creo data across engineering, manufacturing and inspection processes, Bosch is driving improved productivity and bringing products to market faster. Next, on slide 10, Cummins is the world's largest independent diesel and gas engine manufacturer and an interesting ESG story that we help enable. Cummins has long made it a company goal to reduce their environmental impact and digital transformation is a critical part of their journey. By using generative design and ANSYS-powered simulation upfront in their Creo-based design process, Cummins has been able to reduce material usage, create better products and accelerate time to market. Turning to the Velocity business on slide 11. Year-over-year, ARR growth for our Velocity segment was 27% in Q2, with both Onshape and Arena growing multiple times faster than the market, which demonstrates there's a distinct and vibrant segment of the CAD and PLM market that prioritize SaaS and agile product development as their number one buying criteria. With Onshape and Arena, PTC has a unique ability to serve this market segment and we're continuing to ramp both our Velocity product and go-to-market investments. Let's move to slide 12 where I'd like to take you through a Velocity example showing how Arena is empowering Filtronics global team to deliver innovative products faster. Filtronic is using Arena's SaaS PLM solution to control product design and supporting documentation and to enable collaboration across globally-distributed teams. The benefits of providing complete visibility into critical product and quality processes are significant. For example, engineering change cycle time was cut by 50% and the issue resolution time has been cut in half as well. Turning to slide 13. We announced two transactions last week and I'd like to recap both and provide some additional context. First we announced an agreement to acquire Intland Software, a next-generation application life cycle management or ALM company for $280 million. For background, PTC entered the ALM market a decade ago, when we acquired MKS and their integrity suite. ALM has become an important and well-established offering within PTC's portfolio and is sold both standalone and as a key subsystem of our Windchill PLM offering. The Codebeamer family of software products from Intland is a next-generation ALM suite that's fast becoming the new standard in safety critical and regulated industries, especially in the large automotive industries where products are increasingly differentiated by the software. Bringing Codebeamer into our ALM suite will bolster both ALM and PLM growth potential by significantly increasing our product strength and market momentum. Intland is a great company who matches their strong product with strong growth and surprisingly good profitability for their size. We expect to achieve both revenue and cost synergies with this acquisition. When it closes, the acquisition is expected to add roughly a percentage point of inorganic growth to our FY 2022 ARR results. Intland will join our existing ALM unit, so Codebeamer ARR will be reported as part of our FSG segment. We expect this acquisition will increase the growth rates of FSG going forward which we now expect to be consistently growing in the mid-single-digit range. Second, we announced an agreement to sell a portion of our professional services business to long-time partner ITC Infotech to further power our SaaS strategy. This moves a continuation of a long-term strategy we've been executing to focus PTC's efforts on high-margin software, while we look to a partner ecosystem to deliver the professional services that unlock the value of that software in the customer setting. As we ramp up the SaaS initiatives we described at our December Investor Day, a key component of the program is the lift and shift efforts required to move on-premise customer deployments into our SaaS cloud. With a large installed base, we're looking at the need for potentially thousands of services projects in the coming years. These are projects where PTC needs to play a direct role because at the end of each project we will be taking ownership of the running system and carrying it forward. Rather than put our own professional services organization back on to a growth vector as we scale up to perform these projects, we're instead planning to transition some of our key PLM talent into a new ITCI unit called DxPServices, thereby allowing the lift and ship capacity to scale on ITC's P&L rather than ours. This new DxPServices unit will be our partner to run joint lift and ship projects with DXP doing the upgrade and de customization work that happens at the customer site and PTC assuming the resulting system into our centralized SaaS operations. This is a professional services transaction so it has no bearing on ARR. Kristian will comment further on the expected financial impact of these two transactions. We expect both will close in Q3. To wrap-up then on slide 14, I'm very pleased with PTC's position and the opportunity that lies ahead. Our portfolio of products is unique and compelling and it aligns well to customer demand. Throughout the first half of FY 2022, bookings and renewals have been strong and growth is accelerating as we enter the second half of what will be our fifth consecutive year of double-digit ARR growth. We're poised to further accelerate growth as SaaS tailwinds blow harder in the coming quarters and as we gain momentum with DPM and other IoT and ARR initiatives. Our profitability continues to expand following the changes we implemented at the start of the year and as our start-up businesses continue to mature up in J curves. Our model has proven to be highly resilient even in the face of a slowdown like during the pandemic in 2020. We're raising our guidance for the second quarter in a row and I think the company has never been in a better position to create shareholder value. With that, I'll turn it over to Kristian for more details on the financial results. Kristian? Yes. I mean absolutely Joe, Jim here. Keep in mind that PTC is really helping customers plan and engineer and plan the production processes for products. We're not helping them to actually by and large we're not helping them much to produce the product. So the supply chain problems really are production problems. And if you're having production problems, most companies don't see that as a reason to stop planning the next generation of products because suddenly a production problem will be solved at some point. And then you'll be competing for who has the best next-generation product and I hope you didn't take the year off. So we don't really see any connection. And frankly, we didn't see much connection in 2020 either in that particular way. So I think the pandemic in 2020, put a lot of momentum into digital transformation. People realize you can't execute a hybrid work for us for example, without a system of record for product data. It just doesn't work. So that momentum is carrying through and people are forging ahead with their strategies to implement for example PLM and CAD to advance their digital transformation initiative even if their factories are idle because they're waiting on semiconductors or in some cases wire harnesses that used to come from Ukraine and all that type of stuff. So actually I was in Germany, in the last week of the quarter. And the customers I talked to were full speed ahead as it related to the PTC project. And we mentioned that we had a very strong bookings quarter in Europe. And again that's net of a fairly if you put all that churn from Russia in Europe it's material. It's like probably a point of growth I'm just in for Europe. So I think we're doing well and sort of feel like actually conditions look pretty good. And at the same time we can withstand a lot and still really deliver some impressive growth and free cash flow numbers. Yes. If you go back to our Investor Day I'll remind you that we really feel like we're starting the third phase of our SaaS project. And the Windchill part of it started back in the first phase. So for us we've had a lot of success with cloud. And it's one of the growth drivers for Windchill. It has been over the last 18 quarters. I think the difference is, we didn't like the profitability of the cloud part of the Windchill cloud business as we used to do it. So this Windchill+ is really our shift to the multi-tenant model, which to the customer doesn't look much different. But to PTC it looks quite a bit different and produces quite a different outcome in terms of profitability. So, I think, customers like the Windchill in the cloud before. They still like Windchill in the cloud, because PTC likes Windchill in the cloud better now. And that's causing us to open the floodgates a little more, because it's a more attractive business for us now. Next question. Hello, Adam. Yes. I mean, the key thing -- let's focus mostly on IoT, because it's much larger. The key thing is there's two key use cases for IoT -- three key use cases actually. One is smart connected products, which are the products you manufacture. The second one is smart connected factories or we call it, smart connected operations. That's the products you buy and operate in your factories. And then the third one is, really this Navigate strategy of bringing in information from a lot of different systems, kind of, an environment that just makes lightweight users more productive and so forth. But anyway, all of our discrete manufacturers produce products and they all operate factories. So what we really said is, for efficiency reasons and success reasons, all that stuff, we ought to focus on selling to our customer base with more veracity than just selling to anybody. And so Troy Richardson put in place a stronger focus on cross-sell. And we're starting to see some, let's say, green shoots, particularly in DPM, Rockwell sold through the Rockwell base, but all the deals we sold really came from the customer base in PTC. That's good. And we think there's something there. So, keep in mind, when we think about IoT and AR in Q3 and Q4, there's a couple of things I want to point out. First of all ARR is a rolling four-quarter metric. So three of the four data points that say what's going to happen in Q3 are already in. And two of the four data points that say what's going to happen in Q4 are already in. So we have some visibility. But now, what we -- what the rest of it hinges on is, bookings churn and backlog or deferred ARR. And so, we're looking at all this stuff. We look at the pipeline, we look at the forecast. We try to estimate bookings. And we don't have a crystal ball. And sometimes we're not perfectly right. But anyway, we have a read on what we think churn will be and that's what we're looking at. And we're confident that that's going to get us to that two handle by the end of the year. Yes. Well, coincidentally Scott Genereux, the Chief Revenue Officer from Rockwell happened to be at PTC today, so I had lunch with him and we talked it over. And the truth is, DPM is a better fit for Rockwell than is ThingWorx as a platform, an IoT platform. And -- so, Rockwell is leaning in and their consulting arm Calypso is really leaning in and PTC is leaning in. So I think there's some promising again green shoots there. We were pleased to see Rockwell participate in DPM success right from the start. And I think, it gives us a better foundation, if you will to build success. It's a better fit for what both PTC and Rockwell are capable of. We're both solution providers. This is a solution versus a platform. Hi Jay. Okay. I'll take the first one on Intland versus Integrity. I mean Jay it is fundamentally the same story. And I think we've had reasonable success with the Integrity product. But we had some challenges with the Integrity product that I think are fixed in this next-generation Codebeamer offering. Keep in mind that ALM is both a business by itself and it's a key subsystem of our PLM system, which therefore means it fuels our PLM success as well. But when I look at Integrity versus COVID there's a couple of things that stand out. Number one is SaaS. We didn't have a SaaS solution. We didn't have a path to a SaaS solution with integrity. It's much older technology. That's one thing. The second thing is Integrity had its own built-in source code management tools. And the entire development community has really shifted to tools like GitHub and so forth. It's very, very hard to sell against things like GitHub, which amongst other things tend to be free. So it turns out that the Codebeamer is designed to work with all these other modern tools out there. And then the third thing is Codebeamer is really viewed as a sexy, best-in-class user experience all that kind of stuff. So we're really with Codebeamer leapfrogging far ahead of where we were with Integrity, leapfrogging the competition and we now have an offering that allows us to go back on the offense, back into automotive companies, back into medical device companies, aerospace and defense companies, inning where people put safety critical or regulated software into products. The thing in an automobile setting and this is what I would have said 10 years ago is you got to manage the software very carefully in the context of the automobile. You have a set of requirements for a new automobile. Many of those requirements get implemented into mechanical systems, but a bunch of them and more every day get implemented into software. And a bug in the software is as bad or even worse than a failure in a mechanical part. And so this deep concern by these automotive companies and then there's regulations around it that says if anybody in the supply chain changes the line of code. You need to know, which line of code they change. You need to know why they changed it and you need to have a test approved they didn't break anything. And so it's a very, very difficult software management environment that frankly doesn't apply to a software company like PTC. We don't have any mechanical parts. So it's us, it's just software, but they're a software in the context of a physical product managed in CAD and PLM and that all needs to be integrated back together. So basically Intland is a next-generation leapfrog move within our ALM and PLM strategies. Kristian? Yes. I mean, Jay, you look at this data, you know we have a lot of positions open on one hand. We have attrition on another hand and then we're spending some employees out through this transaction. So it is a little hard to net those out, because it's difficult to pin down attrition and pin down hiring success. But headcount won't go up dramatically here in the context of all that, it will probably be flattish. I mean, as a reasonable approximation. Hey, Yun. Yes. So I think we have tremendous scalability in ecosystem. But just for the benefit of everybody, let's turn the clock back a little bit. If you go back 10 years about a third of our revenue was services. And now it's 9% going to, I don't know, 6% or so as a result of this transaction. And what happened over those years in our quest for margins, which was very successful, we said, let's stop chasing services. Let's give it to the ecosystem. The ecosystem took that differential from us and added 10 times that on their own. So literally the ecosystem is doing billions of dollars of services around our stuff. It's not a one partner. It's in many, many, many partners. With some of them having names like Accenture and Deloitte and Cognos and not Cognos, Cognizant and Calypso and on and on and on many having smaller firms you never heard of. So there's a lot of capacity out there. The thing is these projects we can't just give to a partner, because in the end we're taking the systems into our running system. It has to be done very carefully. We have for many, many years subcontracted work to ITCI. We could have subcontracted these projects to ITCI, but I said, I don't really want that in our P&L, because subcontracted projects tend to have even less margin than projects we do with our own employees, of course, there's two margins there. So rather than build up a subcontracting business, because we didn't really want to go hire all those people, we just entered into this arrangement. It's a great win-win-win. ITCI is happy to grow the services business. That's the business they're in. By the way, they're fundamentally an Indian company. So they have a deep reservoir of access to lower-cost labor in India and that \u2013 a lot of these projects will end up being done in India with their Indian capacity. And it will give us the talent, because we're seeding DxP with the best in the industry which are PTC's own services employees. So DxP could have been a joint venture or something like that, could have been a subcontracting approach. We just said, you know, what we're a software company. We want to be high margin, high-growth software, let's PTC focus on that and this is a good way to solve that lift and ship service to pave new problem. Well, we've been doing a lot of adoption of Windchill in the cloud that phase one offering. So we're just going to pivot that to Windchill+ now. Windchill+ by the way, so is not just Windchill in the cloud. It's Windchill+ a bunch of things plus cloud plus all the Atlas benefits plus single sign-in across the suite plus our workflow engine, our BPM workflow engine, plus our visualization in the cloud capabilities. So we're really trying to create a differentiated offering in part to help justify the higher price point, but also to make it more attractive to go to the cloud. Just for fun I tell people think of like a first class seat then in an airplane versus a coach seat. It isn't just at the seats bigger. And you wouldn't want somebody to say, well, I want to sit in coach but have a bigger seat at a lower price point. That's sort of like saying could I have a system integrator put my Windchill system into cloud for me? So what we're doing is offering a bundle of things. It's a bigger seat. It's a bigger TV, it's better food. You get to board first. You got plenty of room for your luggage, quicker access to the restroom. I mean, all those stuff that would be associated with a first-class seat and can't be unbundled and bought off a Chinese menu. So that's really what we're doing with Windchill+ and then we're going to follow the same strategy with the rest of the products as we're ready. Yeah. Thank you, Yun. Well, keep in mind, there's a difference between things we have to do and being opportunistic when you find a really great company that's profitable and all that kind of stuff. I think that, the main basis of CAD and PLM are covered. And then our IoT and AR stuff is already quite savvy. About half of AR is sold as SaaS and more than half of -- I'm sorry about half of IoT is sold as SaaS and more than half of AR. You might remember, we announced the AR capabilities available on the Atlas platform some time ago. So I think \u2013 I don't think we need to acquire anything, there's no gaping holes. Probably integrity was the last important hole that we wanted to fill. And I don't think we would have bought Intland if it weren't such a strong company. It's disruptive in the market. It's growing fast, and it's highly profitable. And that allows us to bring it in, in a short-term free cash flow neutral, mid and long-term free cash flow accretive kind of way, which works for us. So, that's how we think about it, more strategic and opportunistic as opposed to its time to acquire something, what should we go get next? Hey, Matt. Yeah. Well, first let me say that most of Arena is sold direct, to be frank, with an inside sales model. So there's not a big outside for us. So what we've really been expanding to drive Arena sales with some success is to globalize that largely inside model. An inside model is a great thing if you can get it to work. And PLM's, particular big PLM systems are kind of complex and we probably require a higher touch model. But with Arena so far so good. We've been able to scale this inside model. And so that's really what we're doing. Now, our resellers are interested in selling it. And I think as Arena goes up market and the deals get more complex, there'll be a need for a higher touch selling process. And yes probably our existing resellers at some point will play a bigger role with Arena and Onshape. But right now, that low touch inside sales model is working and it's a great thing to -- it's a great model to have if you can make it work. And so far it sounds like we might be able to. Okay. I think that was our last question Matt, right? So thank you all for spending some time with us here today. And Matt tells me, we're going to be very active on the circuit here in the next 90 days. We're going to be at like half a dozen different conferences. I'm going to a few myself and Matt and Kristian will be at others. So we might see you on the road and I hope so I haven't seen a lot of you in a long time. It would be nice to see you face-to-face. And if not, we'll look forward to talking to you again in 90 days. As you can see we really feel good about the business. We've put in place a lot of strategic moves. They're mostly working. We've put in place profitability moves that are working pretty well and that's a good combination to have strong growth and strong profitability, and it bodes well for us, particularly given the resilience of our model in good times and in bad. So, I'll leave you with that thought and look forward to seeing you sometime in the next 90 days. Bye-bye."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by and welcome to the PTC's 2022 First Quarter Conference Call. During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. I'd now like to turn the call over to Matt Shimao, PTC's Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMatt Shimao: Hello. Thank you, Julian and welcome to PTC's results call for Q1 of fiscal '22. On the call today are James Heppelmann, Chief Executive Officer, and Kristian Talvitie, Chief Financial Officer. During this call, PTC will make forward-looking statements, including guidance on future operating results. Because such statements deal with future events, actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements can be found in PTC's annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as in today's press release. The forward-looking statements, including guidance provided during the call are valid only as of today's date, January 26, 2022, and PTC assumes no obligation to publicly update these forward-looking statements. During the call, PTC will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in today's press release made available on our website. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to PTC's Chief Executive Officer, Jim Heppelmann.\nJames Heppelmann: Thanks, Matt, good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. Turning to slide three, I'm pleased to share that PTC delivered another strong financial performance in fiscal Q1. We executed very well building on the momentum we saw in Q4. To simplify things, please note that throughout my prepared commentary, I will only discuss growth rates in constant currency. ARR came in at $1.507 billion, which was better than the $1.5 billion we had guided to at the recent Investor Day. that represents 16% growth, 11% of which was organic. Adjusted free cash flow was also strong at $145 million, which was up 20% year-over-year and better than the $140 million expectation we set at the Investor Day. We're off to a very strong start in fiscal 2022. Turning to Slide four, of particular note was our booking strength. Bookings were up double digits organically and high teens overall against the very strong COVID bounce back quarter we saw in Q1 of fiscal '21, when bookings grew more than 30% over the prior year. To put it in perspective, given the tough comparison against Q1 of last year, we had planned bookings to actually be down slightly inclusive of Arena. So this performance was more than 20% above plan. I know that some analysts and investors had voiced concern that the restructuring work we did in late Q4 and throughout Q1 would distract us, but obviously we didn't see that. The strength was broad based across direct sales and resellers and was achieved with no mega deals. Rockwell came in ahead of their part of our plan too, which was great to see and suggest my concerns of them being distracted may prove overstated. Arena contributed the inorganic element of bookings growth with another strong bookings quarter coming in above plan as well. With the Arena acquisition getting round tripped here in Q2, Arena becomes part of the organic results going forward and their low twenties growth rate will then add another tailwind to the organic results. Arena's been a great acquisition. Bookings growth was particularly strong in PLM and in both Europe and Americas. From a macro perspective, global PMIs remain in expansion territory while digital transformation in SaaS continue to grow an importance as secular drivers. The interest in digital transformation in SaaS has been driving strong bookings for what is very sticky software, which when layered into a recurring revenue model that is atypical of industry peers has allowed PTC to deliver performance in excess of market growth rates. This happened right through the pandemic, especially in the large core business that represents about 70% of our ARR and we fully expected to continue going forward. These factors gave us to raise the lower end of our ARR guidance range, which at the new midpoint basically means we rolled our Q1 beat forward. Now let's take a look at the ARR performance by geography on Slide five, before turning to business units. In Q1, we saw strong ARR performance across all geographies. Our ARR growth in the Americas was 19%. All product segments grew with key growth drivers being the acquired arena contribution and the velocity business unit overall layered on top of another strong quarter in the core CAD and PLM business. In Europe, our ARR growth was 13%. We saw strong results across the board in Europe, with the strongest drivers of the growth being our Digital Thread growth and core businesses. Europe has the largest mix of channel versus direct and the resellers continue to perform well. Our ARR growth in APAC was 14% with growth, primarily driven by our Digital Thread core business. Next, let's take a look at the ARR performance of our various business units, starting with the Digital Thread group on Slide six. In our largest product segment, Digital Thread core, we delivered yet another double digit performance in Q1 with 11% growth. Within this, CAD and PLM both grew double digits with strong growth across all three geographies. This is the 17th consecutive quarter of double digit ARR growth in the core business and as we roll out our more aggressive SaaS strategy, I expect we'll see many more. In the Digital Thread growth, which is IoT and AR, we saw ARR growth of about 14% consistent across both elements. This was in line with our plan and the mid-teens near term growth expectation we set at the recent Investor Day. While this level of growth remains accretive to company growth, we continue to expect an acceleration of growth into the twenties as we get into the back half of the year. The biggest driver of growth in Q1 was from expansions, especially in Europe and APAC. We believe market conditions in IoT improving, and we like the way the pipeline for a new DPM offering is developing through both PTC and Rockwell channels. For AR, we continue to see a tremendous level of interest, but the market remains nascent. Perhaps most importantly, the formation of the Digital Thread business unit at the start of F Y '22 has driven important initiatives to increase our focus on cross-selling of IoT and AR into the core CAD and PLM customer base. FSG had a great Q1 with 6% ARR growth. The expansion deal we recently announced with the US Air Force, both increases and extends this key relationship for up to five more years. Contracts like this demonstrate the value that our customers are realizing from served logistics and other FSG products, such as retail PLM and ALM. You may remember I noted at our Investor Day that having FSG grow in the mid single digits rather than flat would be a helpful upside growth driver. So I'm pleased to see FSG post another strong quarter. Let me run through a couple of quick customer anecdote to give you a sense for our Digital Thread customers and how they rely on us. On Slide seven MAN Energy Solutions is the world's top provider of large bore engines and turbo machinery for the maritime and energy industries. The company manufactures complex parts and nearly every engine they make must meet unique customer requirements. Before implementing Creo, they relied on manual outdated processes that slowed design and production. With Creo, they've been able to transition from 2D to a full 3D model-based approach. Creo's broad range of toolpath automation capabilities enable them to save time in the programming of the tool pass used to machine the large complex engine parts greatly increasing efficiency in transitioning from design to production. Turning to Slide eight, you may have noticed we announced a deal with the -- we announced that the German company Sheffler has expanded its relationship with PTC and I'd like to share a bit of the backstory. Sheffler has been a long time Creo customer and has successfully deployed wind Welsh within engineering. But back in 2017, one of our PLM competitors announced large PLM deal with Sheffler that appeared to cap PTCs expansion opportunity. But that system didn't ultimately stick as Sheffler has now decided to consolidate on PTC systems with Welsh [ph] being the backbone and is broadly deploying our solutions in their standard out of the box fashion so that Sheffler can participate in the full power of our Digital Thread portfolio. I'm very excited about this collaboration and the further expansion that Sheffler is exploring with our IoT and ARR offerings. On Slide nine, you'll see how EMA [ph] Group a global business that delivers packaging machines, services, and solutions to a wide variety of industries was looking for a way to expand their control room offering to help their customers improve overall equipment effectiveness and reduce downtime. As long-time users of PTCs Creo and windshield, EMA decided that ThingWorx was the ideal IoT solution for their initiative, and that Kepware could provide connectivity only to their machines, but to the other vendor's machines deployed alongside them. EMA has successfully launched new revenue streams by enabling 24 7 monitoring of customer production lines and improved OEE by up to 16%. Euphoria integrated with ThingWorxs is the platform of choice for the US Air Force training initiatives. Slide 10 highlights the work that PTC partner Vektrona has done with the US Air Force. With finite training resources and limited capacity, the US Air Force set out to incorporate augmented reality into their maintenance and munitions training. Vektrona using [indiscernible] studio worked with US Air Force to create immersive 3D AR experiences for phones, tablets and the HoloLens 2, that are designed to accelerate learning, improve work performance and facilitate remote training. The improved training shows better engagement and information retention with continuous and repeatable task training available regardless of the system or aircraft type. Turning to Slide 11, the velocity we use ARR growth in Q1 was more than 650% due to the inclusion of Arena and 53% organically, which would be on shape. If you were to add Arena's pre-acquisition results into the prior year to get a better pro forma comparison, then you'd have the velocity business unit growing at 28% in Q1. That 28% is a mix of Onshape growing at 53% in the large Arena business growing in the low twenties. Growth of both Onshape and Arena is multiple times higher than market rates clearly demonstrating that industrial companies see the benefits of SaaS. We continue to ramp investments to expand technology leadership and to broaden the geographic presence of our Velocity businesses. On Slide 12, Beta Technologies, a leading developer of next generation electric aircraft for the cargo and logistics market, sought a cloud native product development platform where everyone would be working with one single source of truth without the workflow restrictions of traditional file based design systems. Beta turned to Onshape because of how it enables real time collaboration, allowing the engineering team to work from any location while streamlining their communications during the design process. To profile an Arena customer, Potrero Medical on Slide 13 is a predictive health company developing the next generation of medical devices, leveraging smart sensors and artificial intelligence. Potrero needed a scalable quality management system to support its growing product development and compliance needs, including satisfying FDA audit requirements. Arena was the right solution offering a cloud native QMS with a quick implementation, leading to ECO cycle time reduction of 30% and non-conformance improvement of 20%. As a final topic, I'd like to give you a quick update on our SaaS acceleration initiative on Slide 14, we've made tremendous progress in the past 90 days since we announced the more aggressive strategy. We've launched our SaaS program management office, which was modeled after the very successful approach we used to drive our subscription transition several years back. Our field organizations transitioned to the new two in a box customer success organization model without missing a beat. We converged our cloud and tech support organizations with product development to deploy the DevOps type of approach you see in virtually all SaaS companies. We've made good progress advancing our offerings, especially the windshield multi-tenant version, which will go into production shortly this quarter and we made good progress preparing the SaaS conversion offerings that will power the hundreds of lift and shifts that will happen in the coming quarters and years. We have more work to do, but we're certainly off and running. The time for SaaS has arrived in our industry and PTC is very well positioned. We're already the SaaS leader in our space with continued strong SaaS growth in windshield and FSG and high levels of growth in our cloud native Velocity Business unit. Sharing the Atlas SaaS platform, we have a dual strategy to win with Onshape and arena powering a new agile product development approach while we transition our Digital Thread portfolio and existing customer base to SaaS, to elevate the platform strategies that so many larger companies have. To wrap up on Slide 15, I'm pleased with PTC's position and the opportunity that lies ahead. Q1 gave us a strong start to what we expect to be our fifth consecutive year of double digit ARR growth. Our portfolio of products is unique and compelling and obviously aligns well to customer demand. Our results have been consistently strong for many quarters, but we're poised to accelerate growth as the SaaS tailwind blows harder in coming quarters and as we gain more momentum with our IoT and ARR initiatives in the back half of the year. We're poised to drive higher levels of profitability too following the organizational changes we've already implemented and as our start-up businesses continue to mature up their J-curves [ph]. The company has never been in a better position to create shareholder value. With that, I'll turn it over to Kristian for more details on the financial results.\nKristian Talvitie: Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our results, I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance and growth rate references will be in both constant currency and at as reported rates. So turning to Slide 17, we delivered constant currency, ARR of $1.507 billion, which is 16% growth year over year, and slightly exceeded our Q1 guidance of $1.5 billion. On an organic constant currency basis, this is 11% growth. FX was an approximate $11 million headwind in Q1. So our as reported ARR was $1.496 billion. Our SaaS products in both the Digital Thread and Velocity business units saw continued strong growth in Q1 with growth rates, similar to what we discussed at our recent Investor Day. This is in combination with continued strong growth of our software-only sales. As of Q1, our SaaS portfolio is now 15% of our total ARR on a constant currency basis. Q1 free cash flow of $134 million grew 21% year-over-year and includes $11 million in restructuring and other related payments. Adjusted free cash flow was $145 million and was slightly ahead of the $140 million we discussed at our Investor Day. Q1 revenue of $458 million increased 7% year-over-year. As we've discussed, previously, revenue is impacted by ASC 606. So we do not believe that revenue growth rates are indicative of our underlying business performance, but would rather guide you to ARR as the best metric to understand our topline performance and cash collections. FX only impacted revenue by about $1 million in Q1. So our revenue on a constant currency basis was $459 million.# Q1 non-GAAP operating margin of 35% compared to 36% in Q1 of 2021. While, this is a strong result, it's still worth pointing out that because revenue is impacted by ASC 606, other derivative metrics such as gross margin, operating margin and EPS are all also impacted. Suffice it to say that our cogs and OpEx came in, in line with our expectations in Q1, and we continue to maintain good discipline on our operating expense structure. I would like to point out that our GAAP results reflect a gain of $9.8 million related to our investment in Matterport and we're also slightly reducing the range for expected PNL charges from approximately $45 million to $50 million down to $40 million to $45 million for the full year and coincidentally, we're also reducing the range of expected cash payments for the restructuring and other from what was previously $50 million to $55 million down to $45 million to $50 million for the full year. For guidance purposes, we will continue to show $50 million as the cash payments in the adjusted free cash flow reconciliation. But if payments come in lower, then we would just expect actual free cash flow to come in higher. There's no change to the $450 million adjusted free cash flow target. Moving to Slide 18, I'll begin with our balance sheet. We ended Q1 with cash and cash equivalent of $296 million. In addition, at the end of Q1, we had medium term investments of $87 million primarily related to our investment in Matterport. Our gross debt was $1.45 billion with an aggregate interest rate of about 3.2%. In Q1, we used $120 million of cash to repurchase shares. We also had an additional $5 million of repurchases, which settled early in Q2. For the remainder of fiscal '22, we will focus on de-levering and looking forward to FY '23 in an ongoing go-forward basis assuming our debt to EBITDA ratio was below three times, we will continue to target to return approximately 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases. Turning to Slide 19. We post a data table to our IR website that has our financial statements, as well as ARR detail by segment. In that file, we share both constant currency and as reported ARR, as a reminder, when we calculate constant currency, we use our current year plan FX rates and restate history to the same rates. So here, for example, on this slide, you can see our Q1 constant currency, ARR of $1.507 billion, and the actual as reported ARR of $1.496 billion. This is important to remember in the context of our guidance because we provide guidance at the plan rate. We believe this is the best way to evaluate the top line performance of our business because it removes FX fluctuations from the analysis positive or negative. With that, I'll move on to guidance on Slide 20. As Jim mentioned, we're raising the low end of our full year constant currency ARR guidance by $10 million. The new range is now $1.625 billion to $1.660 billion. This essentially reflects rolling our Q1 over performance through the remainder of the year. We're now expecting constant currency ARR growth of 11% to 13% in fiscal '22. It's worth pointing out that based on FX rates, at the end of Q1, we would expect a $13 million headwind against that full year ARR guidance. For Q2, we're setting constant currency ARR guidance of $1.540 billion to $1.550 billion. This is 12% organic constant currency growth at the midpoint. On an as reported basis, the FX impact we're calculating based on the FX rates at the end of Q1 is a $12 million headwind in Q2 compared to the constant currency guidance. Moving to free cash flow, we're maintaining our full year free cash flow target of $400 million. This includes approximately $50 million of restructure and acquisition related payments. The majority of these payments are related to the reorganization we announced in Q1 with some residual payments, primarily related to our C port move for which we took the accounting charge in prior periods. So our adjusted free cash flow target for fiscal '22 remains $450 million. Fiscal Q2 adjusted free cash flow is expected to be approximately $155 million. We expect to make approximately $20 million in restructuring and other related payments in Q2 bringing our free cash flow to approximately $135 million. Moving to revenue, we're also taking the low end of the full year revenue guidance up by $20 million. This reflects both the strength in software and strength in the professional services business that we saw in Q1 and the related forecasts for the full year. So for fiscal '22, our new revenue guidance range is $1.870 billion to $1.975 billion. The year-over-year growth rate range is now 3% to 9%. ASE 606 makes revenue very difficult to predict for on premise subscription companies hence the wide range. Note that revenue variability has -- from 606 has no impact on ARR or its related cash generation as we continue to primarily bill customers annually upfront, regardless of term length. We continue to expect more than 60% of our annual free cash flow generation to occur in the first half of the year, collections are stronger in the first half and we expect expenses to increase as we ramp hiring in our SaaS investments throughout the year. Wrapping up on Slide 21 with the free cash flow model that we use and went into some depth on at our recent Investor Day that you can see here, I know many of you use model three cash flow using the indirect method. However, given the complexities related to revenue recognition due to 606, this is difficult to do. The model we show here has proven quite effective. The table shows fiscal '21 actuals compared to the model we shared at Investor Day compared to our current guidance. Let me take you through the model, focusing on the non-GAAP column on the right and starting at the top. First, we're showing the midpoint of our as reported ARR guidance of $1.630 billion which is different from the constant currency guidance that we gave due to the $13 million FX headwind and is also $5 million lower than what we showed at the Investor Day. We use as reported here because it's a better reflection of the cash we expect to generate. You can also see that we have increased the perpetual license revenue forecast slightly, and also the professional services revenue increase that we mentioned earlier. Cogs is slightly higher reflecting the increased cost to deliver the incremental professional services revenue, and the rest of the assumptions remain the same and we still end up with our target adjusted free cash flow of $450 million. Obviously this is a model based on assumptions, such as the midpoint of the ARR range, the impact of FX, the pace of hiring, etcetera. So if some of those variables change, which they invariably will, the model will have to be adjusted accordingly and as I mentioned earlier, if cash payments related to the restructuring, come in at the low end of the range, we would see a flip from the restructuring line to the free cash flow line, but the adjusted free cash flow target would remain unchanged. But as we sit here today, we think this is a reasonable view of how we expect the year to shape up. So with that I'll turn the call over to the operator and we can begin Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Your first question will come from Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAndrew Obin: Just a bigger picture question, I apologize, I missed the first couple of minutes. We hear a lot about supply chain constraints and frankly, we're hearing that this might extend the run in terms of PMI expansion. So what are you hearing in terms of sort of, as you have convers about PLM and in terms of adoption, what kind of conversations are you having with your customers and do customers have awareness of supply chains being gummed up for longer and are you seeing this having any discernible impact on what kind of conversations you are having with people?\nJames Heppelmann: Andrew it's Jim? No, actually it's not really, it's not really a frequent topic in our conversations because well, first of all, since you said you missed the first minutes, one of the things I pointed out is that our bookings came in very, very strong and I explained about 20% higher than plan. So we had a very, very strong booking quarter and notable in that was PLM although frankly, the strength was broad based. I think the key thing to remember is that PLM is really associated with preparing product data in engineering that will then subsequently be used in manufacturing and perhaps in aftermarket service and it's collecting data from supply chain partners and so forth, but production problems in a supply chain don't necessarily impede the collaboration during the engineering and the preparation for production process. So I think people are saying like, maybe I can't get chips to complete the product, but that doesn't mean I should stop designing the next one because if it does then I'll fall behind. So I think that, our view would be that the product development process has largely been unaffected by the supply chain process. Now, some other, we talked about how perhaps COVID had an impact on IoT. Perhaps the supply chain a little bit, although I think muted compared to COVID. So to me, the supply chain thing is fairly small factor in our results. We just see very little correlation between what's happening out there with supply chain problems and what's happening with our pipeline and frankly, with our bookings,\nOperator: Your next question comes from Yun Kim from Loop Capital. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nYun Kim: Hi, Jim. Can you just talk about IoT business in terms of the large deal activity, what kind of trends are you seeing there? Obviously, you are expecting that business to accelerate in the back half, second half of the year. If you can talk about whether that confidence is coming from the, improvement in the large activity, or is it just the overall volume of the activity around IoT and then also if you can just come in around deal size activity around the ARR business as well. Thanks.\nJames Heppelmann: Yeah I think deal sizes are sort of unchanged from previous trends. If, you think, what are we looking at when we project forward, how IoT and ARR will perform well, we're looking at the bookings. Let me say at the pipeline that will drive bookings and for IoT and ARR was quite strong. We're looking at the backlog. Last year bookings actually had improved over the prior year and bookings that went into backlog are what, I'm sorry, what we call deferred ARR were quite high. We were well ahead of our deferred plan number as we exited last year. So you could imagine we've got more, if you want to call it backlog waiting for us. And then what other initiatives are we doing? So for example, our DPM launch I think will be materially positive for our IoT results. It will drive bigger deals. It will drive better value propositions. It's really software that's ready to turn on and get value from as opposed to a platform. And then the other thing is Troy Richardson talked at our Investor Day about organizing better for cross sell. And I think if we look backwards, maybe we had pivoted too much towards new logos, which are great. New logos are a wonderful thing, but we probably have low hanging fruit yet to pick within our install base of CAD and PLM accounts. So I think it's really this combination of a strong looking pipeline, good looking trends, awaiting us in the deferred backlog and then these other initiatives kicking into place DPM and cross-sell but I think will all be very helpful as we proceed through the year. And again, I want to remind everybody, we set the expectation that the two handle would materialize in the back half of the year and that you wouldn't see it in Q1 and Q2. So we sort of feel like this was, as we had predicted just mid December a couple weeks ago,\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jason Celino from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJason Celino: So one question on maybe the fast Windchill, launch with seems like it's coming along nicely and we could see something maybe go GA this quarter. Have you had a chance to maybe, discuss this with customers, how's the pipeline shaving or is it maybe better to think that the pipeline might start to form once we do go live?\nJames Heppelmann: No, we for sure started talking about it with customers, ramping up that process, we got to educate a lot of people and they in turn have to educate customers, but we've certainly made some progress and I can tell you the customer interest is actually quite high. You should know that actually customers were pushing us a little bit to get going with such initiative. So, I feel like the demand is there, and in fact, again, just reflecting on what we told you, that business has been growing about 30% and Christian mentioned, we posted another quarter just like that without us really invoking the new strategy yet. So there's lots of demand. We're just looking for a model where we can promote the demand because we like the margin profile better and that's, what's coming into place here in Q2.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Adam Borg from Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAdam Borg: Great. Thanks so much. And maybe just two quick ones. Just on the Sheffler win that you announced yesterday and highlight on the call earlier, one of the things I thought was really interesting in the press release was this opportunity around some more vertical specific or market specific solutions targeting either automotive or industrial companies. So maybe Jim, you could just talk about that. And maybe just as a quick follow up just maybe for Christian, anyway, you could talk about this transit, it's great to hear the early feedback on the SaaS application efforts, but anyway to comment on how much this has contributed to bookings or the pipeline at least qualitatively. Thanks so much.\nJames Heppelmann: Yeah. I'll get the first part of the question, Chris, and you can take the second part. Yeah. So Sheffler is a great account and as I mentioned back in 2017, it appeared they were going a different direction and now they've decided to come back into the fold. And honestly, they did that for two main reasons. One is that they really want off the shelf technology, the other competitor had told them this low code, no code story and they tried that out and decided that's not really what they want. They don't want develop their own solutions. They want to deploy standard out of the box software that all works together. And then they wanna engage in partnerships with the vendor in this case, PTC to talk about how those solutions should evolve to be, more and more powerful to meet their needs. So, yeah, I'm very excited. I'm in the middle of that relationship myself and yeah, what's going to come out of that is technology that fits better and better, for example, for the automotive supply chain which is a place where we have a lot of customers. So it's a great win or win back, maybe I should say and a great partnership going forward, that's going to produce a lot more bit for us in years to come. And sorry, the second part of the question was around the transition to SaaS and how that's manifesting itself in terms of pipeline and activity. Is that right? Just making sure I got that right,\nAdam Borg: Exactly. Yeah. Any way to qualitatively comment from both, either bookings or a pipeline perspective.\nJames Heppelmann: Yeah, well remember, the bookings that we just reported were for Q1 and Q1 is really when we actually just announced the acceleration of it. So I would say there's actually limited impact in the actual bookings result here in Q1. That said, as I mentioned, we continue to see strong demand for the SaaS properties that we have. That's both in velocity and the digital thread and so those products continue to grow at a rate higher than our software only products. And, now a as the program is pushing ahead, we expect to see demand and pipeline generate, especially with the windshield -- with the new windshield launch coming out here and the program continuing to pick up speed internally.\nKristian Talvitie: Maybe Adam, I could just add, we launched this phase three strategy 90 days ago on the earnest call. And there's nothing we've seen since that makes us any less bullish than we were back then. It looks like a really nice opportunity for PTC and we're pushing forward ahead as aggressively as we can, because we'd like to bring that very upside growth driver, closer in. So it has a bigger impact on '23 and '24 and so forth than it would otherwise have had.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Okay. Thank you. Hello. Hi, Jim. Hi, Christian. Couple things with regard to the strength you noted for PLM at your partner conference six months ago, back in the summer management presented to the channel, your concept that PLM was no longer just an engineering vault that it was becoming a more, what you call multi-system multi-discipline concept. And the question is to what extent is that broader, more diverse view of PLM a current part of new business or in the pipeline for new business as compared to the more conventional historical way of of thinking about PLM? By our calculation, you were already the second largest brand by revenue in PLM and maybe talk about what some of the drivers are to that? And then just a quick clarification you referred earlier to cross sell at the Analyst Meeting last month in the slide deck you referred to cross sell 10 times and relatedly account based selling PTC has often over the years, talked about cross sell, but maybe talk about what's different this time in terms of resources and programs across your various segments in your new customer segmentation model.\nJames Heppelmann: Yeah. Well on your first question, Jay, you are always very pressy on, you've been watching this industry for a long time. When we say multi-system, multi-discipline, what we're really talking about is an enterprise system. And so what's happened in the last couple years is PLM has graduated from being an engineering data management system to being an enterprise system that contains the, it's the system of record for the product definition. And so if you're in manufacturing, well, you need to know the product definition. If you're in procurement, you need to know the product definition. If you're out on an installation or a support call, you probably need to know the product definition. So definitely what's happened is that the enterprise deployments of windshield are multiple times larger than the engineering deployments of windshield. So something that's been driving growth for some years now is that the new deals we're taking are more and more frequently enterprise deals in they're larger. You may remember last quarter, I told you we took the largest deal we had taken to date from a med device company. And the second thing that's happening is we're circling back to those companies who had deployed the engineering solution like Sheffler and we're up-selling them to the enterprise solution and turning that into a much bigger opportunity for us. So definitely that's a real thing and it's been driving the momentum we've seen in windshield for a year. And frankly, there's a lot of it out ahead of us. Even before we start talking about SaaS, the upsell from a departmental solution to an enterprise solution is a driver taking that whole enterprise solution to SaaS is a whole another growth driver, that's on top of that and sort of orthogonal to it. And then on the account based selling, there's two ways to look at that cross selling into your accounts is a great thing. You have established relationships it's much easier to sell another product to a existing customer than to sell a new product to a new customer or a first product to a new customer. At the same time, we like new logos. So it's really always about the balance of how much do you invest in new logos pursuits versus how much do you invest in selling more to the companies who know and trust you. And I think perhaps with IoT and ARR, we realized we had over pivoted toward new logo, which is just generally speaking, less productive selling, you might imagine. And so the reason we formed this Digital Thread growth, which brought CAD and PLM and IoT and ARR, together under Troy Richardson, was to really lubricate how these products work together and how we position them together, and to be able to start anywhere and sell up and down that chain. So it's a good strategy, it's one that we, it's a muscle we've developed. Well, over the years, we, we really built the windshield business largely by cross-selling to the Creo base. And I think this is going to be something that'll help us a lot, to kind of get the right balance of new logo pursuits in cross-sell.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ken Wong from Guggenheim Security Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nKen Wong: Thank you so much for taking my question. Jim or, or Christian. I wanted to perhaps dive into the double digit organic bookings growth couldn't help and notice you guys also had a very large service expansion deal with the air force because how much of that was already in expectations or did you get some, some boost there from timing shifts or anything of that nature?\nJames Heppelmann: Yeah, the let me, let me tell you, none of that actually contributed to the double digit growth because that was a Q4 deal. We released it when we had approval to release it and I commented on it because it was an important customer and so forth. And let me say that deal again, that was closed in Q4 both represented five years of extension, but also about a 50% growth in a ramp that happens over I think it's three years. So it roughly goes from a $10 million run rate to a $15 million run rate over three years and stays there for a couple more that's what the contract contemplates. So some of that will come into ARR in Q4 this year, but the bookings actually were in Q4 last year. So that strength the strength we saw in Q1 was exclusive of that air deal, which just means was really great strength. So, anyway it was hard to pin down where'd the strength come from because it came from CAD, it came from PLM, the the IoT number was actually pretty decent. It didn't all go into ARR. And then of course the velocity numbers and the FSG numbers. So it was broad based in all geographies and really in all product lines.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Matthew Broome from Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open\nMatthew Broome: So Jim I mean, just, I guess, just on that so just deal that I can just mention get given the importance of supply chain management right now, are you seeing like ramping demand to the solution elsewhere and following on from that, is there a chance that FSG AR growth could actually accelerate on the back of that demand beyond the sort of the mid single digit level and actually come sort of more strategic in a way?\nJames Heppelmann: Yeah, that's one of the points Matt that I brought up at the recent investor day is that we've generally modeled FSG to be roughly flat, flat well, plus 1%, 2%, but it's actually been performing, I think last year, Christian was at up 7% FSG and it was up 6% here again in Q1. So yeah, we're overperform and serve logistics is one of the key drivers. And then the second one probably is retail PLM, which has also been doing fairly well. So definitely, there's some, I think we'll be conservative and, and leave the FSG guidance where it is in the near term, but, I do like overperforming it because it's a growth driver. The FSG business is about the same size as the IoT and ARR business. So every point of growth we get there is pretty meaningful.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMatt Swanson: Yeah. Thanks. This is Matt Swanson on for Matt. I'll kind of follow up on a piece of, both Adam and Jay's questions. So looking at the Sheffler announcement, I think the thing I was really interested in was the idea around standardization and the idea around end to end. So could you talk a little bit about your customer's desire around standardization and, clearly this product roadmap has really expanded your TAM, but I think one of the upside areas, something we, maybe the holy grail of the transition would be more competitive displacement. And I'm just curious if you're starting to hear, any early or more talk around that because you're building something so differentiated?\nJames Heppelmann: Yeah. for sure. So the standard thing, I think maybe over the last couple years industrial companies have realized that they should be using software and not developing it. And so we saw this in our IoT business, and it's been why we've been heading up the stack with solutions like DPM is customers would like to buy the software and use it, not buy some kind of a platform and create it, because they just don't really know how to create it if I'm frank. So Sheffler had gone down the path of kind of like I said, low code environments and came back to standard products and then they end to end thing, for sure the CAD data that's created in Creo and managed in windshield, gets used, for example, in augmented reality manufacturing and service instructions, much later and in a different part of the company, if it's all well managed and that connectivity from IoT, well, let's say from CAD to PLM to IoT to AR is what we call the digital thread. And so we actually see so much interest in this that we kind of organized around that principle. Let's stop presenting these products as kind of independent things and let's shine a light on how well they work together in an end to end solution. And by the way, how they're all ready to go that this is something you just turn on and use. And that's really what one Sheffler over, but I can tell you Sheffler is not unique at all and it's really we're organizing to respond to that. SaaS is helpful by the way, because if you want a lot of technology working end to end, it'd be better not to ship it all to the customer site because it gets complicated. The customer would like to just use it, not, set it all up and care and feed for it on, on premise.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Saket Kalia from Barclays Capital. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nQ - : Okay, great. Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question here. Hey Jim, Hey Jim, maybe, Hey Christian, Jim, maybe for you. it was great to hear the PLM strength this quarter in bookings. with other companies that have done shifts like this, there's always a risk, I guess, of customers behaving differently, right? Whether that's slowing purchases to see what's coming or maybe pulling forward purchases before something new comes out now. Now just to be clear, it doesn't sound like that happened here, but can you just stress test that for us a little bit and what you sort of look at to sort of manage what is, more choices for our customer to make. Does, that make sense?\nJames Heppelmann: Yeah. Are you referring just let me clarify, are you referring to like SaaS choices being new choices or..\nQ - : Yeah, that's right. Windshield, no windshield specifically.\nJames Heppelmann: Yeah So, keep in mind Saket, we have been selling wind shell as SaaS for some time. Remember the phase one phase two phase three thing. So since phase one, we've been selling wind shell and we showed you it's got a three year growth CAGR of 30% in SaaS. So the customer demand is strong. It's just on the PTC side. We need to pivot to multi-tenant because in the single tenant model, we just don't have the profitability we like. So the demand is strong, the customers are buying it. Christian mentioned we had another strong quarter. So it really is we'd like to meet that demand with a solution that's more efficient for us to operate on behalf of the customer. And that's what phase three multi-tenant really is all about. Now, when it becomes more efficient for us, we can then lean in on the promotion and marketing of it because we haven't really done that. So we've been servicing demand, not driving it and with phase three, we think there's an opportunity to drive demand and the preliminary data we've seen this quarter suggest customers are very responsive, both to buying new systems that way, but also to lifting and shifting the previous systems they bought and giving them to us to operate and serve back to them in a SaaS model.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Joe Vruwink from Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJoe Vruwink: Great. Hi, everyone. Just to go back to bookings, does the strength of score absent mega deals suggest anything about either the demand environments or maybe just the health of your mid-market and SMB customers and looking ahead, are there going to be certain things you think about or track when contemplating the probability of more mega deals or maybe the larger ARR contributors for PTC, maybe, being a bit more represented in future bookings?\nJames Heppelmann: Christian, let me again, take a stab at that and maybe you'll find things to add. So I think if you look at the bookings again, they were phenomenal and it's hard to pin down. It wasn't one geography, it wasn't one product, it was all geographies, all products. So I think it tells us that the end market is very healthy. And I would say for two different reasons. On one hand, the PMIs are in good shape. That's helpful. On the other hand the interest they have in the digital thread, digital transformation story in the interest they have in SaaS is secular. That interest is not related to the PMIs. It's kind of independent of them and so I think that we're just in a very healthy situation where industrial companies are leaning in on trying to get more digital. They see PTC as having a fairly unique and compelling portfolio and their interest in engaging and trying to make their companies more efficient. I can tell that Sheffler, for example, it's one of the top initiatives in the company is to get more digital and as it relates to the whole product life cycle, the partners PTC, and we see that kind of phenomenon happening in a lot of places in the industrial world. So I think it's just good, strong secular and as well, macro environment out there right now. But I'll remind you that we've had good performance, even when the macro environment wasn't so strong. So all things being equal, I like the strong macro, but we're 17 quarters in with double digit growth in the core business. And there were a lot of bad macro quarters over the course of those 17. So I think it really is the secular driver Kristian, do you want to take?\nKristian Talvitie: Yeah. I agree with all that. Actually just on the big deal dynamic, what we used to call mega deals. We haven't -- I think we've had four in the past four years.\nJames Heppelmann: Yeah. Well, keep in mind, perpetual drove bigger upfront purchases. That's right and subscription or SaaS tends not to.\nKristian Talvitie: Yeah. Which is my point that we've been seeing good strong bookings performance and bookings growth, even with the absence of what used to be a fairly regular occurrence back in the perpetual days. Like we really don't see a lot of those.\nJames Heppelmann: Yeah. It's good. Healthy business. Okay. Next question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Blair Abernethy from Rosenblatt Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBlair Abernethy: Thanks very much. Guys, just maybe a quick question on around partnerships in particular, if you just give us a little a little deeper dive into how things are going with Rockwell and as well on the simulation side with Ansys.\nJames Heppelmann: Yeah. So the state of the partner economy is good and Microsoft, I could put on that list is also strong. With Rockwell you'll remember in the past quarters I had said we should take a bit of a conservative posture as it relates to what Rockwell would contribute to PDCs numbers here in fiscal '22 and we did that because Rockwell had made a big acquisition. Rockwell never completely agreed with me on that. Their own public commentary kind of indicated they didn't worry too much about that. And in Q1 we're right. So we're pleased to see that Rockwell's contribution was solid in Q1 and starting to feel pretty good about the year. I'll tell you one thing is this DPM solution appears to be a very good fit with Rockwell. And in fact, their Calypso alarm is probably lined up to be our strongest partner in promoting DPM. So we're, very happy with that. Calypso has a long term relationship with PTC that even predates their acquisition by Rockwell. So great alignment around DPM. Again, DPM is a high value up to stack solution that drives bigger deal sizes and we think will be a very sticky solution. So lots of optimism around that. With Ansys, we continue to differentiate now with best in class simulation. So, whereas simulation, some years back, would've been viewed as a soft spot for PTC. Now it's a strength, if we're competing against Autodesk or Siemens or [indiscernible]. Nobody's going to have a better simulation story than PTC because nobody has a better simulation story than Ansys and Ansys products are built into PTC products. So that's been going well. And then of course, with Microsoft, that partnership is performing well and poised to get a lot bigger because as we bring more stuff aggressively to SaaS, a whole lot of that is going to land on Azure. So I think all three partnerships are alive and well, and as important as ever and, helping us achieve the kind of results that we're achieving.\nOperator: Your last question comes from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Please call ahead. Your line is open.\nSterling Auty: Yeah. Thanks. Hi guys. Just wondering if you could characterize with the headcount changes that you pointed out are necessary to facilitate the acceleration to SaaS, where are you in that process what's left to go and kind of what's the timeframe that you expect to complete that over?\nJames Heppelmann: Yeah. Christian, I'm thinking the numbers were largely done, but not completely 80%, 90% done.\nKristian Talvitie: Exiting.\nJames Heppelmann: Yeah. we'll be hiring people throughout the year, so, but in terms of the people who are exiting they're largely exited by now that largely happened within the first quarter.\nOperator: We have no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Jim Heppelmann for closing remarks.\nJames Heppelmann: Okay. Well thank you all. There's a lot of good -- lot of good questions and I think good answers because the business is performing very well right now. ARR is doing well. Bookings are doing well. Free cash is doing well. I think we executed through good times and bad. We executed through the changes we made over the last quarter and we're set up to do pretty well for the balance of the year. So we very confident and look forward to talking to you all in 90 days. If we don't happen to cross paths with you sooner in an investor event or what have you. So thanks a lot for joining us and have a good evening.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kristian Talvitie",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our results, I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance and growth rate references will be in both constant currency and at as reported rates. So turning to Slide 17, we delivered constant currency, ARR of $1.507 billion, which is 16% growth year over year, and slightly exceeded our Q1 guidance of $1.5 billion. On an organic constant currency basis, this is 11% growth. FX was an approximate $11 million headwind in Q1. So our as reported ARR was $1.496 billion. Our SaaS products in both the Digital Thread and Velocity business units saw continued strong growth in Q1 with growth rates, similar to what we discussed at our recent Investor Day. This is in combination with continued strong growth of our software-only sales. As of Q1, our SaaS portfolio is now 15% of our total ARR on a constant currency basis. Q1 free cash flow of $134 million grew 21% year-over-year and includes $11 million in restructuring and other related payments. Adjusted free cash flow was $145 million and was slightly ahead of the $140 million we discussed at our Investor Day. Q1 revenue of $458 million increased 7% year-over-year. As we've discussed, previously, revenue is impacted by ASC 606. So we do not believe that revenue growth rates are indicative of our underlying business performance, but would rather guide you to ARR as the best metric to understand our topline performance and cash collections. FX only impacted revenue by about $1 million in Q1. So our revenue on a constant currency basis was $459 million.# Q1 non-GAAP operating margin of 35% compared to 36% in Q1 of 2021. While, this is a strong result, it's still worth pointing out that because revenue is impacted by ASC 606, other derivative metrics such as gross margin, operating margin and EPS are all also impacted. Suffice it to say that our cogs and OpEx came in, in line with our expectations in Q1, and we continue to maintain good discipline on our operating expense structure. I would like to point out that our GAAP results reflect a gain of $9.8 million related to our investment in Matterport and we're also slightly reducing the range for expected PNL charges from approximately $45 million to $50 million down to $40 million to $45 million for the full year and coincidentally, we're also reducing the range of expected cash payments for the restructuring and other from what was previously $50 million to $55 million down to $45 million to $50 million for the full year. For guidance purposes, we will continue to show $50 million as the cash payments in the adjusted free cash flow reconciliation. But if payments come in lower, then we would just expect actual free cash flow to come in higher. There's no change to the $450 million adjusted free cash flow target. Moving to Slide 18, I'll begin with our balance sheet. We ended Q1 with cash and cash equivalent of $296 million. In addition, at the end of Q1, we had medium term investments of $87 million primarily related to our investment in Matterport. Our gross debt was $1.45 billion with an aggregate interest rate of about 3.2%. In Q1, we used $120 million of cash to repurchase shares. We also had an additional $5 million of repurchases, which settled early in Q2. For the remainder of fiscal '22, we will focus on de-levering and looking forward to FY '23 in an ongoing go-forward basis assuming our debt to EBITDA ratio was below three times, we will continue to target to return approximately 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases. Turning to Slide 19. We post a data table to our IR website that has our financial statements, as well as ARR detail by segment. In that file, we share both constant currency and as reported ARR, as a reminder, when we calculate constant currency, we use our current year plan FX rates and restate history to the same rates. So here, for example, on this slide, you can see our Q1 constant currency, ARR of $1.507 billion, and the actual as reported ARR of $1.496 billion. This is important to remember in the context of our guidance because we provide guidance at the plan rate. We believe this is the best way to evaluate the top line performance of our business because it removes FX fluctuations from the analysis positive or negative. With that, I'll move on to guidance on Slide 20. As Jim mentioned, we're raising the low end of our full year constant currency ARR guidance by $10 million. The new range is now $1.625 billion to $1.660 billion. This essentially reflects rolling our Q1 over performance through the remainder of the year. We're now expecting constant currency ARR growth of 11% to 13% in fiscal '22. It's worth pointing out that based on FX rates, at the end of Q1, we would expect a $13 million headwind against that full year ARR guidance. For Q2, we're setting constant currency ARR guidance of $1.540 billion to $1.550 billion. This is 12% organic constant currency growth at the midpoint. On an as reported basis, the FX impact we're calculating based on the FX rates at the end of Q1 is a $12 million headwind in Q2 compared to the constant currency guidance. Moving to free cash flow, we're maintaining our full year free cash flow target of $400 million. This includes approximately $50 million of restructure and acquisition related payments. The majority of these payments are related to the reorganization we announced in Q1 with some residual payments, primarily related to our C port move for which we took the accounting charge in prior periods. So our adjusted free cash flow target for fiscal '22 remains $450 million. Fiscal Q2 adjusted free cash flow is expected to be approximately $155 million. We expect to make approximately $20 million in restructuring and other related payments in Q2 bringing our free cash flow to approximately $135 million. Moving to revenue, we're also taking the low end of the full year revenue guidance up by $20 million. This reflects both the strength in software and strength in the professional services business that we saw in Q1 and the related forecasts for the full year. So for fiscal '22, our new revenue guidance range is $1.870 billion to $1.975 billion. The year-over-year growth rate range is now 3% to 9%. ASE 606 makes revenue very difficult to predict for on premise subscription companies hence the wide range. Note that revenue variability has -- from 606 has no impact on ARR or its related cash generation as we continue to primarily bill customers annually upfront, regardless of term length. We continue to expect more than 60% of our annual free cash flow generation to occur in the first half of the year, collections are stronger in the first half and we expect expenses to increase as we ramp hiring in our SaaS investments throughout the year. Wrapping up on Slide 21 with the free cash flow model that we use and went into some depth on at our recent Investor Day that you can see here, I know many of you use model three cash flow using the indirect method. However, given the complexities related to revenue recognition due to 606, this is difficult to do. The model we show here has proven quite effective. The table shows fiscal '21 actuals compared to the model we shared at Investor Day compared to our current guidance. Let me take you through the model, focusing on the non-GAAP column on the right and starting at the top. First, we're showing the midpoint of our as reported ARR guidance of $1.630 billion which is different from the constant currency guidance that we gave due to the $13 million FX headwind and is also $5 million lower than what we showed at the Investor Day. We use as reported here because it's a better reflection of the cash we expect to generate. You can also see that we have increased the perpetual license revenue forecast slightly, and also the professional services revenue increase that we mentioned earlier. Cogs is slightly higher reflecting the increased cost to deliver the incremental professional services revenue, and the rest of the assumptions remain the same and we still end up with our target adjusted free cash flow of $450 million. Obviously this is a model based on assumptions, such as the midpoint of the ARR range, the impact of FX, the pace of hiring, etcetera. So if some of those variables change, which they invariably will, the model will have to be adjusted accordingly and as I mentioned earlier, if cash payments related to the restructuring, come in at the low end of the range, we would see a flip from the restructuring line to the free cash flow line, but the adjusted free cash flow target would remain unchanged. But as we sit here today, we think this is a reasonable view of how we expect the year to shape up. So with that I'll turn the call over to the operator and we can begin Q&A. Maybe Adam, I could just add, we launched this phase three strategy 90 days ago on the earnest call. And there's nothing we've seen since that makes us any less bullish than we were back then. It looks like a really nice opportunity for PTC and we're pushing forward ahead as aggressively as we can, because we'd like to bring that very upside growth driver, closer in. So it has a bigger impact on '23 and '24 and so forth than it would otherwise have had. Yeah. I agree with all that. Actually just on the big deal dynamic, what we used to call mega deals. We haven't -- I think we've had four in the past four years. Yeah. Which is my point that we've been seeing good strong bookings performance and bookings growth, even with the absence of what used to be a fairly regular occurrence back in the perpetual days. Like we really don't see a lot of those. Exiting."

            "name": "James Heppelmann",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt, good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. Turning to slide three, I'm pleased to share that PTC delivered another strong financial performance in fiscal Q1. We executed very well building on the momentum we saw in Q4. To simplify things, please note that throughout my prepared commentary, I will only discuss growth rates in constant currency. ARR came in at $1.507 billion, which was better than the $1.5 billion we had guided to at the recent Investor Day. that represents 16% growth, 11% of which was organic. Adjusted free cash flow was also strong at $145 million, which was up 20% year-over-year and better than the $140 million expectation we set at the Investor Day. We're off to a very strong start in fiscal 2022. Turning to Slide four, of particular note was our booking strength. Bookings were up double digits organically and high teens overall against the very strong COVID bounce back quarter we saw in Q1 of fiscal '21, when bookings grew more than 30% over the prior year. To put it in perspective, given the tough comparison against Q1 of last year, we had planned bookings to actually be down slightly inclusive of Arena. So this performance was more than 20% above plan. I know that some analysts and investors had voiced concern that the restructuring work we did in late Q4 and throughout Q1 would distract us, but obviously we didn't see that. The strength was broad based across direct sales and resellers and was achieved with no mega deals. Rockwell came in ahead of their part of our plan too, which was great to see and suggest my concerns of them being distracted may prove overstated. Arena contributed the inorganic element of bookings growth with another strong bookings quarter coming in above plan as well. With the Arena acquisition getting round tripped here in Q2, Arena becomes part of the organic results going forward and their low twenties growth rate will then add another tailwind to the organic results. Arena's been a great acquisition. Bookings growth was particularly strong in PLM and in both Europe and Americas. From a macro perspective, global PMIs remain in expansion territory while digital transformation in SaaS continue to grow an importance as secular drivers. The interest in digital transformation in SaaS has been driving strong bookings for what is very sticky software, which when layered into a recurring revenue model that is atypical of industry peers has allowed PTC to deliver performance in excess of market growth rates. This happened right through the pandemic, especially in the large core business that represents about 70% of our ARR and we fully expected to continue going forward. These factors gave us to raise the lower end of our ARR guidance range, which at the new midpoint basically means we rolled our Q1 beat forward. Now let's take a look at the ARR performance by geography on Slide five, before turning to business units. In Q1, we saw strong ARR performance across all geographies. Our ARR growth in the Americas was 19%. All product segments grew with key growth drivers being the acquired arena contribution and the velocity business unit overall layered on top of another strong quarter in the core CAD and PLM business. In Europe, our ARR growth was 13%. We saw strong results across the board in Europe, with the strongest drivers of the growth being our Digital Thread growth and core businesses. Europe has the largest mix of channel versus direct and the resellers continue to perform well. Our ARR growth in APAC was 14% with growth, primarily driven by our Digital Thread core business. Next, let's take a look at the ARR performance of our various business units, starting with the Digital Thread group on Slide six. In our largest product segment, Digital Thread core, we delivered yet another double digit performance in Q1 with 11% growth. Within this, CAD and PLM both grew double digits with strong growth across all three geographies. This is the 17th consecutive quarter of double digit ARR growth in the core business and as we roll out our more aggressive SaaS strategy, I expect we'll see many more. In the Digital Thread growth, which is IoT and AR, we saw ARR growth of about 14% consistent across both elements. This was in line with our plan and the mid-teens near term growth expectation we set at the recent Investor Day. While this level of growth remains accretive to company growth, we continue to expect an acceleration of growth into the twenties as we get into the back half of the year. The biggest driver of growth in Q1 was from expansions, especially in Europe and APAC. We believe market conditions in IoT improving, and we like the way the pipeline for a new DPM offering is developing through both PTC and Rockwell channels. For AR, we continue to see a tremendous level of interest, but the market remains nascent. Perhaps most importantly, the formation of the Digital Thread business unit at the start of F Y '22 has driven important initiatives to increase our focus on cross-selling of IoT and AR into the core CAD and PLM customer base. FSG had a great Q1 with 6% ARR growth. The expansion deal we recently announced with the US Air Force, both increases and extends this key relationship for up to five more years. Contracts like this demonstrate the value that our customers are realizing from served logistics and other FSG products, such as retail PLM and ALM. You may remember I noted at our Investor Day that having FSG grow in the mid single digits rather than flat would be a helpful upside growth driver. So I'm pleased to see FSG post another strong quarter. Let me run through a couple of quick customer anecdote to give you a sense for our Digital Thread customers and how they rely on us. On Slide seven MAN Energy Solutions is the world's top provider of large bore engines and turbo machinery for the maritime and energy industries. The company manufactures complex parts and nearly every engine they make must meet unique customer requirements. Before implementing Creo, they relied on manual outdated processes that slowed design and production. With Creo, they've been able to transition from 2D to a full 3D model-based approach. Creo's broad range of toolpath automation capabilities enable them to save time in the programming of the tool pass used to machine the large complex engine parts greatly increasing efficiency in transitioning from design to production. Turning to Slide eight, you may have noticed we announced a deal with the -- we announced that the German company Sheffler has expanded its relationship with PTC and I'd like to share a bit of the backstory. Sheffler has been a long time Creo customer and has successfully deployed wind Welsh within engineering. But back in 2017, one of our PLM competitors announced large PLM deal with Sheffler that appeared to cap PTCs expansion opportunity. But that system didn't ultimately stick as Sheffler has now decided to consolidate on PTC systems with Welsh [ph] being the backbone and is broadly deploying our solutions in their standard out of the box fashion so that Sheffler can participate in the full power of our Digital Thread portfolio. I'm very excited about this collaboration and the further expansion that Sheffler is exploring with our IoT and ARR offerings. On Slide nine, you'll see how EMA [ph] Group a global business that delivers packaging machines, services, and solutions to a wide variety of industries was looking for a way to expand their control room offering to help their customers improve overall equipment effectiveness and reduce downtime. As long-time users of PTCs Creo and windshield, EMA decided that ThingWorx was the ideal IoT solution for their initiative, and that Kepware could provide connectivity only to their machines, but to the other vendor's machines deployed alongside them. EMA has successfully launched new revenue streams by enabling 24 7 monitoring of customer production lines and improved OEE by up to 16%. Euphoria integrated with ThingWorxs is the platform of choice for the US Air Force training initiatives. Slide 10 highlights the work that PTC partner Vektrona has done with the US Air Force. With finite training resources and limited capacity, the US Air Force set out to incorporate augmented reality into their maintenance and munitions training. Vektrona using [indiscernible] studio worked with US Air Force to create immersive 3D AR experiences for phones, tablets and the HoloLens 2, that are designed to accelerate learning, improve work performance and facilitate remote training. The improved training shows better engagement and information retention with continuous and repeatable task training available regardless of the system or aircraft type. Turning to Slide 11, the velocity we use ARR growth in Q1 was more than 650% due to the inclusion of Arena and 53% organically, which would be on shape. If you were to add Arena's pre-acquisition results into the prior year to get a better pro forma comparison, then you'd have the velocity business unit growing at 28% in Q1. That 28% is a mix of Onshape growing at 53% in the large Arena business growing in the low twenties. Growth of both Onshape and Arena is multiple times higher than market rates clearly demonstrating that industrial companies see the benefits of SaaS. We continue to ramp investments to expand technology leadership and to broaden the geographic presence of our Velocity businesses. On Slide 12, Beta Technologies, a leading developer of next generation electric aircraft for the cargo and logistics market, sought a cloud native product development platform where everyone would be working with one single source of truth without the workflow restrictions of traditional file based design systems. Beta turned to Onshape because of how it enables real time collaboration, allowing the engineering team to work from any location while streamlining their communications during the design process. To profile an Arena customer, Potrero Medical on Slide 13 is a predictive health company developing the next generation of medical devices, leveraging smart sensors and artificial intelligence. Potrero needed a scalable quality management system to support its growing product development and compliance needs, including satisfying FDA audit requirements. Arena was the right solution offering a cloud native QMS with a quick implementation, leading to ECO cycle time reduction of 30% and non-conformance improvement of 20%. As a final topic, I'd like to give you a quick update on our SaaS acceleration initiative on Slide 14, we've made tremendous progress in the past 90 days since we announced the more aggressive strategy. We've launched our SaaS program management office, which was modeled after the very successful approach we used to drive our subscription transition several years back. Our field organizations transitioned to the new two in a box customer success organization model without missing a beat. We converged our cloud and tech support organizations with product development to deploy the DevOps type of approach you see in virtually all SaaS companies. We've made good progress advancing our offerings, especially the windshield multi-tenant version, which will go into production shortly this quarter and we made good progress preparing the SaaS conversion offerings that will power the hundreds of lift and shifts that will happen in the coming quarters and years. We have more work to do, but we're certainly off and running. The time for SaaS has arrived in our industry and PTC is very well positioned. We're already the SaaS leader in our space with continued strong SaaS growth in windshield and FSG and high levels of growth in our cloud native Velocity Business unit. Sharing the Atlas SaaS platform, we have a dual strategy to win with Onshape and arena powering a new agile product development approach while we transition our Digital Thread portfolio and existing customer base to SaaS, to elevate the platform strategies that so many larger companies have. To wrap up on Slide 15, I'm pleased with PTC's position and the opportunity that lies ahead. Q1 gave us a strong start to what we expect to be our fifth consecutive year of double digit ARR growth. Our portfolio of products is unique and compelling and obviously aligns well to customer demand. Our results have been consistently strong for many quarters, but we're poised to accelerate growth as the SaaS tailwind blows harder in coming quarters and as we gain more momentum with our IoT and ARR initiatives in the back half of the year. We're poised to drive higher levels of profitability too following the organizational changes we've already implemented and as our start-up businesses continue to mature up their J-curves [ph]. The company has never been in a better position to create shareholder value. With that, I'll turn it over to Kristian for more details on the financial results. Andrew it's Jim? No, actually it's not really, it's not really a frequent topic in our conversations because well, first of all, since you said you missed the first minutes, one of the things I pointed out is that our bookings came in very, very strong and I explained about 20% higher than plan. So we had a very, very strong booking quarter and notable in that was PLM although frankly, the strength was broad based. I think the key thing to remember is that PLM is really associated with preparing product data in engineering that will then subsequently be used in manufacturing and perhaps in aftermarket service and it's collecting data from supply chain partners and so forth, but production problems in a supply chain don't necessarily impede the collaboration during the engineering and the preparation for production process. So I think people are saying like, maybe I can't get chips to complete the product, but that doesn't mean I should stop designing the next one because if it does then I'll fall behind. So I think that, our view would be that the product development process has largely been unaffected by the supply chain process. Now, some other, we talked about how perhaps COVID had an impact on IoT. Perhaps the supply chain a little bit, although I think muted compared to COVID. So to me, the supply chain thing is fairly small factor in our results. We just see very little correlation between what's happening out there with supply chain problems and what's happening with our pipeline and frankly, with our bookings, Yeah I think deal sizes are sort of unchanged from previous trends. If, you think, what are we looking at when we project forward, how IoT and ARR will perform well, we're looking at the bookings. Let me say at the pipeline that will drive bookings and for IoT and ARR was quite strong. We're looking at the backlog. Last year bookings actually had improved over the prior year and bookings that went into backlog are what, I'm sorry, what we call deferred ARR were quite high. We were well ahead of our deferred plan number as we exited last year. So you could imagine we've got more, if you want to call it backlog waiting for us. And then what other initiatives are we doing? So for example, our DPM launch I think will be materially positive for our IoT results. It will drive bigger deals. It will drive better value propositions. It's really software that's ready to turn on and get value from as opposed to a platform. And then the other thing is Troy Richardson talked at our Investor Day about organizing better for cross sell. And I think if we look backwards, maybe we had pivoted too much towards new logos, which are great. New logos are a wonderful thing, but we probably have low hanging fruit yet to pick within our install base of CAD and PLM accounts. So I think it's really this combination of a strong looking pipeline, good looking trends, awaiting us in the deferred backlog and then these other initiatives kicking into place DPM and cross-sell but I think will all be very helpful as we proceed through the year. And again, I want to remind everybody, we set the expectation that the two handle would materialize in the back half of the year and that you wouldn't see it in Q1 and Q2. So we sort of feel like this was, as we had predicted just mid December a couple weeks ago, No, we for sure started talking about it with customers, ramping up that process, we got to educate a lot of people and they in turn have to educate customers, but we've certainly made some progress and I can tell you the customer interest is actually quite high. You should know that actually customers were pushing us a little bit to get going with such initiative. So, I feel like the demand is there, and in fact, again, just reflecting on what we told you, that business has been growing about 30% and Christian mentioned, we posted another quarter just like that without us really invoking the new strategy yet. So there's lots of demand. We're just looking for a model where we can promote the demand because we like the margin profile better and that's, what's coming into place here in Q2. Yeah. I'll get the first part of the question, Chris, and you can take the second part. Yeah. So Sheffler is a great account and as I mentioned back in 2017, it appeared they were going a different direction and now they've decided to come back into the fold. And honestly, they did that for two main reasons. One is that they really want off the shelf technology, the other competitor had told them this low code, no code story and they tried that out and decided that's not really what they want. They don't want develop their own solutions. They want to deploy standard out of the box software that all works together. And then they wanna engage in partnerships with the vendor in this case, PTC to talk about how those solutions should evolve to be, more and more powerful to meet their needs. So, yeah, I'm very excited. I'm in the middle of that relationship myself and yeah, what's going to come out of that is technology that fits better and better, for example, for the automotive supply chain which is a place where we have a lot of customers. So it's a great win or win back, maybe I should say and a great partnership going forward, that's going to produce a lot more bit for us in years to come. And sorry, the second part of the question was around the transition to SaaS and how that's manifesting itself in terms of pipeline and activity. Is that right? Just making sure I got that right, Yeah, well remember, the bookings that we just reported were for Q1 and Q1 is really when we actually just announced the acceleration of it. So I would say there's actually limited impact in the actual bookings result here in Q1. That said, as I mentioned, we continue to see strong demand for the SaaS properties that we have. That's both in velocity and the digital thread and so those products continue to grow at a rate higher than our software only products. And, now a as the program is pushing ahead, we expect to see demand and pipeline generate, especially with the windshield -- with the new windshield launch coming out here and the program continuing to pick up speed internally. Yeah. Well on your first question, Jay, you are always very pressy on, you've been watching this industry for a long time. When we say multi-system, multi-discipline, what we're really talking about is an enterprise system. And so what's happened in the last couple years is PLM has graduated from being an engineering data management system to being an enterprise system that contains the, it's the system of record for the product definition. And so if you're in manufacturing, well, you need to know the product definition. If you're in procurement, you need to know the product definition. If you're out on an installation or a support call, you probably need to know the product definition. So definitely what's happened is that the enterprise deployments of windshield are multiple times larger than the engineering deployments of windshield. So something that's been driving growth for some years now is that the new deals we're taking are more and more frequently enterprise deals in they're larger. You may remember last quarter, I told you we took the largest deal we had taken to date from a med device company. And the second thing that's happening is we're circling back to those companies who had deployed the engineering solution like Sheffler and we're up-selling them to the enterprise solution and turning that into a much bigger opportunity for us. So definitely that's a real thing and it's been driving the momentum we've seen in windshield for a year. And frankly, there's a lot of it out ahead of us. Even before we start talking about SaaS, the upsell from a departmental solution to an enterprise solution is a driver taking that whole enterprise solution to SaaS is a whole another growth driver, that's on top of that and sort of orthogonal to it. And then on the account based selling, there's two ways to look at that cross selling into your accounts is a great thing. You have established relationships it's much easier to sell another product to a existing customer than to sell a new product to a new customer or a first product to a new customer. At the same time, we like new logos. So it's really always about the balance of how much do you invest in new logos pursuits versus how much do you invest in selling more to the companies who know and trust you. And I think perhaps with IoT and ARR, we realized we had over pivoted toward new logo, which is just generally speaking, less productive selling, you might imagine. And so the reason we formed this Digital Thread growth, which brought CAD and PLM and IoT and ARR, together under Troy Richardson, was to really lubricate how these products work together and how we position them together, and to be able to start anywhere and sell up and down that chain. So it's a good strategy, it's one that we, it's a muscle we've developed. Well, over the years, we, we really built the windshield business largely by cross-selling to the Creo base. And I think this is going to be something that'll help us a lot, to kind of get the right balance of new logo pursuits in cross-sell. Yeah, the let me, let me tell you, none of that actually contributed to the double digit growth because that was a Q4 deal. We released it when we had approval to release it and I commented on it because it was an important customer and so forth. And let me say that deal again, that was closed in Q4 both represented five years of extension, but also about a 50% growth in a ramp that happens over I think it's three years. So it roughly goes from a $10 million run rate to a $15 million run rate over three years and stays there for a couple more that's what the contract contemplates. So some of that will come into ARR in Q4 this year, but the bookings actually were in Q4 last year. So that strength the strength we saw in Q1 was exclusive of that air deal, which just means was really great strength. So, anyway it was hard to pin down where'd the strength come from because it came from CAD, it came from PLM, the the IoT number was actually pretty decent. It didn't all go into ARR. And then of course the velocity numbers and the FSG numbers. So it was broad based in all geographies and really in all product lines. Yeah, that's one of the points Matt that I brought up at the recent investor day is that we've generally modeled FSG to be roughly flat, flat well, plus 1%, 2%, but it's actually been performing, I think last year, Christian was at up 7% FSG and it was up 6% here again in Q1. So yeah, we're overperform and serve logistics is one of the key drivers. And then the second one probably is retail PLM, which has also been doing fairly well. So definitely, there's some, I think we'll be conservative and, and leave the FSG guidance where it is in the near term, but, I do like overperforming it because it's a growth driver. The FSG business is about the same size as the IoT and ARR business. So every point of growth we get there is pretty meaningful. Yeah. for sure. So the standard thing, I think maybe over the last couple years industrial companies have realized that they should be using software and not developing it. And so we saw this in our IoT business, and it's been why we've been heading up the stack with solutions like DPM is customers would like to buy the software and use it, not buy some kind of a platform and create it, because they just don't really know how to create it if I'm frank. So Sheffler had gone down the path of kind of like I said, low code environments and came back to standard products and then they end to end thing, for sure the CAD data that's created in Creo and managed in windshield, gets used, for example, in augmented reality manufacturing and service instructions, much later and in a different part of the company, if it's all well managed and that connectivity from IoT, well, let's say from CAD to PLM to IoT to AR is what we call the digital thread. And so we actually see so much interest in this that we kind of organized around that principle. Let's stop presenting these products as kind of independent things and let's shine a light on how well they work together in an end to end solution. And by the way, how they're all ready to go that this is something you just turn on and use. And that's really what one Sheffler over, but I can tell you Sheffler is not unique at all and it's really we're organizing to respond to that. SaaS is helpful by the way, because if you want a lot of technology working end to end, it'd be better not to ship it all to the customer site because it gets complicated. The customer would like to just use it, not, set it all up and care and feed for it on, on premise. Yeah. Are you referring just let me clarify, are you referring to like SaaS choices being new choices or.. Yeah So, keep in mind Saket, we have been selling wind shell as SaaS for some time. Remember the phase one phase two phase three thing. So since phase one, we've been selling wind shell and we showed you it's got a three year growth CAGR of 30% in SaaS. So the customer demand is strong. It's just on the PTC side. We need to pivot to multi-tenant because in the single tenant model, we just don't have the profitability we like. So the demand is strong, the customers are buying it. Christian mentioned we had another strong quarter. So it really is we'd like to meet that demand with a solution that's more efficient for us to operate on behalf of the customer. And that's what phase three multi-tenant really is all about. Now, when it becomes more efficient for us, we can then lean in on the promotion and marketing of it because we haven't really done that. So we've been servicing demand, not driving it and with phase three, we think there's an opportunity to drive demand and the preliminary data we've seen this quarter suggest customers are very responsive, both to buying new systems that way, but also to lifting and shifting the previous systems they bought and giving them to us to operate and serve back to them in a SaaS model. Christian, let me again, take a stab at that and maybe you'll find things to add. So I think if you look at the bookings again, they were phenomenal and it's hard to pin down. It wasn't one geography, it wasn't one product, it was all geographies, all products. So I think it tells us that the end market is very healthy. And I would say for two different reasons. On one hand, the PMIs are in good shape. That's helpful. On the other hand the interest they have in the digital thread, digital transformation story in the interest they have in SaaS is secular. That interest is not related to the PMIs. It's kind of independent of them and so I think that we're just in a very healthy situation where industrial companies are leaning in on trying to get more digital. They see PTC as having a fairly unique and compelling portfolio and their interest in engaging and trying to make their companies more efficient. I can tell that Sheffler, for example, it's one of the top initiatives in the company is to get more digital and as it relates to the whole product life cycle, the partners PTC, and we see that kind of phenomenon happening in a lot of places in the industrial world. So I think it's just good, strong secular and as well, macro environment out there right now. But I'll remind you that we've had good performance, even when the macro environment wasn't so strong. So all things being equal, I like the strong macro, but we're 17 quarters in with double digit growth in the core business. And there were a lot of bad macro quarters over the course of those 17. So I think it really is the secular driver Kristian, do you want to take? Yeah. Well, keep in mind, perpetual drove bigger upfront purchases. That's right and subscription or SaaS tends not to. Yeah. It's good. Healthy business. Okay. Next question. Yeah. So the state of the partner economy is good and Microsoft, I could put on that list is also strong. With Rockwell you'll remember in the past quarters I had said we should take a bit of a conservative posture as it relates to what Rockwell would contribute to PDCs numbers here in fiscal '22 and we did that because Rockwell had made a big acquisition. Rockwell never completely agreed with me on that. Their own public commentary kind of indicated they didn't worry too much about that. And in Q1 we're right. So we're pleased to see that Rockwell's contribution was solid in Q1 and starting to feel pretty good about the year. I'll tell you one thing is this DPM solution appears to be a very good fit with Rockwell. And in fact, their Calypso alarm is probably lined up to be our strongest partner in promoting DPM. So we're, very happy with that. Calypso has a long term relationship with PTC that even predates their acquisition by Rockwell. So great alignment around DPM. Again, DPM is a high value up to stack solution that drives bigger deal sizes and we think will be a very sticky solution. So lots of optimism around that. With Ansys, we continue to differentiate now with best in class simulation. So, whereas simulation, some years back, would've been viewed as a soft spot for PTC. Now it's a strength, if we're competing against Autodesk or Siemens or [indiscernible]. Nobody's going to have a better simulation story than PTC because nobody has a better simulation story than Ansys and Ansys products are built into PTC products. So that's been going well. And then of course, with Microsoft, that partnership is performing well and poised to get a lot bigger because as we bring more stuff aggressively to SaaS, a whole lot of that is going to land on Azure. So I think all three partnerships are alive and well, and as important as ever and, helping us achieve the kind of results that we're achieving. Yeah. Christian, I'm thinking the numbers were largely done, but not completely 80%, 90% done. Yeah. we'll be hiring people throughout the year, so, but in terms of the people who are exiting they're largely exited by now that largely happened within the first quarter. Okay. Well thank you all. There's a lot of good -- lot of good questions and I think good answers because the business is performing very well right now. ARR is doing well. Bookings are doing well. Free cash is doing well. I think we executed through good times and bad. We executed through the changes we made over the last quarter and we're set up to do pretty well for the balance of the year. So we very confident and look forward to talking to you all in 90 days. If we don't happen to cross paths with you sooner in an investor event or what have you. So thanks a lot for joining us and have a good evening."

[Operator Instructions] Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions.  I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Shimao, PTC's Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nMatt Shimao : Good afternoon. Thank you, Danica, and welcome to PTC's 2023 fourth quarter conference call. On the call today are Jim Heppelmann, CEO; Neil Barua, CEO-elect; and Kristian Talvitie, CFO. Today's conference call is being broadcast live through an audio webcast, and a replay of the call will be available later today at www.ptc.com.  During this call, PTC will make forward-looking statements including guidance as to future operating results. Because such statements deal with future events, actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements can be found in PTC's annual report on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as well as in today's press release.  The forward-looking statements, including guidance provided during this call are valid only as of today's date, November 1, 2023, and PTC assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. During the call, PTC will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in today's press release made available on our website.  With that, I'd like to turn the call over to PTC's CEO, Jim Heppelmann. \nJim Heppelmann : Thanks, Matt. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As usual, I will focus on constant currency results when discussing top line metrics, and Kristian will cover currency effects later in the call. I'm pleased to report that in the fourth quarter, PTC, again delivered solid financial results in terms of ARR and free cash flow, which are the most important metrics to assess the performance of our business.  Reflecting on the full year, which will be my last year in the CEO seat, fiscal '23 has been one of PTC's best years ever. Despite a challenging economy, we delivered a seventh consecutive year of double-digit top line growth with ARR growing 23%, 13% organically and revenue crossing the $2 billion threshold. And on the bottom line, we delivered 41% growth in free cash flow. This performance is a great stepping off point for me as I hand the reins of the company to Neil Barua going forward.  Given the CEO transition that's actively underway, during this call, I'll focus my comments on Q4 and fiscal '23 and let Neil take the lead on forward-looking commentary. Coming back to the Q4 results and turning to Slide 4. Though the manufacturing PMIs have indicated a sluggish global environment for many quarters now, our top line ARR continues to show good resilience. In Q4, we saw a broad-based ARR strength across our product groups and geographies. Our churn remained low. And for the full year, we did better than the churn targets we had shared previously. Customer demand was solid in Q4, up overall and on an organic basis, in line with the exceptional results we delivered in Q4 last year.  Within this context, the portion of business that we signed in Q4, but that did not start in Q4 or fiscal '23 was greater than we had modeled. Since ARR only kicks in when the subscription starts, Q4 ARR was $8 million lower than we had modeled, while deferred ARR is consequently $8 million higher. With this influx, our total deferred ARR is now $20 million higher than it was at the beginning of fiscal '23. Kristian will explain that because of this added strength in deferred ARR, we are now guiding ARR to grow 11% to 14% in fiscal '24, higher than the 10% to 14% growth range we discussed previously.  Moving to Slide 5 and switching to our bottom line view. We delivered $44 million of free cash flow in Q4, ahead of our guidance and up 52% year-over-year. For the full year, our free cash flow was $587 million, ahead of our guidance and up 41% year-over-year. Remember that ARR is the primary driver of cash flow. So this robust result was driven by a combination of strong ARR growth and higher operating efficiency. In fiscal '23, we delivered 38% operating efficiency which was 620 basis points higher than fiscal '22, well above our initial target that call for approximately 450 basis points of improvement in operating efficiency. We expect these operating efficiency improvements to be sustainable, and we think our subscription business model will continue to provide us with operating leverage.  Turning to Slide 6. Let's look at ARR growth by geography. ARR growth in the Americas was 25%. In Europe, ARR growth was 24%, and in APAC, ARR growth was 18%. Regionally, compared to a quarter ago, the GAAP between as reported and constant currency ARR widened in Europe and narrowed in APAC. On a global basis in Q4, our constant currency ARR growth was 3% less than our reported ARR growth. Versus prior quarters, we saw improved demand in China and in our SMB reseller channel. All 3 regions benefited from inorganic growth to varying degrees due to the acquisition of ServiceMax.  Next, let's look at ARR performance of our product groups on Slide 7. In CAD, we delivered 10% ARR growth in Q4. Within these results, the growth magnitude was primarily driven by Creo but supplemented by strong percentage growth in Onshape. PTC is taking share in different parts of the CAD market with both products, and we're excited about the potential of our new Creo+ SaaS offering as well as Onshape. We launched Creo+ at LiveWorx event this past May, and the initial customer demand for Creo+ has been encouraging. Regarding Onshape, with NPS scores that lead the industry by a considerable margin and solid retention rates, we see good opportunities to take share in the part of the CAD market that Onshape focuses on.  Garmin's recent decision to replace their incumbent CAD system with Onshape speaks to the products maturing functionality and competitive differentiation. In PLM, our ARR growth rate in Q4 was 34% or 15% organic with the incremental inorganic growth coming from ServiceMax. ARR growth in Q4 was primarily driven by Windchill, but supplemented by strong organic growth in ALM, thanks to Codebeamer. Codebeamer has proven to be a great addition to our portfolio with strong demand coming from manufacturing companies that might already be profession at managing hardware development but are struggling to deal with a growing wave of software complexity.  While demand is most notable in the automotive industry due to the rise of software-defined vehicles, we see customer demand for ALM tools expanding in other verticals as well, driven by the trend towards software-driven products of all types. Not only do manufacture products contain more software than ever, but there has been an explosion of software configurations that need to be developed and maintained across a company's different product lines, including across model years, sales options and cloud deployments. That's why we supplemented our Codebeamer ALM solution with the acquisition of Pure Systems.  You probably know that on the hardware side of the manufactured product, configuration management has always been the special sauce of Windchill, now with the addition of the pure::variants solution, Codebeamer will be able to offer equally robust configuration management for the software side of the product. The Pure Systems company is relatively small, but their breakthrough pure::variants offering has already landed early wins at many of the same auto and industrial companies that are adopting Codebeamer. Introducing this key competitive differentiator and value proposition into Codebeamer makes our position in the ALM market even more promising.  We've been taking significant share in the PLM market and are well positioned going forward with our strength in core PLM with Windchill Arena, complemented by strong positions in the faster-growing ALM and SLM parts of the market.  Wrapping up my comments then. First, I'd like to say heartfelt thank you to all of you who have supported me and my team over the years. Your insights and support have helped us to transform PTC into the awesome company it is today, a $2 billion scale growth and profit leader with a unique product portfolio that helps our manufacturing customers digitally transform their businesses. I'm personally very proud of what the PTC team has accomplished during my 13 years as CEO and much longer tenure as the company's technology and strategy leader.  I feel things are in good position to transition the leadership to Neil Barua. Neil will be supported by the same team who drove our transformation, including Kristian, Mike DiTullio, Aaron Von Staats, Kevin Wrenn, Steve Dertien, Catherine Kniker and thousands of other PTC employees. I wish them all the best as they evolve the business in pursuit of new ways to create value for our customers and shareholders under Neil's leadership just as they did during mind.  I will remain in the background supporting Neil through February, but I plan to let him take the stage in investor discussions going forward.  With that, I'll hand the call over to Neil to share his perspectives on the CEO transition and the future of the PTC business. \nNeil Barua : Thanks, Jim. Hello, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 9. The CEO transition is progressing well and according to plan. I'm excited to soon step into the CEO role, and I appreciate everything Jim is doing to ensure a seamless transition. I spent much of the past quarter traveling with Jim to visit customers, employees and partners. These meetings have been good opportunities for me to listen and to build relationships with key stakeholders. These meetings have also reinforced how relevant our software is to our customers' digital transformation initiatives.  PTC has established a strong position with customers, and it is clear to me that there continues to be a lot of opportunity ahead. I'm also starting to meet with investors and analysts, and I'm looking forward to continuing and deepening the 2-way dialogue. To that end, I'm looking forward to callbacks with many of you as well as some investor roadshows upcoming and conferences. And we are working on nailing down a date for an Investor Day, likely in the spring after the CEO transition. More broadly, I've been immersing myself in all aspects of PTC's business. As one example, I work closely with our team on the win at Volkswagen Group that we announced yesterday.  This significant expansion of PTC's footprint at underscores the value PTC brings to customers and our customers rely on us to support their product development needs at scale. Our teams understand the digital transformation needs of our customers, and we have the right strategy and product portfolio to help them achieve their goals. There's no other company that can help manufacturers drive closed-loop product life cycle management across engineering, manufacturing, quality and service. PTC is in a very healthy position and I am energized by the business that has been built in a job ahead.  Next, let's turn to Slide 10.  On the Q3 call, we shared this framework, which shows the layers of cumulative drivers that support our top line growth. Fiscal '24 is expected to be our eighth consecutive year of double-digit constant currency ARR growth. So PTC's ability to put up consistent double-digit growth is well established. This is a good framework to understand the sustainability of our top line performance. I won't go through each of the drivers now, but the takeaway is that all the layers contribute to our growth. PTC is clearly moving in the right direction, and my focus as the new CEO will be on ensuring a disciplined and metrics-driven execution of the strategy.  Moving to Slide 11. We also shared this framework on our Q3 call, which shows the layers of cumulative drivers that support our bottom line growth. It's important to recognize that our strong free cash flow growth in recent years is attributable not only to our solid top line growth, but also to our subscription license business model and strong operational discipline. Focusing on operational execution is essential to consistently deliver for our customers and our shareholders. As with the previous slide, all the layers in this framework are important, and I see good opportunities to further expand our operating efficiency. I want to reiterate that with our subscription model and operational discipline, we expect our free cash flow to grow faster than our ARR over the midterm.  As we reinvest in our business to drive growth, we expect to do so prudently such that non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to grow at roughly half the rate of our ARR over time. Let's turn to Slide 12. Today, we are providing targets that reflect solid top line and bottom line growth over the medium term, which Kristian will take you through in more detail. As you will hear from Kristian, for fiscal '26, we are targeting ARR growth in the mid-teens and free cash flow of approximately $1 billion. If there is one takeaway from my comments today, it should be that I am singularly focused on leading PTC to execute to its full potential.  As the company's next CEO, I strongly believe that we have the right strategy, organization and product portfolio to drive consistent customer and shareholder value in the years ahead. Over to you, Kristian. \nKristian Talvitie : Thanks, Neil, and hello, everyone. Starting off with Slide 14. In Q4 '23, our constant currency ARR was $1.941 billion, up 23% year-over-year and in line with our guidance range. On an organic constant currency basis, excluding ServiceMax, our ARR was $1.77 billion, up 13% year-over-year. In Q4, our as reported ARR was $38 million higher than our constant currency ARR. Also in Q4, ARR was impacted by $8 million due to start date timing. The key point is we contracted the overall amount of business that we guided to at the beginning of the quarter. At end year starts landed as expected, we would have been around the high end of our guidance range.  Now with approximately $20 million more deferred ARR in fiscal '24 -- starting in fiscal '24 compared to what started in fiscal '23, we're increasing our fiscal '24 guidance range to 11% to 14%.  Moving on to cash flow. Our results were solid and ahead of our guidance with Q4 operating cash flow of $50 million and free cash flow of $44 million. For the full year, our free cash flow was $587 million, up 41%. When assessing and forecasting our cash flow, it's always good to remember a few things.  The majority of our collections occur in the first half of our fiscal year and Q4 is our lowest cash flow generation quarter. And on an annual basis, free cash flow is primarily a function of ARR rather than revenue. Q4 revenue of $547 million increased $39 million or 8% year-over-year and was up 6% on a constant currency basis. For the full year, revenue was $2.097 billion, up 8% or 12% on a constant currency basis. As we've discussed previously, revenue is impacted by ASC 606, so we do not believe that revenue or EPS are the best indicators of our underlying business performance. But would rather guide you to ARR and free cash flow as the best metrics to understand our business and cash generation potential.  Moving to Slide 15. We ended the fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $288 million. Our gross debt was $2.322 billion with an aggregate interest rate of 5.7%. During Q4, we paid down $43 million of debt and at the end of Q4, we had $1 billion in high-yield notes, a $500 million term loan and approximately $202 million drawn on our revolver. In October of '23, we made the final payment for the ServiceMax transaction totaling $650 million, including $30 million of imputed interest, which will be included in our Q1 '24 free cash flow. We funded this payment with cash on hand and our revolving credit facility. The deferred payment was also -- was included in debt on our Q4 balance sheet, and also factored into our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, which was 3x at the end of Q4.  Also in October, we drew an additional EUR 85 million on the revolver related to the Pure Systems acquisition. We expect to be below 3x levered at the end of Q1 '24 and remain below 3x throughout the remainder of fiscal '24. We're prioritizing paying down our debt in fiscal '24. We expect to use substantially all of our free cash flow to pay down our debt this year and end the year with gross debt of approximately $1.7 billion. We've paused our share repurchase program, and we expect our diluted share count to increase by approximately 1 million shares in fiscal '24. Heading into fiscal '25, we'll revisit the prioritization of debt repay down -- of debt pay down and share repurchases. Our long-term goal, assuming our debt-to-EBITDA ratio is below 3x remains to return approximately 50% and of our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases while also taking into consideration the interest rate environment and strategic opportunities.  Next, turning to Slide 16. Let's take a quick look at how we did against our initial guidance for the year. Summarizing our fiscal '23 financial results. In a challenging market environment, we executed well in all four quarters and consistently delivered solid top and bottom line growth.  With that, let me move on to fiscal '24 guidance. Turning to Slide 18. We provide ARR on both a constant currency basis and on an as reported basis. You can see on the slide how FX dynamics have resulted in differences between our constant currency ARR and as reported ARR over the past 8 quarters. Clearly, as reported ARR embeds a lot of FX volatility. We believe constant currency is the best way to evaluate the top line performance of our business because it removes FX fluctuations from the analysis positive or negative.  That's why we provide ARR guidance on a constant currency basis. For fiscal '23, we provided constant currency ARR guidance for the year and constant currency ARR results for all four quarters using FX rates as of September 30, 2022. For comparative purposes, we also provided constant currency ARR history at these FX rates.  Next, on Slide 19, we're taking the same approach for fiscal '24. Our as reported Q4 '23 ARR was $1.79 billion based on actual FX rates as of September 30, 2023. That rate is our baseline for our fiscal '24 constant currency ARR guidance. For comparative purposes, we've recast our constant currency ARR history at these rates which you can see on the upper half of this slide and is also in the data tables posted on our website.  With that, I'll take you through our guidance on Slide 20. For fiscal '24, we expect constant currency ARR to grow from $1.979 billion to $2.19 billion to $2.25 billion, which corresponds to growth of 11% to 14%. Our Q1 constant currency guidance range of $1.995 billion to $2.01 billion corresponds to year-over-year growth of 22% to 23%. Note that we closed the ServiceMax acquisition right at the start of Q2 '23, so Q1 will be the last quarter we exclude ServiceMax from our organic growth rate. On cash flows, we're guiding for free cash flow of approximately $725 million in fiscal '24. Note that our cash flow guidance is not on a constant currency basis, so FX fluctuations can have an impact in either direction.  For fiscal '24, our guidance for operating cash flow is $745 million. We're assuming CapEx of approximately $20 million. It's worth noting how consistent and solid our free cash flow results have been since completing our transition to a subscription business model. In addition, we maintain consistent billing practices, and we've optimized our AR, AP and budgeting processes over the past few years. The predictability of our cash generation is tremendously helpful as we manage our business and invest for growth. For example, we're able to maintain core long-term investments even in a turbulent macroeconomic environment, which is great for customers and employees alike.  Beyond our core investments, we adjust our shorter-term or more discretionary investments accordingly given our business performance and outlook. The net result is solid and consistent free cash flow growth. In fiscal '24, we expect approximately 55% or more of our free cash flow to be generated in the first half of the year, which is less than we've seen over the past 3 years. This is primarily because in Q1 of '24, our free cash flow of $180 million includes a $30 million imputed interest payment related to the deferred payment on our acquisition of ServiceMax.  Finally, on this slide, we're continuing to provide revenue and EPS guidance to help you with your models. But as a reminder, ASC 606 makes revenue difficult to predict in the short term for on-premise subscription companies. More importantly, revenue does not influence ARR or cash generation as we typically bill customers annually upfront regardless of contract term lengths. Also, since revenue is impacted by ASC 606, it's important to remember that margins and earnings per share also impacted, so we do not view these as meaningful indicators of the performance of our business.  Turning to Slide 21. Here, you can see how we're investing for growth while delivering solid free cash flow. On the slide in blue, you can see our absolute level of R&D spending, which has increased steadily over the years. But more importantly, you can see the slope of the blue line has inflected in recent years, along with our transition to a subscription model. As our free cash flows expanded, this has enabled us to reinvest greater amounts year after year into R&D to drive future growth despite the turbulent macro environment we've been in.  Moving on to Slide 22. Here's an illustrative constant currency ARR model for fiscal '24. You can see our results over the past 3 years and the column on the right illustrates what's needed to get to the midpoint of our constant currency ARR guidance for fiscal '24.  The illustrative model indicates that to hit $2.22 billion midpoint of our guidance range, we need to add $241 million of net ARR this year. While this is higher than the amounts we added in fiscal '23 and '22, there are some important drivers to consider. First of all, as we discussed earlier, we have more deferred ARR contractually committed to start in fiscal '24. In fact, that amount is approximately $20 million higher at the start of fiscal '24 compared to the start of fiscal '23. Secondly, we expect Codebeamer to be a tailwind for ARR growth in fiscal '24. While we currently expect Pure Systems to have de minimis impact on our ARR results in fiscal '24, given its overall size.  We do expect that Pure Systems will help drive our Codebeamer momentum. Also, fiscal '24 will be our first full year of having ServiceMax under our roof. The broader PTC Salesforce has been equipped to sell ServiceMax, and they also have quotas now. All things considered. We believe we've set our fiscal '24 constant currency ARR guidance range prudently.  Next, on Slide 23, here's a similar illustrative model for Q1. You can see our results over the past 8 quarters, and the column on the right illustrates what's needed to get to the midpoint of our constant currency ARR guidance.  Because our ARR trends tend to see some seasonality, the most relevant comparison is the sequential growth in Q1 '23 and Q1 '22. The illustrative model indicates that to hit the midpoint of our Q1 guidance range, we need to add $24 million of net ARR on a sequential basis. We believe we've set our Q1 constant currency guidance range prudently. It's also worth mentioning that the incremental $20 million of deferred ARR we have starting in fiscal '24 is skewed to the second half of the year.  Moving on to Slide 24. I know that most of you model free cash flow using the indirect method, which uses the P&L and balance sheet as a starting point. Given the complexities related to ASC 606, there are inherent challenges in using the indirect method to forecast free cash flow for PTC.  The model on this slide is based on what we use internally. I know that looking at it this way, may be unfamiliar to some of you, so please feel free to reach out if we can help. Starting at the top for fiscal '24 ARR, we're using the midpoint of our constant currency ARR guidance range. Next, our perpetual revenue is primarily related to our Kepware business, which is moving to subscription over time. And the primary reason our professional services is modeled to decline in fiscal '24 is because a portion of our professional services revenue is transitioning to DxP over time. These 3 line items get us to our expected cash generation for the year.  Moving down the model, you can see that even though we continue to reinvest in the business, we also see room to expand our operating efficiency due to our sticky products and subscription business model, combined with operational discipline. Continuing to move down the model, we provide guidance assumptions for stock comp, CapEx, interest payments. You can find these on Slide 29 of the earnings deck and also Pages 3 and 4 of the press release. Specifically, interest payments are expected to be approximately $135 million in fiscal '24, driven by an increase in debt, higher interest rates and the timing of our interest payments.  Next, cash taxes are modeled higher in fiscal '24, reflecting higher taxable income as well as the impact of Section 174. And finally, let's take a look at the other category. In fiscal '23, the $72 million is related to FX movements, pre-acquisition ServiceMax collections and working capital. For fiscal '24, the main driver of the $19 million being modeled is working capital to support continued growth. All this sums up to expected free cash flow of approximately $725 million. If the demand environment is such that we're trending to the lower end of the ARR guidance range, we'll be more judicious in incremental investment decisions if the demand environment is such that we're trending to the higher end of the ARR guidance range, we would feel more comfortable increasing investments.  We have a robust budgeting process internally and that helps us not only prioritize run rate spend but also prioritizes additional investments we might want to make. For example, even in a muted demand environment, we may want to increase R&D investments but it wouldn't necessarily make sense to increase sales and marketing spending.  So turning to Slide 25. For fiscal '25, we're reiterating our previous targets, and for fiscal '26, we're providing targets that extend the trajectory that we're on. We provide these targets to help you understand the potential of our business. But I also want to remind you that the macroeconomic environment, FX rates and interest rates have been volatile in recent years and could positively or negatively impact our midterm targets. It's also important to point out that global tax law changes are expected to have a significant impact on our midterm free cash flow, which we've factored into our midterm targets.  Next, on Slide 26, I'd like to explain the progression of our free cash flow, looking back 3 years and looking forward 3 years. Over the course of fiscal '21 to fiscal '23, we delivered a 40% 3-year free cash flow CAGR. Over that time period, we had solid ARR growth. And as expected, our non-GAAP OpEx growth was roughly 50% of our ARR growth. It was actually 46%. Looking forward, we're targeting FY '26 free cash flow of approximately $1 billion, which reflects a 3-year free cash flow CAGR of approximately 20%. This factors in a continuous of operational discipline, it also factors in a hefty step-up in cash taxes, particularly in fiscal '25 and '26 due to global tax law changes and the depletion of our deferred tax assets.  We're focused on paying down our debt and while interest payments will increase in fiscal '24, we expect them to decrease in both fiscal '25 and $26 million.  In summary, turning to Slide 27. First, we have a strong portfolio and strategy. We have a solid position in CAD with a long-term opportunity to disrupt this market with Onshape and Creo+. This year, we've expanded our category leadership in PLM which has become a technology backbone for digital transformation and industrial companies. The acquisitions of Codebeamer and Pure Systems significantly strengthens our ALM position, which is becoming increasingly important to our customers as their products add more software and complexity to their products. And the addition of ServiceMax further extends what was already a unique portfolio of interconnected digital thread capabilities across the full product life cycle.  Second, our strong execution. With organic growth at double-digit levels already, we're in the early days of a major on-premise to SaaS transformation driven by the evolving needs of our customers. but it's an oversimplification to focus only on SaaS as the one and only major driver of growth for PTC. The delivery model is important, but it all starts with our robust software portfolio that meets the needs of industrial product companies. We continue to benefit from cumulative layers of PTC specific growth drivers, including driving customer expansion through cross-selling our differentiated portfolio and PLM expanding beyond the engineering department and becoming an enterprise-wide system of record.  Fiscal '24 is forecasted to be our eighth consecutive year of double-digit constant currency ARR growth. Third, we have a well-earned reputation for driving margin expansion that goes back more than a decade. We've been demonstrating that we're judicious with our investments, being mindful of both long-term opportunities and near-term macro uncertainty. From a cost and operational perspective, we're lean and a continuous improvement mindset is part of PTC's culture.  Fourth, with organic ARR growth in the low teens, juxtaposed PMIs that are generally in the mid-40s, I trust you would agree we're actively demonstrating that our business model is very resilient. We're targeting solid top line ARR growth and bottom line free cash flow growth. And finally, we're led by a team that has deep expertise and a proven ability to drive growth and margin expansion. And while I personally will miss Jim, I'm also excited to have Neil join the team and help continue to drive and evolve PTC. For sure, the environment around us will continue to change, and we will continue to adapt accordingly while still pushing the envelope of what we can do for our customers.  With so many positive trends going our way, we continue to believe PTC has a tremendous opportunity to continue to create value for our customers and shareholders.  With that, I'll pass it back to Neil for a couple of closing comments. \nNeil Barua : Thank you, everyone, for joining us and for your -- for the time today. We're going to move to Q&A now, and then I'll give some closing remarks. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Daniel Jester with BMO Capital Markets. \nKyle Aberasturi: This is Kyle Aberasturi on for Dan Jester. In the prepared remarks, you hinted at better-than-expected churn this year, which is great to hear, obviously, could you dig a bit further into this, maybe what is driving the strength? And how you guys are thinking about the retention into fiscal year 2024? \nKristian Talvitie : Yes, sure. This is Kristian. So we've been on this journey really for a number of years now trying to drive programmatic change to help with the churn. And frankly, it's a few different things. One is we've been driving for longer term lengths, which has been helping. Two, we've had more commercial discipline particularly around price increase realization. Three, there has been a -- both market and product maturity have been improving in some of our segments that have higher churn such as IoT and AR. So those are some of the levers that we've been pulling on.  I think we're in a great spot as it stands. Candidly, I'd say I think there's even more room to continue to improve from here, albeit it will be at a more muted pace than it's been over the past 3 years or so. \nOperator: Next question comes from Ken Wong with Oppenheimer & Company. \nKen Wong : This question is for Neil. So Neil, I think in the past, you had mentioned that you were very involved in the financial planning and obviously, plus the target out to fiscal '25. Perhaps there was some skepticism there, but with fiscal '26 introduced, I guess it's right to assume that you definitely put your stamp on that particular trajectory. Any specific nuances or refinements to the strategic road map that might have gone into that fiscal '26 number that you can perhaps share with us? \nNeil Barua : Yes. Ken, a few things, and I've got more to share, obviously, as the CEO transition comes to an end here in February, and we're planning on something at Investor Day for a more comprehensive update here. But couple of the themes that give me more confidence since the last time we spoke around the business and again, 90 days more of the transition. But around the PLM expansion capabilities is actually something that is very interesting, and some of the trends that we've seen this past year that I believe will continue. And the focus of the company on that is giving me confidence around supporting the guidance that we put out there for the multiple years that you indicated.  As well as this ALM strength. I think that is something that we've shown momentum, and we're building more momentum given some of the things that we're seeing in the marketplace with that product and solutions have now augmented by Pure as well. And lastly, on the SLM piece and the cross-sell opportunities, not only within SLM, but connecting back to we're advancing those beyond what we were doing 90 days ago. And now given the fact that ServiceMax is in the quotas of the sellers, we've created enablement I see also that area to be an area that we'll focus in on to keep building on the sustainable growth levers that we've been showing, but continue to show that trend into '25 and '26. \nOperator: We'll move to our next question. It's Jason Celino with KeyBanc. \nJason Celino : Great. Kind of a follow-up on the Codebeamer strength, this momentum that we're seeing. And then with the Volvo deal, I don't know if any of us really knew what PTC was doing in ALM 2 or 3 years ago. So when I think about the Codebeamer pipeline and the ALM strength, how much of this is maybe from existing customers looking to upgrade existing legacy ALM products? Versus wins and displacements of other tools versus customers who may not even have an ALM product for, if that makes sense? \nNeil Barua : Yes. Let me take the front end of this. Thanks for the question. We indicated in a press release a large strategic relationship with Volkswagen across their entire enterprise where we are deploying code beamer to their enterprise users for all the use cases that we talked about. One of the themes that we're seeing is this is actually a tip of the spear and an enabler for getting into new logos, particularly in the automotive segment.  What we're seeing is that a displacement of other tools in the marketplace that now Codebeamer with its differentiated capabilities with also the element of the tieback to PLM within PTC is actually creating the momentum that we spoke about, that will continue to push on over the course of this year as well. \nJim Heppelmann : Maybe I can add, Neil. Just if I could. In the fourth quarter, we actually did transactions with 5 auto OEMs. The big one with Volkswagen and then smaller, in some cases, foot-in-the-door type transactions with other global OEMs. And at least 3 of those, we have no meaningful CAD, PLM or ALM business with prior to this Codebeamer win. So I mean, certainly, we can upsell from the ALM position we had and sometimes from the PLM position. But what's really exciting is that we're knocking down big name new logos that we have no previous relationship with. \nOperator: It looks like our next question comes from Saket Kalia with Barclays Capital. \nSaket Kalia : Okay. Great. Nice to see the quarter and the guide in the new long-term framework. Neil, maybe for you a little bit of a higher-level question. I know that we've said that it's an oversimplification to focus on SaaS for PTC. But clearly, you come from a SaaS background with at least ServiceMax, if not your time before that as well, so maybe the question is, as you met customers intra-quarter, what do they think to you about taking PLM and CAD to the cloud? \nNeil Barua : Yes. Great question. So first off, there is continued interest in our SaaS offering, and it is an important layer of the cake that we mentioned in terms of the sustainable growth drivers. As a reminder, this is -- we expect an S-shaped adoption curve. We've also told you, and I agree with this is a decade-plus long journey. We continue on this journey into '24. And in regards to feedback from customers, we're seeing opportunities by which the roadmap, the ability for Windchill+, Creo+ for not only new logos by the way, but also conversions continues to be interesting.  That being said, one thing's important here in my upfront here that I mentioned, the overall growth drivers of our ARR has very little right now, and quite frankly, into '24 to do with SaaS. That being said, we are making sure the SaaS opportunities we've already secured, the pipeline that we're working on, we're working hand in hand with those customers to ensure we're optimizing the conversion experience of those customers.  Again, this will be a multiyear decade-plus long journey across the base of our existing customers plus those that were far new but is a key part of our focus. However, there are many other layers of the cake that are working extremely well right now that I'm going to help push the team even further to accelerate. \nSaket Kalia : Got it. Got it. That makes a lot of sense. Kristian, maybe for my follow-up for you. And apologies, I joined the call a little late. Great to see the continued double-digit growth in ARR continue into next year and beyond that. Maybe the question is can you just talk a little bit about your level of visibility here? I know we've talked about ramp deals in the past. And I think you mentioned something on deferred ARR. Maybe going one level deeper into sort of the level of visibility or comfort that you have as you look out to '24, which is clearly another sort of uncertain year of macro. \nKristian Talvitie : Yes. I mean, again, I think we have a pretty good level of visibility. A lot of our contracts are multiyear contracts. So you don't -- they're not actually even coming up for renewal in fiscal '24. You have some portion that's coming up for renewal. But again, our retention rates at this point are already quite high. And then also, as you point out, we do have deferred ARR, we've had obviously deferred ARR for many years. But we have that, which also provides more incremental visibility. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with BofA. \nAndrew Obin : Neil, Jim. Just a question on PLM and specifically Windchill. You guys have been very successful with growing the business. And I guess the question I have as your customers digitize their operation and there's this build-out of this digital value chain. What's the opportunity to monetize beyond sort of existing users, right, as more people touch the digital thread? What are the revenue opportunities? Are there sort of opportunities to sort of charge people for different services? If you could expand on that? \nNeil Barua : Yes. Let me take the front end and maybe Kristian and Jim could support here. As I mentioned, one of the drivers we've seen over many years right now is around Windchill's adoption within our customers. And what we've also seen is that expanding not only within engineering, but as you mentioned, it's now going to other groups that is tied closer to engineering, like supply chain, like quality as an example.  And as Kristian said, we're seeing this migration of Windchill becoming more of an enterprise-wide system of record, that will take some time, but we are seeing the trends moving towards that, particularly as we think about model base and the digital thread that is pushing on this lever. To be clear, some of the economic points that you're asking about revenue potential outside of the already strong sustainable growth that we've been showing in Windchill, we're working on more of a metrics-driven approach to that within ourselves internally to think about how do we sustain that over the periods over the next medium and long term, that will be an area that we'll explain more in detail as we get into the Investor Day, hopefully, in early spring. Jim, Kris, do you want to add? \nJim Heppelmann : Maybe I would add that our rule of thumb has long been that when a customer first adopts an engineering and then expands to a broader enterprise deployment. There's generally 10x to 15x more users across the broader enterprise than there are in engineering. And so as companies digitize, they're basically saying, we need to have everybody in the enterprise logging into the system and getting real-time data as opposed to working with data that's been exported out of the system and passed on and maybe on a date may be wrong, et cetera, typically drawings and PDF files and so forth. So I think that there is a real opportunity. And yes, I think Neil is offering to quantify it a little bit more discretely at the Investor Day. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. \nSteve Tusa : Jim, congrats again. Great run for sure. Can you guys -- I think you guys said you would update us kind of annually on the SaaS trajectory? I think you had put out an illustrative model or at least like some sense of where you'd be as a percentage of ARR by year-end '23. Maybe if we could just get a little bit of color on how that turned out? \nKristian Talvitie : Yes. I mean -- I think what we had said was we plan to be in the mid-20s in '23, and that's where we ended. \nSteve Tusa : Okay. Great. And then just a question on the long-term cash targets. You're kind of putting up some good numbers despite these other headwinds. I haven't gone back to the old model. But -- and anything incremental that moved around you on an operating basis because the numbers seem pretty strong despite the non-fundamental headwinds? \nKristian Talvitie : I'm not 100% sure I'm understanding the question, Steve. Like -- no, there isn't -- when we talked about some of the puts and takes, meaning the interest payments are going to come down. Cash taxes are going to go up. But otherwise, it's really just operating the business. \nOperator: Thank you. Looks like our next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. \nJay Vleeschhouwer : One thing that PTC does that I think is important and does rather well, for instance, at LiveWorx, is you share in some detail your product road map for CAD, PLM and the other 3-letter acronyms. So with that in mind, for Jim and Neil, when you look into '24, what do you think are some of the principal product development or release executables that you're working on, whether it's developing Atlas further or new forms of packaging like DPM or anything else that you care to mention as far as the portfolio is concerned for '24? And then for Kristian, a question that's often come up in the past, which is about your our sales coverage, our customer account segmentation. Anything new that you've implemented for '24 in terms of channel programs, channel margins, anything of that kind out in the field that we should be aware of? \nNeil Barua : So Jay, thanks for the question. I'll start off and Jim could support here, too. On roadmap. First, on SLM, I'll take that since this was a question in the last call. We are working on a release in December that ties ServiceMax closer to Servigistics with a combined offering that we believe will have nice reception to the marketplace, as well as in the same release, a tie of ServiceMax to IoT for preventative maintenance use cases between the two capabilities.  In terms of the broader portfolio, Windchill+, Creo+, Kepware+, as I said, this remains a strategic relevant area that will continue to grow and emphasize and we've got a number of leases for all the plus strategies that we have in '24. That includes, by the way, things that we're doing with Atlas in support of our Plus strategy. And then third, in an order of priority, by the way, here, Codebeamer, right, the ALM to scale and continue to capture what we're seeing is strong demand and pipeline we're making sure that we're taking Pure and Codebeamer and working through how that looks to the customer as well as augments to Codebeamer in general to make sure that it's enterprise scalable in the regard that companies like Volkswagen are needing us to deliver for them on the end user experience piece.  Jim, anything to add? \nJim Heppelmann : Well, just maybe to observe, listen, you talk here, you kind of called out projects that drive cross-selling is a top priority projects that drive SaaS is a second priority, not far behind. And then functionality, scalability, whatever of certain products, in particular, like Codebeamer, where we have a tiger by the tail and want to make sure we're being responsive to it. I think that would be a way I could characterize it, just reflecting on what you said. \nKristian Talvitie : Jay, it's Kristian. So then to get the part 2 of your question. So yes, we actually have some incentives that we're rolling out to drive -- to help continue to drive growth in the channel as well as improved retention in that space. So there are some programs there, and that's also focusing on enabling them to obviously, they do a great job already at selling CAD, PLM. We want to enable them to cross-sell other parts of the portfolio better. And as we can see a focus on both on-prem and SaaS, particularly Windchill+, Creo+. And then on the direct side, I would say that is really just continued refinement of the territory coverage that we have. So that's where we are. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Blair Abernethy with Rosenblatt Securities. \nBlair Abernethy : Just Jim, I wonder if you can just expand a little more on the Windchill+ in terms of -- what have you seen there so far? I know it's only been a few months that you've been pushing that out there. But just wondering if you've got any sense at all as to what the revenue uplift might be there? And also, how are you positioning Windshield+ versus, say, Arena in the market? \nJim Heppelmann : Yes. Kristian, do you want to address the what are we seeing in terms of uplift and then I can hit the differentiation versus Arena? \nKristian Talvitie : Yes. So from an uplift -- so from an uplift perspective, we're continuing to see at this point better than what we have modeled or communicated, right, that kind of 2x uplift. I think we'll see as we continue to progress through this I still think that's the right way to think about the long-term opportunity, but that's what we're seeing now. \nJim Heppelmann : And maybe I could add on the Windchill versus Arena positioning. So Windchill teams up with Creo and sometimes with other CAD systems to kind of enable this digital thread. So typically larger companies who have complex products, and they're more vertically integrated, so they're thinking how does this engineering data get used by manufacturing, get used again by service. And Windchill's orchestrating all that complexity up and down the value chain.  Arena on the other hand, is teamed up with Onshape in this agile product development and typically sold to smaller, fast-moving high-tech companies. Typically, companies have a lot of electronics, a lot of software and a tremendous amount of contract manufacturing. So it's a different problem that Arena is trying to solve and Arena excels at how does an engineering team in one company work with a contract manufacturing team in another or perhaps even other suppliers involved to orchestrate that.  It's much more -- Arena is much more focused on operations than on product configuration, much more well suited to a contract manufacturing type of setup that you see so frequently in the electronics industry, for example. So I'd say Arena is a little bit of a special purpose product that pairs very nicely with Onshape, sort of like a nice red line with a stake or something like that, and addresses this problem that a fair number of manufacturers have. \nOperator: Thank you. We will wrap up our Q&A session now, and I will turn the call back over to Neil for closing remarks. \nNeil Barua : Sure. Thank you, everyone, for joining us and for your questions today. Kris and I will be both on the road in the weeks ahead, participating in investor conferences. Kristian will be at the RBC Conference in New York in mid-November. Kristian also will be going to London in early December, and will be at the NASDAQ and Berenberg conferences. I'll be at the Barclays Conference in San Francisco in early December. We also have 2 bus stores coming to visit us at our Boston headquarters in early November. Those visits will be hosted by Kristian and Mike DiTullio, reach out please to BofA or Baird if you're interested. And on behalf of the team, thank you again, and we look forward to engaging with you. \nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Neil Barua",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim. Hello, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 9. The CEO transition is progressing well and according to plan. I'm excited to soon step into the CEO role, and I appreciate everything Jim is doing to ensure a seamless transition. I spent much of the past quarter traveling with Jim to visit customers, employees and partners. These meetings have been good opportunities for me to listen and to build relationships with key stakeholders. These meetings have also reinforced how relevant our software is to our customers' digital transformation initiatives.  PTC has established a strong position with customers, and it is clear to me that there continues to be a lot of opportunity ahead. I'm also starting to meet with investors and analysts, and I'm looking forward to continuing and deepening the 2-way dialogue. To that end, I'm looking forward to callbacks with many of you as well as some investor roadshows upcoming and conferences. And we are working on nailing down a date for an Investor Day, likely in the spring after the CEO transition. More broadly, I've been immersing myself in all aspects of PTC's business. As one example, I work closely with our team on the win at Volkswagen Group that we announced yesterday.  This significant expansion of PTC's footprint at underscores the value PTC brings to customers and our customers rely on us to support their product development needs at scale. Our teams understand the digital transformation needs of our customers, and we have the right strategy and product portfolio to help them achieve their goals. There's no other company that can help manufacturers drive closed-loop product life cycle management across engineering, manufacturing, quality and service. PTC is in a very healthy position and I am energized by the business that has been built in a job ahead.  Next, let's turn to Slide 10.  On the Q3 call, we shared this framework, which shows the layers of cumulative drivers that support our top line growth. Fiscal '24 is expected to be our eighth consecutive year of double-digit constant currency ARR growth. So PTC's ability to put up consistent double-digit growth is well established. This is a good framework to understand the sustainability of our top line performance. I won't go through each of the drivers now, but the takeaway is that all the layers contribute to our growth. PTC is clearly moving in the right direction, and my focus as the new CEO will be on ensuring a disciplined and metrics-driven execution of the strategy.  Moving to Slide 11. We also shared this framework on our Q3 call, which shows the layers of cumulative drivers that support our bottom line growth. It's important to recognize that our strong free cash flow growth in recent years is attributable not only to our solid top line growth, but also to our subscription license business model and strong operational discipline. Focusing on operational execution is essential to consistently deliver for our customers and our shareholders. As with the previous slide, all the layers in this framework are important, and I see good opportunities to further expand our operating efficiency. I want to reiterate that with our subscription model and operational discipline, we expect our free cash flow to grow faster than our ARR over the midterm.  As we reinvest in our business to drive growth, we expect to do so prudently such that non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to grow at roughly half the rate of our ARR over time. Let's turn to Slide 12. Today, we are providing targets that reflect solid top line and bottom line growth over the medium term, which Kristian will take you through in more detail. As you will hear from Kristian, for fiscal '26, we are targeting ARR growth in the mid-teens and free cash flow of approximately $1 billion. If there is one takeaway from my comments today, it should be that I am singularly focused on leading PTC to execute to its full potential.  As the company's next CEO, I strongly believe that we have the right strategy, organization and product portfolio to drive consistent customer and shareholder value in the years ahead. Over to you, Kristian. Thank you, everyone, for joining us and for your -- for the time today. We're going to move to Q&A now, and then I'll give some closing remarks. Yes. Ken, a few things, and I've got more to share, obviously, as the CEO transition comes to an end here in February, and we're planning on something at Investor Day for a more comprehensive update here. But couple of the themes that give me more confidence since the last time we spoke around the business and again, 90 days more of the transition. But around the PLM expansion capabilities is actually something that is very interesting, and some of the trends that we've seen this past year that I believe will continue. And the focus of the company on that is giving me confidence around supporting the guidance that we put out there for the multiple years that you indicated.  As well as this ALM strength. I think that is something that we've shown momentum, and we're building more momentum given some of the things that we're seeing in the marketplace with that product and solutions have now augmented by Pure as well. And lastly, on the SLM piece and the cross-sell opportunities, not only within SLM, but connecting back to we're advancing those beyond what we were doing 90 days ago. And now given the fact that ServiceMax is in the quotas of the sellers, we've created enablement I see also that area to be an area that we'll focus in on to keep building on the sustainable growth levers that we've been showing, but continue to show that trend into '25 and '26. Yes. Let me take the front end of this. Thanks for the question. We indicated in a press release a large strategic relationship with Volkswagen across their entire enterprise where we are deploying code beamer to their enterprise users for all the use cases that we talked about. One of the themes that we're seeing is this is actually a tip of the spear and an enabler for getting into new logos, particularly in the automotive segment.  What we're seeing is that a displacement of other tools in the marketplace that now Codebeamer with its differentiated capabilities with also the element of the tieback to PLM within PTC is actually creating the momentum that we spoke about, that will continue to push on over the course of this year as well. Yes. Great question. So first off, there is continued interest in our SaaS offering, and it is an important layer of the cake that we mentioned in terms of the sustainable growth drivers. As a reminder, this is -- we expect an S-shaped adoption curve. We've also told you, and I agree with this is a decade-plus long journey. We continue on this journey into '24. And in regards to feedback from customers, we're seeing opportunities by which the roadmap, the ability for Windchill+, Creo+ for not only new logos by the way, but also conversions continues to be interesting.  That being said, one thing's important here in my upfront here that I mentioned, the overall growth drivers of our ARR has very little right now, and quite frankly, into '24 to do with SaaS. That being said, we are making sure the SaaS opportunities we've already secured, the pipeline that we're working on, we're working hand in hand with those customers to ensure we're optimizing the conversion experience of those customers.  Again, this will be a multiyear decade-plus long journey across the base of our existing customers plus those that were far new but is a key part of our focus. However, there are many other layers of the cake that are working extremely well right now that I'm going to help push the team even further to accelerate. Yes. Let me take the front end and maybe Kristian and Jim could support here. As I mentioned, one of the drivers we've seen over many years right now is around Windchill's adoption within our customers. And what we've also seen is that expanding not only within engineering, but as you mentioned, it's now going to other groups that is tied closer to engineering, like supply chain, like quality as an example.  And as Kristian said, we're seeing this migration of Windchill becoming more of an enterprise-wide system of record, that will take some time, but we are seeing the trends moving towards that, particularly as we think about model base and the digital thread that is pushing on this lever. To be clear, some of the economic points that you're asking about revenue potential outside of the already strong sustainable growth that we've been showing in Windchill, we're working on more of a metrics-driven approach to that within ourselves internally to think about how do we sustain that over the periods over the next medium and long term, that will be an area that we'll explain more in detail as we get into the Investor Day, hopefully, in early spring. Jim, Kris, do you want to add? So Jay, thanks for the question. I'll start off and Jim could support here, too. On roadmap. First, on SLM, I'll take that since this was a question in the last call. We are working on a release in December that ties ServiceMax closer to Servigistics with a combined offering that we believe will have nice reception to the marketplace, as well as in the same release, a tie of ServiceMax to IoT for preventative maintenance use cases between the two capabilities.  In terms of the broader portfolio, Windchill+, Creo+, Kepware+, as I said, this remains a strategic relevant area that will continue to grow and emphasize and we've got a number of leases for all the plus strategies that we have in '24. That includes, by the way, things that we're doing with Atlas in support of our Plus strategy. And then third, in an order of priority, by the way, here, Codebeamer, right, the ALM to scale and continue to capture what we're seeing is strong demand and pipeline we're making sure that we're taking Pure and Codebeamer and working through how that looks to the customer as well as augments to Codebeamer in general to make sure that it's enterprise scalable in the regard that companies like Volkswagen are needing us to deliver for them on the end user experience piece.  Jim, anything to add? Sure. Thank you, everyone, for joining us and for your questions today. Kris and I will be both on the road in the weeks ahead, participating in investor conferences. Kristian will be at the RBC Conference in New York in mid-November. Kristian also will be going to London in early December, and will be at the NASDAQ and Berenberg conferences. I'll be at the Barclays Conference in San Francisco in early December. We also have 2 bus stores coming to visit us at our Boston headquarters in early November. Those visits will be hosted by Kristian and Mike DiTullio, reach out please to BofA or Baird if you're interested. And on behalf of the team, thank you again, and we look forward to engaging with you."

            "name": "Kristian Talvitie",
            "content": "Thanks, Neil, and hello, everyone. Starting off with Slide 14. In Q4 '23, our constant currency ARR was $1.941 billion, up 23% year-over-year and in line with our guidance range. On an organic constant currency basis, excluding ServiceMax, our ARR was $1.77 billion, up 13% year-over-year. In Q4, our as reported ARR was $38 million higher than our constant currency ARR. Also in Q4, ARR was impacted by $8 million due to start date timing. The key point is we contracted the overall amount of business that we guided to at the beginning of the quarter. At end year starts landed as expected, we would have been around the high end of our guidance range.  Now with approximately $20 million more deferred ARR in fiscal '24 -- starting in fiscal '24 compared to what started in fiscal '23, we're increasing our fiscal '24 guidance range to 11% to 14%.  Moving on to cash flow. Our results were solid and ahead of our guidance with Q4 operating cash flow of $50 million and free cash flow of $44 million. For the full year, our free cash flow was $587 million, up 41%. When assessing and forecasting our cash flow, it's always good to remember a few things.  The majority of our collections occur in the first half of our fiscal year and Q4 is our lowest cash flow generation quarter. And on an annual basis, free cash flow is primarily a function of ARR rather than revenue. Q4 revenue of $547 million increased $39 million or 8% year-over-year and was up 6% on a constant currency basis. For the full year, revenue was $2.097 billion, up 8% or 12% on a constant currency basis. As we've discussed previously, revenue is impacted by ASC 606, so we do not believe that revenue or EPS are the best indicators of our underlying business performance. But would rather guide you to ARR and free cash flow as the best metrics to understand our business and cash generation potential.  Moving to Slide 15. We ended the fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $288 million. Our gross debt was $2.322 billion with an aggregate interest rate of 5.7%. During Q4, we paid down $43 million of debt and at the end of Q4, we had $1 billion in high-yield notes, a $500 million term loan and approximately $202 million drawn on our revolver. In October of '23, we made the final payment for the ServiceMax transaction totaling $650 million, including $30 million of imputed interest, which will be included in our Q1 '24 free cash flow. We funded this payment with cash on hand and our revolving credit facility. The deferred payment was also -- was included in debt on our Q4 balance sheet, and also factored into our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, which was 3x at the end of Q4.  Also in October, we drew an additional EUR 85 million on the revolver related to the Pure Systems acquisition. We expect to be below 3x levered at the end of Q1 '24 and remain below 3x throughout the remainder of fiscal '24. We're prioritizing paying down our debt in fiscal '24. We expect to use substantially all of our free cash flow to pay down our debt this year and end the year with gross debt of approximately $1.7 billion. We've paused our share repurchase program, and we expect our diluted share count to increase by approximately 1 million shares in fiscal '24. Heading into fiscal '25, we'll revisit the prioritization of debt repay down -- of debt pay down and share repurchases. Our long-term goal, assuming our debt-to-EBITDA ratio is below 3x remains to return approximately 50% and of our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases while also taking into consideration the interest rate environment and strategic opportunities.  Next, turning to Slide 16. Let's take a quick look at how we did against our initial guidance for the year. Summarizing our fiscal '23 financial results. In a challenging market environment, we executed well in all four quarters and consistently delivered solid top and bottom line growth.  With that, let me move on to fiscal '24 guidance. Turning to Slide 18. We provide ARR on both a constant currency basis and on an as reported basis. You can see on the slide how FX dynamics have resulted in differences between our constant currency ARR and as reported ARR over the past 8 quarters. Clearly, as reported ARR embeds a lot of FX volatility. We believe constant currency is the best way to evaluate the top line performance of our business because it removes FX fluctuations from the analysis positive or negative.  That's why we provide ARR guidance on a constant currency basis. For fiscal '23, we provided constant currency ARR guidance for the year and constant currency ARR results for all four quarters using FX rates as of September 30, 2022. For comparative purposes, we also provided constant currency ARR history at these FX rates.  Next, on Slide 19, we're taking the same approach for fiscal '24. Our as reported Q4 '23 ARR was $1.79 billion based on actual FX rates as of September 30, 2023. That rate is our baseline for our fiscal '24 constant currency ARR guidance. For comparative purposes, we've recast our constant currency ARR history at these rates which you can see on the upper half of this slide and is also in the data tables posted on our website.  With that, I'll take you through our guidance on Slide 20. For fiscal '24, we expect constant currency ARR to grow from $1.979 billion to $2.19 billion to $2.25 billion, which corresponds to growth of 11% to 14%. Our Q1 constant currency guidance range of $1.995 billion to $2.01 billion corresponds to year-over-year growth of 22% to 23%. Note that we closed the ServiceMax acquisition right at the start of Q2 '23, so Q1 will be the last quarter we exclude ServiceMax from our organic growth rate. On cash flows, we're guiding for free cash flow of approximately $725 million in fiscal '24. Note that our cash flow guidance is not on a constant currency basis, so FX fluctuations can have an impact in either direction.  For fiscal '24, our guidance for operating cash flow is $745 million. We're assuming CapEx of approximately $20 million. It's worth noting how consistent and solid our free cash flow results have been since completing our transition to a subscription business model. In addition, we maintain consistent billing practices, and we've optimized our AR, AP and budgeting processes over the past few years. The predictability of our cash generation is tremendously helpful as we manage our business and invest for growth. For example, we're able to maintain core long-term investments even in a turbulent macroeconomic environment, which is great for customers and employees alike.  Beyond our core investments, we adjust our shorter-term or more discretionary investments accordingly given our business performance and outlook. The net result is solid and consistent free cash flow growth. In fiscal '24, we expect approximately 55% or more of our free cash flow to be generated in the first half of the year, which is less than we've seen over the past 3 years. This is primarily because in Q1 of '24, our free cash flow of $180 million includes a $30 million imputed interest payment related to the deferred payment on our acquisition of ServiceMax.  Finally, on this slide, we're continuing to provide revenue and EPS guidance to help you with your models. But as a reminder, ASC 606 makes revenue difficult to predict in the short term for on-premise subscription companies. More importantly, revenue does not influence ARR or cash generation as we typically bill customers annually upfront regardless of contract term lengths. Also, since revenue is impacted by ASC 606, it's important to remember that margins and earnings per share also impacted, so we do not view these as meaningful indicators of the performance of our business.  Turning to Slide 21. Here, you can see how we're investing for growth while delivering solid free cash flow. On the slide in blue, you can see our absolute level of R&D spending, which has increased steadily over the years. But more importantly, you can see the slope of the blue line has inflected in recent years, along with our transition to a subscription model. As our free cash flows expanded, this has enabled us to reinvest greater amounts year after year into R&D to drive future growth despite the turbulent macro environment we've been in.  Moving on to Slide 22. Here's an illustrative constant currency ARR model for fiscal '24. You can see our results over the past 3 years and the column on the right illustrates what's needed to get to the midpoint of our constant currency ARR guidance for fiscal '24.  The illustrative model indicates that to hit $2.22 billion midpoint of our guidance range, we need to add $241 million of net ARR this year. While this is higher than the amounts we added in fiscal '23 and '22, there are some important drivers to consider. First of all, as we discussed earlier, we have more deferred ARR contractually committed to start in fiscal '24. In fact, that amount is approximately $20 million higher at the start of fiscal '24 compared to the start of fiscal '23. Secondly, we expect Codebeamer to be a tailwind for ARR growth in fiscal '24. While we currently expect Pure Systems to have de minimis impact on our ARR results in fiscal '24, given its overall size.  We do expect that Pure Systems will help drive our Codebeamer momentum. Also, fiscal '24 will be our first full year of having ServiceMax under our roof. The broader PTC Salesforce has been equipped to sell ServiceMax, and they also have quotas now. All things considered. We believe we've set our fiscal '24 constant currency ARR guidance range prudently.  Next, on Slide 23, here's a similar illustrative model for Q1. You can see our results over the past 8 quarters, and the column on the right illustrates what's needed to get to the midpoint of our constant currency ARR guidance.  Because our ARR trends tend to see some seasonality, the most relevant comparison is the sequential growth in Q1 '23 and Q1 '22. The illustrative model indicates that to hit the midpoint of our Q1 guidance range, we need to add $24 million of net ARR on a sequential basis. We believe we've set our Q1 constant currency guidance range prudently. It's also worth mentioning that the incremental $20 million of deferred ARR we have starting in fiscal '24 is skewed to the second half of the year.  Moving on to Slide 24. I know that most of you model free cash flow using the indirect method, which uses the P&L and balance sheet as a starting point. Given the complexities related to ASC 606, there are inherent challenges in using the indirect method to forecast free cash flow for PTC.  The model on this slide is based on what we use internally. I know that looking at it this way, may be unfamiliar to some of you, so please feel free to reach out if we can help. Starting at the top for fiscal '24 ARR, we're using the midpoint of our constant currency ARR guidance range. Next, our perpetual revenue is primarily related to our Kepware business, which is moving to subscription over time. And the primary reason our professional services is modeled to decline in fiscal '24 is because a portion of our professional services revenue is transitioning to DxP over time. These 3 line items get us to our expected cash generation for the year.  Moving down the model, you can see that even though we continue to reinvest in the business, we also see room to expand our operating efficiency due to our sticky products and subscription business model, combined with operational discipline. Continuing to move down the model, we provide guidance assumptions for stock comp, CapEx, interest payments. You can find these on Slide 29 of the earnings deck and also Pages 3 and 4 of the press release. Specifically, interest payments are expected to be approximately $135 million in fiscal '24, driven by an increase in debt, higher interest rates and the timing of our interest payments.  Next, cash taxes are modeled higher in fiscal '24, reflecting higher taxable income as well as the impact of Section 174. And finally, let's take a look at the other category. In fiscal '23, the $72 million is related to FX movements, pre-acquisition ServiceMax collections and working capital. For fiscal '24, the main driver of the $19 million being modeled is working capital to support continued growth. All this sums up to expected free cash flow of approximately $725 million. If the demand environment is such that we're trending to the lower end of the ARR guidance range, we'll be more judicious in incremental investment decisions if the demand environment is such that we're trending to the higher end of the ARR guidance range, we would feel more comfortable increasing investments.  We have a robust budgeting process internally and that helps us not only prioritize run rate spend but also prioritizes additional investments we might want to make. For example, even in a muted demand environment, we may want to increase R&D investments but it wouldn't necessarily make sense to increase sales and marketing spending.  So turning to Slide 25. For fiscal '25, we're reiterating our previous targets, and for fiscal '26, we're providing targets that extend the trajectory that we're on. We provide these targets to help you understand the potential of our business. But I also want to remind you that the macroeconomic environment, FX rates and interest rates have been volatile in recent years and could positively or negatively impact our midterm targets. It's also important to point out that global tax law changes are expected to have a significant impact on our midterm free cash flow, which we've factored into our midterm targets.  Next, on Slide 26, I'd like to explain the progression of our free cash flow, looking back 3 years and looking forward 3 years. Over the course of fiscal '21 to fiscal '23, we delivered a 40% 3-year free cash flow CAGR. Over that time period, we had solid ARR growth. And as expected, our non-GAAP OpEx growth was roughly 50% of our ARR growth. It was actually 46%. Looking forward, we're targeting FY '26 free cash flow of approximately $1 billion, which reflects a 3-year free cash flow CAGR of approximately 20%. This factors in a continuous of operational discipline, it also factors in a hefty step-up in cash taxes, particularly in fiscal '25 and '26 due to global tax law changes and the depletion of our deferred tax assets.  We're focused on paying down our debt and while interest payments will increase in fiscal '24, we expect them to decrease in both fiscal '25 and $26 million.  In summary, turning to Slide 27. First, we have a strong portfolio and strategy. We have a solid position in CAD with a long-term opportunity to disrupt this market with Onshape and Creo+. This year, we've expanded our category leadership in PLM which has become a technology backbone for digital transformation and industrial companies. The acquisitions of Codebeamer and Pure Systems significantly strengthens our ALM position, which is becoming increasingly important to our customers as their products add more software and complexity to their products. And the addition of ServiceMax further extends what was already a unique portfolio of interconnected digital thread capabilities across the full product life cycle.  Second, our strong execution. With organic growth at double-digit levels already, we're in the early days of a major on-premise to SaaS transformation driven by the evolving needs of our customers. but it's an oversimplification to focus only on SaaS as the one and only major driver of growth for PTC. The delivery model is important, but it all starts with our robust software portfolio that meets the needs of industrial product companies. We continue to benefit from cumulative layers of PTC specific growth drivers, including driving customer expansion through cross-selling our differentiated portfolio and PLM expanding beyond the engineering department and becoming an enterprise-wide system of record.  Fiscal '24 is forecasted to be our eighth consecutive year of double-digit constant currency ARR growth. Third, we have a well-earned reputation for driving margin expansion that goes back more than a decade. We've been demonstrating that we're judicious with our investments, being mindful of both long-term opportunities and near-term macro uncertainty. From a cost and operational perspective, we're lean and a continuous improvement mindset is part of PTC's culture.  Fourth, with organic ARR growth in the low teens, juxtaposed PMIs that are generally in the mid-40s, I trust you would agree we're actively demonstrating that our business model is very resilient. We're targeting solid top line ARR growth and bottom line free cash flow growth. And finally, we're led by a team that has deep expertise and a proven ability to drive growth and margin expansion. And while I personally will miss Jim, I'm also excited to have Neil join the team and help continue to drive and evolve PTC. For sure, the environment around us will continue to change, and we will continue to adapt accordingly while still pushing the envelope of what we can do for our customers.  With so many positive trends going our way, we continue to believe PTC has a tremendous opportunity to continue to create value for our customers and shareholders.  With that, I'll pass it back to Neil for a couple of closing comments. Yes, sure. This is Kristian. So we've been on this journey really for a number of years now trying to drive programmatic change to help with the churn. And frankly, it's a few different things. One is we've been driving for longer term lengths, which has been helping. Two, we've had more commercial discipline particularly around price increase realization. Three, there has been a -- both market and product maturity have been improving in some of our segments that have higher churn such as IoT and AR. So those are some of the levers that we've been pulling on.  I think we're in a great spot as it stands. Candidly, I'd say I think there's even more room to continue to improve from here, albeit it will be at a more muted pace than it's been over the past 3 years or so. Yes. I mean, again, I think we have a pretty good level of visibility. A lot of our contracts are multiyear contracts. So you don't -- they're not actually even coming up for renewal in fiscal '24. You have some portion that's coming up for renewal. But again, our retention rates at this point are already quite high. And then also, as you point out, we do have deferred ARR, we've had obviously deferred ARR for many years. But we have that, which also provides more incremental visibility. Yes. I mean -- I think what we had said was we plan to be in the mid-20s in '23, and that's where we ended. I'm not 100% sure I'm understanding the question, Steve. Like -- no, there isn't -- when we talked about some of the puts and takes, meaning the interest payments are going to come down. Cash taxes are going to go up. But otherwise, it's really just operating the business. Jay, it's Kristian. So then to get the part 2 of your question. So yes, we actually have some incentives that we're rolling out to drive -- to help continue to drive growth in the channel as well as improved retention in that space. So there are some programs there, and that's also focusing on enabling them to obviously, they do a great job already at selling CAD, PLM. We want to enable them to cross-sell other parts of the portfolio better. And as we can see a focus on both on-prem and SaaS, particularly Windchill+, Creo+. And then on the direct side, I would say that is really just continued refinement of the territory coverage that we have. So that's where we are. Yes. So from an uplift -- so from an uplift perspective, we're continuing to see at this point better than what we have modeled or communicated, right, that kind of 2x uplift. I think we'll see as we continue to progress through this I still think that's the right way to think about the long-term opportunity, but that's what we're seeing now."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Jim Heppelmann",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As usual, I will focus on constant currency results when discussing top line metrics, and Kristian will cover currency effects later in the call. I'm pleased to report that in the fourth quarter, PTC, again delivered solid financial results in terms of ARR and free cash flow, which are the most important metrics to assess the performance of our business.  Reflecting on the full year, which will be my last year in the CEO seat, fiscal '23 has been one of PTC's best years ever. Despite a challenging economy, we delivered a seventh consecutive year of double-digit top line growth with ARR growing 23%, 13% organically and revenue crossing the $2 billion threshold. And on the bottom line, we delivered 41% growth in free cash flow. This performance is a great stepping off point for me as I hand the reins of the company to Neil Barua going forward.  Given the CEO transition that's actively underway, during this call, I'll focus my comments on Q4 and fiscal '23 and let Neil take the lead on forward-looking commentary. Coming back to the Q4 results and turning to Slide 4. Though the manufacturing PMIs have indicated a sluggish global environment for many quarters now, our top line ARR continues to show good resilience. In Q4, we saw a broad-based ARR strength across our product groups and geographies. Our churn remained low. And for the full year, we did better than the churn targets we had shared previously. Customer demand was solid in Q4, up overall and on an organic basis, in line with the exceptional results we delivered in Q4 last year.  Within this context, the portion of business that we signed in Q4, but that did not start in Q4 or fiscal '23 was greater than we had modeled. Since ARR only kicks in when the subscription starts, Q4 ARR was $8 million lower than we had modeled, while deferred ARR is consequently $8 million higher. With this influx, our total deferred ARR is now $20 million higher than it was at the beginning of fiscal '23. Kristian will explain that because of this added strength in deferred ARR, we are now guiding ARR to grow 11% to 14% in fiscal '24, higher than the 10% to 14% growth range we discussed previously.  Moving to Slide 5 and switching to our bottom line view. We delivered $44 million of free cash flow in Q4, ahead of our guidance and up 52% year-over-year. For the full year, our free cash flow was $587 million, ahead of our guidance and up 41% year-over-year. Remember that ARR is the primary driver of cash flow. So this robust result was driven by a combination of strong ARR growth and higher operating efficiency. In fiscal '23, we delivered 38% operating efficiency which was 620 basis points higher than fiscal '22, well above our initial target that call for approximately 450 basis points of improvement in operating efficiency. We expect these operating efficiency improvements to be sustainable, and we think our subscription business model will continue to provide us with operating leverage.  Turning to Slide 6. Let's look at ARR growth by geography. ARR growth in the Americas was 25%. In Europe, ARR growth was 24%, and in APAC, ARR growth was 18%. Regionally, compared to a quarter ago, the GAAP between as reported and constant currency ARR widened in Europe and narrowed in APAC. On a global basis in Q4, our constant currency ARR growth was 3% less than our reported ARR growth. Versus prior quarters, we saw improved demand in China and in our SMB reseller channel. All 3 regions benefited from inorganic growth to varying degrees due to the acquisition of ServiceMax.  Next, let's look at ARR performance of our product groups on Slide 7. In CAD, we delivered 10% ARR growth in Q4. Within these results, the growth magnitude was primarily driven by Creo but supplemented by strong percentage growth in Onshape. PTC is taking share in different parts of the CAD market with both products, and we're excited about the potential of our new Creo+ SaaS offering as well as Onshape. We launched Creo+ at LiveWorx event this past May, and the initial customer demand for Creo+ has been encouraging. Regarding Onshape, with NPS scores that lead the industry by a considerable margin and solid retention rates, we see good opportunities to take share in the part of the CAD market that Onshape focuses on.  Garmin's recent decision to replace their incumbent CAD system with Onshape speaks to the products maturing functionality and competitive differentiation. In PLM, our ARR growth rate in Q4 was 34% or 15% organic with the incremental inorganic growth coming from ServiceMax. ARR growth in Q4 was primarily driven by Windchill, but supplemented by strong organic growth in ALM, thanks to Codebeamer. Codebeamer has proven to be a great addition to our portfolio with strong demand coming from manufacturing companies that might already be profession at managing hardware development but are struggling to deal with a growing wave of software complexity.  While demand is most notable in the automotive industry due to the rise of software-defined vehicles, we see customer demand for ALM tools expanding in other verticals as well, driven by the trend towards software-driven products of all types. Not only do manufacture products contain more software than ever, but there has been an explosion of software configurations that need to be developed and maintained across a company's different product lines, including across model years, sales options and cloud deployments. That's why we supplemented our Codebeamer ALM solution with the acquisition of Pure Systems.  You probably know that on the hardware side of the manufactured product, configuration management has always been the special sauce of Windchill, now with the addition of the pure::variants solution, Codebeamer will be able to offer equally robust configuration management for the software side of the product. The Pure Systems company is relatively small, but their breakthrough pure::variants offering has already landed early wins at many of the same auto and industrial companies that are adopting Codebeamer. Introducing this key competitive differentiator and value proposition into Codebeamer makes our position in the ALM market even more promising.  We've been taking significant share in the PLM market and are well positioned going forward with our strength in core PLM with Windchill Arena, complemented by strong positions in the faster-growing ALM and SLM parts of the market.  Wrapping up my comments then. First, I'd like to say heartfelt thank you to all of you who have supported me and my team over the years. Your insights and support have helped us to transform PTC into the awesome company it is today, a $2 billion scale growth and profit leader with a unique product portfolio that helps our manufacturing customers digitally transform their businesses. I'm personally very proud of what the PTC team has accomplished during my 13 years as CEO and much longer tenure as the company's technology and strategy leader.  I feel things are in good position to transition the leadership to Neil Barua. Neil will be supported by the same team who drove our transformation, including Kristian, Mike DiTullio, Aaron Von Staats, Kevin Wrenn, Steve Dertien, Catherine Kniker and thousands of other PTC employees. I wish them all the best as they evolve the business in pursuit of new ways to create value for our customers and shareholders under Neil's leadership just as they did during mind.  I will remain in the background supporting Neil through February, but I plan to let him take the stage in investor discussions going forward.  With that, I'll hand the call over to Neil to share his perspectives on the CEO transition and the future of the PTC business. Maybe I can add, Neil. Just if I could. In the fourth quarter, we actually did transactions with 5 auto OEMs. The big one with Volkswagen and then smaller, in some cases, foot-in-the-door type transactions with other global OEMs. And at least 3 of those, we have no meaningful CAD, PLM or ALM business with prior to this Codebeamer win. So I mean, certainly, we can upsell from the ALM position we had and sometimes from the PLM position. But what's really exciting is that we're knocking down big name new logos that we have no previous relationship with. Maybe I would add that our rule of thumb has long been that when a customer first adopts an engineering and then expands to a broader enterprise deployment. There's generally 10x to 15x more users across the broader enterprise than there are in engineering. And so as companies digitize, they're basically saying, we need to have everybody in the enterprise logging into the system and getting real-time data as opposed to working with data that's been exported out of the system and passed on and maybe on a date may be wrong, et cetera, typically drawings and PDF files and so forth. So I think that there is a real opportunity. And yes, I think Neil is offering to quantify it a little bit more discretely at the Investor Day. Well, just maybe to observe, listen, you talk here, you kind of called out projects that drive cross-selling is a top priority projects that drive SaaS is a second priority, not far behind. And then functionality, scalability, whatever of certain products, in particular, like Codebeamer, where we have a tiger by the tail and want to make sure we're being responsive to it. I think that would be a way I could characterize it, just reflecting on what you said. Yes. Kristian, do you want to address the what are we seeing in terms of uplift and then I can hit the differentiation versus Arena? And maybe I could add on the Windchill versus Arena positioning. So Windchill teams up with Creo and sometimes with other CAD systems to kind of enable this digital thread. So typically larger companies who have complex products, and they're more vertically integrated, so they're thinking how does this engineering data get used by manufacturing, get used again by service. And Windchill's orchestrating all that complexity up and down the value chain.  Arena on the other hand, is teamed up with Onshape in this agile product development and typically sold to smaller, fast-moving high-tech companies. Typically, companies have a lot of electronics, a lot of software and a tremendous amount of contract manufacturing. So it's a different problem that Arena is trying to solve and Arena excels at how does an engineering team in one company work with a contract manufacturing team in another or perhaps even other suppliers involved to orchestrate that.  It's much more -- Arena is much more focused on operations than on product configuration, much more well suited to a contract manufacturing type of setup that you see so frequently in the electronics industry, for example. So I'd say Arena is a little bit of a special purpose product that pairs very nicely with Onshape, sort of like a nice red line with a stake or something like that, and addresses this problem that a fair number of manufacturers have."

During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions.  I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Shimao, PTC's Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMatt Shimao: Good afternoon. Thank you, Josh and welcome to PTC's 2023 third quarter conference call. On the call today are Jim Heppelmann, Chief Executive Officer; Kristian Talvitie, Chief Financial Officer; and Neil Barua, CEO Elect. Today's conference call is being broadcast live through an audio webcast and a replay of the call will be available later today at www.ptc.com. During this call, PTC will make forward-looking statements, including guidance as to future operating results. Because such statements deal with future events, actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements can be found in PTC's annual report on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and other filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission as well as in today's press release. The forward-looking statements, including guidance provided during this call are valid only as of today's date, July 26, 2023 and PTC assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. During the call, PTC will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in today's press release made available on our website. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to PTC's Chief Executive Officer, Jim Heppelmann.\nJim Heppelmann: Thanks Matt. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. You probably noticed that we have some additional news regarding CEO succession to cover today. So, I'll kick off with an overview of Q3, but skip the normal customer commentary to allow time for the succession discussion. I trust that many of you had a good chance to interact directly with customers at a recent LiveWorx event and I hope that will carry you for a while. Starting with Q3 results then, I'm pleased to report that in Q3, PTC again delivered solid results. As you know, we feel that ARR and free cash flow are the best metrics to assess the performance of our business. In Q3, we exceeded our guidance on both metrics, and today, we are again raising our full year ARR guidance midpoint as well as our full year guidance for free cash flow. As usual, I'll focus my discussion on constant currency results when discussing topline metrics, and Kristian will outline currency effects later in the call. Starting with the topline metric of ARR on slide four. In Q3, we came in at $1.868 billion, which was above the high end of our guidance range and up 25% year-over-year. Organic ARR growth accelerated slightly to 14%. ServiceMax contributed the extra 11 points of inorganic growth to bridge us to the overall 25% growth rate. We passed the one-year anniversary of acquiring Codebeamer, so we're now counting Codebeamer in our organic ARR results. Though the manufacturing PMIs continue to indicate a sluggish environment globally, our topline ARR continues to show good resilience. In Q3, we saw broad-based ARR strength across all product groups and geographies and our churn results remain good. Given strong year-to-date results, together with a solid pipeline and outlook for Q4, we're raising our full year ARR guidance midpoint. As I mentioned, Kristian will provide the details later. Moving to slide five and switching to our bottom-line view, we delivered $164 million of free cash flow in Q3, ahead of our guidance and up 46% year-over-year. Remember that ARR is the primary driver of cash flow, so this result was driven by a combination of strong ARR growth and higher operating efficiency. We raised our key free cash flow guidance for the year. Kristian will elaborate on that as well. Turning to slide six. Let's look at ARR growth by geography. ARR growth in the Americas was 29%. In Europe, ARR growth was 24%. And in APAC, ARR growth was 16%. On a global basis, FX was neutral to our year-on-year growth in Q3, but regionally, FX continued to be a growth tailwind in Asia, whereas it's a growth headwind in Europe. All three regions benefited from inorganic growth to varying degrees due to the acquisition of ServiceMax. Speaking of ServiceMax, we saw our first cross-sell activity happened in the quarter and while it's still quite early in the integration process, there is a nice cross-sell pipeline building, which bodes well for the future. Next, let's look at the ARR performance of our product groups on slide seven. In CAD, which is those products that enable authoring of product data, we delivered 11% ARR growth in Q3 in a market that's been growing an estimated 7%. Within these results, the growth was primarily driven by Creo, but supplemented by strong percentage growth in Onshape. PTC is clearly taking share in different parts of the CAD market with both products. In PLM, which includes those products that enable data and process management, our ARR growth rate in Q3 was 36% and or 16% organic with the incremental inorganic growth coming from ServiceMax. In PLM, we continue to significantly outperform the market, which has been growing an estimated 8% in core PLL. ARR growth for PLM in Q3 was primarily driven by Windchill, supplemented by strong organic percentage growth in ALM and SLM. Clearly, we're taking significant share in the PLM market as well. Turning to slide eight, I want to double-click on our ARR growth strategy because we've been fielding many investor questions regarding how we've been able to perform so well on the growth front as compared to peers and whether this differential growth is sustainable. Some investors think we've shifted from one growth strategy to another over the years, but we see it very differently. In our view, we have consistently layered new growth strategies on top of existing growth strategies to create additional tailwinds that fuel faster growth. Let me explain. Our growth strategy starts at the bottom of the chart where we participate in CAD and PLM markets that are growing in the upper single-digit range. So, that is our baseline. On top of this, our products are very strong competitively, which has allowed us to take some incremental market share and outgrow our peers. Then back in fiscal 2014, we launched our IoT business, which will be more than $200 million of ARR this year and continuing to grow at a rate that's accretive to company growth. Perhaps the single biggest driver of growth was unleashed in 2015 when we launched the full-on transition from a perpetual and maintenance model to a subscription business model. This was a short-term pain for long-term gain type of strategy, and I'm pleased to say the pain bottomed out in fiscal 2017 and faded in fiscal 2019 and we've been enjoying the long-term gain and growth rate ever since. Simply put, a recurring model with sticky software creates much more growth than does a perpetual model even at the same level of new seed sales. That's why companies like PTC cross the Valley of Death to get there. You can refer to our FY 2021 investor deck where we took investors through the math model that shows how much easier it is to grow a sticky recurring business model than a perpetual one. Following that, we put a strong focus on commercial improvements, such as improved churn, improved discounting and price optimization. And then redoubled our efforts in these areas when we entered the COVID and inflationary periods. Collectively, these improvements have created incremental tailwinds to company growth rates, and we think there's more to be done here going forward. We could have been satisfied to stop there, but we didn't. We saw the CAD and PLM markets beginning to pivot towards SaaS, which led us to acquire the peer SaaS Onshape and Arena businesses. These businesses continue to be growth tailwinds as the growth is accretive to PTC's overall growth rate. Then in fiscal 2022, we decided to bring the SaaS phenomenon that was driving strong Onshape and Arena growth to our core CAD and PLM business, which we did using the Atlas platform that leveraged Onshape technology. This strategy allows us to land larger ARR run rates because we're selling both the software and the service to deliver it. And of course, now we can expand the existing on-premise customer base ARR run rates by shifting customers to SaaS and upselling to include the value of the delivery service the customer now gets from PTC. Frankly, this growth driver is in its early stages and its impact is minor right now compared to what it promises to contribute in the coming years. Because we already enjoy strong growth independent of this SaaS driver, you should consider that SaaS is not our growth strategy per se, it's just another tailwind that helps in our quest to drive our growth rates higher. Finally, during fiscal 2022 and 2023, we made smart acquisitions like Codebeamer for the ALM part of our PLM strategy and ServiceMax for the SLM part of our PLM strategy. On a standalone basis, these businesses are growing faster than PTC. And of course, these growth tailwinds will increase as we further develop the cross-sell synergies we're pursuing. Cross-sell is already becoming meaningful for Codebeamer now and looks very promising for ServiceMax where we're still quite early in the process. So, when an investor asks what is driving the 14% organic growth that PTC is reporting this quarter? The answer really is all of it, except of course, ServiceMax, which is not yet factored into the organic calculation, but will be in a few quarters. For those who questioned whether this level of ARR growth is sustainable, I'd first like to point out that fiscal 2023 will be the seventh consecutive year of double-digit ARR growth across good macro setups and bad. And indeed, ARR growth has generally been accelerating over that time as more of these growth drivers came into play. I'd also point out that several of these drivers should be more impactful going forward, whereas none of them show signs of fading away. The sluggish macro, no doubt has cost us a small amount of growth here in fiscal 2023, but past history suggests we'll get it back when macro conditions improve. Bottom-line is we feel very confident that PTC is positioned to deliver sustained double-digit ARR growth at or near the top of our peer group. Most importantly, please keep in mind that it is ARR, not revenue that drives free cash flow at PTC. On the subject of free cash flow, then, let's turn to slide nine where I'd like to double-click on the dramatic increase in margins that we've been driving, which raises similar investor questions of how and for how long. Our strong margin expansion, best measured using our operating efficiency metric, starts with the bottom four strategies we've been driving for many years. The first and biggest expansion driver has been the mix shift from professional services to software. Before this transformation, our revenue had a roughly 25% mix of low-margin professional services, whereas currently, we're at about 7% professional services mix on our way to a 5% mix thanks to the recent arrangement to sell a portion of our professional services business to ITCI in the form of DxP Services. In turn, the large system integrator partner ecosystem we built has become a critical part of our growth strategy as SIs help create software demand in order to drive demand for their own services. We've been backfilling the low-margin services mix with high-margin software all along. And by the time we get to our 5% services mix target, the cumulative effect of this mix shift will be about 10 points of margin expansion. We feel the negative impact to revenue growth from declining services revenue over the years has been more than justified by the positive impact of the higher profit software mix to our margins and free cash flow. Said differently, the quality of PTC's revenue has increased dramatically. At the next level, a second big driver of margin expansion has been our go-to-market improvements, which had dramatically increased the productivity of our salesforce over the years. In particular, our development of a strong cross-sell muscle has been very helpful to sales productivity and naturally, we leverage this key strategy whenever we bring acquired products into the mix like Codebeamer and ServiceMax. The third big driver in this group is our R&D offshoring program, which allows us to maintain relatively rich resourcing against more moderate spending levels. We tend to have a higher degree of offshoring than peers, and we have consistently proliferated this strategy across our portfolio and into acquisitions that we make. On a non-GAAP basis, year-to-date R&D spending is around 16% of revenue, but R&D accounts for 37% of our employee base. Our largest offshore site is the PTC R&D center in India that will celebrate its 30th anniversary next year. So, you can see we have an incredibly deep pool of talent and expertise there. The fourth item to point out is the portfolio rebalancing, we do as part of our planning every year to ensure that our resources are best positioned to drive growth while maximizing profitability. This strategy essentially boiled down to driving low-growth businesses at very high margins while driving moderate growth businesses at good margins, thus reserving sufficient dry powder to invest more aggressively to develop new high-growth businesses like Onshape, all while retaining an attractive and expanding company margin profile. The next layer, the margin strategy is to leverage the benefits of scale that a recurring subscription business offers. Because growth in ARR requires relatively little growth in terms of variable costs, we've been doing a good job following our rule of thumb that on average, our costs will rise at half the rate of ARR growth, helping to drive expanding margins year after year. The improving commercial discipline around churn, discounting and price optimization that I previously mentioned as a growth driver is obviously a margin driver, too, since our input costs are essentially the same independent of churn, discount and price levels. The incremental growth we get here comes at nearly 100% margin. Finally, the changes we made in fiscal 2021 to align our field organization to SaaS organizational principles, Together with the operational rebalancing we did in fiscal 2022 to better align spending with our growth outlook in IoT and ARR have been big margin drivers because they've allowed us to meet incremental resourcing needs without incremental hiring. Our IoT business, for example, now has mid-teens operating efficiency margins while being accretive to company growth. Similar then to what I said about ARR growth, the significant margin expansion we're delivering here in fiscal 2023 is really due to all of the above factors. In my view, these gains are fully sustainable with more to come in the future. As Kristian and I have said previously, we expect our operating efficiency margin to expand to 40% by fiscal 2025 and expect we can get to mid-40s longer term. So, we continue to have a lot of runway here. Moving on to slide 10 then. I'd like to discuss our plans for CEO succession. I feel the company is in great shape in terms of topline and bottom-line growth with multiple layers of initiatives that can sustain this performance well into the future. I trust you see we're continuing to demonstrate the resilience of our business as our growth powers on while PMI trends in the wrong direction. So, for me, with more than 25 years under my belt now at PTC, half that time as CEO, I think it's a perfect time to think about putting a new generation of leadership in place that can sustain this high level of success well into the future. I love this company, and I'm very proud of all that's been accomplished during my time here, but life is calling me to a new chapter in following the succession I plan to retire from traditional management roles. PTC's Board has given careful consideration to who should be PTC's next leader and how we could best transition this person into the role to preserve our strategy and momentum. Our Board engaged Korn Ferry's CEO succession practice to determine what characteristics were most important in our next CEO and to vet our internal candidates and to consider external candidates. That careful process led us to an ideal successor in Neil Barua, the former CEO of ServiceMax. Neil is smart in articulate and he knows our industry. He's been a CEO twice already, yet still has a lot of career runway. He has a finance background, but really leans in with customers and product strategies. He's developed great followership within PTC already. And by the time, Neil become CEO, he will have spent more than a year coming up to speed as a PTC insider. We are set up to have a seamless transition that offers complete continuity in the company's strategy and performance. So, effective now we've made a series of changes that initiate the transition process. I have been named Chairman and CEO and with plans for the CEO role to transfer to Neil on February 14th, 2024, which is the date of our next Annual Shareholders Meeting. Neil has been appointed to the Board and has been given the title of CEO Elect. Neil and I will work together over the coming six months to ensure Neil has ample opportunity to get to know our important customer, employee, and shareholder constituencies and to transition my knowledge, relationships, and responsibilities to him. Given that I'm a non-independent Chairman by definition, the Board has appointed experienced Director, Janice Chaffin, to be Lead Independent Director. Neil will inherit and be surrounded by an excellent team that fully supports him. Mike DiTullio, will continue to head our operations as President and COO. Kristian Talvitie will continue to head our financial strategy as CFO. Likewise, other PTC executives, such as our Chief Product Officer, Chief Technology Officer, Chief Strategy Officer, Chief Legal Counsel, and Chief Human Resources Officer, will remain in place throughout the transition and beyond. This transition should be very smooth. The bottom-line is that the Board chose a great successor whom I fully endorse and who has the support of the entire team. I'm very happy for Neil and for myself, I might add, that we could find such an elegant way to transition PTC leadership into what promises to be an exciting and successful next phase for the company. With that, I'd like to turn to slide 11 and ask Neil to spend a few minutes introducing himself before we move back to Christian for additional commentary regarding results and guidance. Neil?\nNeil Barua: Thanks Jim. Hello to everyone listening. It's great to be on the call today. PTC is a terrific company, and it's an honor to be named PTC's next CEO. I want to thank the Board for running a thoughtful succession planning process and for the vote of confidence they placed in me. I've learned a lot about PTC since the ServiceMax acquisition seven months ago, and I'm excited to continue learning from Jim, Mike, Kristian, and the rest of the leadership team during the transition period. I want to personally thank Jim for all he has done for PTC for setting things up so well for me and the team and for the friendship that we've built. For those on the call who don't know me, I've been in the tech industry for nearly 25 years. I was CEO of ServiceMax for about four years before the acquisition by PTC. Prior to that, I was CEO of IPC systems for four years. Prior to IPC, I worked in the technology PE space as an operating executive at both Silver Lake and Francisco Partners. PTC is in a terrific position, and my top priority is continued execution. Over these last six months, I've seen firsthand how excited our customers are about our model-based closed-loop digital threat strategy and how critical our software is for their digital transformation journeys. I've also observed the talent and passion of our employees and the commitment they bring to our customers and partners. There is no other company like PTC and I can't wait to roll up my sleeves and help take it to the next level. Over the next several weeks and months, I will be meeting and spending more time with our customers, employees, partners, and investors. I'll be joining many upcoming investor and analyst meetings with Jim and Kristian and I look forward to meeting you. Jim, thanks again to you and the Board. Over to you, Kristian.\nKristian Talvitie: Thanks Neil. And let me start off by reiterating Jim's ringing endorsement. It's been great getting to know you and I'm looking forward to working with you to drive customer and shareholder value. Turning to slide 13, I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance, and ARR references will be in both constant currency and as-reported. In Q3 2023, our constant currency ARR was $1.89 billion, up 25% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. On an organic constant currency basis, excluding ServiceMax, our ARR was $1.7 billion, up 14% year-over-year. In Q3, our as-reported ARR was $61 million higher than our constant currency ARR on a year-over-year basis, currency fluctuations were neutral to growth in Q3. As Jim explained, our solid topline in Q3 was broad-based across all geographies and product groups. I'm sure many of you have been following the manufacturing PMIs due to the historical correlation with our topline when we operated a perpetual business model many years ago. The global manufacturing PMI peaked in December 2021 and has been under 50 for almost a year now. The Eurozone PMI has been particularly weak. In contrast to those trends, our topline, including in Europe, has continued to grow. Our subscription business model and low churn rates make our ARR resilient and demand for digital transformation continues across our customer base. In Q3, our ARR benefited from some timing, which we factored into our guidance for Q4. Naturally, we also took the outlook for bookings, churn, start dates, deferred ARR into account when we raised the midpoint of our fiscal 2023 ARR guidance range. Moving on to cash flow, our results were strong with Q3 cash from operations of $169 million and free cash flow of $164 million, coming in ahead of our guidance. This performance was driven by continued strong execution based on our foundation of solid collections and cost discipline. In addition, we had a net timing benefit of approximately $5 million in Q3. So, keep that in mind as we go through our Q4 cash flow guidance in a few minutes. When assessing and forecasting our cash flow, it's always good to remember a few things. The majority of our collections occur in the first half of our fiscal year. Q4 is our lowest cash flow generation quarter, and on an annual basis, free cash flow is primarily a function of ARR rather than revenue. Q3 revenue of $542 million increased $80 million or 17% year-over-year and was up 21% on a constant currency basis. In Q3, recurring revenue grew by $83 million, partially offset by a $3 million decline in professional services revenue. The decline in professional services revenue is consistent with Jim's mix conversation, including our strategy to transition some of our professional services revenue to DxP Services, our partner for Windchill + lift and shift projects. As we've discussed previously, revenue is impacted by ASC 606, so we do not believe that revenue is the best indicator of our underlying business performance, but would rather guide you to ARR as the best metric to understand our topline performance and cash generation potential. Moving to slide 14, we ended the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $282 million. Our gross debt was $2.365 billion with an aggregate interest rate of 5.6%. During Q3, we paid down $180 million of debt and at the end of Q3, we had $1 billion in high-yield notes, a $500 million term loan, and approximately $245 million drawn on our revolver. We have a second payment for the ServiceMax transaction due in October 23 of $650 million of which $620 million is already reflected as debt on our balance sheet and $30 million of imputed interest will be reflected in our Q1 2024 cash flow. We intend to fund this payment with cash on hand and our revolving credit facility. The deferred payment is included in debt on our balance sheet, as I just mentioned, and is factored into our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, which was three times at the end of Q3. We expect to be at or below three times levered by the end of Q4 and below three times levered throughout fiscal 2024. Given the interest rate environment, we continue to prioritize paying down our debt in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024. We've paused our share repurchase program and expect our diluted share count to increase by approximately 1 million shares in fiscal 2023. We expect to have substantially reduced our debt by the end of fiscal 2024 and will then revisit the prioritization of debt paydown and share repurchases. Despite this interruption, our long-term goal, assuming our debt-to-EBITDA ratio is below three times remains to return approximately 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases, while also taking into consideration the interest rate environment and strategic opportunities. Next, slide 15 shows our ARR by product group. In the constant currency section on the top half of the slide, we use FX rates as of September 30, 2022, to calculate ARR for all periods. You can see on the slide how FX dynamics have resulted in differences between our constant currency ARR and as-reported ARR over the past seven quarters. Based on exchange rates at the end of Q3 2023, our as-reported ARR at the end of fiscal 2023 would be higher by approximately $64 million compared to the midpoint of our constant currency guidance. We report both actual and constant currency results and FX fluctuations can have a material impact on actuals. But remember that we provide ARR guidance on a constant currency basis. If exchange rates fluctuate significantly between the end of Q3 and Q4, the impact to our as-reported ARR would also change. We believe constant currency is the best way to evaluate the topline performance of our business because it removes FX fluctuations from the analysis, positive or negative. With that, I'll take you through our guidance on slide 16. For all ARR guidance amounts, we are using our constant currency FX rates, which again, are as of September 30, 2022. For fiscal 2023, we expect constant currency ARR of $1.935 to $1.95 billion, which corresponds to constant currency ARR growth of 23% to 24%. We raised the low end of our guidance by $10 million, so the midpoint of our ARR guidance is up $5 million. On cash flows, we are again raising our fiscal 2023 cash flow guidance. We're now targeting cash from operations of approximately $605 million and free cash flow of approximately $585 million. As I pointed out last quarter, I think it's worth highlighting that we're raising our cash flow guidance for the year, while we have also been increasing investments in select growth opportunities for our business in the back half. The important point is that the resilience of our business model enables us to maintain core long-term investments even in a turbulent macro environment. In addition to that, as a baseline, we adjust shorter term investments accordingly, given our business performance and outlook. The result is solid and consistent cash flow growth. We maintain consistent billings practices, and we've optimized our processes around billings and payments over the past two to three years. Because of this, the quarterly seasonality of our free cash flow results has been very consistent over the past two years, and we're on track to deliver similar quarterly linearity in fiscal 2023 as well. For Q4, we're guiding to free cash flow of approximately $42 million. We expect approximately $2 million of CapEx in Q4, and therefore, our cash from operations guidance is approximately $44 million. Note, that we made acquisition and restructuring-related payments of $11 million through the first three quarters of the year, of which $3 million was paid in Q3. And we plan $11 million of payments in Q4, which we've also factored into our free cash flow guidance. Going forward, we also plan to provide full year and quarterly guidance for both revenue and EPS. We continue to believe that revenue and EPS are not good measures of our business performance. And internally, we look at ARR as our primary topline metric and free cash flow as our primary bottom-line metric. That said, the public scorecard is still often revenue and EPS. And while we have consistently met or beat on ARR and free cash flow over the past few years, we sometimes score a miss on revenue or EPS against metrics that we've not even guided to quarterly. So, now we're going to start guiding to both revenue and EPS on a quarterly basis. The EPS ranges we're providing are aligned with our revenue guidance ranges, which appropriately allow for a broad range of outcomes given ASC 606-related dynamics. For fiscal 2023, we've narrowed our revenue guidance range and primarily due to FX fluctuations, we lowered our revenue guidance midpoint by $5 million. Our fiscal 2023 revenue guidance range is $2.09 billion to $2.12 billion and for Q4, we're guiding to $540 million to $570 million. As a reminder, ASC 606 makes revenue fairly difficult to predict in the short term for on-premise subscription company. More importantly, revenue does not influence ARR or cash generation as we typically bill customers annually upfront regardless of contract term length. Moving on to EPS. For fiscal 2023, we expect GAAP EPS of $2.14 to $2.45 and non-GAAP EPS of $4.07 to $4.38. For Q4, our guidance range is $0.47 to $0.77 for GAAP and $0.95 to $1.25 for non-GAAP. Since revenue is impacted by ASC 606, it's important to remember that earnings per share is also impacted. Now that I've taken you through our guidance, let's quickly review how our guidance has progressed this year on slide 17. First, looking at ARR, as you'll recall, when we began fiscal 2023, we had a constant currency ARR growth range of 10% to 14%, given the uncertain macro environment. There's no doubt that we're operating in a difficult macro backdrop, but even still, we've been able to deliver solid results, taking the low end up every quarter this year. And now with our fiscal 2023 ARR guidance midpoint is for a 13% constant currency organic constant currency growth. As we begin to think about next year, while we're not guiding fiscal 2024 at this point. I think it's safe to assume that we will weigh our end market opportunity, pipeline, momentum and also try to consider the macro environment at the time. Assuming the current macro environment continues, I would not be surprised to see an ARR guidance set up similar to this year going into next year. And much like this year, I would think that we would expect to deliver a free cash flow result within our previously guided fiscal 2024 range regardless of the ARR outcome for the year in macro environment will be more judicious with our spending and in a more favorable topline environment, we are likely to invest more in the business. Because of the stability of the business model, we have a lot of room to match run rate topline inflows or cash generation with run rate expense investments, which are primarily headcount and COGS expenses related to SaaS delivery. I think we have proven that we will actively manage our investments in line with the macro and momentum -- business momentum we're seeing. Looking at our free cash flow guidance progression, we've been able to raise our guidance every quarter this year. We started the year guiding for 35% free cash flow growth and we're now guiding to 41% growth. Turning to slide 18, here's an illustrative constant currency ARR model. You can see our results over the past seven quarters, and the column on the right illustrates what's needed to get to the midpoint of our constant currency ARR guidance for Q4 of fiscal 2023. Because our ARR tends to see some seasonality, the most relevant comparison is the sequential growth in Q4 of 2022. The illustrative model indicates that to hit the midpoint of our Q4 2023 guidance range of $1.943 billion, we need to add $75 million of ARR on a sequential basis. This is $1 million less than the $76 million we added in Q4 of fiscal 2022. All things considered, we believe we've set our constant currency ARR guidance range prudently. Summarizing then on slide 19. First, we have a strong portfolio and strategy. This year, we've expanded our clear category leadership role in PLM, which has become a technology backbone for digital transformation and industrial company. The addition of ServiceMax further extends what was already a unique portfolio of interconnected digital thread capabilities across the full product life cycle. Second, our strong execution with organic growth at double-digit levels already. We're in the early days, but executing well against a major on-premise to SaaS transformation that should provide a multiyear growth tailwind. And as Jim explained, it's a massive oversimplification to focus only on SaaS as the growth driver for PTC. We continue to benefit from the cumulative layers of PTC-specific growth drivers, including driving customer expansion through cross-selling our unique portfolio. Third, we have a well-earned reputation for driving margin expansion that goes back more than a decade. We've been demonstrating that we're judicious with our investments, being mindful of both long-term opportunities and near-term macro uncertainty, from a cost and operational perspective, we're lean and a continuous improvement mindset is part of PTC's culture. Fourth, with the organic ARR growth in the low teens, juxtaposed against PMIs that are generally in the mid-40s. I trust you would agree that we're actively demonstrating that our business model is very resilient. Our topline growth and bottom-line profitability are approaching peer leadership levels. And finally, we're led by a team that has deep expertise and a proven ability to drive growth and margin expansion. For sure, the environment around us will continue to change, and we will continue to adapt accordingly while still pushing the envelope of what we can do for our customers. We're continuing to make progress towards our midterm guidance targets. In a challenging macro environment, we've been able to deliver solid ARR growth year-to-date in fiscal 2023. We have confidence in continued double-digit ARR growth and our free cash flow target for fiscal 2024 despite the macro uncertainty that continues to persist. We feel good about our midterm growth aspirations and cash flow targets as well. With so many positive trends going our way, we continue to believe PTC has a tremendous opportunity to continue to drive shareholder value. So, with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator to begin Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Jason Celino with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJason Celino: Hey guys. Lots of unpack here. Jim, it looks like we have a couple of more quarters with you. So, I guess this isn't a goodbye yet. And Neil, looking forward to working with you as well. But I guess my question will go to Kristian. But to clarify, I think you said similar guidance framework for entering 2024 on how you kind of entered 2023. So maybe can you just elaborate on this a little bit more because I know you entered this year with 12% guidance midpoint. Thanks.\nKristian Talvitie: Yes. So hey Jason, first of all, and thanks for the question. I think the point that we're making without really guiding for fiscal 2024 yet. Let's get through 2023 and actually see what the macro looks like and what the pipeline and everything actually continues to shape up to looking like. But we provided a fairly wide guidance range, 10% to 14% as we started fiscal 2023 that allowed for considerable amount of macro uncertainty. We've certainly seen that and I think that we would look for -- I wouldn't be surprised to see a similar setup as we start next year.\nJim Heppelmann: Yes, I think as we reflect on it, how we guided and how the year has transpired, we're pleased with the guidance. We're pleased with how resilient the business was. We're pleased with the fact that we've been able to ratchet the guidance up, but it feels like that was a good approach.\nJason Celino: Great. No, that's very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nMatt Hedberg: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats, Jim, 26 years, quite a run. Neil, I look forward to working with you more closely. And yes, I guess, Jim, we do get you for a few more quarters. So, that's good as well. I had a question on Creo Plus. Obviously, it just launched. Curious on some of the initial customer feedback. And really then, once you start to get more data, do you suspect that we'll see similar upsell to what you're seeing with Windchill +, which I believe is somewhere in the neighborhood of 2x uplift?\nJim Heppelmann: Yes, Kristian, why don't I take the first half of the question and the customer reaction and you take the uplift, part. So, yes, we have, I'd say, good momentum out of the blocks. I mean, in the first quarter, introducing it in the middle of the quarter, we didn't expect to necessarily do a lot of business. But actually, our first order came from a customer was at LiveWorx and said, wow, that's kind of what we're looking for. And that's a customer incidentally who was planning to add multiple CAD systems right now and was planning to standardize on 1 kind of had a preference for Creo and then came to LiveWorx and said, what we really want is Creo Plus. So, that example of a relatively short sales cycle from a company who was pretty impressed with the technology and some of the advantages it brings. So I think the reaction is good. I mean it's very, very early. And so we shouldn't get ahead of ourselves. But it's always good to get out of the blocks fast and I feel like we did with Creo Plus in the quarter.\nKristian Talvitie: Yes. And hey Matt, just back to your question on the uplift. We would expect, obviously, an uplift for Creo Plus as well, although I don't think it's going to be quite the 2x, it will be a little bit less than that. out of the gates, somewhere probably somewhere closer to, I don't know, 1.7-ish, maybe 1.7, 1.8, somewhere in that ballpark.\nMatt Hedberg: Thanks a lot guys. Congrats again.\nJim Heppelmann: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nSteve Tusa: Hey guys. Good evening.\nJim Heppelmann: Hi.\nSteve Tusa: Congrats to both of you, Jim and Neil. Jim, didn't work with you for very long, but quite a run for sure.\nJim Heppelmann: Well, thank you.\nSteve Tusa: Kristian, I didn't see any disclosure like last quarter on bookings and churn. Can you maybe give us a bit of an update on those metrics to the extent you can?\nKristian Talvitie: Hey Steve. So, actually, we're trying to stay focused on ARR and free cash flow and really ARR and sequential ARR and thinking about that framework. The trick with bookings is there's so many different dynamics to it that you just got to keep you on back layers and layers and layers and to be honest, it all nets out in the ARR number and the ARR guidance anyways. So, I mean, as we evolve this guidance process, I think you'll remember what we said last year about -- or last quarter about expectations and where we think that would land us for the full year. Obviously, now we took the low end up for the full year. We mentioned some timing issues. You obviously saw that we beat the sequential ARR or the ARR guidance for Q3. So, I think all that nets out in how we're feeling about the business and the pipeline from that perspective.\nSteve Tusa: And I guess the 11 to 14 you mentioned as like a good framework. Is that an organic constant currency metric that you're talking about?\nKristian Talvitie: Yes, it was actually 10 to 14. And yes, that would be organic constant currency.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. And then one last one, just on the new guidance for EPS and revenue. That was something that you guys chose to do, not something that I don't know what -- that was something like more of an IR kind of strategic discussion as opposed to something else?\nKristian Talvitie: Yes, that's exactly right. I mean, again, really, the way that we look at the business is ARR and free cash flow. Revenue is very volatile, not necessarily for performance reasons, but for accounting reasons. And it really doesn't tell you anything about the performance of the business in any given quarter or even trended just because varying term lengths caused so much volatility that you actually can't really use revenue and therefore, really the full P&L as barometer of business performance. But that said, we also recognize that the investment community when doing comparative analysis and so on, does actually still refer to revenue and EPS. And as I said, there's a scorecard out there, and we look at the ARR and free cash flow scorecard and say, hey, great, we're actually doing good. We're meeting or beating expectations. And then on revenue and EPS, where we don't provide quarterly guidance, then everybody's left up to their own devices to define what that might be on a quarterly or a quarterly basis for revenue and EPS. Sometimes we miss on the scorecard. We score a miss. And so we're really just trying to be more proactive about that and provide some -- provide some of our color to--\nJim Heppelmann: Just if I could kind of add -- reiterate some points. We don't think these are meaningful metrics. We prefer not to miss them anyway. So, we're going to give you some guidance. I'm going to give you some guidance set your targets in the right place.\nKristian Talvitie: Jim is always makes much more sense.\nSteve Tusa: Makes a ton of sense. Congrats to all you guys again. Thanks.\nJim Heppelmann: All right. Thank you, Steve.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Broome with Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.\nMatthew Broome: Thanks very much and congratulations to Neil on your appointment and of course, to Jim, on your retirement. You'll certainly be missed. In terms of the timing benefits to ARR, just how big was that benefit? And what was the reason for that?\nKristian Talvitie: Hey Matt, it's Kristian. So, the timing benefit was a few million dollars, and it just has to do with when contracts are actually getting behind, is basically what it boils down to. I mean, deals are being worked for, in many cases, many months. And it just has to do with that really.\nJim Heppelmann: Yes, I mean it's the start date phenomenon that Kristian always talks about sometimes it's pretty typical that we signed a contract in this quarter. Sometimes it starts in this quarter, sometimes it starts next quarter. Sometimes it then ramps or not. So, just what we call in-quarter starts if it started in Q3 rather than Q4, well, it had helped Q3, but then it came out of Q4. So, that's really what we're talking about.\nMatthew Broome: Got it. And then sorry, if I could just maybe quickly ask just in terms of this year's constant currency organic ARR growth guidance of 13%. How sustainable is that level of growth sort of going forward into FY 2024?\nKristian Talvitie: Yes, I mean, again, we're not really going to guide fiscal 2024 at this point, but we have mid-teens growth aspirations over the midterm. I think that Jim did a great job kind of outlining a lot of the various growth drivers that help stack up to delivering on that kind of growth, then you have to overlay the macro and understand how that's impacting in any given period. But as we said, I'd be surprised if we had a -- I wouldn't be surprised if we had a similar guidance set up to last year. So, we think that whatever low to mid-teens growth is sustainable.\nMatthew Broome: All right. Thanks again.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Adam Borg with Stifel. Your line is open.\nAdam Borg: Awesome. Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe just on the macro Jim. I know you don't want to talk or Kristian, do you want to talk, explicitly around bookings trajectory in the quarter. But maybe you can talk a little bit more about the macro overall, how sales cycles changed in the quarter? And any changes by geography or vertical.\nJim Heppelmann: Yes, I think we can talk about it. I mean, I think at a high level, in the past several quarters, three quarters probably, we've talked about SMB being a challenge, China being a challenge. I think that continues particularly pockets of SMB, our arena business is not at the growth level it was previously. But that's not new news. That's kind of been here for multiple quarters already. And I think in Europe, we're actually surprised at how well we're doing, given some of the macro data points, the PMIs, stuff like that. So, it's sort of the same story as before, inside an uncertain environment, there's a few pockets of weakness. Most of the GOs and products are kind of doing just fine, and then there's some real pockets of strength, too. Like we've said before, Aerospace and Defense, for example, happens to be pocket of strength, medical device happens to be a pocket of strength. So, it's kind of a mixed bag. I think it nets out for the year to less favorable than I want to be. And I said we did slow down a bit. I mean, we exited last year with 15% growth. And this year, at the midpoint, we're calling 13%, but the year is not over. So, it could be we lose a point, point and a half of growth this year, two points maybe, I don't know. But I'll tell you what, that's pretty darn good in this environment. And it's certainly better than any of our peers have been able to do in this environment. So, we feel proud about it and feel confident going forward that this is a very growth-oriented sustainable, resilient business and it's not likely to change dramatically from that. And one other thing I'd say, we've also experienced in the past that when there's a slowdown, for example, in some of these pockets like, let's say, arena, when the environment improves, we get a surge as all of that business come trickling in now because people have authorization to go forward with this project, they've had sitting on the shelf for a while. So, we saw this in 2009, we saw in 2020. In 2020 Q2 and Q3 were pretty weak, and we had a blockbuster Q4 and kind of made up for all of it. So, I also think our view is probably when the environment improves, and I'm not sure when that will be, probably, we'll get a surge of strength as some of these projects that have been held back by the customers get funded again.\nAdam Borg: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Your line is open.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Thank you. God evening. Jim, Neil, one of the interesting things about your closed-loop life cycle management strategy is the multiple forms of associativity across the product line. And with that in mind and at the risk of asking which of your children do you favor the most question. What do you think is the next big thing in closed loop life cycle management? Is it PLM and ALM, PLM and SLM, is it perhaps CAD in simulation and SPDM or all of the above. But how do you think about where the next big thing in terms of incremental growth or share might be? And then if I could just add to that, related to the share, it's been demonstrable that you've gained share in your two biggest businesses, CAD and PLM, but SLM and ALM are smaller, arguably more fragmented businesses. So, how do you think about gaining share in both of those?\nJim Heppelmann: Yes, I think I'll take that one, Jay. It's probably not fair yet to pin on Neil, but maybe on the next call. But for this call, I'll take it. So, I think, first of all, I don't want to pick one thing, and that's kind of a message here is it's not like just one good thing happening at PTC. There's a whole stack of good things. But nonetheless, I think you would agree, we have a very strong PLM position and we've been taking share for years with PLM. In fact, you suggested it went from third place to second place and then I think we've gone the first place. So, PLM is a strength and I don't see that dying anytime soon. Now, that said, we acquired a real strength in ALM with Codebeamer, and that is a hot market. particularly in some places like automotive, which is a massive industry. I think most of you know, there's three to four software engineers per mechanical engineer in automotive development right now across all companies. So, that's a hot place to be, and we have a hot product in Codebeamer. And then I'd say in SLM, we have an offering that's pretty much unmatched. And particularly so when you take ServiceMax, the strategy we outlined at LiveWorx Service Max with Arbortext, with Servigistics, with ThingWorx, IoT with Vuforia ARR. There's just nothing to go against that, frankly, and certainly not anything model-based close-loop life cycle. I mean, the nearest thing we could point to in a competitor there would be like IFS, which is kind of a Swedish mainframe company. Not really over Siemens or anybody like that. So, I think we have some real strengths. But again, I don't think there's one. I think we have a portfolio of advantages we've been developing and will play out in our favor.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Okay. So, Jim, given your long tenure, I was going to ask you about something you mentioned to me in 1999, but it can wait. We'll say it fix time.\nJim Heppelmann: Yes. Jay, my tenure is almost marked.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Thanks guys.\nJim Heppelmann: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Tilton with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nJoshua Tilton: Hey guys. Thanks for sneaking me in here and congratulations to both of you. Jim, you mentioned you have a hot product with Codebeamer. We keep hearing nothing but positive things. Any chance you could just give a little bit more color on how it performed in the quarter. And I understand that it's officially organic, for Kristian, maybe just any sense for how it contributed to ARR this quarter and what you guys are baking in for its contribution in 4Q? Thanks.\nJim Heppelmann: Yes. So, I mean, at a high level, we had a previous offering called Integrity, which had aged, let's say, over the years. And Codebeamer is a much newer kind of cutting-edge product. It's got great functionality, great usability supports all the Agile principles that embedded software developers also want to adopt now, but at the same time, provides the regulatory framework that they need to develop against. So, it's a great product. I think it's best in class and it's a hot market. So, we've been doing very well with these big auto companies that you would all know, you all know the names of. And I think we're going to land a few more here in the coming quarters. But -- it's certainly been accretive. I said last quarter, if you remember, that we had 13% growth, but if you'd let me look at Codebeamer a little differently, it had been 14 and now this quarter is 14%. So, you see that Codebeamer while not a big business, is performing well enough to lift the organic business up by as much as 100 basis points.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Wong with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nKen Wong: Great. Thanks for sneaking me in as well. So this question, I'm not sure if kind of appropriate at this stage, Neil. But mean Jim has established a pretty well-deserved reputation for delivering on cash flow and EPS in a past life. I guess as you kind of think about your background, how you look at the business, would you characterize yourself as having more of a growth or margin tilt?\nNeil Barua: Ken, thanks for the question. I appreciate it. And as a way of backdrop, and a reminder, I've been at PTC getting myself very much embedded here for the last 7 months. And so spending meaningful time here in Boston, moving the family out in the next few weeks out here. So, I've got a good -- the point being, I've got a really good context so far of the business. Clearly in this transition with all the great things Jim has done with this great executive team, I'm going to get to know the business a lot better. But that being said, I've been part of the framework with the executive team building the near-term and long-term plans for the business and feel really confident about what we have put forward based on the momentum based on what I see, I am very much supportive of how KT has put together is free cash flow framework around the levers we have around the resilient business and the layer cake growth opportunities we have that Jim articulated. So, from a perspective of me being new, it's actually me having spent meaningful time here making sure I was comfortable with the things that we heard on the call and the go-forward perspective of the business. So, feel good about that with the layer cake growth strategy as well as a very disciplined approach to make sure free cash flow is something we stay very much focused in on.\nJim Heppelmann: And I can add in -- to give him some kudos here, he's ahead of plan on the free cash flow of ServiceMax. So, he gets it. I mean you know that cash flow comes from growth and careful application of spending and he's had a plan.\nKristian Talvitie: And demonstrated you not to answer the previous question about which of Jim's children do you like.\nKen Wong: Appreciate the insights guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Jester with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nDaniel Jester: Great. Thanks for taking my question. So, congratulations on the first cross-sell of ServiceMax, which I suspect on a different call might have been highlighted more in your opening remarks. Maybe you could just spend a minute sort of providing a little more context kind of how that deal came together. And as you think about accelerating the cross-sell opportunity, any sort of learnings or strategic adjustments you've made as you've got this first deal across the door? Thank you.\nKristian Talvitie: Great question. And the children over time will be constructively across the whole digital thread. But in this regard of ServiceMax and SLM the cross-sell value that we're seeing and the momentum that we're building in a material deal that we closed out this past quarter was an evolution of an already significant customer of PTC for a number of years. And quite frankly, for the last three years, we've been trying to win it as a stand-alone business at ServiceMax when we put the companies together, went through LiveWorx and explain the closed loop -- model-based closed-loop digital thread strategy with PLM and SLM and the things that we could do to provide value for the customer, it was a no-brainer and there's no competitor that the actual industrial manufacturer out of Europe here had a choice to actually go to someone different. And so that thread and what we're doing to answer your second part of your question is across the collective customer base that has PLM and all the other categories that PTC has sold, we're actually integrating in the SLM portfolio and really showing the customer value and we've only started, as Jim mentioned, again, a material deal, and we feel confident that we're building the right pipeline and the energy around the customer really seeing a differentiated offer across this closed loop that we've been articulating as our strategy.\nJim Heppelmann: Yes and I think that one was fortunate because LiveWorx made the lightbulb come on, and then we had a very short sales cycle. So I certainly I certainly hope we can have other such short sales cycles, that's atypical. But I think the light bulb went on for a lot of companies at LiveWorx, there was a lot written about it, if you've seen that. So, it was great support for the concept of the physical and digital, the closed loop model-based closed-loop product life cycle management concept. So, I'm very optimistic, and there are numerous deals in the pipeline. They just didn't happen to close quick enough to get done in the quarter.\nDaniel Jester: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia with Barclays. Your line is open.\nSaket Kalia: Awesome. Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question here and congrats Jim and Neil, on your respective next phases. Listen, most of my questions have been answered. But maybe one for Kristian. Anything to note on pricing here, Kristian. I know the last couple of years have been responsive to the macro backdrop, right? Like not necessarily using that as much during tough times, also responding with inflation during more inflationary times. Anything to note more recently on pricing? Or how are you thinking about pricing going forward?\nKristian Talvitie: Yes. Hey Saket, thanks for the question. I mean I do think as the CPI continues to trend down in the -- we start to see a little bit more stability in the overall macro environment that will also be reflected in pricing strategy. So, I would expect that we would see normal kind of normal price increases again, absent some abnormal -- extremely abnormal macro situation. But that's what I would expect we'd start to see more normalized pricing action. Similarly, what we did similar to what we've done prior to COVID.\nSaket Kalia: Understood. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nAndrew Obin: Yes, hi. How are you guys?\nJim Heppelmann: Good. Hey Andrew.\nAndrew Obin: Jim, Neil, congratulations on the transition. Just a question. I know you guys have number of AI offerings, I think, co-generative AI design. I think you for expert capture, I think, uses semi AI. I think AI within ThingWorx -- you had this for a while. Are you getting more customer inquiries given we're in this AI news cycle? And is this enough to start moving the needle?\nJim Heppelmann: Yes, I don't think it's ready to be a layer in the layer cake yet, Andrew, but it could head that way because certainly, there's a lot more industry buzz, a lot more people saying, what should we be doing? A lot of engineers saying, what does AI mean to engineering. And there's a lot of work going on at PTC, as you would expect, say, what else could we do? And of course, there's two dimensions of that. What can we do in our products that would create more value for our customers. And then secondarily, what can we do in our operations that would make us more productive. So, there's a lot of things happening here. And then we do have these three capabilities in the market already. So, I don't think that deserves yet to be a layer in that layer cake of growth drivers, but hey, let's try to develop it into one. I know that's on Neil's list.\nAndrew Obin: Excellent. And just a follow-up question. What areas have you been adding incremental spending year-to-date?\nKristian Talvitie: Andrew, it's Kristian. So, if you're referring to the comments that we were talking about kind of increased investment in the back half and growth drivers that's been primarily in continued investment in Windchill + in Codebeamer, in particular, to name a couple.\nAndrew Obin: Excellent. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nay Soe Naing with Berenberg. Your line is open.\nNay Soe Naing: Hi, thanks for taking my question and I'd like everyone else, congrats to Jim and will put your upcoming roles. -- for cost with a question on you mentioned that we're seeing the weakening macro numbers in the global manufacturing PMIs. I was wondering if and when we -- you do start to feel the pressure from those decline in macros, which aspects would you start to resume first deal the pressure? Would it be in new business? Or would it be when you renew contracts, customers are committing to a lower level of contract values than what you would have expected them to? And then in terms of growth percentage points, how much would be at risk if we start to see macro pressures in the performances?\nJim Heppelmann: Yes, I think -- maybe I'll try a start, Kristian, you can help. So, I mean, the factors that build up ARR are fundamentally bookings and churn, but we can leave deferred and all that stuff out of the discussion for a minute. We've seen no evidence of increased churn in bad macro environments. We did not see it in 2009. We did not see it in 2020, and we have not seen it this year. So, I just feel like our software when it goes into production has always stayed in full production in terms of at least anyway, churn rates being the same. So, I'm going to take that off the table. I just -- there's no data through three down cycles to suggest that's vulnerable. And then as you go to bookings, I mean we've been clear, we've already seen some pressure in pockets. And when Kristian said some time ago that we -- our expectation was flat organic bookings for the year, well, we had probably hoped to do better than that. So, I think that's where we feel the pressure. But again, we gave some scenarios a year ago when we guided this 10 to 14 and said, We can actually withstand quite a bit of bookings pressure and still deliver some pretty impressive ARR results and off that, some pretty impressive free cash flow numbers. So, again, the business model is quite resilient, and it's because it's a recurring model with a low churn rate, I mean, fundamentally. So, you can go back and review that guidance. We're not really trying to guide the next year here, but I think the low end of the scenario was 30% bookings decline, which kind of matched more or less what we saw in 2009, but of course, the metrics were a little bit different then. But anyway, we sort of feel like even in a difficult environment, we can post some peer-leading growth rates and off that, peer-leading free cash flow growth rates because of the nature of the business.\nKristian Talvitie: And I mean we're in a difficult environment right now.\nNay Soe Naing: Thank you very much. Particularly helpful.\nOperator: That is all. I'd like to turn the call back to Jim for closing remarks.\nJim Heppelmann: Okay, great. Well, thank you all, and thank you for the kind comments for both Neil and myself. We appreciate that. A lot of news here. We're going to be quite active on the Investor Relations circuit here over the next quarter, this current quarter. Starting with callbacks, which Neil and I will both participate in. We're planning to be in New York, Tuesday of next week. We don't have the details quite nailed down yet, so look for an e-mail from Matt, Shamal. And then PTC people, various different people are going to attend the KeyBanc Virtual Road Show on the 31st of July. We're going to the KeyBanc Annual Technology Leadership Forum in Vail on August 7th and the 28th, we're going to be at the Stifel Tech Executive Summit in Deer Valley. And we're going to as well be at the Citi 2023 Global Tech Conference in New York City on September 6th. So, you'll have ample opportunities to talk to us. We're looking forward -- lots of good stuff happening in the business. We think this CEO succession is good and healthy and careful and will be continuous and everybody is happy about it. So, thanks a lot for your time, and I appreciate the support and look forward to seeing you on the road or at the next earnings call as the case may be. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks Jim. Hello to everyone listening. It's great to be on the call today. PTC is a terrific company, and it's an honor to be named PTC's next CEO. I want to thank the Board for running a thoughtful succession planning process and for the vote of confidence they placed in me. I've learned a lot about PTC since the ServiceMax acquisition seven months ago, and I'm excited to continue learning from Jim, Mike, Kristian, and the rest of the leadership team during the transition period. I want to personally thank Jim for all he has done for PTC for setting things up so well for me and the team and for the friendship that we've built. For those on the call who don't know me, I've been in the tech industry for nearly 25 years. I was CEO of ServiceMax for about four years before the acquisition by PTC. Prior to that, I was CEO of IPC systems for four years. Prior to IPC, I worked in the technology PE space as an operating executive at both Silver Lake and Francisco Partners. PTC is in a terrific position, and my top priority is continued execution. Over these last six months, I've seen firsthand how excited our customers are about our model-based closed-loop digital threat strategy and how critical our software is for their digital transformation journeys. I've also observed the talent and passion of our employees and the commitment they bring to our customers and partners. There is no other company like PTC and I can't wait to roll up my sleeves and help take it to the next level. Over the next several weeks and months, I will be meeting and spending more time with our customers, employees, partners, and investors. I'll be joining many upcoming investor and analyst meetings with Jim and Kristian and I look forward to meeting you. Jim, thanks again to you and the Board. Over to you, Kristian. Ken, thanks for the question. I appreciate it. And as a way of backdrop, and a reminder, I've been at PTC getting myself very much embedded here for the last 7 months. And so spending meaningful time here in Boston, moving the family out in the next few weeks out here. So, I've got a good -- the point being, I've got a really good context so far of the business. Clearly in this transition with all the great things Jim has done with this great executive team, I'm going to get to know the business a lot better. But that being said, I've been part of the framework with the executive team building the near-term and long-term plans for the business and feel really confident about what we have put forward based on the momentum based on what I see, I am very much supportive of how KT has put together is free cash flow framework around the levers we have around the resilient business and the layer cake growth opportunities we have that Jim articulated. So, from a perspective of me being new, it's actually me having spent meaningful time here making sure I was comfortable with the things that we heard on the call and the go-forward perspective of the business. So, feel good about that with the layer cake growth strategy as well as a very disciplined approach to make sure free cash flow is something we stay very much focused in on."

            "name": "Kristian Talvitie",
            "content": "Thanks Neil. And let me start off by reiterating Jim's ringing endorsement. It's been great getting to know you and I'm looking forward to working with you to drive customer and shareholder value. Turning to slide 13, I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance, and ARR references will be in both constant currency and as-reported. In Q3 2023, our constant currency ARR was $1.89 billion, up 25% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. On an organic constant currency basis, excluding ServiceMax, our ARR was $1.7 billion, up 14% year-over-year. In Q3, our as-reported ARR was $61 million higher than our constant currency ARR on a year-over-year basis, currency fluctuations were neutral to growth in Q3. As Jim explained, our solid topline in Q3 was broad-based across all geographies and product groups. I'm sure many of you have been following the manufacturing PMIs due to the historical correlation with our topline when we operated a perpetual business model many years ago. The global manufacturing PMI peaked in December 2021 and has been under 50 for almost a year now. The Eurozone PMI has been particularly weak. In contrast to those trends, our topline, including in Europe, has continued to grow. Our subscription business model and low churn rates make our ARR resilient and demand for digital transformation continues across our customer base. In Q3, our ARR benefited from some timing, which we factored into our guidance for Q4. Naturally, we also took the outlook for bookings, churn, start dates, deferred ARR into account when we raised the midpoint of our fiscal 2023 ARR guidance range. Moving on to cash flow, our results were strong with Q3 cash from operations of $169 million and free cash flow of $164 million, coming in ahead of our guidance. This performance was driven by continued strong execution based on our foundation of solid collections and cost discipline. In addition, we had a net timing benefit of approximately $5 million in Q3. So, keep that in mind as we go through our Q4 cash flow guidance in a few minutes. When assessing and forecasting our cash flow, it's always good to remember a few things. The majority of our collections occur in the first half of our fiscal year. Q4 is our lowest cash flow generation quarter, and on an annual basis, free cash flow is primarily a function of ARR rather than revenue. Q3 revenue of $542 million increased $80 million or 17% year-over-year and was up 21% on a constant currency basis. In Q3, recurring revenue grew by $83 million, partially offset by a $3 million decline in professional services revenue. The decline in professional services revenue is consistent with Jim's mix conversation, including our strategy to transition some of our professional services revenue to DxP Services, our partner for Windchill + lift and shift projects. As we've discussed previously, revenue is impacted by ASC 606, so we do not believe that revenue is the best indicator of our underlying business performance, but would rather guide you to ARR as the best metric to understand our topline performance and cash generation potential. Moving to slide 14, we ended the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $282 million. Our gross debt was $2.365 billion with an aggregate interest rate of 5.6%. During Q3, we paid down $180 million of debt and at the end of Q3, we had $1 billion in high-yield notes, a $500 million term loan, and approximately $245 million drawn on our revolver. We have a second payment for the ServiceMax transaction due in October 23 of $650 million of which $620 million is already reflected as debt on our balance sheet and $30 million of imputed interest will be reflected in our Q1 2024 cash flow. We intend to fund this payment with cash on hand and our revolving credit facility. The deferred payment is included in debt on our balance sheet, as I just mentioned, and is factored into our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, which was three times at the end of Q3. We expect to be at or below three times levered by the end of Q4 and below three times levered throughout fiscal 2024. Given the interest rate environment, we continue to prioritize paying down our debt in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024. We've paused our share repurchase program and expect our diluted share count to increase by approximately 1 million shares in fiscal 2023. We expect to have substantially reduced our debt by the end of fiscal 2024 and will then revisit the prioritization of debt paydown and share repurchases. Despite this interruption, our long-term goal, assuming our debt-to-EBITDA ratio is below three times remains to return approximately 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases, while also taking into consideration the interest rate environment and strategic opportunities. Next, slide 15 shows our ARR by product group. In the constant currency section on the top half of the slide, we use FX rates as of September 30, 2022, to calculate ARR for all periods. You can see on the slide how FX dynamics have resulted in differences between our constant currency ARR and as-reported ARR over the past seven quarters. Based on exchange rates at the end of Q3 2023, our as-reported ARR at the end of fiscal 2023 would be higher by approximately $64 million compared to the midpoint of our constant currency guidance. We report both actual and constant currency results and FX fluctuations can have a material impact on actuals. But remember that we provide ARR guidance on a constant currency basis. If exchange rates fluctuate significantly between the end of Q3 and Q4, the impact to our as-reported ARR would also change. We believe constant currency is the best way to evaluate the topline performance of our business because it removes FX fluctuations from the analysis, positive or negative. With that, I'll take you through our guidance on slide 16. For all ARR guidance amounts, we are using our constant currency FX rates, which again, are as of September 30, 2022. For fiscal 2023, we expect constant currency ARR of $1.935 to $1.95 billion, which corresponds to constant currency ARR growth of 23% to 24%. We raised the low end of our guidance by $10 million, so the midpoint of our ARR guidance is up $5 million. On cash flows, we are again raising our fiscal 2023 cash flow guidance. We're now targeting cash from operations of approximately $605 million and free cash flow of approximately $585 million. As I pointed out last quarter, I think it's worth highlighting that we're raising our cash flow guidance for the year, while we have also been increasing investments in select growth opportunities for our business in the back half. The important point is that the resilience of our business model enables us to maintain core long-term investments even in a turbulent macro environment. In addition to that, as a baseline, we adjust shorter term investments accordingly, given our business performance and outlook. The result is solid and consistent cash flow growth. We maintain consistent billings practices, and we've optimized our processes around billings and payments over the past two to three years. Because of this, the quarterly seasonality of our free cash flow results has been very consistent over the past two years, and we're on track to deliver similar quarterly linearity in fiscal 2023 as well. For Q4, we're guiding to free cash flow of approximately $42 million. We expect approximately $2 million of CapEx in Q4, and therefore, our cash from operations guidance is approximately $44 million. Note, that we made acquisition and restructuring-related payments of $11 million through the first three quarters of the year, of which $3 million was paid in Q3. And we plan $11 million of payments in Q4, which we've also factored into our free cash flow guidance. Going forward, we also plan to provide full year and quarterly guidance for both revenue and EPS. We continue to believe that revenue and EPS are not good measures of our business performance. And internally, we look at ARR as our primary topline metric and free cash flow as our primary bottom-line metric. That said, the public scorecard is still often revenue and EPS. And while we have consistently met or beat on ARR and free cash flow over the past few years, we sometimes score a miss on revenue or EPS against metrics that we've not even guided to quarterly. So, now we're going to start guiding to both revenue and EPS on a quarterly basis. The EPS ranges we're providing are aligned with our revenue guidance ranges, which appropriately allow for a broad range of outcomes given ASC 606-related dynamics. For fiscal 2023, we've narrowed our revenue guidance range and primarily due to FX fluctuations, we lowered our revenue guidance midpoint by $5 million. Our fiscal 2023 revenue guidance range is $2.09 billion to $2.12 billion and for Q4, we're guiding to $540 million to $570 million. As a reminder, ASC 606 makes revenue fairly difficult to predict in the short term for on-premise subscription company. More importantly, revenue does not influence ARR or cash generation as we typically bill customers annually upfront regardless of contract term length. Moving on to EPS. For fiscal 2023, we expect GAAP EPS of $2.14 to $2.45 and non-GAAP EPS of $4.07 to $4.38. For Q4, our guidance range is $0.47 to $0.77 for GAAP and $0.95 to $1.25 for non-GAAP. Since revenue is impacted by ASC 606, it's important to remember that earnings per share is also impacted. Now that I've taken you through our guidance, let's quickly review how our guidance has progressed this year on slide 17. First, looking at ARR, as you'll recall, when we began fiscal 2023, we had a constant currency ARR growth range of 10% to 14%, given the uncertain macro environment. There's no doubt that we're operating in a difficult macro backdrop, but even still, we've been able to deliver solid results, taking the low end up every quarter this year. And now with our fiscal 2023 ARR guidance midpoint is for a 13% constant currency organic constant currency growth. As we begin to think about next year, while we're not guiding fiscal 2024 at this point. I think it's safe to assume that we will weigh our end market opportunity, pipeline, momentum and also try to consider the macro environment at the time. Assuming the current macro environment continues, I would not be surprised to see an ARR guidance set up similar to this year going into next year. And much like this year, I would think that we would expect to deliver a free cash flow result within our previously guided fiscal 2024 range regardless of the ARR outcome for the year in macro environment will be more judicious with our spending and in a more favorable topline environment, we are likely to invest more in the business. Because of the stability of the business model, we have a lot of room to match run rate topline inflows or cash generation with run rate expense investments, which are primarily headcount and COGS expenses related to SaaS delivery. I think we have proven that we will actively manage our investments in line with the macro and momentum -- business momentum we're seeing. Looking at our free cash flow guidance progression, we've been able to raise our guidance every quarter this year. We started the year guiding for 35% free cash flow growth and we're now guiding to 41% growth. Turning to slide 18, here's an illustrative constant currency ARR model. You can see our results over the past seven quarters, and the column on the right illustrates what's needed to get to the midpoint of our constant currency ARR guidance for Q4 of fiscal 2023. Because our ARR tends to see some seasonality, the most relevant comparison is the sequential growth in Q4 of 2022. The illustrative model indicates that to hit the midpoint of our Q4 2023 guidance range of $1.943 billion, we need to add $75 million of ARR on a sequential basis. This is $1 million less than the $76 million we added in Q4 of fiscal 2022. All things considered, we believe we've set our constant currency ARR guidance range prudently. Summarizing then on slide 19. First, we have a strong portfolio and strategy. This year, we've expanded our clear category leadership role in PLM, which has become a technology backbone for digital transformation and industrial company. The addition of ServiceMax further extends what was already a unique portfolio of interconnected digital thread capabilities across the full product life cycle. Second, our strong execution with organic growth at double-digit levels already. We're in the early days, but executing well against a major on-premise to SaaS transformation that should provide a multiyear growth tailwind. And as Jim explained, it's a massive oversimplification to focus only on SaaS as the growth driver for PTC. We continue to benefit from the cumulative layers of PTC-specific growth drivers, including driving customer expansion through cross-selling our unique portfolio. Third, we have a well-earned reputation for driving margin expansion that goes back more than a decade. We've been demonstrating that we're judicious with our investments, being mindful of both long-term opportunities and near-term macro uncertainty, from a cost and operational perspective, we're lean and a continuous improvement mindset is part of PTC's culture. Fourth, with the organic ARR growth in the low teens, juxtaposed against PMIs that are generally in the mid-40s. I trust you would agree that we're actively demonstrating that our business model is very resilient. Our topline growth and bottom-line profitability are approaching peer leadership levels. And finally, we're led by a team that has deep expertise and a proven ability to drive growth and margin expansion. For sure, the environment around us will continue to change, and we will continue to adapt accordingly while still pushing the envelope of what we can do for our customers. We're continuing to make progress towards our midterm guidance targets. In a challenging macro environment, we've been able to deliver solid ARR growth year-to-date in fiscal 2023. We have confidence in continued double-digit ARR growth and our free cash flow target for fiscal 2024 despite the macro uncertainty that continues to persist. We feel good about our midterm growth aspirations and cash flow targets as well. With so many positive trends going our way, we continue to believe PTC has a tremendous opportunity to continue to drive shareholder value. So, with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator to begin Q&A. Yes. So hey Jason, first of all, and thanks for the question. I think the point that we're making without really guiding for fiscal 2024 yet. Let's get through 2023 and actually see what the macro looks like and what the pipeline and everything actually continues to shape up to looking like. But we provided a fairly wide guidance range, 10% to 14% as we started fiscal 2023 that allowed for considerable amount of macro uncertainty. We've certainly seen that and I think that we would look for -- I wouldn't be surprised to see a similar setup as we start next year. Yes. And hey Matt, just back to your question on the uplift. We would expect, obviously, an uplift for Creo Plus as well, although I don't think it's going to be quite the 2x, it will be a little bit less than that. out of the gates, somewhere probably somewhere closer to, I don't know, 1.7-ish, maybe 1.7, 1.8, somewhere in that ballpark. Hey Steve. So, actually, we're trying to stay focused on ARR and free cash flow and really ARR and sequential ARR and thinking about that framework. The trick with bookings is there's so many different dynamics to it that you just got to keep you on back layers and layers and layers and to be honest, it all nets out in the ARR number and the ARR guidance anyways. So, I mean, as we evolve this guidance process, I think you'll remember what we said last year about -- or last quarter about expectations and where we think that would land us for the full year. Obviously, now we took the low end up for the full year. We mentioned some timing issues. You obviously saw that we beat the sequential ARR or the ARR guidance for Q3. So, I think all that nets out in how we're feeling about the business and the pipeline from that perspective. Yes, it was actually 10 to 14. And yes, that would be organic constant currency. Yes, that's exactly right. I mean, again, really, the way that we look at the business is ARR and free cash flow. Revenue is very volatile, not necessarily for performance reasons, but for accounting reasons. And it really doesn't tell you anything about the performance of the business in any given quarter or even trended just because varying term lengths caused so much volatility that you actually can't really use revenue and therefore, really the full P&L as barometer of business performance. But that said, we also recognize that the investment community when doing comparative analysis and so on, does actually still refer to revenue and EPS. And as I said, there's a scorecard out there, and we look at the ARR and free cash flow scorecard and say, hey, great, we're actually doing good. We're meeting or beating expectations. And then on revenue and EPS, where we don't provide quarterly guidance, then everybody's left up to their own devices to define what that might be on a quarterly or a quarterly basis for revenue and EPS. Sometimes we miss on the scorecard. We score a miss. And so we're really just trying to be more proactive about that and provide some -- provide some of our color to-- Jim is always makes much more sense. Hey Matt, it's Kristian. So, the timing benefit was a few million dollars, and it just has to do with when contracts are actually getting behind, is basically what it boils down to. I mean, deals are being worked for, in many cases, many months. And it just has to do with that really. Yes, I mean, again, we're not really going to guide fiscal 2024 at this point, but we have mid-teens growth aspirations over the midterm. I think that Jim did a great job kind of outlining a lot of the various growth drivers that help stack up to delivering on that kind of growth, then you have to overlay the macro and understand how that's impacting in any given period. But as we said, I'd be surprised if we had a -- I wouldn't be surprised if we had a similar guidance set up to last year. So, we think that whatever low to mid-teens growth is sustainable. And demonstrated you not to answer the previous question about which of Jim's children do you like. Great question. And the children over time will be constructively across the whole digital thread. But in this regard of ServiceMax and SLM the cross-sell value that we're seeing and the momentum that we're building in a material deal that we closed out this past quarter was an evolution of an already significant customer of PTC for a number of years. And quite frankly, for the last three years, we've been trying to win it as a stand-alone business at ServiceMax when we put the companies together, went through LiveWorx and explain the closed loop -- model-based closed-loop digital thread strategy with PLM and SLM and the things that we could do to provide value for the customer, it was a no-brainer and there's no competitor that the actual industrial manufacturer out of Europe here had a choice to actually go to someone different. And so that thread and what we're doing to answer your second part of your question is across the collective customer base that has PLM and all the other categories that PTC has sold, we're actually integrating in the SLM portfolio and really showing the customer value and we've only started, as Jim mentioned, again, a material deal, and we feel confident that we're building the right pipeline and the energy around the customer really seeing a differentiated offer across this closed loop that we've been articulating as our strategy. Yes. Hey Saket, thanks for the question. I mean I do think as the CPI continues to trend down in the -- we start to see a little bit more stability in the overall macro environment that will also be reflected in pricing strategy. So, I would expect that we would see normal kind of normal price increases again, absent some abnormal -- extremely abnormal macro situation. But that's what I would expect we'd start to see more normalized pricing action. Similarly, what we did similar to what we've done prior to COVID. Andrew, it's Kristian. So, if you're referring to the comments that we were talking about kind of increased investment in the back half and growth drivers that's been primarily in continued investment in Windchill + in Codebeamer, in particular, to name a couple. And I mean we're in a difficult environment right now."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Jim Heppelmann",
            "content": "Thanks Matt. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. You probably noticed that we have some additional news regarding CEO succession to cover today. So, I'll kick off with an overview of Q3, but skip the normal customer commentary to allow time for the succession discussion. I trust that many of you had a good chance to interact directly with customers at a recent LiveWorx event and I hope that will carry you for a while. Starting with Q3 results then, I'm pleased to report that in Q3, PTC again delivered solid results. As you know, we feel that ARR and free cash flow are the best metrics to assess the performance of our business. In Q3, we exceeded our guidance on both metrics, and today, we are again raising our full year ARR guidance midpoint as well as our full year guidance for free cash flow. As usual, I'll focus my discussion on constant currency results when discussing topline metrics, and Kristian will outline currency effects later in the call. Starting with the topline metric of ARR on slide four. In Q3, we came in at $1.868 billion, which was above the high end of our guidance range and up 25% year-over-year. Organic ARR growth accelerated slightly to 14%. ServiceMax contributed the extra 11 points of inorganic growth to bridge us to the overall 25% growth rate. We passed the one-year anniversary of acquiring Codebeamer, so we're now counting Codebeamer in our organic ARR results. Though the manufacturing PMIs continue to indicate a sluggish environment globally, our topline ARR continues to show good resilience. In Q3, we saw broad-based ARR strength across all product groups and geographies and our churn results remain good. Given strong year-to-date results, together with a solid pipeline and outlook for Q4, we're raising our full year ARR guidance midpoint. As I mentioned, Kristian will provide the details later. Moving to slide five and switching to our bottom-line view, we delivered $164 million of free cash flow in Q3, ahead of our guidance and up 46% year-over-year. Remember that ARR is the primary driver of cash flow, so this result was driven by a combination of strong ARR growth and higher operating efficiency. We raised our key free cash flow guidance for the year. Kristian will elaborate on that as well. Turning to slide six. Let's look at ARR growth by geography. ARR growth in the Americas was 29%. In Europe, ARR growth was 24%. And in APAC, ARR growth was 16%. On a global basis, FX was neutral to our year-on-year growth in Q3, but regionally, FX continued to be a growth tailwind in Asia, whereas it's a growth headwind in Europe. All three regions benefited from inorganic growth to varying degrees due to the acquisition of ServiceMax. Speaking of ServiceMax, we saw our first cross-sell activity happened in the quarter and while it's still quite early in the integration process, there is a nice cross-sell pipeline building, which bodes well for the future. Next, let's look at the ARR performance of our product groups on slide seven. In CAD, which is those products that enable authoring of product data, we delivered 11% ARR growth in Q3 in a market that's been growing an estimated 7%. Within these results, the growth was primarily driven by Creo, but supplemented by strong percentage growth in Onshape. PTC is clearly taking share in different parts of the CAD market with both products. In PLM, which includes those products that enable data and process management, our ARR growth rate in Q3 was 36% and or 16% organic with the incremental inorganic growth coming from ServiceMax. In PLM, we continue to significantly outperform the market, which has been growing an estimated 8% in core PLL. ARR growth for PLM in Q3 was primarily driven by Windchill, supplemented by strong organic percentage growth in ALM and SLM. Clearly, we're taking significant share in the PLM market as well. Turning to slide eight, I want to double-click on our ARR growth strategy because we've been fielding many investor questions regarding how we've been able to perform so well on the growth front as compared to peers and whether this differential growth is sustainable. Some investors think we've shifted from one growth strategy to another over the years, but we see it very differently. In our view, we have consistently layered new growth strategies on top of existing growth strategies to create additional tailwinds that fuel faster growth. Let me explain. Our growth strategy starts at the bottom of the chart where we participate in CAD and PLM markets that are growing in the upper single-digit range. So, that is our baseline. On top of this, our products are very strong competitively, which has allowed us to take some incremental market share and outgrow our peers. Then back in fiscal 2014, we launched our IoT business, which will be more than $200 million of ARR this year and continuing to grow at a rate that's accretive to company growth. Perhaps the single biggest driver of growth was unleashed in 2015 when we launched the full-on transition from a perpetual and maintenance model to a subscription business model. This was a short-term pain for long-term gain type of strategy, and I'm pleased to say the pain bottomed out in fiscal 2017 and faded in fiscal 2019 and we've been enjoying the long-term gain and growth rate ever since. Simply put, a recurring model with sticky software creates much more growth than does a perpetual model even at the same level of new seed sales. That's why companies like PTC cross the Valley of Death to get there. You can refer to our FY 2021 investor deck where we took investors through the math model that shows how much easier it is to grow a sticky recurring business model than a perpetual one. Following that, we put a strong focus on commercial improvements, such as improved churn, improved discounting and price optimization. And then redoubled our efforts in these areas when we entered the COVID and inflationary periods. Collectively, these improvements have created incremental tailwinds to company growth rates, and we think there's more to be done here going forward. We could have been satisfied to stop there, but we didn't. We saw the CAD and PLM markets beginning to pivot towards SaaS, which led us to acquire the peer SaaS Onshape and Arena businesses. These businesses continue to be growth tailwinds as the growth is accretive to PTC's overall growth rate. Then in fiscal 2022, we decided to bring the SaaS phenomenon that was driving strong Onshape and Arena growth to our core CAD and PLM business, which we did using the Atlas platform that leveraged Onshape technology. This strategy allows us to land larger ARR run rates because we're selling both the software and the service to deliver it. And of course, now we can expand the existing on-premise customer base ARR run rates by shifting customers to SaaS and upselling to include the value of the delivery service the customer now gets from PTC. Frankly, this growth driver is in its early stages and its impact is minor right now compared to what it promises to contribute in the coming years. Because we already enjoy strong growth independent of this SaaS driver, you should consider that SaaS is not our growth strategy per se, it's just another tailwind that helps in our quest to drive our growth rates higher. Finally, during fiscal 2022 and 2023, we made smart acquisitions like Codebeamer for the ALM part of our PLM strategy and ServiceMax for the SLM part of our PLM strategy. On a standalone basis, these businesses are growing faster than PTC. And of course, these growth tailwinds will increase as we further develop the cross-sell synergies we're pursuing. Cross-sell is already becoming meaningful for Codebeamer now and looks very promising for ServiceMax where we're still quite early in the process. So, when an investor asks what is driving the 14% organic growth that PTC is reporting this quarter? The answer really is all of it, except of course, ServiceMax, which is not yet factored into the organic calculation, but will be in a few quarters. For those who questioned whether this level of ARR growth is sustainable, I'd first like to point out that fiscal 2023 will be the seventh consecutive year of double-digit ARR growth across good macro setups and bad. And indeed, ARR growth has generally been accelerating over that time as more of these growth drivers came into play. I'd also point out that several of these drivers should be more impactful going forward, whereas none of them show signs of fading away. The sluggish macro, no doubt has cost us a small amount of growth here in fiscal 2023, but past history suggests we'll get it back when macro conditions improve. Bottom-line is we feel very confident that PTC is positioned to deliver sustained double-digit ARR growth at or near the top of our peer group. Most importantly, please keep in mind that it is ARR, not revenue that drives free cash flow at PTC. On the subject of free cash flow, then, let's turn to slide nine where I'd like to double-click on the dramatic increase in margins that we've been driving, which raises similar investor questions of how and for how long. Our strong margin expansion, best measured using our operating efficiency metric, starts with the bottom four strategies we've been driving for many years. The first and biggest expansion driver has been the mix shift from professional services to software. Before this transformation, our revenue had a roughly 25% mix of low-margin professional services, whereas currently, we're at about 7% professional services mix on our way to a 5% mix thanks to the recent arrangement to sell a portion of our professional services business to ITCI in the form of DxP Services. In turn, the large system integrator partner ecosystem we built has become a critical part of our growth strategy as SIs help create software demand in order to drive demand for their own services. We've been backfilling the low-margin services mix with high-margin software all along. And by the time we get to our 5% services mix target, the cumulative effect of this mix shift will be about 10 points of margin expansion. We feel the negative impact to revenue growth from declining services revenue over the years has been more than justified by the positive impact of the higher profit software mix to our margins and free cash flow. Said differently, the quality of PTC's revenue has increased dramatically. At the next level, a second big driver of margin expansion has been our go-to-market improvements, which had dramatically increased the productivity of our salesforce over the years. In particular, our development of a strong cross-sell muscle has been very helpful to sales productivity and naturally, we leverage this key strategy whenever we bring acquired products into the mix like Codebeamer and ServiceMax. The third big driver in this group is our R&D offshoring program, which allows us to maintain relatively rich resourcing against more moderate spending levels. We tend to have a higher degree of offshoring than peers, and we have consistently proliferated this strategy across our portfolio and into acquisitions that we make. On a non-GAAP basis, year-to-date R&D spending is around 16% of revenue, but R&D accounts for 37% of our employee base. Our largest offshore site is the PTC R&D center in India that will celebrate its 30th anniversary next year. So, you can see we have an incredibly deep pool of talent and expertise there. The fourth item to point out is the portfolio rebalancing, we do as part of our planning every year to ensure that our resources are best positioned to drive growth while maximizing profitability. This strategy essentially boiled down to driving low-growth businesses at very high margins while driving moderate growth businesses at good margins, thus reserving sufficient dry powder to invest more aggressively to develop new high-growth businesses like Onshape, all while retaining an attractive and expanding company margin profile. The next layer, the margin strategy is to leverage the benefits of scale that a recurring subscription business offers. Because growth in ARR requires relatively little growth in terms of variable costs, we've been doing a good job following our rule of thumb that on average, our costs will rise at half the rate of ARR growth, helping to drive expanding margins year after year. The improving commercial discipline around churn, discounting and price optimization that I previously mentioned as a growth driver is obviously a margin driver, too, since our input costs are essentially the same independent of churn, discount and price levels. The incremental growth we get here comes at nearly 100% margin. Finally, the changes we made in fiscal 2021 to align our field organization to SaaS organizational principles, Together with the operational rebalancing we did in fiscal 2022 to better align spending with our growth outlook in IoT and ARR have been big margin drivers because they've allowed us to meet incremental resourcing needs without incremental hiring. Our IoT business, for example, now has mid-teens operating efficiency margins while being accretive to company growth. Similar then to what I said about ARR growth, the significant margin expansion we're delivering here in fiscal 2023 is really due to all of the above factors. In my view, these gains are fully sustainable with more to come in the future. As Kristian and I have said previously, we expect our operating efficiency margin to expand to 40% by fiscal 2025 and expect we can get to mid-40s longer term. So, we continue to have a lot of runway here. Moving on to slide 10 then. I'd like to discuss our plans for CEO succession. I feel the company is in great shape in terms of topline and bottom-line growth with multiple layers of initiatives that can sustain this performance well into the future. I trust you see we're continuing to demonstrate the resilience of our business as our growth powers on while PMI trends in the wrong direction. So, for me, with more than 25 years under my belt now at PTC, half that time as CEO, I think it's a perfect time to think about putting a new generation of leadership in place that can sustain this high level of success well into the future. I love this company, and I'm very proud of all that's been accomplished during my time here, but life is calling me to a new chapter in following the succession I plan to retire from traditional management roles. PTC's Board has given careful consideration to who should be PTC's next leader and how we could best transition this person into the role to preserve our strategy and momentum. Our Board engaged Korn Ferry's CEO succession practice to determine what characteristics were most important in our next CEO and to vet our internal candidates and to consider external candidates. That careful process led us to an ideal successor in Neil Barua, the former CEO of ServiceMax. Neil is smart in articulate and he knows our industry. He's been a CEO twice already, yet still has a lot of career runway. He has a finance background, but really leans in with customers and product strategies. He's developed great followership within PTC already. And by the time, Neil become CEO, he will have spent more than a year coming up to speed as a PTC insider. We are set up to have a seamless transition that offers complete continuity in the company's strategy and performance. So, effective now we've made a series of changes that initiate the transition process. I have been named Chairman and CEO and with plans for the CEO role to transfer to Neil on February 14th, 2024, which is the date of our next Annual Shareholders Meeting. Neil has been appointed to the Board and has been given the title of CEO Elect. Neil and I will work together over the coming six months to ensure Neil has ample opportunity to get to know our important customer, employee, and shareholder constituencies and to transition my knowledge, relationships, and responsibilities to him. Given that I'm a non-independent Chairman by definition, the Board has appointed experienced Director, Janice Chaffin, to be Lead Independent Director. Neil will inherit and be surrounded by an excellent team that fully supports him. Mike DiTullio, will continue to head our operations as President and COO. Kristian Talvitie will continue to head our financial strategy as CFO. Likewise, other PTC executives, such as our Chief Product Officer, Chief Technology Officer, Chief Strategy Officer, Chief Legal Counsel, and Chief Human Resources Officer, will remain in place throughout the transition and beyond. This transition should be very smooth. The bottom-line is that the Board chose a great successor whom I fully endorse and who has the support of the entire team. I'm very happy for Neil and for myself, I might add, that we could find such an elegant way to transition PTC leadership into what promises to be an exciting and successful next phase for the company. With that, I'd like to turn to slide 11 and ask Neil to spend a few minutes introducing himself before we move back to Christian for additional commentary regarding results and guidance. Neil? Yes, I think as we reflect on it, how we guided and how the year has transpired, we're pleased with the guidance. We're pleased with how resilient the business was. We're pleased with the fact that we've been able to ratchet the guidance up, but it feels like that was a good approach. Yes, Kristian, why don't I take the first half of the question and the customer reaction and you take the uplift, part. So, yes, we have, I'd say, good momentum out of the blocks. I mean, in the first quarter, introducing it in the middle of the quarter, we didn't expect to necessarily do a lot of business. But actually, our first order came from a customer was at LiveWorx and said, wow, that's kind of what we're looking for. And that's a customer incidentally who was planning to add multiple CAD systems right now and was planning to standardize on 1 kind of had a preference for Creo and then came to LiveWorx and said, what we really want is Creo Plus. So, that example of a relatively short sales cycle from a company who was pretty impressed with the technology and some of the advantages it brings. So I think the reaction is good. I mean it's very, very early. And so we shouldn't get ahead of ourselves. But it's always good to get out of the blocks fast and I feel like we did with Creo Plus in the quarter. Thank you. Hi. Well, thank you. Just if I could kind of add -- reiterate some points. We don't think these are meaningful metrics. We prefer not to miss them anyway. So, we're going to give you some guidance. I'm going to give you some guidance set your targets in the right place. All right. Thank you, Steve. Yes, I mean it's the start date phenomenon that Kristian always talks about sometimes it's pretty typical that we signed a contract in this quarter. Sometimes it starts in this quarter, sometimes it starts next quarter. Sometimes it then ramps or not. So, just what we call in-quarter starts if it started in Q3 rather than Q4, well, it had helped Q3, but then it came out of Q4. So, that's really what we're talking about. Yes, I think we can talk about it. I mean, I think at a high level, in the past several quarters, three quarters probably, we've talked about SMB being a challenge, China being a challenge. I think that continues particularly pockets of SMB, our arena business is not at the growth level it was previously. But that's not new news. That's kind of been here for multiple quarters already. And I think in Europe, we're actually surprised at how well we're doing, given some of the macro data points, the PMIs, stuff like that. So, it's sort of the same story as before, inside an uncertain environment, there's a few pockets of weakness. Most of the GOs and products are kind of doing just fine, and then there's some real pockets of strength, too. Like we've said before, Aerospace and Defense, for example, happens to be pocket of strength, medical device happens to be a pocket of strength. So, it's kind of a mixed bag. I think it nets out for the year to less favorable than I want to be. And I said we did slow down a bit. I mean, we exited last year with 15% growth. And this year, at the midpoint, we're calling 13%, but the year is not over. So, it could be we lose a point, point and a half of growth this year, two points maybe, I don't know. But I'll tell you what, that's pretty darn good in this environment. And it's certainly better than any of our peers have been able to do in this environment. So, we feel proud about it and feel confident going forward that this is a very growth-oriented sustainable, resilient business and it's not likely to change dramatically from that. And one other thing I'd say, we've also experienced in the past that when there's a slowdown, for example, in some of these pockets like, let's say, arena, when the environment improves, we get a surge as all of that business come trickling in now because people have authorization to go forward with this project, they've had sitting on the shelf for a while. So, we saw this in 2009, we saw in 2020. In 2020 Q2 and Q3 were pretty weak, and we had a blockbuster Q4 and kind of made up for all of it. So, I also think our view is probably when the environment improves, and I'm not sure when that will be, probably, we'll get a surge of strength as some of these projects that have been held back by the customers get funded again. Yes, I think I'll take that one, Jay. It's probably not fair yet to pin on Neil, but maybe on the next call. But for this call, I'll take it. So, I think, first of all, I don't want to pick one thing, and that's kind of a message here is it's not like just one good thing happening at PTC. There's a whole stack of good things. But nonetheless, I think you would agree, we have a very strong PLM position and we've been taking share for years with PLM. In fact, you suggested it went from third place to second place and then I think we've gone the first place. So, PLM is a strength and I don't see that dying anytime soon. Now, that said, we acquired a real strength in ALM with Codebeamer, and that is a hot market. particularly in some places like automotive, which is a massive industry. I think most of you know, there's three to four software engineers per mechanical engineer in automotive development right now across all companies. So, that's a hot place to be, and we have a hot product in Codebeamer. And then I'd say in SLM, we have an offering that's pretty much unmatched. And particularly so when you take ServiceMax, the strategy we outlined at LiveWorx Service Max with Arbortext, with Servigistics, with ThingWorx, IoT with Vuforia ARR. There's just nothing to go against that, frankly, and certainly not anything model-based close-loop life cycle. I mean, the nearest thing we could point to in a competitor there would be like IFS, which is kind of a Swedish mainframe company. Not really over Siemens or anybody like that. So, I think we have some real strengths. But again, I don't think there's one. I think we have a portfolio of advantages we've been developing and will play out in our favor. Yes. Jay, my tenure is almost marked. Yes. Thank you. Yes. So, I mean, at a high level, we had a previous offering called Integrity, which had aged, let's say, over the years. And Codebeamer is a much newer kind of cutting-edge product. It's got great functionality, great usability supports all the Agile principles that embedded software developers also want to adopt now, but at the same time, provides the regulatory framework that they need to develop against. So, it's a great product. I think it's best in class and it's a hot market. So, we've been doing very well with these big auto companies that you would all know, you all know the names of. And I think we're going to land a few more here in the coming quarters. But -- it's certainly been accretive. I said last quarter, if you remember, that we had 13% growth, but if you'd let me look at Codebeamer a little differently, it had been 14 and now this quarter is 14%. So, you see that Codebeamer while not a big business, is performing well enough to lift the organic business up by as much as 100 basis points. And I can add in -- to give him some kudos here, he's ahead of plan on the free cash flow of ServiceMax. So, he gets it. I mean you know that cash flow comes from growth and careful application of spending and he's had a plan. Yes and I think that one was fortunate because LiveWorx made the lightbulb come on, and then we had a very short sales cycle. So I certainly I certainly hope we can have other such short sales cycles, that's atypical. But I think the light bulb went on for a lot of companies at LiveWorx, there was a lot written about it, if you've seen that. So, it was great support for the concept of the physical and digital, the closed loop model-based closed-loop product life cycle management concept. So, I'm very optimistic, and there are numerous deals in the pipeline. They just didn't happen to close quick enough to get done in the quarter. Good. Hey Andrew. Yes, I don't think it's ready to be a layer in the layer cake yet, Andrew, but it could head that way because certainly, there's a lot more industry buzz, a lot more people saying, what should we be doing? A lot of engineers saying, what does AI mean to engineering. And there's a lot of work going on at PTC, as you would expect, say, what else could we do? And of course, there's two dimensions of that. What can we do in our products that would create more value for our customers. And then secondarily, what can we do in our operations that would make us more productive. So, there's a lot of things happening here. And then we do have these three capabilities in the market already. So, I don't think that deserves yet to be a layer in that layer cake of growth drivers, but hey, let's try to develop it into one. I know that's on Neil's list. Yes, I think -- maybe I'll try a start, Kristian, you can help. So, I mean, the factors that build up ARR are fundamentally bookings and churn, but we can leave deferred and all that stuff out of the discussion for a minute. We've seen no evidence of increased churn in bad macro environments. We did not see it in 2009. We did not see it in 2020, and we have not seen it this year. So, I just feel like our software when it goes into production has always stayed in full production in terms of at least anyway, churn rates being the same. So, I'm going to take that off the table. I just -- there's no data through three down cycles to suggest that's vulnerable. And then as you go to bookings, I mean we've been clear, we've already seen some pressure in pockets. And when Kristian said some time ago that we -- our expectation was flat organic bookings for the year, well, we had probably hoped to do better than that. So, I think that's where we feel the pressure. But again, we gave some scenarios a year ago when we guided this 10 to 14 and said, We can actually withstand quite a bit of bookings pressure and still deliver some pretty impressive ARR results and off that, some pretty impressive free cash flow numbers. So, again, the business model is quite resilient, and it's because it's a recurring model with a low churn rate, I mean, fundamentally. So, you can go back and review that guidance. We're not really trying to guide the next year here, but I think the low end of the scenario was 30% bookings decline, which kind of matched more or less what we saw in 2009, but of course, the metrics were a little bit different then. But anyway, we sort of feel like even in a difficult environment, we can post some peer-leading growth rates and off that, peer-leading free cash flow growth rates because of the nature of the business. Okay, great. Well, thank you all, and thank you for the kind comments for both Neil and myself. We appreciate that. A lot of news here. We're going to be quite active on the Investor Relations circuit here over the next quarter, this current quarter. Starting with callbacks, which Neil and I will both participate in. We're planning to be in New York, Tuesday of next week. We don't have the details quite nailed down yet, so look for an e-mail from Matt, Shamal. And then PTC people, various different people are going to attend the KeyBanc Virtual Road Show on the 31st of July. We're going to the KeyBanc Annual Technology Leadership Forum in Vail on August 7th and the 28th, we're going to be at the Stifel Tech Executive Summit in Deer Valley. And we're going to as well be at the Citi 2023 Global Tech Conference in New York City on September 6th. So, you'll have ample opportunities to talk to us. We're looking forward -- lots of good stuff happening in the business. We think this CEO succession is good and healthy and careful and will be continuous and everybody is happy about it. So, thanks a lot for your time, and I appreciate the support and look forward to seeing you on the road or at the next earnings call as the case may be. Thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the PTC 2023 Second Quarter Conference Call. During todays presentation all parties will be in a listen-only mode, following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions.  I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Matt Shimao, PTC's Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nMatt Shimao: Good afternoon. Thank you, Lisa, and welcome to PTC's Fiscal 2023 second quarter conference call. On the call today are Jim Heppelmann, Chief Executive Officer; and Kristian Talvitie, Chief Financial Officer. Today's conference call is being broadcast live through an audio webcast, and a replay of the call will be available later today at www.ptc.com. During this call, PTC will make forward-looking statements, including guidance as to future operating results. Because such statements deal with future events, actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements can be found in PTC's annual report on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as well as in today's press release.  The forward-looking statements, including guidance provided during this call are valid only as of today's date, April 26, 2023, and PTC assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. During the call, PTC will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted the common principles. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in today's press release made available on our website. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to PTC's Chief Executive Officer, Jim Heppelmann.\nJim Heppelmann: Thanks, Matt. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to report PTC delivered strong results in our second fiscal quarter of 2023. As you know, we feel that ARR and free cash flow are the best metrics to assess the performance of our business. We exceeded our guidance on both metrics in Q2 and are at the midpoint, raising the full year guidance for both metrics. A reminder that as usual, I'll focus my discussion on constant currency results when discussing top line metrics and Kristian will expound on currency effects later in the call. Starting with the top line metric of ARR on Slide 4. In Q2, we came in at $1.814 billion, which was above the high end of our guidance range and up 26% year-over-year. Top line strength was broad based across all segments and geographies. Bookings were solid in Q2, and our churn results were outstanding.  Organic ARR growth was 13%, with ServiceMax and Codebeamer, contributing the extra 13 points of inorganic growth to bridge us to that 26% growth rate. Given our strong first half results, together with a solid outlook for the second half, we are narrowing our full year ARR guidance range while slightly raising the midpoint. Kristian will provide guidance details later. Global PMIs continue to hover in the mid-40s to 50 range, suggesting the business environment remains challenging for industrial companies, but it does not appear to be getting much worse. Despite the sluggish macro, the solid organic bookings result we saw in Q2 was up nicely on a sequential and year-over-year basis, suggesting at this point that the softer booking result in Q1 was probably an anomaly, within the normal range of bookings volatility rather than the beginning of a more sinister trend. While we did see continued booking softness in small and medium business and in China, this was offset by notable bookings strength in Europe and in the U.S. and in particular, with Windchill and Codebeamer as well as with IoT and AR. Running counter to the SMB trend, Onshape had a record bookings quarter, helped in part by a large household name electronics company, making the decision to move away from SolidWorks and standardize instead on Onshape to gain the advantages of SaaS and agile product development. This key win represents a notable milestone for Onshape.  In our core business, we saw a higher mix of ramp deals from companies choosing to proceed with large strategic programs but wanting to ramp their deployments over multiple years. This buying behaviour pushes more of the bookings into deferred ARR, which benefits fiscal '24 and fiscal '25 ARR growth more than it does fiscal '23. Deferred ARR is up sharply year-over-year. Naturally, we took the outlook for bookings, churn, start dates and deferred ARR into account when we adjusted our FY '23 ARR guidance. We landed a large and interesting PLM and ALM order from a European automotive OEM that included extension options for Windchill and Codebeamer to contemplate our relationship spanning 20 years. The fact that an automotive OEM wants to understand commercial terms over the next two decades, speaks to how sticky our software is. Clearly, they expect to have it for a while.  A final top line observation is that organic growth arguably has a bit more momentum than the numbers on this slide suggests. That's because following the Codebeamer acquisition, our strategy has been to shift our organic ALM selling effort to the new Codebeamer technology platform. That strategy is working and Codebeamer is doing exceptionally well.  Codebeamer is now the ALM standard at several of the largest European and Asian auto OEMs and at numerous suppliers. But the consequence of this shift in sales strategy is that some of the ALM business we would have likely transacted organically is now scored as inorganic Codebeamer instead. We estimate that excluding the impact of this mix shift factor in Q2 because this slide to show organic growth at 14%, with inorganic growth at 12. Codebeamer will become organic in Q3 when we pass the acquisition anniversary. Moving to Slide 5 and switching to our bottom line. We delivered $207 million of free cash flow in Q2, a record quarterly result that was ahead of our guidance and up 48% year-over-year. Note that in fiscal '22, we had $41 million of restructuring-related cash outflows for the full year and $18 million in Q2. Excluding the impact of restructuring payments in last year's compare, we still delivered 31% year-over-year free cash flow growth in Q2, driven by a combination of strong ARR growth and higher operating efficiency due to disciplined cost management. We raised our free cash flow guide for the year. Kristian will elaborate on that, too. To help you understand what's driving the big year-over-year increase in free cash flow, let me recap the margin expansion program that PTC management has been driving. First, I'll remind you that operating efficiency is our metric that measures the percentage of our billings that we're able to convert to cash flow each year.  Margins have been expanding for many years now, but the organizational realignment we did at the end of fiscal '21, coupled with the resource rebalancing work we did during fiscal '22, have together created an organizational model for PTC that's efficient and sustainable. We delivered 300 basis points of expansion in fiscal '22. At the midpoint of our fiscal '23 ARR guidance range, based on actions that are well behind us now, we expect our operating efficiency to expand by at least another 450 basis points this year. Looking back, while other companies were hiring like crazy, the proactive work we did to optimize our cost structure proved prescient and is generating exactly the results we promised. Given the trends at PTC, we do not anticipate any need for the type of layoffs or restructuring that we've seen in the tech world around us. Indeed, we're still hiring and investing in the business, albeit conservatively, which Kristian will discuss later. Turning to Slide 6. A large driver of this margin expansion is the natural result of putting the business model transition behind us, traversing the valley of death in fiscal 2014 through '19 caused PTC to defer revenue recognition while retaining the same spending levels, which made our reported margins look much worse than they fundamentally were.  The short-term pain we endured during that transition is long gone and now we're enjoying the fruits of the long-term gain we were aiming for, which is a resilient business that's tracking toward peer-leading performance. That's a good segue to Slide 7, where I'd like to share a view of PTC's combined top and bottom line performance in comparison to peers. Starting at the upper left, Autodesk recently showed this FY '23 Rule of 40 comparison at their Investor Day in March. Note that Autodesk's definition of the Rule of 40 uses free cash flow margin rather than operating margin, which is probably a good way to look at it given ASC 606 accounting noise. I'd prefer to use ARR rather than revenue growth for the same reasons but I realize that makes comparisons of actuals hard to do. So for today's purposes, we will embrace Autodesk's definition. That said, this chart showed PTC with an anemic 28% figure for fiscal '23, which didn't sound right to me given the margin expansion I just described.  So moving to the upper right, our team looked up all the axles to reverse engineer the Autodesk chart and two things became clear: First, Autodesk has a strange fiscal calendar, where 11 of the 12 months of their fiscal '23 actually happened in calendar '22. Most of the companies in this analysis, including PTC, I would say this is really a '22 comparison. Second, there are some significant onetime factors involved here, too, because PTC's fiscal '22 cash flow was negatively impacted by the restructuring I mentioned, whereas Autodesk cash flow during this period was helped by their practice of building multiyear subscriptions upfront, which they've since committed to move away from. Putting those points aside, obviously, the future matters more than the past. So it's interesting to consider the trajectory of companies in this peer group going forward. The two charts on the lower half of the slide have been created using consensus data pulled directly from FactSet. In the current year, based on strong growth and significant free cash flow margin expansion that PTC has been delivering, we're expected to move to the middle of the pack while Autodesk recedes. Next year in 2024, based on continued growth and margin expansion, PTC is expected to lead this peer group in the Rule of 40 as Autodesk defines it. Of course, these are just consensus models and not actuals, but we're comfortable with the expectations shown here for PTC because they align to the midterm guidance ranges we provided at our November Investor Day. We'll plan to revisit this useful chart periodically to track how PTC is doing as compared to peers. Turning to Slide 8. Let's look at ARR growth by geography. ARR growth in Americas was 29%. In Europe ARR growth was 25% and in Asia Pacific, ARR growth was 19%. All three regions benefited from the acquisitions of ServiceMax and Codebeamer, albeit to differing degrees. Next, let's look at ARR performance of our product groups on Slide 9. In CAD, which is those products that enable authoring of product data, we delivered 10% ARR growth in Q2 in a market that's been growing an estimated 7%. Within these results, the growth was primarily driven by Creo, but supplemented by strong percentage growth in Onshape.  Shave Blecher, recently noted in his research that Creo has been the fastest-growing major CAD system for 12 of the past 16 quarters. Onshape is growing at a considerably faster rate than Creo. So PTC is clearly taking shares in different parts of the market with both products. I feel we have a great hand to play in the CAD market. In PLM, which includes those products that enable data and process management, our ARR growth rate in Q1 was 39% or 16% organic with the inorganic growth coming from both ServiceMax and Codebeamer, Codebeamer having enjoyed a tailwind from the ALM mix shift factor I previously mentioned.  In PLM, we continue to significantly outperform the market, which has been growing approximately 8% in core PLM, but more like 11% when you roll in the extended PLM categories of ALM and SLM. ARR growth for PLM in Q2 was primarily driven by Windchill, supplemented by strong percentage growth in arena, IoT and SLM. PTC has a strong hand to play here, too. As clearly, we are taking significant market share in the PLM market as well. Turning to Slide 10. Now that 2022 is behind us, we thought it would be helpful to publish PTC's calendar year performance for those analysts who wish to make growth and market share comparisons on that basis. As you can see, calendar 2022 was a strong year for PTC, and it was our fifth consecutive year of double-digit ARR growth in both our CAD and PLM segments. In PLM, the addition of ServiceMax into our portfolio brings management of the customer's installed base of products into our product life cycle management offering and this significantly expands our category leadership. On a calendar 2022 basis, inclusive of the $153 million ServiceMax contributed on a pro forma basis, PLM revenue was $1.15 billion. ARR growth was strong at 20%, with organic at 18%, which suggests we're widening the leadership gap.  In Canada, results were all organic in calendar '22 and growth here too remains well ahead of the market. CAD revenue was $788 million in calendar '22 and the ARR growth rate was 10%. PTC's growth rate in CAD is best-in-class. So while we're not the category leader, given the differential growth rates we are in the passing lane. Turning to Slide 11. In just a few weeks, we're hosting our big LiveWorx event on May 15 and 16 here in Boston. This is our flagship event dedicated to our customer and partner ecosystem, and we're also welcoming investors to join. It's a great way to network and learn first-hand all things PTC. This year, we're excited to try a new approach to maximize the investor experience. In addition to having an exclusive investor lunch session on sustainability as well as an executive Q&A session, we have organized an immersive investor track, which will enable you to attend our main keynote and our spotlight sessions on ServiceMax, Windchill and Creo Plus sitting alongside our customers and partners.  We will host a special demo tour for investors, and you'll be free to explore and learn more on your own too. There will also be opportunities to network with our executive team and our Board will be present as well. We would love to see you at LiveWorx. If you need registration details, please reach out to our IR team. On Slide 12, one of the demos you can check out in the Windchill section will come from Fresenius Medical Care. Fresenius is the world's leading provider of products and services for individuals that need dialysis treatment. Fresenius produces dialysis machines in over 40 manufacturing facilities around the globe and also runs a network of over 4,000 dialysis clinics. There's a lot of inherent complexity in their product life cycle.  Fresenius saw the opportunity to bring down treatment costs and improve their products by building a digital thread workflow across their engineering, manufacturing and service domains. Windchill was selected as the backbone to bring product data together and enable better collaboration across internal groups and with external partners. Fresenius subsequently standardized on Creo and has since adopted ThingWorx for smart connected products and for smart connected factories. Currently, they're exploring how they might leverage ServiceMax in that digital threat. Fresenius is a great case study that shows the breadth of what PTC technology can enable. For another teaser on Slide 13, one of the demos you literally can't missing is the Komatsu wheel loader. It's big and yellow and weighs 30 tons. Using Creo and Windchill Komatsu engineers and manufacturers' equipment that customers use for decades in the field. Because Komatsu's aftermarket service business contributes significantly to their overall financial results, they've been investing in software to make the services business more efficient and productive. Komatsu has been using PTC service life cycle management software, including Servigistics since 2006 to optimize spare parts inventory and Arbotex since 2015 to streamline the availability of service instructions.  Last year, Komatsu expanded their investment in service technology by selecting ServiceMax. Komatsu purchased software independently from PTC and ServiceMax when we are still separate companies, but represents a good example of the type of customer where we think we can be successful cross-selling because they really appreciate that 3D model-based digital threat. Komatsu is also a poster child for my point that for every customer that ServiceMax currently has, PTC has 10 more that look like them. Companies that use Creo and Windchill to produce products that have long service lives. Summarizing then on Slide 14 and fiscal '23, we're continuing to make good progress toward our midterm guidance targets. With solid first half results, we're well positioned to achieve our full year ARR and free cash flow guidance, which ticked upward this quarter. PTC has expanded our clear category leadership role in PLM, which has become a must-have technology backbone for digital transformation at industrial companies. The addition of ServiceMax further extends what was already a unique portfolio of interconnected digital threat capabilities across the full product life cycle. Second, with organic growth at double-digit levels already, we're in the early days, but executing well against the major on-premise to SaaS transformation that should provide a multiyear growth tailwind. You'll learn a lot more about our SaaS strategy at LiveWorx. Third, we have a well-earned reputation for driving margin expansion that goes back more than a decade and the proactive changes we made are driving high levels of free cash flow growth through the midterm guidance period. Fourth, with organic ARR in the low teens, juxtaposed on PMIs in the upper 40s, I trust you would agree we are actively demonstrating that our business model is very resilient. Q2 bookings were solid and churn outstanding.  Top line growth and bottom line profitability are approaching peer leadership levels even in this challenging macro environment. And finally, we're led by a team that has deep expertise and a proven ability to drive growth and margin expansion. I want to congratulate Mike DiTullio, who was promoted to President and COO in the quarter. Mike and I have decades of experience working together, and I'm very much enjoying this new division of labor.  Congratulations also to Neil Barua, who was previously the CEO of ServiceMax and joined PTC as the President of our SLM business that combines ServiceMax with PTC's broader suite of service-related technologies and use cases. We're pleased to have Neil join the team and love what he brings to the business. With so many positive trends going our way, I continue to believe PTC has a tremendous opportunity to create shareholder value. With that, I'll turn it over to Kristian for his more detailed commentary on financial results and guidance.\nKristian Talvitie: Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I get into it, I'd like to note that the non-GAAP results and guidance and ARR references I'll be discussing will be in both constant currency and as reported. Turning to Slide 16. In Q2 of '23, our constant currency ARR was $1.81 billion, up 26% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. On an organic constant currency basis, excluding ServiceMax and Codebeamer, our ARR was $1.63 billion, up 13% year-over-year. As Jim explained, our solid top line in Q2 was broad-based across all geographies and product groups. Our pipeline development also continued over the past three months in a solid and consistent way, and our outlook was steady all quarter long. In Q2, our organic top line continued to show good resilience. I'm sure many of you have been following the manufacturing PMIs due to the historical correlation with our top line when we operate a perpetual business model. The PMIs have been soft over the past year, particularly in Europe where factory orders have been down 11 months in a row and where the Eurozone PMI was a little over 47 in March.  In contrast to those trends, our top line, including in Europe, has continued to grow. Our subscription business model makes our ARR resilient and demand for digital transformation continues across our customer base. In fact, Q2 was one of our best bookings quarters in Europe ever.  On an as-reported basis, we delivered 23% ARR growth, 11% organic. In Q2, our as reported ARR was $68 million higher than our constant currency ARR. Remember that for our constant currency reporting, we use rates as of September 30, 2022, for all periods, forwards and backwards. On a year-over-year basis, currency fluctuations were still a meaningful headwind in Q2 and for the entire first half. Moving on to cash flow. Our results were strong with Q2 cash from operations of $211 million and free cash flow of $207 million, coming in ahead of our guidance. This performance was driven by continued strong execution based on a foundation of solid collections and cost discipline. When assessing and forecasting our cash flow, it's always good to remember a few things. The majority of our collections occur in the first half of our fiscal year. Q4 is our lowest cash flow generation quarter, and on an annual basis, free cash flow is primarily a function of ARR rather than revenue. Q2 revenue of $542 million increased 7% year-over-year and was up 13% on a constant currency basis. In Q2, recurring revenue grew by approximately $40 million, partially offset by small declines in perpetual license and professional services revenue. The decline in professional services revenue is consistent with our strategy to transition some of our professional services to DXP services, our partner for Windchill plus lift and shift projects.  And the decline in perpetual license revenue is consistent with our plan to continue transitioning Kepware to a subscription model over time. Kepware is the primary driver of the small amount of perpetual license revenue we have left.  As we've discussed previously, revenue is impacted by ASC 606, so we do not believe that revenue is the best indicator of our underlying business performance, but would rather guide you to ARR as the best metric to understand our top line performance and cash generation. Moving to Slide 17. We ended the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $320 million. Our gross debt was $2.545 billion with an aggregate interest rate of 5.4%. In Q2, in conjunction with the ServiceMax acquisition, we took out a $500 million term loan and increased the size of our revolving credit facility from $1 billion to $1.25 billion. After the new borrowings and $205 million of debt pay down in Q2, we had $1 billion in high-yield notes, a $500 million term loan and approximately $425 million drawn on our revolver at the end of the quarter. As a reminder, we have a second payment for the ServiceMax transaction due in October of 2023 of $650 million, which consists of $620 million of debt and $30 million of imputed interest. We intend to fund this with cash on hand and our revolving credit facility. This deferred payment is included in debt on our balance sheet and is factored into our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, which was 3.4 times at the end of Q2. We continue to be -- expect to be around 3 times levered by the end of Q4 and below 3 times throughout fiscal '24.  Given the interest rate environment, we expect to prioritize paying down our debt in fiscal '23 and fiscal '24. We've paused our share repurchase program. And in fiscal '23, we expect our diluted share count to increase by approximately 1 million shares. We expect to substantially reduce our debt by the end of fiscal '24 and will then revisit the prioritization of debt pay down and share repurchases. Despite this interruption, our long-term goal, assuming our debt-to-EBITDA ratio is below 3 times remains to return 50% or so of our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases while also taking into consideration the interest rate environment and strategic opportunities. Next, Slide 18 shows our ARR by product group. In the constant currency section on the top half of the slide, we use rates as of September 30, 2022, to calculate ARR for all periods. You can see on the slide how FX dynamics have resulted in differences between our constant currency ARR and as reported ARR over the past six quarters.  Based on exchange rates at the end of Q2 '23, as reported ARR in Q3 '23 would be higher by approximately $70 million compared to the midpoint of our constant currency guidance and fiscal '23 in as reported ARR would be higher by approximately $73 million compared to our constant currency guidance midpoint. We report both actual and constant currency results and FX fluctuations can have a material impact on actuals. But remember, we provide ARR guidance on a constant currency basis. If exchange rates fluctuate significantly, between the end of Q2 '23 and the end of Q3 '23, the impact to our as reported ARR would also change. We believe the constant currency is the best way to evaluate the top line performance of our business because it removes FX fluctuations from the analysis, positive or negative.  Given the continued volatility in FX that we've seen over the past few months, I thought it would be useful to update our ARR sensitivity rule of thumb on Slide 19. Using FX rates at the end of Q2, the impact of a $0.10 change in the euro to USD rate would be about $40 million positive or negative and the impact of a JPY 10 change in the U.S. dollar to yen rate would be about $9 million, again, positive or negative.  In addition to the dollar, we transact in euro, the yen and more than 10 other additional currencies. And of course, the estimated dollar impact to ARR is dependent on the size of the ARR base. With that, I'll take you through our guidance on Slide 20. For all ARR guidance amounts, we're using our constant currency FX rates, which are as of September 30, 2022. For fiscal '23, we expect constant currency ARR growth of 22% to 24%, which corresponds to a fiscal '23 constant currency ARR guidance range of $1.925 billion to $1.95 billion. We raised the low end by $15 million and lowered the high end of our ARR range by $10 million. So the midpoint of our ARR guidance is up a few million dollars. I'm going to circle back on this on the next slide to provide a little more context. For Q3, we're guiding constant currency ARR to be in the range of $1.845 billion to $1.855 billion. At the midpoint, this equates to 24% constant currency growth.  On cash flows, we are again raising our fiscal '23 cash flow guidance. We're now targeting cash from operations of $600 million and free cash flow of $580 million. I think it's worth pointing out that we're raising our cash flow guidance for the year while also increasing investments in select growth opportunities for our business in the second half of fiscal '23. The important point here is the resilience of our business enables us to maintain core long-term investments even in a turbulent macro environment. In addition to that, as a baseline, we can adjust our shorter-term investments accordingly given our business performance and outlook.  The net result is solid and consistent cash flow growth. We maintain consistent billing practices and we've improved our processes around collections and payments over the past 2 to 3 years. Because of this, the quarterly seasonality of our free cash flow results has been very consistent over the past 2 years, and we're on track to deliver similar quarterly linearity in fiscal '23 as well. As in the past two fiscal years, we ended the halfway point of fiscal '23 at approximately 65% of our full year cash flow target. For Q3, we're guiding to free cash flow of approximately $155 million. We expect approximately $5 million of CapEx, and therefore, our cash from operations guidance is approximately $160 million. Moving to revenue guidance. For fiscal '23, we expect revenue of $2.08 billion to $2.14 billion, which corresponds to a growth rate of 8% to 11%. ASC 606 makes it fairly difficult to predict in the short term for on-premise subscription companies, hence the wide range. More importantly, revenue does not influence ARR or cash generation as we typically bill customers annually upfront regardless of contract term lengths. Next, on Slide 21. We've taken you through a lot of details. So I think it's important to step back and give you a high-level perspective. We'll use the slide that we showed on our Q4 '22 call as a basis to do this. The initial guidance range and scenarios we provided on our Q4 '22 call is at the bottom half of this slide.  We started the year providing a range of ARR outcomes that included organic bookings anywhere from up 5% to down 15% on a year-over-year basis and churn anywhere from flat to worse by 100 basis points. On the top half of the slide, you can see a summary of the current guidance range. As you can see, we've narrowed the guidance from our initial range of $60 million at the start of the year to our current range of $25 million at the midpoint. In short, since Q4 of fiscal '22, we've taken the bottom end of the ARR range up by $25 million and taking the top end of the range down by $10 million, along with the adjustment for ServiceMax we made at the time of close. So basically, based on our first half performance and the outlook for the second half, we've taken the initial low-end scenario for ARR off the table, which called for an organic bookings decline of 15% and for churn to increase.  Our organic bookings growth was solid in the first half, and we expect flattish organic bookings for the full year. We've also continued our strong organic churn performance, and we've actually seen an improvement of about 50 basis points in the first half. And while we continue to guide to flat churn for the year, we think this may be conservative. There are a lot of factors that could impact where we end the year in terms of ARR and just to be clear on the major factors they include: first, whether organic bookings are flat or a little better or a little worse than that. Second, how inorganic bookings perform also matters. The scenarios we're showing on the bottom half of the page only contemplated organic bookings. In addition to flattish organic bookings, we expect total bookings growth on a year-over-year basis, supported by bookings from ServiceMax and Codebeamer. Third, whether churn comes in flat or continues on the trend of slight improvement we've seen in the first half. Fourth, we saw in Q2, in particular, increased customer interest in ramp deals. These are multiyear contractual commitments from customers where the ARR increases during the contractual term. In practice, what this means is that the amount of ARR we get in year one is smaller than the exit run rate, which is what creates deferred ARR for us.  These are great deals in the sense that they demonstrate significant customer commitments to PTC. And with low churn rates we have, these deals bode well for future ARR growth.  And lastly, it probably goes without saying that the difference in timing of booking a deal and when the contract term actually begins, matters as well. We count the booking when we sign the contract, but ARR and revenue start only when the contract term begins. We have consistently called this out as a factor in ARR, especially in Q4 when we may sign a contract in Q4, but for a variety of reasons, it doesn't actually start until Q1. This also can create deferred ARR for us, but it's just short-term deferred and the timing difference is generally measured in days or weeks. A lot of moving parts for sure, but the net result of all of this is that we've raised the midpoint of our ARR guidance by approximately $8 million from when we started the year. On the free cash flow side of the equation at the beginning of the year, we said we thought $560 million was a good target regardless of the ARR outcome as we would moderate or increase spending based on the environment as we saw. As you know, we were cautious on spending and hiring in the first half, and that has served us well.  We're comfortable increasing the target to $580 million for the year, given the results in the first half and the outlook for the back half. While there is a tailwind from FX to be expected for the year, I'll remind you that FX rates in the first half are still below the FX rates for the first half of last year. So we've not really seen much of a year-over-year benefit from FX thus far this year. And I'll also remind you, we generate about 65% of our free cash flow in the first half. But if FX rates hold for the second half, we should see some pickup. That said, this will be offset by higher-than-anticipated interest rates and the increased investments we're making in select growth opportunities, namely Codebeamer, Windchill Plus and Atlas in the back half, and this is all factored into our current guidance. Hopefully, this slide helps clarify at a big picture level, how we've performed through the first half and our expected range of outcomes for the back half. Summing all this up, in the first half of fiscal '23, we've been demonstrating the resilience of the model and the stickiness of our solutions or said another way, the value that customers are getting from our solutions in an uncertain macro environment.  On the top line, we think the combination of flattish organic bookings compared to record bookings last year with additional growth coming from our more recent acquisitions and churn that is flat to improving is a compelling outcome in a difficult macro. On the bottom line, we're continuing to be judicious with our investments being mindful of both long-term opportunities and near-term macro uncertainty. Turning to Slide 22. Although we're not providing separate guidance on ServiceMax, I thought it would be helpful to summarize the financial disclosures we made on ServiceMax in one place for you. These are the same numbers we provided previously with one exception. Since we focus on software ARR, we updated the geographic region chart to show the expected ARR mix instead of the expected revenue mix. As part of PTC, ServiceMax continues to trend toward the numbers we gave you. Turning to Slide 23. Here's an illustrative constant currency ARR model for the back half of the year. You can see our results over the past six quarters and the two columns on the right illustrate what is needed to get to the midpoint of our constant currency ARR guidance for Q3 and Q4 of fiscal '23 because our ARR tends to see some seasonality, the most relevant comparisons are the sequential growth in Q3 and Q4 of fiscal '22. The illustrative model indicates that to hit the midpoint of our Q3 '23 guidance range of $1.85 billion, we need to add $36 million of organic ARR on a sequential basis. This is $7 million less than the $43 million we added in Q3 of fiscal '22. And in percentage terms, we need 2% organic sequential ARR growth to hit our guidance midpoint for Q3, which is at the lower end of what we've delivered over the past six quarters.  Next, to hit the midpoint of our full year guidance range of $1.938 billion, we need to add $88 million of organic ARR on a sequential basis in Q4. While this is $12 million more than we added in Q4 of fiscal '22, we expect previously deferred ARR and sequential ARR growth from ServiceMax that we didn't have in Q4 of '22. We expect these 2 things will more than compensate for the additional $12 million sequential increase when compared to Q4 of '22. All things considered, we believe we've set our Q3 '23 and full year constant currency ARR guidance ranges prudently. Turning to Slide 24. I'll conclude my prepared remarks today by highlighting that we prepared for a storm, and we're demonstrating resilience in the midst of one. For sure, the environment will continue to change around us, and we will continue to adapt accordingly while still pushing the envelope of what we can do for our customers. From a top line perspective, we serve industrial product companies and R&D at those companies tends to be quite resilient. So we have a supportive top line backdrop. We also have a subscription business model and our products are very sticky with our customers. Given our results in the first half and the pipeline and outlook for the second half, we expect to deliver flattish organic bookings in fiscal '23 in comparison to record bookings in 2022. We also expect our ARR growth in fiscal '23 to benefit from incremental ServiceMax and Codebeamer contributions. And on the top line, we conservatively expect flattish churn from the already strong level of churn at the end of fiscal '22. Just as importantly, from a cost and operational perspective, we are lean, having already battened down the hatches a while ago. In addition to the cost optimization work we did last year, we slowed planned hires and backfills in the first half of fiscal '23. We're well positioned to deliver on our updated cash flow targets for the year. And now at a time when many other technology companies are cutting costs, we're capitalizing on the strength of our business model and outlook by increasing investments selectively in long-term growth opportunities. So with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator, and we can begin Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go for to Jason Celino from KeyBanc.\nJason Celino: Thanks guys. Cleaner quarter here. Maybe just my one question. This morning, your French competitor talked about a really strong pipeline for the year for them. I'm curious on what you're seeing from a pipeline, large deal pipeline perspective, for yourself? And if you are, what types of end markets we're seeing strengthen?\nKristian Talvitie: Yes. Jason, its Kristian. Yes, I think we actually are -- we would agree that we're also seeing a pretty good pipeline for large deals. And I would say that actually is across our major geos and the major verticals that we serve as well. We've seen good interest in FAD for sure, in automotive, industrial, med-device, life sciences or med devices as well, across all those, we continue to see good business momentum and good pipeline generation.\nOperator: Next, we'll hear from Nay Soe Naing, Berenberg.\nNay Soe Naing: Hi, thank you for taking my questions. Congrats on pretty good quarter. You mentioned a few times that you are winning in your core CAD and PLM markets. I just wanted to -- if you could share, where is it then you're seeing competitive wins? Is it in the call Creo or Windchill? Or is it in your cloud version of the CAD and PLM products? And then related to that, now that you now have the plus version of Windchill and Creo, how do you expect the competitive landscape to change going forward?\nJim Heppelmann: Yes. Good question. So we believe that we're taking share with both products because both products are growing double digits. I mean, Creo is growing low double digits and Onshape growing at a multiple of that. So I think we're taking share of them in different parts of the market. Creo is a little bit in the upper half of the market. And today, Onshape is typically a little bit in the bottom half of the market.  They're both, for example, competing against SolidWorks but perhaps at different ends of the SolidWorks base. Creo might be taking customers that have kind of outgrown SolidWorks and Onshape's taking customers that, for example, might feel like SolidWorks is too heavy, too expensive, too complicated, requires a system administrator. They just -- they really like the idea of the pure web-based technology. So both products are doing very well. And in order to sustain that level of performance. Keep in mind for Creo, we're talking 22 quarters, 23 quarters now in a row we've had a double-digit growth rate, one of those numbers right now. You can't do that unless there's something good happening. And I mean, part of it is the business model, we're clear on that. But part of it is we're winning a lot of new orders as well.  Now what would the advent of Creo Plus deal. First of all, it's not yet in the market, but we're launching it at LiveWorx in a couple of weeks. That should be helpful. It should be helpful for two reasons. One is it's more compelling, some of the advantages that are present in Onshape will become present in Creo. Some of the same characteristics.  There won't be -- it won't be exactly like Onshape because it's fully Creo plus is fully compatible with Creo, and that's a fixed requirement. But I think some of the real advantages of always being on the latest version and so forth will accrue to Creo as well. And then second all, we will ultimately lift and shift Creo customers to the cloud, and there will be an uplift there as well. So it's only helpful, it's only helpful.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Steve Tusa, JPMorgan. Steve.\nSteve Tusa: Congrats on the execution on the quarter and looking forward to LiveWorx for sure. So just on this orders commentary. So were orders -- so were orders actually down in the first quarter? I'm still we're still -- I think there are still people trying to kind of pencil that out. You mentioned these ramp orders several times in this presentation, which I'm sure influences the actual number that you're kind of reporting and why it may not line up directly with the change in ARR. And then I guess as you look out and you say they're going to be flat for the year, does that imply they're going to be down at all at any point in the second half for bookings?\nJim Heppelmann: Steve, I mean, we had a very good orders quarter and it wouldn't be fair for us to give the details when it's a good strong quarter when we didn't want to give them when it was a softer quarter last quarter. So I mean I think Kristian took you through the guidance changes. In general, we're tracking well. Renewals have been our friend all year. But as Christian said, in the first half, we have a number that doesn't compare too badly to a first half last year that was a record first half.  So I think it's strong, but it is complicated to understand how much is going into deferred and when does it come back out? And by the way, how much is coming out next quarter and the quarter after that, it just requires a level of disclosure that seems a little bit inappropriate for an earnings call. So that's why we're just trying to back off and give you directional commentary on bookings and churn and much more precise commentary around ARR guidance.\nOperator: We'll go next to Ken Wong, Oppenheimer.\nKen Wong: Great. I wanted to circle up on the ramp deals I guess how much of that was customer-driven versus maybe you guys are pushing more aggressively with kind of more add-ons, more attach, more cross-selling or just the sales force is maybe pushing in that particular direction. Any color there would be fantastic.\nJim Heppelmann: Well, first thing to know, Ken, is there's nothing but goodness in ramp deals. They make it a little bit more difficult for us to predict ARR though because, for example, if we were to get a very large order, I suppose we could take a smaller one that started all at once and go get another order later to grow it. But yes, in that environment, we'd rather take the larger order now with a ramp because it's got the customer locked in, ramps are irrevocable. It's not something Kristian talked earlier about churn, but just to be clear, you can only turn at the end of a ramp, not during one.  So we like the commitment. And if a customer is willing to make a commitment, we want to take it. But it just makes it a little harder for us to predict. And as Kristian said, in Q4, it's really hard because sometimes a ramp in Q2, the first tranche might start in Q3 or Q4. But in Q4, if it's a ramp, anything that's not in Q4 is in the next fiscal year. So that makes it a little tricky to predict. But in general, ramps are great. And we do reward our sales team for getting them, but we also have a strange incentive that they get a little bit more credit for dollars to come in, in the front part of a ramp than they do for dollars to come in, in the back part of the ramp. But they still get credit for dollars that grow as the ramp goes on. So we want the bigger deals, the bigger commitments. And of course, we want them to start as soon as possible and grow as soon as possible. And that's all a point of negotiation with the customers.\nOperator: And next, we'll hear from Adam Borg, Stifel.\nAdam Borg: Great. Just for Jim on Codebeamer, it's nice to see the continued traction there. Is this more of an upsell motion or is this really tip of spear and maybe just as a quick follow-up on question on the incremental investments in the back half of the year. Just where are you making them in R&D as the sales and marketing? Any color there?\nJim Heppelmann: Yes. Codebeamer is both an upsell and a tip of the spear. So some amount of the Codebeamer success, we're cross-selling from Windchill because Windchill and Codebeamer sold together like the previous product integrity and Windchill frequently were. So we're cross-selling from a windshield position. But for example, in some of these automotive accounts, we don't have a windchill position. And Codebeamer is a very compelling product, and then we'll leave with it.  And we'll see if we get Codebeamer installed. Can we cross-sell from there? I don't know. We haven't had really enough time with it yet. But certainly, we've penetrated some accounts or Codebeamer where we had no significant windchill position, and that's good news.\nAdam Borg: And then on the -- just on the sneaky follow-up question. The second question on the investments. What I would say is it's probably, again, the primary areas are Codebeamer, Windchill Plus and Atlas. And in terms of where it is organizationally, it's probably, I don't know, 75% to 80% R&D, 20% and 25% sales and marketing.\nOperator: We will move on to Jay Vleeschhouwer, Griffin Securities.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Good afternoon. Jim, you mentioned the PLM-ALM selection at a European auto. Could you speak more broadly about multisolution sales, PLM with SLM, for example, as examples of the implementation of closed loop? And you're probably talking about LiveWorx, but maybe speak about what you're seeing already in that regard.\nJim Heppelmann: Yes. I mean I think there's a couple of words that go together here. There's the digital thread idea, which means data created upstream is used multiple times downstream. Then there's the model-based idea, which says, by the way, let's make sure this data is 3D models, not 2D drawing, so model-based digital thread and then closed loop means, let's make sure that things we find in the manufacturing process, for example, using DPM get reflected into changes upstream, either in the product itself or in the manufacturing plan.  And then let's make sure that what we find when the products all the field at the customer site, for example, IoT, smart connected products, that is likewise being funnel back end, ultimately, upstream, maybe into the product, maybe into the manufacturing process, maybe into the service process. But let's have these feedback loops. So I think this concept PTC has of a model-based closed-loop digital thread is very powerful, and I'd say pretty unique. And yes, I'll talk a lot about that at LiveWorx. If I know it will be a kind of theme throughout. So it allows us to cross-sell in a lot of directions. We talked about Codebeamer and Windchill. Well, there's going to be a similar conversation between Windchill and ServiceMax and between ServiceMax and Servigistics and ServiceMax and ThingWorx IoT. So we like this idea of a lot of products that are very compelling could be sold stand-alone as the tip of the spear but then integrated into this digital thread so that they could -- kind of better together. Better together, but you don't have to buy it all. If you want to use ServiceMax with some other PLM system, fine, we know how to make that work. And you have to be that way because it's practical. Customers don't throw out all their technology and switch like stock and barrel.  They look at what they have and they want to systematically over time, upgrade it. And so we get in there, we might win with Windchill and then we might win with Codebeamer, and then we might introduce ServiceMax, and that's kind of how we've built our whole growth story over the last decade is by really perfecting these cross-sell motions.\nOperator: And everyone, at this time, that does conclude our question-and-answer session. We ask that you please you remain on the line for any additional remarks as I hand the conference back to Mr. Jin Heppelmann\nJim Heppelmann: Okay. Well, great. Thank you, Lisa. And for anybody who has more questions that maybe we didn't have time to get to, please come to LiveWorx, you're going to get lots and lots and lots of information. You're going to get a firehose -- promise. So the real day we have set up for investors is May 16. You're welcome to stay longer, if you want, but that's where we had this sort of investor track that was on the slide.  Otherwise, if you can't come to LiveWorx, there will be a couple of other opportunities to catch us. I know that Kristian, myself and Mike DiTullio, are going to the JPMorgan conference in Boston on May 22. We're hosting a Bank of America roadshow here at PTC on June 5. And then Christian, our Chief Product Officer, Kevin Ren, are participating in the Stifel conference in Boston on June 6. So lots of opportunities to engage us with more questions and get more information across all those different events I spoke of. So thanks for your time today. Really appreciate it, and look forward to talking to you during the course of the quarter or in 90 days as the case may be.\nOperator: Once again, everyone, that does conclude today's conference. We would like to thank you all for your participation today.",

            "name": "Kristian Talvitie",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I get into it, I'd like to note that the non-GAAP results and guidance and ARR references I'll be discussing will be in both constant currency and as reported. Turning to Slide 16. In Q2 of '23, our constant currency ARR was $1.81 billion, up 26% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. On an organic constant currency basis, excluding ServiceMax and Codebeamer, our ARR was $1.63 billion, up 13% year-over-year. As Jim explained, our solid top line in Q2 was broad-based across all geographies and product groups. Our pipeline development also continued over the past three months in a solid and consistent way, and our outlook was steady all quarter long. In Q2, our organic top line continued to show good resilience. I'm sure many of you have been following the manufacturing PMIs due to the historical correlation with our top line when we operate a perpetual business model. The PMIs have been soft over the past year, particularly in Europe where factory orders have been down 11 months in a row and where the Eurozone PMI was a little over 47 in March.  In contrast to those trends, our top line, including in Europe, has continued to grow. Our subscription business model makes our ARR resilient and demand for digital transformation continues across our customer base. In fact, Q2 was one of our best bookings quarters in Europe ever.  On an as-reported basis, we delivered 23% ARR growth, 11% organic. In Q2, our as reported ARR was $68 million higher than our constant currency ARR. Remember that for our constant currency reporting, we use rates as of September 30, 2022, for all periods, forwards and backwards. On a year-over-year basis, currency fluctuations were still a meaningful headwind in Q2 and for the entire first half. Moving on to cash flow. Our results were strong with Q2 cash from operations of $211 million and free cash flow of $207 million, coming in ahead of our guidance. This performance was driven by continued strong execution based on a foundation of solid collections and cost discipline. When assessing and forecasting our cash flow, it's always good to remember a few things. The majority of our collections occur in the first half of our fiscal year. Q4 is our lowest cash flow generation quarter, and on an annual basis, free cash flow is primarily a function of ARR rather than revenue. Q2 revenue of $542 million increased 7% year-over-year and was up 13% on a constant currency basis. In Q2, recurring revenue grew by approximately $40 million, partially offset by small declines in perpetual license and professional services revenue. The decline in professional services revenue is consistent with our strategy to transition some of our professional services to DXP services, our partner for Windchill plus lift and shift projects.  And the decline in perpetual license revenue is consistent with our plan to continue transitioning Kepware to a subscription model over time. Kepware is the primary driver of the small amount of perpetual license revenue we have left.  As we've discussed previously, revenue is impacted by ASC 606, so we do not believe that revenue is the best indicator of our underlying business performance, but would rather guide you to ARR as the best metric to understand our top line performance and cash generation. Moving to Slide 17. We ended the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $320 million. Our gross debt was $2.545 billion with an aggregate interest rate of 5.4%. In Q2, in conjunction with the ServiceMax acquisition, we took out a $500 million term loan and increased the size of our revolving credit facility from $1 billion to $1.25 billion. After the new borrowings and $205 million of debt pay down in Q2, we had $1 billion in high-yield notes, a $500 million term loan and approximately $425 million drawn on our revolver at the end of the quarter. As a reminder, we have a second payment for the ServiceMax transaction due in October of 2023 of $650 million, which consists of $620 million of debt and $30 million of imputed interest. We intend to fund this with cash on hand and our revolving credit facility. This deferred payment is included in debt on our balance sheet and is factored into our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, which was 3.4 times at the end of Q2. We continue to be -- expect to be around 3 times levered by the end of Q4 and below 3 times throughout fiscal '24.  Given the interest rate environment, we expect to prioritize paying down our debt in fiscal '23 and fiscal '24. We've paused our share repurchase program. And in fiscal '23, we expect our diluted share count to increase by approximately 1 million shares. We expect to substantially reduce our debt by the end of fiscal '24 and will then revisit the prioritization of debt pay down and share repurchases. Despite this interruption, our long-term goal, assuming our debt-to-EBITDA ratio is below 3 times remains to return 50% or so of our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases while also taking into consideration the interest rate environment and strategic opportunities. Next, Slide 18 shows our ARR by product group. In the constant currency section on the top half of the slide, we use rates as of September 30, 2022, to calculate ARR for all periods. You can see on the slide how FX dynamics have resulted in differences between our constant currency ARR and as reported ARR over the past six quarters.  Based on exchange rates at the end of Q2 '23, as reported ARR in Q3 '23 would be higher by approximately $70 million compared to the midpoint of our constant currency guidance and fiscal '23 in as reported ARR would be higher by approximately $73 million compared to our constant currency guidance midpoint. We report both actual and constant currency results and FX fluctuations can have a material impact on actuals. But remember, we provide ARR guidance on a constant currency basis. If exchange rates fluctuate significantly, between the end of Q2 '23 and the end of Q3 '23, the impact to our as reported ARR would also change. We believe the constant currency is the best way to evaluate the top line performance of our business because it removes FX fluctuations from the analysis, positive or negative.  Given the continued volatility in FX that we've seen over the past few months, I thought it would be useful to update our ARR sensitivity rule of thumb on Slide 19. Using FX rates at the end of Q2, the impact of a $0.10 change in the euro to USD rate would be about $40 million positive or negative and the impact of a JPY 10 change in the U.S. dollar to yen rate would be about $9 million, again, positive or negative.  In addition to the dollar, we transact in euro, the yen and more than 10 other additional currencies. And of course, the estimated dollar impact to ARR is dependent on the size of the ARR base. With that, I'll take you through our guidance on Slide 20. For all ARR guidance amounts, we're using our constant currency FX rates, which are as of September 30, 2022. For fiscal '23, we expect constant currency ARR growth of 22% to 24%, which corresponds to a fiscal '23 constant currency ARR guidance range of $1.925 billion to $1.95 billion. We raised the low end by $15 million and lowered the high end of our ARR range by $10 million. So the midpoint of our ARR guidance is up a few million dollars. I'm going to circle back on this on the next slide to provide a little more context. For Q3, we're guiding constant currency ARR to be in the range of $1.845 billion to $1.855 billion. At the midpoint, this equates to 24% constant currency growth.  On cash flows, we are again raising our fiscal '23 cash flow guidance. We're now targeting cash from operations of $600 million and free cash flow of $580 million. I think it's worth pointing out that we're raising our cash flow guidance for the year while also increasing investments in select growth opportunities for our business in the second half of fiscal '23. The important point here is the resilience of our business enables us to maintain core long-term investments even in a turbulent macro environment. In addition to that, as a baseline, we can adjust our shorter-term investments accordingly given our business performance and outlook.  The net result is solid and consistent cash flow growth. We maintain consistent billing practices and we've improved our processes around collections and payments over the past 2 to 3 years. Because of this, the quarterly seasonality of our free cash flow results has been very consistent over the past 2 years, and we're on track to deliver similar quarterly linearity in fiscal '23 as well. As in the past two fiscal years, we ended the halfway point of fiscal '23 at approximately 65% of our full year cash flow target. For Q3, we're guiding to free cash flow of approximately $155 million. We expect approximately $5 million of CapEx, and therefore, our cash from operations guidance is approximately $160 million. Moving to revenue guidance. For fiscal '23, we expect revenue of $2.08 billion to $2.14 billion, which corresponds to a growth rate of 8% to 11%. ASC 606 makes it fairly difficult to predict in the short term for on-premise subscription companies, hence the wide range. More importantly, revenue does not influence ARR or cash generation as we typically bill customers annually upfront regardless of contract term lengths. Next, on Slide 21. We've taken you through a lot of details. So I think it's important to step back and give you a high-level perspective. We'll use the slide that we showed on our Q4 '22 call as a basis to do this. The initial guidance range and scenarios we provided on our Q4 '22 call is at the bottom half of this slide.  We started the year providing a range of ARR outcomes that included organic bookings anywhere from up 5% to down 15% on a year-over-year basis and churn anywhere from flat to worse by 100 basis points. On the top half of the slide, you can see a summary of the current guidance range. As you can see, we've narrowed the guidance from our initial range of $60 million at the start of the year to our current range of $25 million at the midpoint. In short, since Q4 of fiscal '22, we've taken the bottom end of the ARR range up by $25 million and taking the top end of the range down by $10 million, along with the adjustment for ServiceMax we made at the time of close. So basically, based on our first half performance and the outlook for the second half, we've taken the initial low-end scenario for ARR off the table, which called for an organic bookings decline of 15% and for churn to increase.  Our organic bookings growth was solid in the first half, and we expect flattish organic bookings for the full year. We've also continued our strong organic churn performance, and we've actually seen an improvement of about 50 basis points in the first half. And while we continue to guide to flat churn for the year, we think this may be conservative. There are a lot of factors that could impact where we end the year in terms of ARR and just to be clear on the major factors they include: first, whether organic bookings are flat or a little better or a little worse than that. Second, how inorganic bookings perform also matters. The scenarios we're showing on the bottom half of the page only contemplated organic bookings. In addition to flattish organic bookings, we expect total bookings growth on a year-over-year basis, supported by bookings from ServiceMax and Codebeamer. Third, whether churn comes in flat or continues on the trend of slight improvement we've seen in the first half. Fourth, we saw in Q2, in particular, increased customer interest in ramp deals. These are multiyear contractual commitments from customers where the ARR increases during the contractual term. In practice, what this means is that the amount of ARR we get in year one is smaller than the exit run rate, which is what creates deferred ARR for us.  These are great deals in the sense that they demonstrate significant customer commitments to PTC. And with low churn rates we have, these deals bode well for future ARR growth.  And lastly, it probably goes without saying that the difference in timing of booking a deal and when the contract term actually begins, matters as well. We count the booking when we sign the contract, but ARR and revenue start only when the contract term begins. We have consistently called this out as a factor in ARR, especially in Q4 when we may sign a contract in Q4, but for a variety of reasons, it doesn't actually start until Q1. This also can create deferred ARR for us, but it's just short-term deferred and the timing difference is generally measured in days or weeks. A lot of moving parts for sure, but the net result of all of this is that we've raised the midpoint of our ARR guidance by approximately $8 million from when we started the year. On the free cash flow side of the equation at the beginning of the year, we said we thought $560 million was a good target regardless of the ARR outcome as we would moderate or increase spending based on the environment as we saw. As you know, we were cautious on spending and hiring in the first half, and that has served us well.  We're comfortable increasing the target to $580 million for the year, given the results in the first half and the outlook for the back half. While there is a tailwind from FX to be expected for the year, I'll remind you that FX rates in the first half are still below the FX rates for the first half of last year. So we've not really seen much of a year-over-year benefit from FX thus far this year. And I'll also remind you, we generate about 65% of our free cash flow in the first half. But if FX rates hold for the second half, we should see some pickup. That said, this will be offset by higher-than-anticipated interest rates and the increased investments we're making in select growth opportunities, namely Codebeamer, Windchill Plus and Atlas in the back half, and this is all factored into our current guidance. Hopefully, this slide helps clarify at a big picture level, how we've performed through the first half and our expected range of outcomes for the back half. Summing all this up, in the first half of fiscal '23, we've been demonstrating the resilience of the model and the stickiness of our solutions or said another way, the value that customers are getting from our solutions in an uncertain macro environment.  On the top line, we think the combination of flattish organic bookings compared to record bookings last year with additional growth coming from our more recent acquisitions and churn that is flat to improving is a compelling outcome in a difficult macro. On the bottom line, we're continuing to be judicious with our investments being mindful of both long-term opportunities and near-term macro uncertainty. Turning to Slide 22. Although we're not providing separate guidance on ServiceMax, I thought it would be helpful to summarize the financial disclosures we made on ServiceMax in one place for you. These are the same numbers we provided previously with one exception. Since we focus on software ARR, we updated the geographic region chart to show the expected ARR mix instead of the expected revenue mix. As part of PTC, ServiceMax continues to trend toward the numbers we gave you. Turning to Slide 23. Here's an illustrative constant currency ARR model for the back half of the year. You can see our results over the past six quarters and the two columns on the right illustrate what is needed to get to the midpoint of our constant currency ARR guidance for Q3 and Q4 of fiscal '23 because our ARR tends to see some seasonality, the most relevant comparisons are the sequential growth in Q3 and Q4 of fiscal '22. The illustrative model indicates that to hit the midpoint of our Q3 '23 guidance range of $1.85 billion, we need to add $36 million of organic ARR on a sequential basis. This is $7 million less than the $43 million we added in Q3 of fiscal '22. And in percentage terms, we need 2% organic sequential ARR growth to hit our guidance midpoint for Q3, which is at the lower end of what we've delivered over the past six quarters.  Next, to hit the midpoint of our full year guidance range of $1.938 billion, we need to add $88 million of organic ARR on a sequential basis in Q4. While this is $12 million more than we added in Q4 of fiscal '22, we expect previously deferred ARR and sequential ARR growth from ServiceMax that we didn't have in Q4 of '22. We expect these 2 things will more than compensate for the additional $12 million sequential increase when compared to Q4 of '22. All things considered, we believe we've set our Q3 '23 and full year constant currency ARR guidance ranges prudently. Turning to Slide 24. I'll conclude my prepared remarks today by highlighting that we prepared for a storm, and we're demonstrating resilience in the midst of one. For sure, the environment will continue to change around us, and we will continue to adapt accordingly while still pushing the envelope of what we can do for our customers. From a top line perspective, we serve industrial product companies and R&D at those companies tends to be quite resilient. So we have a supportive top line backdrop. We also have a subscription business model and our products are very sticky with our customers. Given our results in the first half and the pipeline and outlook for the second half, we expect to deliver flattish organic bookings in fiscal '23 in comparison to record bookings in 2022. We also expect our ARR growth in fiscal '23 to benefit from incremental ServiceMax and Codebeamer contributions. And on the top line, we conservatively expect flattish churn from the already strong level of churn at the end of fiscal '22. Just as importantly, from a cost and operational perspective, we are lean, having already battened down the hatches a while ago. In addition to the cost optimization work we did last year, we slowed planned hires and backfills in the first half of fiscal '23. We're well positioned to deliver on our updated cash flow targets for the year. And now at a time when many other technology companies are cutting costs, we're capitalizing on the strength of our business model and outlook by increasing investments selectively in long-term growth opportunities. So with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator, and we can begin Q&A. Yes. Jason, its Kristian. Yes, I think we actually are -- we would agree that we're also seeing a pretty good pipeline for large deals. And I would say that actually is across our major geos and the major verticals that we serve as well. We've seen good interest in FAD for sure, in automotive, industrial, med-device, life sciences or med devices as well, across all those, we continue to see good business momentum and good pipeline generation."

            "name": "Jim Heppelmann",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to report PTC delivered strong results in our second fiscal quarter of 2023. As you know, we feel that ARR and free cash flow are the best metrics to assess the performance of our business. We exceeded our guidance on both metrics in Q2 and are at the midpoint, raising the full year guidance for both metrics. A reminder that as usual, I'll focus my discussion on constant currency results when discussing top line metrics and Kristian will expound on currency effects later in the call. Starting with the top line metric of ARR on Slide 4. In Q2, we came in at $1.814 billion, which was above the high end of our guidance range and up 26% year-over-year. Top line strength was broad based across all segments and geographies. Bookings were solid in Q2, and our churn results were outstanding.  Organic ARR growth was 13%, with ServiceMax and Codebeamer, contributing the extra 13 points of inorganic growth to bridge us to that 26% growth rate. Given our strong first half results, together with a solid outlook for the second half, we are narrowing our full year ARR guidance range while slightly raising the midpoint. Kristian will provide guidance details later. Global PMIs continue to hover in the mid-40s to 50 range, suggesting the business environment remains challenging for industrial companies, but it does not appear to be getting much worse. Despite the sluggish macro, the solid organic bookings result we saw in Q2 was up nicely on a sequential and year-over-year basis, suggesting at this point that the softer booking result in Q1 was probably an anomaly, within the normal range of bookings volatility rather than the beginning of a more sinister trend. While we did see continued booking softness in small and medium business and in China, this was offset by notable bookings strength in Europe and in the U.S. and in particular, with Windchill and Codebeamer as well as with IoT and AR. Running counter to the SMB trend, Onshape had a record bookings quarter, helped in part by a large household name electronics company, making the decision to move away from SolidWorks and standardize instead on Onshape to gain the advantages of SaaS and agile product development. This key win represents a notable milestone for Onshape.  In our core business, we saw a higher mix of ramp deals from companies choosing to proceed with large strategic programs but wanting to ramp their deployments over multiple years. This buying behaviour pushes more of the bookings into deferred ARR, which benefits fiscal '24 and fiscal '25 ARR growth more than it does fiscal '23. Deferred ARR is up sharply year-over-year. Naturally, we took the outlook for bookings, churn, start dates and deferred ARR into account when we adjusted our FY '23 ARR guidance. We landed a large and interesting PLM and ALM order from a European automotive OEM that included extension options for Windchill and Codebeamer to contemplate our relationship spanning 20 years. The fact that an automotive OEM wants to understand commercial terms over the next two decades, speaks to how sticky our software is. Clearly, they expect to have it for a while.  A final top line observation is that organic growth arguably has a bit more momentum than the numbers on this slide suggests. That's because following the Codebeamer acquisition, our strategy has been to shift our organic ALM selling effort to the new Codebeamer technology platform. That strategy is working and Codebeamer is doing exceptionally well.  Codebeamer is now the ALM standard at several of the largest European and Asian auto OEMs and at numerous suppliers. But the consequence of this shift in sales strategy is that some of the ALM business we would have likely transacted organically is now scored as inorganic Codebeamer instead. We estimate that excluding the impact of this mix shift factor in Q2 because this slide to show organic growth at 14%, with inorganic growth at 12. Codebeamer will become organic in Q3 when we pass the acquisition anniversary. Moving to Slide 5 and switching to our bottom line. We delivered $207 million of free cash flow in Q2, a record quarterly result that was ahead of our guidance and up 48% year-over-year. Note that in fiscal '22, we had $41 million of restructuring-related cash outflows for the full year and $18 million in Q2. Excluding the impact of restructuring payments in last year's compare, we still delivered 31% year-over-year free cash flow growth in Q2, driven by a combination of strong ARR growth and higher operating efficiency due to disciplined cost management. We raised our free cash flow guide for the year. Kristian will elaborate on that, too. To help you understand what's driving the big year-over-year increase in free cash flow, let me recap the margin expansion program that PTC management has been driving. First, I'll remind you that operating efficiency is our metric that measures the percentage of our billings that we're able to convert to cash flow each year.  Margins have been expanding for many years now, but the organizational realignment we did at the end of fiscal '21, coupled with the resource rebalancing work we did during fiscal '22, have together created an organizational model for PTC that's efficient and sustainable. We delivered 300 basis points of expansion in fiscal '22. At the midpoint of our fiscal '23 ARR guidance range, based on actions that are well behind us now, we expect our operating efficiency to expand by at least another 450 basis points this year. Looking back, while other companies were hiring like crazy, the proactive work we did to optimize our cost structure proved prescient and is generating exactly the results we promised. Given the trends at PTC, we do not anticipate any need for the type of layoffs or restructuring that we've seen in the tech world around us. Indeed, we're still hiring and investing in the business, albeit conservatively, which Kristian will discuss later. Turning to Slide 6. A large driver of this margin expansion is the natural result of putting the business model transition behind us, traversing the valley of death in fiscal 2014 through '19 caused PTC to defer revenue recognition while retaining the same spending levels, which made our reported margins look much worse than they fundamentally were.  The short-term pain we endured during that transition is long gone and now we're enjoying the fruits of the long-term gain we were aiming for, which is a resilient business that's tracking toward peer-leading performance. That's a good segue to Slide 7, where I'd like to share a view of PTC's combined top and bottom line performance in comparison to peers. Starting at the upper left, Autodesk recently showed this FY '23 Rule of 40 comparison at their Investor Day in March. Note that Autodesk's definition of the Rule of 40 uses free cash flow margin rather than operating margin, which is probably a good way to look at it given ASC 606 accounting noise. I'd prefer to use ARR rather than revenue growth for the same reasons but I realize that makes comparisons of actuals hard to do. So for today's purposes, we will embrace Autodesk's definition. That said, this chart showed PTC with an anemic 28% figure for fiscal '23, which didn't sound right to me given the margin expansion I just described.  So moving to the upper right, our team looked up all the axles to reverse engineer the Autodesk chart and two things became clear: First, Autodesk has a strange fiscal calendar, where 11 of the 12 months of their fiscal '23 actually happened in calendar '22. Most of the companies in this analysis, including PTC, I would say this is really a '22 comparison. Second, there are some significant onetime factors involved here, too, because PTC's fiscal '22 cash flow was negatively impacted by the restructuring I mentioned, whereas Autodesk cash flow during this period was helped by their practice of building multiyear subscriptions upfront, which they've since committed to move away from. Putting those points aside, obviously, the future matters more than the past. So it's interesting to consider the trajectory of companies in this peer group going forward. The two charts on the lower half of the slide have been created using consensus data pulled directly from FactSet. In the current year, based on strong growth and significant free cash flow margin expansion that PTC has been delivering, we're expected to move to the middle of the pack while Autodesk recedes. Next year in 2024, based on continued growth and margin expansion, PTC is expected to lead this peer group in the Rule of 40 as Autodesk defines it. Of course, these are just consensus models and not actuals, but we're comfortable with the expectations shown here for PTC because they align to the midterm guidance ranges we provided at our November Investor Day. We'll plan to revisit this useful chart periodically to track how PTC is doing as compared to peers. Turning to Slide 8. Let's look at ARR growth by geography. ARR growth in Americas was 29%. In Europe ARR growth was 25% and in Asia Pacific, ARR growth was 19%. All three regions benefited from the acquisitions of ServiceMax and Codebeamer, albeit to differing degrees. Next, let's look at ARR performance of our product groups on Slide 9. In CAD, which is those products that enable authoring of product data, we delivered 10% ARR growth in Q2 in a market that's been growing an estimated 7%. Within these results, the growth was primarily driven by Creo, but supplemented by strong percentage growth in Onshape.  Shave Blecher, recently noted in his research that Creo has been the fastest-growing major CAD system for 12 of the past 16 quarters. Onshape is growing at a considerably faster rate than Creo. So PTC is clearly taking shares in different parts of the market with both products. I feel we have a great hand to play in the CAD market. In PLM, which includes those products that enable data and process management, our ARR growth rate in Q1 was 39% or 16% organic with the inorganic growth coming from both ServiceMax and Codebeamer, Codebeamer having enjoyed a tailwind from the ALM mix shift factor I previously mentioned.  In PLM, we continue to significantly outperform the market, which has been growing approximately 8% in core PLM, but more like 11% when you roll in the extended PLM categories of ALM and SLM. ARR growth for PLM in Q2 was primarily driven by Windchill, supplemented by strong percentage growth in arena, IoT and SLM. PTC has a strong hand to play here, too. As clearly, we are taking significant market share in the PLM market as well. Turning to Slide 10. Now that 2022 is behind us, we thought it would be helpful to publish PTC's calendar year performance for those analysts who wish to make growth and market share comparisons on that basis. As you can see, calendar 2022 was a strong year for PTC, and it was our fifth consecutive year of double-digit ARR growth in both our CAD and PLM segments. In PLM, the addition of ServiceMax into our portfolio brings management of the customer's installed base of products into our product life cycle management offering and this significantly expands our category leadership. On a calendar 2022 basis, inclusive of the $153 million ServiceMax contributed on a pro forma basis, PLM revenue was $1.15 billion. ARR growth was strong at 20%, with organic at 18%, which suggests we're widening the leadership gap.  In Canada, results were all organic in calendar '22 and growth here too remains well ahead of the market. CAD revenue was $788 million in calendar '22 and the ARR growth rate was 10%. PTC's growth rate in CAD is best-in-class. So while we're not the category leader, given the differential growth rates we are in the passing lane. Turning to Slide 11. In just a few weeks, we're hosting our big LiveWorx event on May 15 and 16 here in Boston. This is our flagship event dedicated to our customer and partner ecosystem, and we're also welcoming investors to join. It's a great way to network and learn first-hand all things PTC. This year, we're excited to try a new approach to maximize the investor experience. In addition to having an exclusive investor lunch session on sustainability as well as an executive Q&A session, we have organized an immersive investor track, which will enable you to attend our main keynote and our spotlight sessions on ServiceMax, Windchill and Creo Plus sitting alongside our customers and partners.  We will host a special demo tour for investors, and you'll be free to explore and learn more on your own too. There will also be opportunities to network with our executive team and our Board will be present as well. We would love to see you at LiveWorx. If you need registration details, please reach out to our IR team. On Slide 12, one of the demos you can check out in the Windchill section will come from Fresenius Medical Care. Fresenius is the world's leading provider of products and services for individuals that need dialysis treatment. Fresenius produces dialysis machines in over 40 manufacturing facilities around the globe and also runs a network of over 4,000 dialysis clinics. There's a lot of inherent complexity in their product life cycle.  Fresenius saw the opportunity to bring down treatment costs and improve their products by building a digital thread workflow across their engineering, manufacturing and service domains. Windchill was selected as the backbone to bring product data together and enable better collaboration across internal groups and with external partners. Fresenius subsequently standardized on Creo and has since adopted ThingWorx for smart connected products and for smart connected factories. Currently, they're exploring how they might leverage ServiceMax in that digital threat. Fresenius is a great case study that shows the breadth of what PTC technology can enable. For another teaser on Slide 13, one of the demos you literally can't missing is the Komatsu wheel loader. It's big and yellow and weighs 30 tons. Using Creo and Windchill Komatsu engineers and manufacturers' equipment that customers use for decades in the field. Because Komatsu's aftermarket service business contributes significantly to their overall financial results, they've been investing in software to make the services business more efficient and productive. Komatsu has been using PTC service life cycle management software, including Servigistics since 2006 to optimize spare parts inventory and Arbotex since 2015 to streamline the availability of service instructions.  Last year, Komatsu expanded their investment in service technology by selecting ServiceMax. Komatsu purchased software independently from PTC and ServiceMax when we are still separate companies, but represents a good example of the type of customer where we think we can be successful cross-selling because they really appreciate that 3D model-based digital threat. Komatsu is also a poster child for my point that for every customer that ServiceMax currently has, PTC has 10 more that look like them. Companies that use Creo and Windchill to produce products that have long service lives. Summarizing then on Slide 14 and fiscal '23, we're continuing to make good progress toward our midterm guidance targets. With solid first half results, we're well positioned to achieve our full year ARR and free cash flow guidance, which ticked upward this quarter. PTC has expanded our clear category leadership role in PLM, which has become a must-have technology backbone for digital transformation at industrial companies. The addition of ServiceMax further extends what was already a unique portfolio of interconnected digital threat capabilities across the full product life cycle. Second, with organic growth at double-digit levels already, we're in the early days, but executing well against the major on-premise to SaaS transformation that should provide a multiyear growth tailwind. You'll learn a lot more about our SaaS strategy at LiveWorx. Third, we have a well-earned reputation for driving margin expansion that goes back more than a decade and the proactive changes we made are driving high levels of free cash flow growth through the midterm guidance period. Fourth, with organic ARR in the low teens, juxtaposed on PMIs in the upper 40s, I trust you would agree we are actively demonstrating that our business model is very resilient. Q2 bookings were solid and churn outstanding.  Top line growth and bottom line profitability are approaching peer leadership levels even in this challenging macro environment. And finally, we're led by a team that has deep expertise and a proven ability to drive growth and margin expansion. I want to congratulate Mike DiTullio, who was promoted to President and COO in the quarter. Mike and I have decades of experience working together, and I'm very much enjoying this new division of labor.  Congratulations also to Neil Barua, who was previously the CEO of ServiceMax and joined PTC as the President of our SLM business that combines ServiceMax with PTC's broader suite of service-related technologies and use cases. We're pleased to have Neil join the team and love what he brings to the business. With so many positive trends going our way, I continue to believe PTC has a tremendous opportunity to create shareholder value. With that, I'll turn it over to Kristian for his more detailed commentary on financial results and guidance. Yes. Good question. So we believe that we're taking share with both products because both products are growing double digits. I mean, Creo is growing low double digits and Onshape growing at a multiple of that. So I think we're taking share of them in different parts of the market. Creo is a little bit in the upper half of the market. And today, Onshape is typically a little bit in the bottom half of the market.  They're both, for example, competing against SolidWorks but perhaps at different ends of the SolidWorks base. Creo might be taking customers that have kind of outgrown SolidWorks and Onshape's taking customers that, for example, might feel like SolidWorks is too heavy, too expensive, too complicated, requires a system administrator. They just -- they really like the idea of the pure web-based technology. So both products are doing very well. And in order to sustain that level of performance. Keep in mind for Creo, we're talking 22 quarters, 23 quarters now in a row we've had a double-digit growth rate, one of those numbers right now. You can't do that unless there's something good happening. And I mean, part of it is the business model, we're clear on that. But part of it is we're winning a lot of new orders as well.  Now what would the advent of Creo Plus deal. First of all, it's not yet in the market, but we're launching it at LiveWorx in a couple of weeks. That should be helpful. It should be helpful for two reasons. One is it's more compelling, some of the advantages that are present in Onshape will become present in Creo. Some of the same characteristics.  There won't be -- it won't be exactly like Onshape because it's fully Creo plus is fully compatible with Creo, and that's a fixed requirement. But I think some of the real advantages of always being on the latest version and so forth will accrue to Creo as well. And then second all, we will ultimately lift and shift Creo customers to the cloud, and there will be an uplift there as well. So it's only helpful, it's only helpful. Steve, I mean, we had a very good orders quarter and it wouldn't be fair for us to give the details when it's a good strong quarter when we didn't want to give them when it was a softer quarter last quarter. So I mean I think Kristian took you through the guidance changes. In general, we're tracking well. Renewals have been our friend all year. But as Christian said, in the first half, we have a number that doesn't compare too badly to a first half last year that was a record first half.  So I think it's strong, but it is complicated to understand how much is going into deferred and when does it come back out? And by the way, how much is coming out next quarter and the quarter after that, it just requires a level of disclosure that seems a little bit inappropriate for an earnings call. So that's why we're just trying to back off and give you directional commentary on bookings and churn and much more precise commentary around ARR guidance. Well, first thing to know, Ken, is there's nothing but goodness in ramp deals. They make it a little bit more difficult for us to predict ARR though because, for example, if we were to get a very large order, I suppose we could take a smaller one that started all at once and go get another order later to grow it. But yes, in that environment, we'd rather take the larger order now with a ramp because it's got the customer locked in, ramps are irrevocable. It's not something Kristian talked earlier about churn, but just to be clear, you can only turn at the end of a ramp, not during one.  So we like the commitment. And if a customer is willing to make a commitment, we want to take it. But it just makes it a little harder for us to predict. And as Kristian said, in Q4, it's really hard because sometimes a ramp in Q2, the first tranche might start in Q3 or Q4. But in Q4, if it's a ramp, anything that's not in Q4 is in the next fiscal year. So that makes it a little tricky to predict. But in general, ramps are great. And we do reward our sales team for getting them, but we also have a strange incentive that they get a little bit more credit for dollars to come in, in the front part of a ramp than they do for dollars to come in, in the back part of the ramp. But they still get credit for dollars that grow as the ramp goes on. So we want the bigger deals, the bigger commitments. And of course, we want them to start as soon as possible and grow as soon as possible. And that's all a point of negotiation with the customers. Yes. Codebeamer is both an upsell and a tip of the spear. So some amount of the Codebeamer success, we're cross-selling from Windchill because Windchill and Codebeamer sold together like the previous product integrity and Windchill frequently were. So we're cross-selling from a windshield position. But for example, in some of these automotive accounts, we don't have a windchill position. And Codebeamer is a very compelling product, and then we'll leave with it.  And we'll see if we get Codebeamer installed. Can we cross-sell from there? I don't know. We haven't had really enough time with it yet. But certainly, we've penetrated some accounts or Codebeamer where we had no significant windchill position, and that's good news. Yes. I mean I think there's a couple of words that go together here. There's the digital thread idea, which means data created upstream is used multiple times downstream. Then there's the model-based idea, which says, by the way, let's make sure this data is 3D models, not 2D drawing, so model-based digital thread and then closed loop means, let's make sure that things we find in the manufacturing process, for example, using DPM get reflected into changes upstream, either in the product itself or in the manufacturing plan.  And then let's make sure that what we find when the products all the field at the customer site, for example, IoT, smart connected products, that is likewise being funnel back end, ultimately, upstream, maybe into the product, maybe into the manufacturing process, maybe into the service process. But let's have these feedback loops. So I think this concept PTC has of a model-based closed-loop digital thread is very powerful, and I'd say pretty unique. And yes, I'll talk a lot about that at LiveWorx. If I know it will be a kind of theme throughout. So it allows us to cross-sell in a lot of directions. We talked about Codebeamer and Windchill. Well, there's going to be a similar conversation between Windchill and ServiceMax and between ServiceMax and Servigistics and ServiceMax and ThingWorx IoT. So we like this idea of a lot of products that are very compelling could be sold stand-alone as the tip of the spear but then integrated into this digital thread so that they could -- kind of better together. Better together, but you don't have to buy it all. If you want to use ServiceMax with some other PLM system, fine, we know how to make that work. And you have to be that way because it's practical. Customers don't throw out all their technology and switch like stock and barrel.  They look at what they have and they want to systematically over time, upgrade it. And so we get in there, we might win with Windchill and then we might win with Codebeamer, and then we might introduce ServiceMax, and that's kind of how we've built our whole growth story over the last decade is by really perfecting these cross-sell motions. Okay. Well, great. Thank you, Lisa. And for anybody who has more questions that maybe we didn't have time to get to, please come to LiveWorx, you're going to get lots and lots and lots of information. You're going to get a firehose -- promise. So the real day we have set up for investors is May 16. You're welcome to stay longer, if you want, but that's where we had this sort of investor track that was on the slide.  Otherwise, if you can't come to LiveWorx, there will be a couple of other opportunities to catch us. I know that Kristian, myself and Mike DiTullio, are going to the JPMorgan conference in Boston on May 22. We're hosting a Bank of America roadshow here at PTC on June 5. And then Christian, our Chief Product Officer, Kevin Ren, are participating in the Stifel conference in Boston on June 6. So lots of opportunities to engage us with more questions and get more information across all those different events I spoke of. So thanks for your time today. Really appreciate it, and look forward to talking to you during the course of the quarter or in 90 days as the case may be."

During today\u2019s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation the conference will be open for questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Shimao, PTC's Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMatt Shimao: Good afternoon. Thank you, Rob and welcome to PTC's first quarter 2023 conference call. On the call today are Jim Heppelmann, Chief Executive Officer; Kristian Talvitie, Chief Financial Officer; and Mike DiTullio, President of our Digital Thread Group. Today's conference call is being broadcast live through an audio webcast and a replay of the call will be available later today at www.ptc.com. During this call, PTC will be making forward-looking statements including guidance as to future operating results. Because such statements deal with future events, actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements can be found in PTC's Annual Report on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission as well as in today's press release. The forward-looking statements including guidance provided during this call are valid only as of today's date, February 1 2023 and PTC assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. During the call, PTC will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in today's press release made available on our website. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to PTC's Chief Executive Officer, Jim Heppelmann.\nJim Heppelmann: Thanks, Matt. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. Turning to slide 4. I'm pleased to report that despite seeing some incremental macro softness, PTC delivered a solid first quarter to kick off fiscal 2023. On the top-line metric of ARR we came in at $1.603 billion, which was above the high end of our range and up more than 15% year-over-year. The strength was broad-based across all product groups and geographies. Sorry about that, a little interference. The strength was broad-based across all product groups and geographies. Organic ARR growth was 14% with Codebeamer then contributing that extra point of inorganic growth. The strong Q1 ARR results put the company in a position to narrow our original 10% to 14% full year ARR guidance to 11% to 14% as we feel that the 10% outcome has become increasingly implausible with a solid Q1 behind us. Switching to our bottom-line metric of free cash flow we delivered $172 million ahead of our guidance and up 28% year-over-year. We raised our free cash flow guidance for the full year by $15 million. Currency had little impact to free cash flow in Q1, but it is expected to be incrementally helpful as the year progresses. On the subject of currency, I'll remind you that Kristian will cover the ongoing effects of foreign exchange fluctuations later in the call. So to simplify things I'll focus my discussion on constant currency results when discussing top-line metrics. Turning to slide 5. Shortly after our first quarter close we completed the acquisition of ServiceMax. ServiceMax is not included in the Q1 results we reported though we did incur some acquisition-related costs that we're a headwind to our nevertheless strong free cash flow results in Q1. With the deal now closed ServiceMax will be included in our guidance going forward. To recap the highlights of this business as now part of PTC, ServiceMax is used to manage the service processes for high-value long life cycle products. Think of products like an MRI machine in a hospital, a machine tool in a factory or pumping equipment at a refinery. This has always been a sweet spot for PTC and we have many customers matching this profile. Referring to the infinity diagram on slide 5, many of you know that PTC's logo represents the interplay of physical and digital and that logo provides a good way to explain the fit with ServiceMax. The digital part of our logo refers to when products are under development. At this point, they exist in a purely digital form which is authored in Creo and managed in Windchill. Being purely digital at this stage products are easy to change and highly configurable. Each time our customers get an order their factories take a configuration of the digital product data that matches the order and use it as the recipe to produce the physical product, which is then delivered to the end customer. That's where the physical part of our logo fits in. Physical products are very different. If you want to change them for example, you need to dispatch a truck to the customer site carrying a technician and spare parts. Spare parts are managed in our Servigistics software. The technician will need access to similar types of digital product information, as what the factory used when creating the product. This service information is created using Arbortext and Vuforia. High-value products are operated by the customer for years or even decades. These products require regular service to keep them up and running, and this service is typically provided by the manufacturer, who views the recurring service contracts and spare part sales as a highly desirable source of revenue and profit. ServiceMax helps the manufacturer manage their entire installed base of physical product instances and orchestrates all the necessary service activities. By monitoring the installed base of products, ThingWorx adds a lot of value to ServiceMax because it allows service to be more proactive and preventative in nature. And sometimes the service can even be done remotely thereby canceling the need for a truck roll. As you can see ServiceMax has great synergy with Creo and Windchill, because on one hand the service process consumes the digital product data created in engineering in the form of parts catalogs and service instructions. And on the other hand, the service process is the primary source of feedback that drives ongoing product improvements through engineering change orders or ECOs. Windchill serves as the system of record for the digital definition of all possible product configurations and ServiceMax serves as the system of record for the actual physical instances of products that exist, each of which may have a slightly different configuration. As the infinity diagram implies, there is a digital thread of product information flowing between these key systems in both directions throughout the product life cycle. Aligning ServiceMax with PTC's various offerings will lubricate this flow of data creating tremendous business value. No competitor has a solution comparable to this. Equally important, as the service system of record, ServiceMax knits together our existing SLM products, allowing PTC to now offer the industry's first truly comprehensive offering for service management optimization. You can think of our new SLM offering as a hub-and-spoke model with ServiceMax as the hub and PTC's various other service solutions as spokes. For example, ThingWorx IoT connects to and monitors the vital signs of installed products to enable preventative remote service. Arbortext dynamically publishes technical service information to match each product configuration in the installed base. Vuforia AR enables this technical service information to be augmented onto each installed product to make service technicians more productive. And Servigistics allows customer service level agreements to be met, while carrying the smallest possible inventory of spare parts. With the acquisition now closed work is underway to enable deeper integration between ServiceMax and these various PTC offering. I'm pleased to announce that Neil Barua the CEO of ServiceMax is joining PTC and will preside over this expanded SLM business that now exceeds $300 million of combined ARR. Neil and team will unveil a broad new SLM vision at our LiveWorx conference in May. And based on the number of inquiries we're getting, I expect it to be one of the highlights of the conference. The strategic fit with ServiceMax is excellent and we're excited about the synergies we can generate by cross-selling from engineering to service and vice versa and also cross-selling between our various SLM offerings within the service domain. The financial fit is excellent too as the transaction is expected to be accretive to PTC's growth rate as well as the PTC's cash flow and this drove part of today's guidance raises. ServiceMax also increases PTC's total addressable market. The ServiceMax business has been growing in the mid-teens which is a few points faster than the market, but we see potential for the business to accelerate to high-teens growth over time as synergistic cross-sell opportunities are realized. Turning to Slide 6. Given the elevated focus on profitability that investors all share in today's market, I want to reiterate the margin expansion program that PTC management has been driving. The organizational realignment we did at the end of fiscal 2021 and the resource rebalancing work we did during fiscal 2022 have created an organizational model for PTC that's both highly efficient and fully sustainable. When we made these changes, we were not addressing a problem per se, but simply pursuing margin expansion opportunities that we had identified. The actions we took proved prescient, as we're now well-positioned for a macro downturn. While many notable tech companies are announcing layoffs to come to terms of bloated cost structures, thanks to our proactive actions, we're entering this period of uncertainty with a very lean cost structure and we do not anticipate any need for layoffs or restructuring. In Q1, non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 36% compared to 35% a year ago. That sounds like progress, but due to ASC 606 noise, it doesn't fully capture the full magnitude of improvements we've made. We prefer to assess our margin progress by focusing on a more meaningful metric we now call operating efficiency. Operating efficiency is the same metric that we previously called cash contribution margin, but we're changing the name of the metric to be more precise that it is an operating metric, not a non-GAAP financial measure. This is a change in name only. The metric is still calculated the same way and still measures how much of our billings we're able to convert to cash flow each year. At the midpoint of our ARR guidance range, based on actions already taken, we continue to expect this operating efficiency to expand by another approximately 450 basis points in fiscal 2023, following the 300 basis point improvement we delivered last year. The significant operating efficiency improvement when layered on top of double-digit ARR growth is what drove the strong Q1 free cash flow result and is what will drive the 38% free cash flow growth we're guiding to for fiscal 2023. Kristian will elaborate further. Turning to slide seven. As you're aware, our FY 2023 ARR guidance range, has from the start, contemplated the possibility of a potential macro downturn. In Q1, we saw further signs of a downturn in the form of incrementally softer bookings. At the same time, we were comforted by strong renewals, which actually improved slightly year-over-year, reinforcing just how sticky our software is. The net impact of these softer bookings and stronger renewals was a slowdown of about 0.5 percentage point from last quarter's 16% ARR growth rate, taking the Q1 ARR growth rate down to about 15.5%. This was obviously less than we had allowed at the high end of our Q1 ARR guidance range, so ARR results landed $3 million above the range. The softness was relatively consistent across various dimensions of the business, suggesting it was macro related, rather than any type of competitive issue. The summary is that, after posting 15.5% growth in Q1, we remain well positioned to perform against our financial targets and indeed, have raised our guidance accordingly. Turning to slide eight. With Q1 behind us, as compared to our original guidance, we're now on track to deliver ARR growth results within a narrower 11% to 14% range in fiscal 2023, with the low end having been raised, because the 10% outcome is less plausible now, given that solid Q1. Keep in mind, the addition of ServiceMax to our portfolio happens here in Q2 and the inclusion of ServiceMax will recalibrate the ARR growth range upward. In a few minutes Kristian will outline a new guidance range, that's essentially 11% to 14% plus 1,100 basis points more from ServiceMax added on top. Across this range of ARR outcomes, we've also raised the original cash flow guidance we provided a quarter ago by $15 million to $575 million, which now represents 38% growth for the full year. The raise is powered in roughly equal parts: by a strong free cash flow result in Q1, the expected $5 million benefit from the ServiceMax acquisition and improving foreign exchange rates. Should exchange rates hold, or further improve, FX could prove incrementally helpful as the year progresses. Kristian will elaborate on the various factors involved here too. Turning to slide nine. Let's look at ARR growth across all geographies. ARR growth in the Americas was 16%. In Europe, ARR growth was 15%, despite the Russia exit in Q2 of last year which still affects the growth rate, given the trailing nature of our ARR metric. ARR growth in APAC was 12%. Across all geographies, the largest ARR growth in terms of magnitude was driven by continued strong demand for Creo CAD and Windchill PLM products. In the Americas, we saw the strongest ARR percentage growth in IoT, Arena, Windchill and Onshape. In Europe and APAC the growth rate was highest for Arena, which has been expanding outside the US. Arbortext and Servigistics both delivered strong growth rates in Europe and APAC. And finally in Europe, Onshape and augmented reality also delivered strong percentage growth. Next let's look at the ARR performance of our product groups on Slide 10. In CAD, which is those products that enable authoring of product data, we delivered 10% ARR growth in Q1 in a market that has been growing approximately 8%. Within this the growth was primarily driven by Creo, supplemented by strong percentage growth in Onshape and Arbortext. In PLM, which includes those products that enable data management and process orchestration for product development, our ARR growth rate in Q1 was 20%, or 18% organic with strong growth across all geographic regions. In PLM, we continue to significantly outperform the market, which has been growing approximately 12%. Half of our Q1 growth was driven by Windchill, but ALM including Codebeamer and Arena, IoT and retail PLM also contributed to great Q1 PLM results by delivering strong percentage growth. I'd like to discuss Windchill+ in the context of a new logo customer on Slide 11. Given the importance of our SaaS transformation program as a growth driver, I'm pleased to see good progress ramping up the new multi-tenant Windchill+ solution. While it's still early across a combination of new logo deals as well as lift-and-shift SaaS conversions, we now have about a dozen Windchill+ customers in production or headed there shortly with dozens more opportunities in the pipeline. As we said at our Investor Day, we expect an S-curve type of ramp over multiple years for our Plus offerings. And thus far we're tracking well to that expectation. To share a customer story, we landed a new logo deal with a well-known motor sports company. That's a great example of an organization that's reaping the benefits of the streamlined PLM implementation experience that Windchill+ offers. This customer has committed to enter a new racing circuit, but faces a tight time line to get prepared. Their team needed a PLM system to be in place quickly, because they're designing a more efficient power unit that needs to be completed and tested in short order. And then as usual there'll be a steady diet of changes and improvements thereafter. With their Windchill+ implementation the motor sports company achieved a production ramp-up time of several months, including integration with their hybrid SaaS ERP system. They got there so quickly by leveraging the out-of-the-box capability of Windchill+ delivered by PTC to the customer as a secure preconfigured service. This customer has no dedicated IT team, so leveraging SaaS applications is important to enable them to keep their internal efforts focused on racing, while improving collaboration across team members in the field and around the globe. As a reminder, Windchill+ is the tip of the iceberg of a bigger Plus strategy, and you'll see us follow with Creo+ and similar premium SaaS offerings in FY 2023 and beyond. We are aiming to launch Creo+ and the bigger Plus strategy at LiveWorx in May. I'd like to share another customer anecdote to help you better understand the immense power of our technology. Turning to Slide 12, I want to tell you about an important project from our customers at the U.S. Department of Energy. I trust you saw the mid-December news that for the first time scientists at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory have produced a nuclear fusion reaction that generated more energy than it consumed. This major scientific breakthrough happened at Lawrence Livermore's National Ignition Facility and may pave the way to a future filled with clean energy. The National Ignition Facility, or NIF is essentially a massive machine of enormous size and complexity. The NIF is a precision-engineered system of systems that generates and then directs 192 powerful laser beams onto a pencil eraser-sized area that heats to millions of degrees to ignite the nuclear fusion reaction. The sports stadium-sized NIF machine is all modeled in Creo and Windchill, everything they say except the walls and the bathrooms. With 3.5 million components, we believe the NIF is the largest Creo and Windchill assembly ever made and very likely, the largest assembly ever modeled in 3D CAD, which is a real testament to the power of our technology. During our regular collaborations with DOE teams over many years now, PTC product teams have been challenged to further develop our products to enable such highly advanced projects in what has proven to be a mutually beneficial relationship. While substantially more work lies ahead in the effort to harness the potential of fusion energy as demonstrated by the NIF, we're very proud of the role that our technology has played in enabling this early breakthrough. And the announcement was exciting for many PTC employees who have been involved including me. PTC may very well-prove to play a key enabling role in the ultimate ESG breakthrough. Summarizing then on slide 13. While in Q1, we saw incremental signs of a macro slowdown there's a lot going our way right now. First, PTC has established itself as the clear category leader in PLM, which has become a must-have technology backbone for digital transformation at industrial companies. We just posted another quarter of 18% organic PLM growth well-ahead of market peers. We are conquering the PLM market. The addition of ServiceMax further extends what was already a unique portfolio of interconnected digital thread capabilities across the full product life cycle and ServiceMax is expected to be a tailwind to ARR and free cash flow right from the start. Both Codebeamer and ServiceMax will provide a big boost to our PLM conquest efforts. Second, while the company growth is at a double-digit level already, we're in the early days but executing well against a major on-premise to SaaS transformation that should provide a multiyear growth tailwind. Third, we have a reputation for driving margin expansion that goes back more than a decade and the proactive changes we've already made are driving high levels of free cash flow growth again this year. Fourth, we're demonstrating that our business model is very resilient. Top line growth and bottom line profitability are at levels that are amongst the best in our industry peer group. Not many peer companies are projecting the double-digit organic top line and 38% bottom line growth that PTC is guiding to this year. And finally, we're led by a team that has deep expertise and proven ability to drive growth and margin expansion. We're happy to welcome Neil Barua to the PTC executive ranks because Neil and the entire ServiceMax team share the same depth and passion for the business that's so important here in the PTC culture. With so many positive trends going our way, I continue to believe PTC has a tremendous opportunity to create shareholder value even in the face of a macro downturn we've all been expecting. With that, I'll turn it over to Kristian for his more detailed commentary on financial results and guidance.\nKristian Talvitie: Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our results I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance and ARR references will be in both constant currency and as reported. Turning to slide 15. In Q1 2023 our constant currency ARR was $1.6 billion, up 15% year-over-year and exceeded guidance. On an organic constant currency basis excluding Codebeamer, our ARR was $1.59 billion, up 14% year-over-year. As Jim explained our top line strength in Q1 was broad-based. We're executing well against our strategy and we're continuing to improve upon the strong market position that we have. Our SaaS businesses saw continued solid ARR growth in Q1 as well. On an as-reported basis we delivered 11% ARR growth, 10% organic due to the impact of FX headwinds. Currency fluctuations were positive in Q1 of 2023 and our as reported ARR was $60 million higher than our constant currency ARR. However, on a year-over-year basis currency fluctuations were still a meaningful headwind. Moving on to cash flow. Our results were strong with Q1 coming in ahead of our guidance across all metrics. While it was great to see favorable FX movements during Q1, there was no impact to free cash flow from FX. Our free cash flow performance in Q1 was driven by strong execution based on a foundation of solid collections and cost discipline. Our cash from operations also came in ahead of guidance by $11 million, due to a combination of free cash flow outperformance and the timing of capital expenditures which were $9 million in Q1, compared to our guidance of $5 million. When assessing and forecasting our cash flow, it's important to remember a few things. The majority of our collections occur in the first half of our fiscal year. Q4 is our lowest cash flow generation quarter. And on an annual basis, free cash flow is primarily a function of ARR, rather than revenue. Q1 revenue of $466 million increased 2% year-over-year and was up 9% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. In Q1 recurring revenue grew by $12 million, perpetual license revenue grew by $5 million and professional services revenue declined by $9 million year-over-year. The decline in professional services revenue is consistent with our strategy to transition some of our professional services talent and revenue to DxP our partner for Windchill+ lift-and-shift projects. As we've discussed previously, revenue is impacted by ASC 606, so we do not believe that revenue is the best indicator of our underlying business performance, but we'd rather guide you to ARR as the best metric to understand our top line performance and cash generation. Before I move on to the balance sheet, I'd like to provide some color on our non-GAAP operating margin, as I did last quarter. Compared to, Q1 2022 our non-GAAP operating margin expanded by approximately 100 basis points to 36% in Q1 of 2023. We continue to caution that because revenue is impacted by ASC 606 other derivative metrics such as gross margin, operating margin, operating profit and EPS are all impacted as well. Still, it's worth mentioning, that we're benefiting from the work that we've done to optimize our cost structure in fiscal 2022. On a year-over-year basis in Q1, we continue to grow our top line at a faster rate than our spending and delivered significantly higher ARR and free cash flow. Moving to slide 16, we ended the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $388 million. Our gross debt was $1.36 billion with an aggregate interest rate of 4.3%. Looking forward, in Q2, in conjunction with the ServiceMax acquisition, we took out a $500 million term loan and increased the size of our revolving credit facility from $1 billion to $1.25 billion. The net of new borrowings and debt pay down in Q2, should leave us with $1 billion in high-yield notes, the $500 million term loan and approximately $450 million drawn on the revolver at the end of the quarter. As a reminder, we also have a second payment for the ServiceMax transaction, due in October 2023 of $650 million. We intend to fund this with cash on hand and our revolving credit facility. This deferred payment is included in debt on our balance sheet and is factored into our debt-to-EBITDA ratio. We expect our debt-to-EBITDA ratio to be approximately 3.4 times, at the end of Q2. We should be around three times levered by Q4 and below three times throughout fiscal 2024 and into fiscal 2025, as we continue to pay down debt. To help you with your models, in fiscal 2023 as it relates to cash flow, we expect total cash interest payments of approximately $85 million. And as it relates to the P&L, we expect interest expense of approximately $125 million. Given the interest rate environment, we expect to prioritize paying down our debt in fiscal 2023 and 2024. We'll pause, our share repurchase program. And in fiscal 2023, we expect our diluted share count to increase by a little under, one million shares. We expect to have substantially reduced our debt by the end of fiscal 2024 and we'll then revisit the prioritization of debt paydown and share repurchases. Despite this interruption, our long-term goal assuming our debt-to-EBITDA ratio is below three times, remains to return approximately 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases, while also taking into consideration the interest rate environment and strategic opportunities. Next slide 17 shows our ARR by product group. In the constant currency section on the top half of the slide, we used FX rates as of September 30, 2022 to calculate ARR for all periods. You can see on the slide, how currency dynamics have resulted in differences between our constant currency ARR and as-reported ARR over the past five quarters. Exchange rates continued to move materially in Q1 2023 causing a difference between constant currency ARR results and our as-reported ARR results. Based on the exchange rates, at the end of Q1 2023, our as-reported ARR in Q2 of 2023 would be higher by approximately $62 million compared to the midpoint of our constant currency guidance and fiscal 2023 as-reported ARR would be higher by approximately $67 million compared to our constant currency guidance midpoint. We report both actual and constant currency results and FX fluctuations can obviously have a material impact on actuals. But remember that, we provide ARR guidance on a constant currency basis. If exchange rates fluctuate significantly between the end of Q1 and in the end of Q2 2023 the impact to our as-reported ARR would also change. We believe constant currency is the best way to evaluate the top line performance of our business, because it removes currency fluctuations from the analysis, positive or negative. Given the sharp moves that, we've seen recently, I thought it would be useful to provide an updated ARR sensitivity rule of thumb on slide 18. In addition to the US dollar, we transact in euro, yen and more than 10 other additional currencies. Using currency rates at the end of Q1, the impact of a $0.10 change in the euro-to-USD rate would be $39 million positive or negative, and the impact of a \u00a510 change in the USD-to-yen rate would be $9 million again positive or negative. And of course, the estimated dollar impact to ARR is dependent on the size of the ARR base. With that, I'll take you through our guidance on slide 19. For our ARR guidance amounts, we're using FX rates as of September 30, 2022. The previous guidance shown on this slide is from our November 2022 Investor Day presentation, and includes ServiceMax. For fiscal 2023, we expect constant currency ARR growth of 22% to 25%, which corresponds to a fiscal 2023 constant currency ARR guidance range of $1.91 billion to $1.96 billion. This narrowed range is based on two primary factors. First, we took up the bottom end of the 10% to 14% guidance range we provided on our Q4 earnings call, which excluded ServiceMax. While we saw some incremental macro-driven booking softness in our first quarter, this was partially offset by better-than-planned churn and our guidance contemplated the potential for a much bigger impact than what we saw, and we actually finished $3 million above the high end of our Q1 2023 ARR guidance range. So based on our strong Q1 results and forecast for the year, while still being mindful of the macro environment, we feel comfortable taking up the lower end of the range, which still allows for continued softening due to the macro environment. Secondly, the other update to guidance is adding approximately $170 million for ServiceMax compared to our Investor Day assumption, which was for approximately $175 million. There's a few reasons we're doing this, which include. First, ServiceMax' fiscal quarters ended one month later than ours. As we all know, the final month of a quarter in a software company is really when the magic happens. So, while I think that ultimately their results will align with PTC's quarter-end hockey stick, I also think it's prudent to assume it may take a few quarters to align selling and customer buying behavior. Second, as you know Salesforce.com is a go-to-market partner with ServiceMax for its Asset 360 product. Salesforce just announced a fairly sizable reduction in force. And while we do not know if or how this may impact ServiceMax business in the coming months, we feel it's a valid concern which we want to account for in our guidance. And third, frankly, the uncertainty of the macro environment applies to ServiceMax as well. So, it's primarily for these three reasons that we're derisking the ServiceMax guidance for fiscal 2023 and adding $170 million to our now updated 11% to 14% guidance range. With a strong Q1 behind us and given our pipeline and forecast and how we've set our guidance ranges, we believe we're well-positioned to achieve our fiscal 2023 ARR guidance. Note that we expect modestly more deferred ARR to become ARR in fiscal 2023 than in fiscal 2022. And our churn in Q1 was lower than planned. In dollar terms, churn was actually lower in Q1 2023 than it was in Q1 2022 and that's against a bigger base of ARR. For Q2, we're guiding constant currency ARR to be in the range of $1.79 billion to $1.81 billion. At the midpoint, this equates to 25% constant currency growth. I'll discuss our Q2 guidance in more detail on the next slide. On cash flows for fiscal 2023, we raised our guidance. We now expect cash from operations of approximately $595 million, up 37%; and free cash flow of approximately $575 million up approximately 38%. Compared to the guidance we provided a quarter ago, our updated $575 million target for free cash flow factors in our strong execution and results in Q1, $5 million from the ServiceMax acquisition which we already communicated at our Investor Day, as well as an increase from FX tailwinds for the remainder of the year. Assuming we hit our Q2 free cash flow target, we'll be at approximately 65% of our full year target similar in the past two years. Our CapEx assumption for fiscal 2023 is $20 million. Therefore relative to our free cash flow guidance of $575 million, we're guiding to cash from operations of $595 million. For Q2, we're guiding to free cash flow of approximately $200 million. We expect approximately $5 million of CapEx in Q2 and therefore, our cash from operations guidance is approximately $205 million. As you model the quarters of fiscal 2023, keep in mind, we expect the quarterly distribution of full year cash flow results to follow a similar pattern as in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 with over 60% of cash flow in the first half of the year and Q4 being our lowest cash flow generation quarter. Moving on to revenue guidance, we raised -- which we raised from our November 2nd guidance, primarily because of ServiceMax and currency. For fiscal 2023, we expect revenue of $2.07 billion to $2.15 billion which corresponds to a growth rate of 7% to 11%. ASC 606 makes revenue fairly difficult to predict in the short-term for on-premise subscription companies, hence the wide range. More importantly, revenue does not influence ARR or cash generation as we typically bill customers annually upfront regardless of term lengths. Turning to slide 20. Here is an illustrative constant currency ARR model for Q2 2023. You can see our results over the past nine quarters and in the far-right column, we've modeled the midpoint of our Q2 constant currency ARR guidance range. Because our ARR tends to see some seasonality, the most relevant compare is Q2 of 2022. The illustrative model indicates, that to hit the midpoint of our Q2 2023 guidance range of $1.8 billion, we need ServiceMax ARR of approximately $160 million, which is what we said at Investor Day and believe is a reasonable target. On top of the ServiceMax contribution, we need to add $37 million of organic ARR on a sequential basis. This is $19 million less than the $56 million we added in Q2 of fiscal 2022. In percentage terms, we need 2% organic sequential ARR growth to hit our guidance midpoint for Q2, which is at the lower end of what we've delivered over the past nine quarters. All things considered, we believe we've set our Q2 2023 constant currency ARR guidance range prudently.  Turning to Slide 22. I'll conclude my prepared remarks today by highlighting, that we're prepared for a storm and expect to be resilient in the face of one. From a top line perspective, we serve industrial product companies. And R&D, at those companies tends to be quite resilient, so we have a supportive top line backdrop. We also have a subscription business model and our products are very sticky with our customers. Just as importantly from a cost perspective, we've already battened down the hatches. In addition, to the cost optimization work we did last year, we've already slowed planned hires and backfills as we head into Q2. Nevertheless, as we've said in the past, we don't have a Pollyanna-type view when it comes to the macro situation. We have a strong track record of disciplined operational management. And if the macro situation gets meaningfully worse, you can expect us to moderate our spending further, to better align spending with market realities and mitigate the impact on our fiscal 2023 cash flow results. For example, variable compensation would automatically adjust. And depending on the magnitude of the downturn, we would also be incrementally more cautious on hiring and marketing spend travel, et cetera. On the other hand, if the macro situation improves and/or if the dollar weakness continues, this would be favorable for our cash generation. And in that scenario, we would have the optionality to invest more aggressively in our business. There's no question that the macro environment is hard to predict. Nevertheless, we've contemplated one strong quarter of fiscal 2023 -- completed one strong quarter of fiscal 2023 and are positioned to continue producing attractive financial results, based on our strong product and market position coupled with solid execution and prudent financial management. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator to begin Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nMatt Hedberg: Great, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the strong results guys. Jim, you guys are pushing the envelope for SaaS beyond many peers that we talk to which is obviously, great. I guess a two-point question, do you think that's resulted in sort of a larger pipeline coverage ratio than maybe a year ago? And with your Plus strategy, do you think the opportunity for PLM and CAD replacements could accelerate as well?\nJim Heppelmann: Yes. Well, let's say, certainly the Plus strategy and SaaS here at PTC is helpful to the pipeline, because first of all when deals come in at SaaS, they come in twice the size as they would have been had they've been on-premise, so right away you have a factor there. But I'd also say, the interest level is quite high. I mean, I think if you come to LiveWorx, you're going to see lots of customers are going to come, just to learn about SaaS because they're interested. We're at that phase where everybody is interested. Some people will bite sooner than others, but everybody wants to hear about it, start thinking about it and understand how it plays into their future. Then on the competitive replacement opportunity, I do think that some of our competitors are laggards with SaaS or they're doing SaaS in a pretty hokey way. For example, we have a French competitor, who is trying to become a hyperscaler. And when you place an order with them they turn around by hardware to host it on. And between you and me I don't really think that's the right strategy. And I think a lot of companies are going to say, \"I don't actually want to buy into a strategy like that because the day it all collapses I'm a little bit out in the cold.\" So I do think that people are going to say, \"We need to go to SaaS. If my vendor doesn't have a good story, I should shop around.\" And at PTC, we have mature proven products like Creo and Windchill, that will be available in an honest-to-god true SaaS form not unlike for example Microsoft Office 365. And then on the other hand, if you want to go full bore, clean slate, right from the start pure SaaS, well we have Onshape and Arena, which are the SaaS-est products in our entire industry. So I do think we're going to get some amount of people moving to SaaS and switching vendors at the same time. And as you said, we're way out there ahead of people with a pretty serious well-thought-out strategy.\nMatt Hedberg: Thanks, Jim. Congrats.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Broome from Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.\nMatt Broome: Thanks very much. Hi, Jim and Kristian.\nJim Heppelmann: Hi, Matt.\nMatt Broome: I guess firstly just how is ThingWorx growth during the quarter? Has it been impacted at all by the reallocation of resources there?\nJim Heppelmann: ThingWorx growth was pretty steady. No doubt that reallocation of resources isn't actually helpful to just standalone ThingWorx growth, but I think it's actually been quite helpful to PTC growth and very, very helpful to PTC cash flow, because instead of hiring new resources that would consume cash flow, we moved resources around and let that fall to the bottom line. So I think probably not helpful to ThingWorx, although ThingWorx is clipping along at a decent growth rate but very helpful to PTC altogether kind of neutral to growth altogether very helpful to cash flow.\nMatt Broome: Okay. Great. And if I could just also ask channel continues to lag direct AR growth on a constant currency basis, can you talk about why growth is a little bit slower in the channel I guess with your partners? And what might be done to sort of bring that more into line with your direct business?\nJim Heppelmann: Well, I think they simply are more impacted by the macro situation. When the economy was strong our channel was growing faster than direct. And I think small companies have less room if you will less capacity to weather a downturn, so they're more conservative. So I think in a downturn situation, small and medium businesses, which is what our channel cover they're the first ones to start getting conservative on spending. And I mean we've seen that. I think for example, a lot of the start-up companies aren't hiring. And if they're not hiring they don't need expansions and so forth. So I would attribute that the channel is relatively more macro sensitive than the direct sales force. Now on the rebound it goes the other way of course.\nMatt Broome: Right. Makes sense. Okay. Thanks, again and congrats on the results.\nJim Heppelmann: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke from Citi. Your line is open.\nJim Heppelmann: Hey, Tyler.\nTyler Radke: Hey, hey, good evening, Jim. Good evening, Kristian. So a question just on the bookings commentary. So I think last quarter your base case was for flattish year-over-year bookings for the full year to kind of get to that 12% ARR growth obviously, pre-ServiceMax. When you say you saw bookings weaken, did bookings go negative during the quarter? And where is kind of your underlying assumption for the full year on bookings?\nJim Heppelmann: Yes, Tyler, so we thought a lot about how to describe this. And what we really owe you is transparency to how bookings and macro affect ARR because ARR is the key metric. And we're in this funny situation, where what happened in the quarter didn't align to any of our scenarios because bookings was a little softer and churn frankly was shockingly good. So what we decided is if we really want to tell you what exactly happened to bookings we're going to tell you exactly what happened to churn and we probably ought to tell you what happened to deferred and then maybe we ought to get into year-over-year comps because as you know bookings is where the volatility is. So we decided, we'll disclose it, we'll quantify it, as 0.5 percentage point of slowdown. So 0.5 percentage point you can do the math it's about $8 million on $1.603 billion. So we had $8 million less in bookings than what it took to maintain a 16% growth rate, but $3 million more in bookings than what it took to hit the high end of the guidance range we gave you. So, I think if you look at it that way, in the year now we've lost $8 million and that will show up four quarters. And it won't compound but the $8 million will show up in the next four quarters. I think as we look forward the pipeline looks pretty decent. The forecast looks good. The real question will be, post rates, does the business come in or not. And that's sort of an unknown. But to us, Q1 while it was a little bit softer than the previous two quarters, actually it was not a bad quarter.\nTyler Radke: That's super clear. Thank you. And just a follow-up, so going back to one of the questions on the competition, maybe broader than just what you're seeing as it relates to SaaS. Can you just talk about maybe the strength you're seeing in PLM more broadly? And obviously the growth rates you're posting on an organic basis are kind of above market. Who do you see you're taking share from and anything from a product perspective you'd highlight?\nJim Heppelmann: Yes. I mean nothing changed materially in the quarter. But to kind of remind you, just in general what's happening. SAP has given up share, Oracle has given up share. In our view, Dassault has given up quite a bit of share, because we passed them in the last year and we're opening up quite a gap now. And we think Siemens has given up some share. Siemens has been posting actually negative numbers in terms of PLM growth of late, and it will be interesting to see at the next earnings report. I encourage you all to dig in and try to parse it apart, because I think Siemens is losing a lot of momentum. They have some structural changes happening, so it's a little hard to kind of tease it all out and they don't provide much disclosure. But I think you\u2019re going to see -- Siemens would be our toughest competitor and you're going to see us post growth rates approaching 20% and it wouldn't surprise me if theirs has a negative number on the front of it when they report this quarter.\nTyler Radke: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJim Heppelmann: Hi, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Sorry, I'm kind of new to covering you guys and so the math maybe is a little bit tricky. But like you said last quarter that I think it was a low-single-digit constant currency bookings growth year-over-year. I'm kind of having trouble putting what you just said kind of altogether. What does that actually mean on a year-over-year constant currency bookings growth rate for this quarter?\nJim Heppelmann: Yes. Steve, I mean we don't disclose. We don't report bookings. We don't guide bookings. We provide color. And because, again, the scenario was a little strange compared to the guidance scenarios, softer on bookings, stronger on free cash flow to avoid having to disclose a lot more detail, we netted it out and netted it out as better than guidance but a slowdown of about $8 million for the year 0.5 percentage point.\nSteve Tusa: Yes. Okay, got it. That's helpful. And then just lastly on free cash flow, pretty strong even seasonally even how you talk about it with a decent amount coming here in the first half of the year assuming you hit the $200 million. Receivables were a big positive at least on a GAAP basis. Anything else moving around in working capital that kind of overdrove at all or is this kind of bang in line with what you guys were expecting?\nKristian Talvitie: In general, I think it was largely in line with what we were expecting Steve. I mean again solid collections performance.\nSteve Tusa: Yeah. Okay.\nJim Heppelmann: Yes, it\u2019s little bit Steve, like with the ARR situation where our guidance contains a little bit of a buffer and we didn't need it.\nSteve Tusa: Yes. Congrats on the good result. Thanks.\nJim Heppelmann: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays. Your line is open.\nJim Heppelmann: Hello, Saket.\nSaket Kalia: Hey, Jim. Hey, Kristian. Thanks for taking my question here. Jim, maybe just -- I'd love to dig one level deeper just into sort of that dichotomy, right, the softer bookings but then also the lower churn. Maybe just on the softer bookings piece, are those deals that are pushing? Are those deals that are still in the pipeline, or are they ones that you think just get pushed indefinitely? And then on the lower churn piece, that is great to hear, particularly with the hiring environment how much is maybe some of the price adjustments that we did last year maybe factoring into that as well?\nJim Heppelmann: Yes. Well, let me address the churn piece first and I'll circle back to the push or cancellation on bookings. On churn, you remember that we gave you scenarios that had churn getting worse, when we were clear, we have no evidence that that is happening or will happen, it just seems prudent to allow for the possibility. So, we're allowing for a possibility that would require a reversal in trend, but we did not get the reversal in trend. We got actually more of the same improving trend. And I think we were clear that certainly pricing helps, but it doesn't really account for the strength we're seeing. I mean the strength we're seeing is fundamentally just good renewals. And to put it in perspective, Creo and Windchill, represent roughly 70% of our ARR just those two products. And if you took the churn rate for Creo and Windchill in the quarter and you annualized it for the entire year, it would be less than 3% churn on those two massive product bases. So I mean, we're talking about fundamentally strong adoption of our technology, mission-critical technology. You can't switch from it. You can't stop using it. You can't stop paying for it, I mean unless you're winding your business down. So, I think it's just good fundamental sticky software that people are continuing to use. And I think there's not really a lot of layoffs happening in our marketplace right now our customers. A lot of layoffs happening in tech, but I don't think so many engineers in the world of product development for physical products are getting laid off. And then coming back to the push and cancel, I mean, I think it's mostly push. What happens is typically you've got a purchase order and it needs some level of approval. Maybe last quarter, it needed a higher level of approval, another signature maybe somebody sat on that signature because they're saying, couldn't we do this next quarter? Couldn't we start this project a little later? So I think it's pushing. There's no competitive dynamics. And generally it's not being canceled, because companies do need this technology. They're just delaying a little bit. The second factor would be expansion, sometimes are driven by hiring. If a company is hiring a lot of engineers, well, now they need to go back and buy more CAD and PLM seats for those engineers. There probably is a slowdown in hiring, which is slowing down expansions, but nothing structural happening. It's just sort of the natural delays the cholesterol if you will that gets in the way of doing deals when people are getting nervous about the economy.\nSaket Kalia: Makes a lot of sense. Thanks, Jim.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. Your line is open.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Thank you. Good evening. Jim for you first, over the last couple of years at least to the active bases for both Creo and Windchill have seemingly grown at least a mid-single-digit rate, at least by our calculation, which corresponds to the share gain for each we've been able to document. How are you thinking about the active base growth from here for both those products? And perhaps more broadly, since we've gone through so many evolutions of both those markets over the last many years, what from here do you think are the critical functionalities within CAD and PLM to continue or sustain the growth in those businesses, maybe GD or something else that you care to mention? And then secondly, maybe for Kristian you've done well in terms of product releases, adhering to the road map, but you do have the smallest R&D budget in your peer group. So, how are you thinking about orchestrating or managing R&D productivity from here to keep executing on that road map in the context of containing your expenses?\nJim Heppelmann: Yes. Okay. You've got a couple of different questions for me there. Let me say, the wildcard Jay is what happens with the economy. There's nothing again structurally happening that would cause our share gain or our seat growth to differ from the trend as it has been other than just a macro slowdown. And in the past, like in 2020, when there was a macro slowdown then we had an acceleration on the back end of it. We had a tough quarter, I think it was Q3 right Kristian, yes, Q3 of 2020 and a monster quarter in Q4 and it was like a snapback to where we work. So, even if there's a slowdown, we might get that effect, but that's the wildcard. Otherwise nothing in the industry is happening that would in my view change the trend. In terms of some of the critical functionality, yes, generative design is important. The ANSYS simulation is important. But the thing I think is really carrying the day is this concept that our guys call model-based enterprise. And what that really means is, companies are trying to make 2D drawings go away. In the world of engineering, there has been forever a really messed up process, where engineers create 3D models to really conceptualize the parts and how they fit together and to simulate them with technologies like ANSYS and everything is done in 3D. And then the very last step is, they convert that all to 2D drawings. They dumb it down and leave a lot of information behind and the drawings get sent out to the supply chain and to the factory and everything else. And then, for example, at suppliers they get these drawings and they turn around and remodel them in 3D. And the factory gets the data and they might have to remodel, so they can generate tool paths off it and whatnot. So the industry has said for a long time, we shouldn't need drawings, but we need to figure out how to get different processes that aren't so dependent on them, because all the procurement processes, the supplier collaboration processes are based on drawings and red lines and so forth. So what's happening now is many, many companies are saying, okay, this is it. That drawing process has to go now. What we have to do is model it in 3D. It has to be 3D -- annotated 3D models go out to suppliers, annotated 3D models go down in the manufacturing process, annotated 3D models end up in the service process, there's not going to be any more drawings. Now that requires a lot more adoption of CAD, because suddenly now a lot more people need a CAD suite rather than an Acrobat viewer, PDF suite, if you will. We're not just talking about viewing a PDF file; we're now talking about interacting directly with the 3D data. So I think that's a driver for the whole industry, but I certainly can tell you here at PTC, it's a driver. Many more suites of CAD software are sold when a company decides to move away from drawings. And on their side, they can shut a whole department down. And it's a department that not only leaks value, it actually actively destroys it by dumbing data down that then has to be smartened back up by somebody else downstream. So I think that's a big factor this model-based enterprise stuff. That's the whole capability around annotated 3D models and whatnot and viewing technologies and markup and collaboration. But certainly, generative design and simulation, 3D printing, additive manufacturing, those are all quite interesting as well. Now, finally, on your last question about the smallest R&D budget. I'm an R&D guy, so I'm not going to lose and we have not been losing the product battle. We've actually been winning the product battle. And I think what it is, is just, R&D is not about body count, it's about strategy, it's about project selection, it's about execution. Some of our larger competitors spend a lot of time and energy developing nonsensical products; products that don't work; don't make any sense. Autodesk was famous for that for many years. But some of our French and German competitors, French in particular, they've developed a lot of 3D experience, blah, blah, blah, that these are products that actually mean anything to anybody, but there's engineers working on them. So, I think, at PTC, we're just much more serious, much more focused. We prioritize what we do. We execute it well. We don't get in too many rework loops. We're just very efficient. And I think that's the winning recipe. Throwing bodies at R&D is not a winning strategy. Executing a good strategy efficiently is what it takes to win and we're doing fine in the product front. You know this. Our products are very strong and, if anything, getting stronger despite the fact that we spend less in R&D. And then, finally, one last comment. It's not like we don't spend much on R&D. Creo has 500 engineers working on it. Windchill has 500 engineers working on it. If you have 1000 engineers on it you just have more people tripping all over each other. So I think also I don't want you to think we don't spend much. We're not quite as extravagant as other people, but we're executing very, very well within what is a substantial spend envelope.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Thank you very much, Jim.\nJim Heppelmann: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Adam Borg from Stifel. Your line is open.\nAdam Borg: Awesome. Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe just two quick ones. Just first, Jim, just on the incremental softness you noted on the macro, it doesn't sound like things gotten any softer in the month of January. And of course, January is a smaller month to begin with, but just any commentary there on how demand trends have started so far in the month of January. And maybe just as a follow-up on ServiceMax, obviously it seems really compelling, just curious now that the acquisition closed, how early customer feedback is from both customers and prospects? Thanks so much.\nJim Heppelmann: Yeah. So on the first question, how's Q2 looking, at the start of the quarter here, we're more or less still at the start of the quarter because if you look at our quarter, a majority of our business is done in the third month of the quarter. So it's very difficult in the first month to really understand how things are trending. I mean we're starting the quarter with a decent pipeline. We're starting the quarter with a decent forecast. The real question will be in the last week or two of the quarter, are we able to close these deals or do they slide. If they slide, bookings will be soft again. If they close, actually we'll have a pretty stellar bookings quarter based on how things are forecasted at the moment or maybe we'll end up somewhere in between. What was the second question? Sorry, I didn't write it down.\nAdam Borg: No worries, just on ServiceMax.\nJim Heppelmann: ServiceMax, yes. So ServiceMax, I mean you see I'm very excited about it. You can probably sense that through the call here. That's because customers are very excited about it. I mean, we had a thesis of what this was going to mean. We've gotten into it. We found how many customers had independently purchased software from both of us, but also how many customers ServiceMax has that looked like PTC customers and how many customers PTC have that look like they should be ServiceMax customers. And a lot of common customers immediately contacted me, immediately contacted Neil and said \"Hey can we get together? Can you fly out and see us? Can we come visit you? We want to hear this story.\" To be honest, we're pushing back a little bit on them saying \"Could you just give us a little bit of time to figure out the details?\" So we're really targeting that for LiveWorx. I mean obviously, we'll talk to a lot of customers before LiveWorx, but that will be kind of the grand unveiling of that sort of infinity concept that I had on that slide. And I think it will be very exciting. I think there'll be many, many excited customers.\nMatt Shimao: Rob, we have time for one final question today.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Celino from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJason Celino: Hey, Jim, hey, Kristian. Thanks for fitting me in. Maybe just a quick one. We've been hearing different customers and organizations trying to use PLM more within their organizations. When we think about the expansion, is it expanding to different departments and teams, or is it product development, just becoming a more critical role within an organization? I guess, how would you kind of quantify this secular dynamic?\nJim Heppelmann: Yeah. I think maybe a couple of thoughts. One thing I said Jason is that PLM is moving from a nice-to-have to a must-have, and for example, this concept I was talking about earlier model-based enterprise where you're going to interact with 3D models. And 3D models are too big to e-mail around. By the way, when you're interacting with a 3D design, it's not one file, it can be dozens, hundreds or thousands of files and you need a system to find them all and fit them together and present it to you so that you can understand what's going on. So, I think what's happening this is all forms of digital transformation is that companies are saying, we're going to get rid of paper drawings and PDF files. We're going to go to 3D. Therefore everybody in the company who interacts with product data is going to need a PLM seat and they're going to need some type of a 3D seat. It might be a Viewer, it might be CAD, whatever. But it's driving proliferation of PLM out from the engineering department, where it's always been into purchasing into manufacturing now into the service technicians. We pretty quickly envision service technicians out in the field on their phone interacting with 3D models when they're standing in front of a piece of equipment if not augmenting it right onto the piece of equipment. So, I think that's what's happening is it's becoming a true enterprise system versus a departmental system, while at the same time it's becoming a must-have rather than a nice-to-have. I think it's those trends that are really driving this proliferation of PLM, which frankly is good for the whole industry, but I think PTC is taking share in the industry at the same time.\nJason Celino: Okay. Great. I guess we'll look forward to more at LiveWorx. Thanks.\nJim Heppelmann: Great. Okay. So, let me just wrap up here. Thank you all for spending time with us. In the next quarter, we have quite a busy investor schedule. So, I just want to share with you some of the things happening in case you want to participate. So, Kristian and I together are going tomorrow and Friday, we\u2019re going to -- tomorrow at dinner and Friday in the morning we're going to participate in an RBC roadshow in New York. Then on February 27th, we're hosting a headquarters visit that JPMorgan is conducting here in Boston. On March 8th, we're both going to the Morgan Stanley TMT Conference in San Francisco. Meanwhile on my own behalf, I'm going to the Wolfe Conference in New York on February 28th. Kristian additionally is going to the Baird Conference in Utah on March 2nd; to the JPMorgan Global High Yield Conference in Miami on March 6th. And Kristian's going on a Barclays Virtual Bus Tour or probably hosting a Barclays Virtual Bus Tour on March 15th. And then one of our executives Kevin Wrenn, who's our Chief Product Officer is doing the Loop Virtual Conference on March 13th. So, lots of IR touch points here in the coming quarter. Hope to see many of you in the course of one or more of those events. And if not hope to catch you again in about 90 days on our Q2 earnings call. So, thanks again and have a good evening everybody.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kristian Talvitie",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our results I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance and ARR references will be in both constant currency and as reported. Turning to slide 15. In Q1 2023 our constant currency ARR was $1.6 billion, up 15% year-over-year and exceeded guidance. On an organic constant currency basis excluding Codebeamer, our ARR was $1.59 billion, up 14% year-over-year. As Jim explained our top line strength in Q1 was broad-based. We're executing well against our strategy and we're continuing to improve upon the strong market position that we have. Our SaaS businesses saw continued solid ARR growth in Q1 as well. On an as-reported basis we delivered 11% ARR growth, 10% organic due to the impact of FX headwinds. Currency fluctuations were positive in Q1 of 2023 and our as reported ARR was $60 million higher than our constant currency ARR. However, on a year-over-year basis currency fluctuations were still a meaningful headwind. Moving on to cash flow. Our results were strong with Q1 coming in ahead of our guidance across all metrics. While it was great to see favorable FX movements during Q1, there was no impact to free cash flow from FX. Our free cash flow performance in Q1 was driven by strong execution based on a foundation of solid collections and cost discipline. Our cash from operations also came in ahead of guidance by $11 million, due to a combination of free cash flow outperformance and the timing of capital expenditures which were $9 million in Q1, compared to our guidance of $5 million. When assessing and forecasting our cash flow, it's important to remember a few things. The majority of our collections occur in the first half of our fiscal year. Q4 is our lowest cash flow generation quarter. And on an annual basis, free cash flow is primarily a function of ARR, rather than revenue. Q1 revenue of $466 million increased 2% year-over-year and was up 9% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. In Q1 recurring revenue grew by $12 million, perpetual license revenue grew by $5 million and professional services revenue declined by $9 million year-over-year. The decline in professional services revenue is consistent with our strategy to transition some of our professional services talent and revenue to DxP our partner for Windchill+ lift-and-shift projects. As we've discussed previously, revenue is impacted by ASC 606, so we do not believe that revenue is the best indicator of our underlying business performance, but we'd rather guide you to ARR as the best metric to understand our top line performance and cash generation. Before I move on to the balance sheet, I'd like to provide some color on our non-GAAP operating margin, as I did last quarter. Compared to, Q1 2022 our non-GAAP operating margin expanded by approximately 100 basis points to 36% in Q1 of 2023. We continue to caution that because revenue is impacted by ASC 606 other derivative metrics such as gross margin, operating margin, operating profit and EPS are all impacted as well. Still, it's worth mentioning, that we're benefiting from the work that we've done to optimize our cost structure in fiscal 2022. On a year-over-year basis in Q1, we continue to grow our top line at a faster rate than our spending and delivered significantly higher ARR and free cash flow. Moving to slide 16, we ended the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $388 million. Our gross debt was $1.36 billion with an aggregate interest rate of 4.3%. Looking forward, in Q2, in conjunction with the ServiceMax acquisition, we took out a $500 million term loan and increased the size of our revolving credit facility from $1 billion to $1.25 billion. The net of new borrowings and debt pay down in Q2, should leave us with $1 billion in high-yield notes, the $500 million term loan and approximately $450 million drawn on the revolver at the end of the quarter. As a reminder, we also have a second payment for the ServiceMax transaction, due in October 2023 of $650 million. We intend to fund this with cash on hand and our revolving credit facility. This deferred payment is included in debt on our balance sheet and is factored into our debt-to-EBITDA ratio. We expect our debt-to-EBITDA ratio to be approximately 3.4 times, at the end of Q2. We should be around three times levered by Q4 and below three times throughout fiscal 2024 and into fiscal 2025, as we continue to pay down debt. To help you with your models, in fiscal 2023 as it relates to cash flow, we expect total cash interest payments of approximately $85 million. And as it relates to the P&L, we expect interest expense of approximately $125 million. Given the interest rate environment, we expect to prioritize paying down our debt in fiscal 2023 and 2024. We'll pause, our share repurchase program. And in fiscal 2023, we expect our diluted share count to increase by a little under, one million shares. We expect to have substantially reduced our debt by the end of fiscal 2024 and we'll then revisit the prioritization of debt paydown and share repurchases. Despite this interruption, our long-term goal assuming our debt-to-EBITDA ratio is below three times, remains to return approximately 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases, while also taking into consideration the interest rate environment and strategic opportunities. Next slide 17 shows our ARR by product group. In the constant currency section on the top half of the slide, we used FX rates as of September 30, 2022 to calculate ARR for all periods. You can see on the slide, how currency dynamics have resulted in differences between our constant currency ARR and as-reported ARR over the past five quarters. Exchange rates continued to move materially in Q1 2023 causing a difference between constant currency ARR results and our as-reported ARR results. Based on the exchange rates, at the end of Q1 2023, our as-reported ARR in Q2 of 2023 would be higher by approximately $62 million compared to the midpoint of our constant currency guidance and fiscal 2023 as-reported ARR would be higher by approximately $67 million compared to our constant currency guidance midpoint. We report both actual and constant currency results and FX fluctuations can obviously have a material impact on actuals. But remember that, we provide ARR guidance on a constant currency basis. If exchange rates fluctuate significantly between the end of Q1 and in the end of Q2 2023 the impact to our as-reported ARR would also change. We believe constant currency is the best way to evaluate the top line performance of our business, because it removes currency fluctuations from the analysis, positive or negative. Given the sharp moves that, we've seen recently, I thought it would be useful to provide an updated ARR sensitivity rule of thumb on slide 18. In addition to the US dollar, we transact in euro, yen and more than 10 other additional currencies. Using currency rates at the end of Q1, the impact of a $0.10 change in the euro-to-USD rate would be $39 million positive or negative, and the impact of a \u00a510 change in the USD-to-yen rate would be $9 million again positive or negative. And of course, the estimated dollar impact to ARR is dependent on the size of the ARR base. With that, I'll take you through our guidance on slide 19. For our ARR guidance amounts, we're using FX rates as of September 30, 2022. The previous guidance shown on this slide is from our November 2022 Investor Day presentation, and includes ServiceMax. For fiscal 2023, we expect constant currency ARR growth of 22% to 25%, which corresponds to a fiscal 2023 constant currency ARR guidance range of $1.91 billion to $1.96 billion. This narrowed range is based on two primary factors. First, we took up the bottom end of the 10% to 14% guidance range we provided on our Q4 earnings call, which excluded ServiceMax. While we saw some incremental macro-driven booking softness in our first quarter, this was partially offset by better-than-planned churn and our guidance contemplated the potential for a much bigger impact than what we saw, and we actually finished $3 million above the high end of our Q1 2023 ARR guidance range. So based on our strong Q1 results and forecast for the year, while still being mindful of the macro environment, we feel comfortable taking up the lower end of the range, which still allows for continued softening due to the macro environment. Secondly, the other update to guidance is adding approximately $170 million for ServiceMax compared to our Investor Day assumption, which was for approximately $175 million. There's a few reasons we're doing this, which include. First, ServiceMax' fiscal quarters ended one month later than ours. As we all know, the final month of a quarter in a software company is really when the magic happens. So, while I think that ultimately their results will align with PTC's quarter-end hockey stick, I also think it's prudent to assume it may take a few quarters to align selling and customer buying behavior. Second, as you know Salesforce.com is a go-to-market partner with ServiceMax for its Asset 360 product. Salesforce just announced a fairly sizable reduction in force. And while we do not know if or how this may impact ServiceMax business in the coming months, we feel it's a valid concern which we want to account for in our guidance. And third, frankly, the uncertainty of the macro environment applies to ServiceMax as well. So, it's primarily for these three reasons that we're derisking the ServiceMax guidance for fiscal 2023 and adding $170 million to our now updated 11% to 14% guidance range. With a strong Q1 behind us and given our pipeline and forecast and how we've set our guidance ranges, we believe we're well-positioned to achieve our fiscal 2023 ARR guidance. Note that we expect modestly more deferred ARR to become ARR in fiscal 2023 than in fiscal 2022. And our churn in Q1 was lower than planned. In dollar terms, churn was actually lower in Q1 2023 than it was in Q1 2022 and that's against a bigger base of ARR. For Q2, we're guiding constant currency ARR to be in the range of $1.79 billion to $1.81 billion. At the midpoint, this equates to 25% constant currency growth. I'll discuss our Q2 guidance in more detail on the next slide. On cash flows for fiscal 2023, we raised our guidance. We now expect cash from operations of approximately $595 million, up 37%; and free cash flow of approximately $575 million up approximately 38%. Compared to the guidance we provided a quarter ago, our updated $575 million target for free cash flow factors in our strong execution and results in Q1, $5 million from the ServiceMax acquisition which we already communicated at our Investor Day, as well as an increase from FX tailwinds for the remainder of the year. Assuming we hit our Q2 free cash flow target, we'll be at approximately 65% of our full year target similar in the past two years. Our CapEx assumption for fiscal 2023 is $20 million. Therefore relative to our free cash flow guidance of $575 million, we're guiding to cash from operations of $595 million. For Q2, we're guiding to free cash flow of approximately $200 million. We expect approximately $5 million of CapEx in Q2 and therefore, our cash from operations guidance is approximately $205 million. As you model the quarters of fiscal 2023, keep in mind, we expect the quarterly distribution of full year cash flow results to follow a similar pattern as in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 with over 60% of cash flow in the first half of the year and Q4 being our lowest cash flow generation quarter. Moving on to revenue guidance, we raised -- which we raised from our November 2nd guidance, primarily because of ServiceMax and currency. For fiscal 2023, we expect revenue of $2.07 billion to $2.15 billion which corresponds to a growth rate of 7% to 11%. ASC 606 makes revenue fairly difficult to predict in the short-term for on-premise subscription companies, hence the wide range. More importantly, revenue does not influence ARR or cash generation as we typically bill customers annually upfront regardless of term lengths. Turning to slide 20. Here is an illustrative constant currency ARR model for Q2 2023. You can see our results over the past nine quarters and in the far-right column, we've modeled the midpoint of our Q2 constant currency ARR guidance range. Because our ARR tends to see some seasonality, the most relevant compare is Q2 of 2022. The illustrative model indicates, that to hit the midpoint of our Q2 2023 guidance range of $1.8 billion, we need ServiceMax ARR of approximately $160 million, which is what we said at Investor Day and believe is a reasonable target. On top of the ServiceMax contribution, we need to add $37 million of organic ARR on a sequential basis. This is $19 million less than the $56 million we added in Q2 of fiscal 2022. In percentage terms, we need 2% organic sequential ARR growth to hit our guidance midpoint for Q2, which is at the lower end of what we've delivered over the past nine quarters. All things considered, we believe we've set our Q2 2023 constant currency ARR guidance range prudently.  Turning to Slide 22. I'll conclude my prepared remarks today by highlighting, that we're prepared for a storm and expect to be resilient in the face of one. From a top line perspective, we serve industrial product companies. And R&D, at those companies tends to be quite resilient, so we have a supportive top line backdrop. We also have a subscription business model and our products are very sticky with our customers. Just as importantly from a cost perspective, we've already battened down the hatches. In addition, to the cost optimization work we did last year, we've already slowed planned hires and backfills as we head into Q2. Nevertheless, as we've said in the past, we don't have a Pollyanna-type view when it comes to the macro situation. We have a strong track record of disciplined operational management. And if the macro situation gets meaningfully worse, you can expect us to moderate our spending further, to better align spending with market realities and mitigate the impact on our fiscal 2023 cash flow results. For example, variable compensation would automatically adjust. And depending on the magnitude of the downturn, we would also be incrementally more cautious on hiring and marketing spend travel, et cetera. On the other hand, if the macro situation improves and/or if the dollar weakness continues, this would be favorable for our cash generation. And in that scenario, we would have the optionality to invest more aggressively in our business. There's no question that the macro environment is hard to predict. Nevertheless, we've contemplated one strong quarter of fiscal 2023 -- completed one strong quarter of fiscal 2023 and are positioned to continue producing attractive financial results, based on our strong product and market position coupled with solid execution and prudent financial management. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator to begin Q&A. In general, I think it was largely in line with what we were expecting Steve. I mean again solid collections performance."

            "name": "Jim Heppelmann",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. Turning to slide 4. I'm pleased to report that despite seeing some incremental macro softness, PTC delivered a solid first quarter to kick off fiscal 2023. On the top-line metric of ARR we came in at $1.603 billion, which was above the high end of our range and up more than 15% year-over-year. The strength was broad-based across all product groups and geographies. Sorry about that, a little interference. The strength was broad-based across all product groups and geographies. Organic ARR growth was 14% with Codebeamer then contributing that extra point of inorganic growth. The strong Q1 ARR results put the company in a position to narrow our original 10% to 14% full year ARR guidance to 11% to 14% as we feel that the 10% outcome has become increasingly implausible with a solid Q1 behind us. Switching to our bottom-line metric of free cash flow we delivered $172 million ahead of our guidance and up 28% year-over-year. We raised our free cash flow guidance for the full year by $15 million. Currency had little impact to free cash flow in Q1, but it is expected to be incrementally helpful as the year progresses. On the subject of currency, I'll remind you that Kristian will cover the ongoing effects of foreign exchange fluctuations later in the call. So to simplify things I'll focus my discussion on constant currency results when discussing top-line metrics. Turning to slide 5. Shortly after our first quarter close we completed the acquisition of ServiceMax. ServiceMax is not included in the Q1 results we reported though we did incur some acquisition-related costs that we're a headwind to our nevertheless strong free cash flow results in Q1. With the deal now closed ServiceMax will be included in our guidance going forward. To recap the highlights of this business as now part of PTC, ServiceMax is used to manage the service processes for high-value long life cycle products. Think of products like an MRI machine in a hospital, a machine tool in a factory or pumping equipment at a refinery. This has always been a sweet spot for PTC and we have many customers matching this profile. Referring to the infinity diagram on slide 5, many of you know that PTC's logo represents the interplay of physical and digital and that logo provides a good way to explain the fit with ServiceMax. The digital part of our logo refers to when products are under development. At this point, they exist in a purely digital form which is authored in Creo and managed in Windchill. Being purely digital at this stage products are easy to change and highly configurable. Each time our customers get an order their factories take a configuration of the digital product data that matches the order and use it as the recipe to produce the physical product, which is then delivered to the end customer. That's where the physical part of our logo fits in. Physical products are very different. If you want to change them for example, you need to dispatch a truck to the customer site carrying a technician and spare parts. Spare parts are managed in our Servigistics software. The technician will need access to similar types of digital product information, as what the factory used when creating the product. This service information is created using Arbortext and Vuforia. High-value products are operated by the customer for years or even decades. These products require regular service to keep them up and running, and this service is typically provided by the manufacturer, who views the recurring service contracts and spare part sales as a highly desirable source of revenue and profit. ServiceMax helps the manufacturer manage their entire installed base of physical product instances and orchestrates all the necessary service activities. By monitoring the installed base of products, ThingWorx adds a lot of value to ServiceMax because it allows service to be more proactive and preventative in nature. And sometimes the service can even be done remotely thereby canceling the need for a truck roll. As you can see ServiceMax has great synergy with Creo and Windchill, because on one hand the service process consumes the digital product data created in engineering in the form of parts catalogs and service instructions. And on the other hand, the service process is the primary source of feedback that drives ongoing product improvements through engineering change orders or ECOs. Windchill serves as the system of record for the digital definition of all possible product configurations and ServiceMax serves as the system of record for the actual physical instances of products that exist, each of which may have a slightly different configuration. As the infinity diagram implies, there is a digital thread of product information flowing between these key systems in both directions throughout the product life cycle. Aligning ServiceMax with PTC's various offerings will lubricate this flow of data creating tremendous business value. No competitor has a solution comparable to this. Equally important, as the service system of record, ServiceMax knits together our existing SLM products, allowing PTC to now offer the industry's first truly comprehensive offering for service management optimization. You can think of our new SLM offering as a hub-and-spoke model with ServiceMax as the hub and PTC's various other service solutions as spokes. For example, ThingWorx IoT connects to and monitors the vital signs of installed products to enable preventative remote service. Arbortext dynamically publishes technical service information to match each product configuration in the installed base. Vuforia AR enables this technical service information to be augmented onto each installed product to make service technicians more productive. And Servigistics allows customer service level agreements to be met, while carrying the smallest possible inventory of spare parts. With the acquisition now closed work is underway to enable deeper integration between ServiceMax and these various PTC offering. I'm pleased to announce that Neil Barua the CEO of ServiceMax is joining PTC and will preside over this expanded SLM business that now exceeds $300 million of combined ARR. Neil and team will unveil a broad new SLM vision at our LiveWorx conference in May. And based on the number of inquiries we're getting, I expect it to be one of the highlights of the conference. The strategic fit with ServiceMax is excellent and we're excited about the synergies we can generate by cross-selling from engineering to service and vice versa and also cross-selling between our various SLM offerings within the service domain. The financial fit is excellent too as the transaction is expected to be accretive to PTC's growth rate as well as the PTC's cash flow and this drove part of today's guidance raises. ServiceMax also increases PTC's total addressable market. The ServiceMax business has been growing in the mid-teens which is a few points faster than the market, but we see potential for the business to accelerate to high-teens growth over time as synergistic cross-sell opportunities are realized. Turning to Slide 6. Given the elevated focus on profitability that investors all share in today's market, I want to reiterate the margin expansion program that PTC management has been driving. The organizational realignment we did at the end of fiscal 2021 and the resource rebalancing work we did during fiscal 2022 have created an organizational model for PTC that's both highly efficient and fully sustainable. When we made these changes, we were not addressing a problem per se, but simply pursuing margin expansion opportunities that we had identified. The actions we took proved prescient, as we're now well-positioned for a macro downturn. While many notable tech companies are announcing layoffs to come to terms of bloated cost structures, thanks to our proactive actions, we're entering this period of uncertainty with a very lean cost structure and we do not anticipate any need for layoffs or restructuring. In Q1, non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 36% compared to 35% a year ago. That sounds like progress, but due to ASC 606 noise, it doesn't fully capture the full magnitude of improvements we've made. We prefer to assess our margin progress by focusing on a more meaningful metric we now call operating efficiency. Operating efficiency is the same metric that we previously called cash contribution margin, but we're changing the name of the metric to be more precise that it is an operating metric, not a non-GAAP financial measure. This is a change in name only. The metric is still calculated the same way and still measures how much of our billings we're able to convert to cash flow each year. At the midpoint of our ARR guidance range, based on actions already taken, we continue to expect this operating efficiency to expand by another approximately 450 basis points in fiscal 2023, following the 300 basis point improvement we delivered last year. The significant operating efficiency improvement when layered on top of double-digit ARR growth is what drove the strong Q1 free cash flow result and is what will drive the 38% free cash flow growth we're guiding to for fiscal 2023. Kristian will elaborate further. Turning to slide seven. As you're aware, our FY 2023 ARR guidance range, has from the start, contemplated the possibility of a potential macro downturn. In Q1, we saw further signs of a downturn in the form of incrementally softer bookings. At the same time, we were comforted by strong renewals, which actually improved slightly year-over-year, reinforcing just how sticky our software is. The net impact of these softer bookings and stronger renewals was a slowdown of about 0.5 percentage point from last quarter's 16% ARR growth rate, taking the Q1 ARR growth rate down to about 15.5%. This was obviously less than we had allowed at the high end of our Q1 ARR guidance range, so ARR results landed $3 million above the range. The softness was relatively consistent across various dimensions of the business, suggesting it was macro related, rather than any type of competitive issue. The summary is that, after posting 15.5% growth in Q1, we remain well positioned to perform against our financial targets and indeed, have raised our guidance accordingly. Turning to slide eight. With Q1 behind us, as compared to our original guidance, we're now on track to deliver ARR growth results within a narrower 11% to 14% range in fiscal 2023, with the low end having been raised, because the 10% outcome is less plausible now, given that solid Q1. Keep in mind, the addition of ServiceMax to our portfolio happens here in Q2 and the inclusion of ServiceMax will recalibrate the ARR growth range upward. In a few minutes Kristian will outline a new guidance range, that's essentially 11% to 14% plus 1,100 basis points more from ServiceMax added on top. Across this range of ARR outcomes, we've also raised the original cash flow guidance we provided a quarter ago by $15 million to $575 million, which now represents 38% growth for the full year. The raise is powered in roughly equal parts: by a strong free cash flow result in Q1, the expected $5 million benefit from the ServiceMax acquisition and improving foreign exchange rates. Should exchange rates hold, or further improve, FX could prove incrementally helpful as the year progresses. Kristian will elaborate on the various factors involved here too. Turning to slide nine. Let's look at ARR growth across all geographies. ARR growth in the Americas was 16%. In Europe, ARR growth was 15%, despite the Russia exit in Q2 of last year which still affects the growth rate, given the trailing nature of our ARR metric. ARR growth in APAC was 12%. Across all geographies, the largest ARR growth in terms of magnitude was driven by continued strong demand for Creo CAD and Windchill PLM products. In the Americas, we saw the strongest ARR percentage growth in IoT, Arena, Windchill and Onshape. In Europe and APAC the growth rate was highest for Arena, which has been expanding outside the US. Arbortext and Servigistics both delivered strong growth rates in Europe and APAC. And finally in Europe, Onshape and augmented reality also delivered strong percentage growth. Next let's look at the ARR performance of our product groups on Slide 10. In CAD, which is those products that enable authoring of product data, we delivered 10% ARR growth in Q1 in a market that has been growing approximately 8%. Within this the growth was primarily driven by Creo, supplemented by strong percentage growth in Onshape and Arbortext. In PLM, which includes those products that enable data management and process orchestration for product development, our ARR growth rate in Q1 was 20%, or 18% organic with strong growth across all geographic regions. In PLM, we continue to significantly outperform the market, which has been growing approximately 12%. Half of our Q1 growth was driven by Windchill, but ALM including Codebeamer and Arena, IoT and retail PLM also contributed to great Q1 PLM results by delivering strong percentage growth. I'd like to discuss Windchill+ in the context of a new logo customer on Slide 11. Given the importance of our SaaS transformation program as a growth driver, I'm pleased to see good progress ramping up the new multi-tenant Windchill+ solution. While it's still early across a combination of new logo deals as well as lift-and-shift SaaS conversions, we now have about a dozen Windchill+ customers in production or headed there shortly with dozens more opportunities in the pipeline. As we said at our Investor Day, we expect an S-curve type of ramp over multiple years for our Plus offerings. And thus far we're tracking well to that expectation. To share a customer story, we landed a new logo deal with a well-known motor sports company. That's a great example of an organization that's reaping the benefits of the streamlined PLM implementation experience that Windchill+ offers. This customer has committed to enter a new racing circuit, but faces a tight time line to get prepared. Their team needed a PLM system to be in place quickly, because they're designing a more efficient power unit that needs to be completed and tested in short order. And then as usual there'll be a steady diet of changes and improvements thereafter. With their Windchill+ implementation the motor sports company achieved a production ramp-up time of several months, including integration with their hybrid SaaS ERP system. They got there so quickly by leveraging the out-of-the-box capability of Windchill+ delivered by PTC to the customer as a secure preconfigured service. This customer has no dedicated IT team, so leveraging SaaS applications is important to enable them to keep their internal efforts focused on racing, while improving collaboration across team members in the field and around the globe. As a reminder, Windchill+ is the tip of the iceberg of a bigger Plus strategy, and you'll see us follow with Creo+ and similar premium SaaS offerings in FY 2023 and beyond. We are aiming to launch Creo+ and the bigger Plus strategy at LiveWorx in May. I'd like to share another customer anecdote to help you better understand the immense power of our technology. Turning to Slide 12, I want to tell you about an important project from our customers at the U.S. Department of Energy. I trust you saw the mid-December news that for the first time scientists at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory have produced a nuclear fusion reaction that generated more energy than it consumed. This major scientific breakthrough happened at Lawrence Livermore's National Ignition Facility and may pave the way to a future filled with clean energy. The National Ignition Facility, or NIF is essentially a massive machine of enormous size and complexity. The NIF is a precision-engineered system of systems that generates and then directs 192 powerful laser beams onto a pencil eraser-sized area that heats to millions of degrees to ignite the nuclear fusion reaction. The sports stadium-sized NIF machine is all modeled in Creo and Windchill, everything they say except the walls and the bathrooms. With 3.5 million components, we believe the NIF is the largest Creo and Windchill assembly ever made and very likely, the largest assembly ever modeled in 3D CAD, which is a real testament to the power of our technology. During our regular collaborations with DOE teams over many years now, PTC product teams have been challenged to further develop our products to enable such highly advanced projects in what has proven to be a mutually beneficial relationship. While substantially more work lies ahead in the effort to harness the potential of fusion energy as demonstrated by the NIF, we're very proud of the role that our technology has played in enabling this early breakthrough. And the announcement was exciting for many PTC employees who have been involved including me. PTC may very well-prove to play a key enabling role in the ultimate ESG breakthrough. Summarizing then on slide 13. While in Q1, we saw incremental signs of a macro slowdown there's a lot going our way right now. First, PTC has established itself as the clear category leader in PLM, which has become a must-have technology backbone for digital transformation at industrial companies. We just posted another quarter of 18% organic PLM growth well-ahead of market peers. We are conquering the PLM market. The addition of ServiceMax further extends what was already a unique portfolio of interconnected digital thread capabilities across the full product life cycle and ServiceMax is expected to be a tailwind to ARR and free cash flow right from the start. Both Codebeamer and ServiceMax will provide a big boost to our PLM conquest efforts. Second, while the company growth is at a double-digit level already, we're in the early days but executing well against a major on-premise to SaaS transformation that should provide a multiyear growth tailwind. Third, we have a reputation for driving margin expansion that goes back more than a decade and the proactive changes we've already made are driving high levels of free cash flow growth again this year. Fourth, we're demonstrating that our business model is very resilient. Top line growth and bottom line profitability are at levels that are amongst the best in our industry peer group. Not many peer companies are projecting the double-digit organic top line and 38% bottom line growth that PTC is guiding to this year. And finally, we're led by a team that has deep expertise and proven ability to drive growth and margin expansion. We're happy to welcome Neil Barua to the PTC executive ranks because Neil and the entire ServiceMax team share the same depth and passion for the business that's so important here in the PTC culture. With so many positive trends going our way, I continue to believe PTC has a tremendous opportunity to create shareholder value even in the face of a macro downturn we've all been expecting. With that, I'll turn it over to Kristian for his more detailed commentary on financial results and guidance. Yes. Well, let's say, certainly the Plus strategy and SaaS here at PTC is helpful to the pipeline, because first of all when deals come in at SaaS, they come in twice the size as they would have been had they've been on-premise, so right away you have a factor there. But I'd also say, the interest level is quite high. I mean, I think if you come to LiveWorx, you're going to see lots of customers are going to come, just to learn about SaaS because they're interested. We're at that phase where everybody is interested. Some people will bite sooner than others, but everybody wants to hear about it, start thinking about it and understand how it plays into their future. Then on the competitive replacement opportunity, I do think that some of our competitors are laggards with SaaS or they're doing SaaS in a pretty hokey way. For example, we have a French competitor, who is trying to become a hyperscaler. And when you place an order with them they turn around by hardware to host it on. And between you and me I don't really think that's the right strategy. And I think a lot of companies are going to say, \"I don't actually want to buy into a strategy like that because the day it all collapses I'm a little bit out in the cold.\" So I do think that people are going to say, \"We need to go to SaaS. If my vendor doesn't have a good story, I should shop around.\" And at PTC, we have mature proven products like Creo and Windchill, that will be available in an honest-to-god true SaaS form not unlike for example Microsoft Office 365. And then on the other hand, if you want to go full bore, clean slate, right from the start pure SaaS, well we have Onshape and Arena, which are the SaaS-est products in our entire industry. So I do think we're going to get some amount of people moving to SaaS and switching vendors at the same time. And as you said, we're way out there ahead of people with a pretty serious well-thought-out strategy. Hi, Matt. ThingWorx growth was pretty steady. No doubt that reallocation of resources isn't actually helpful to just standalone ThingWorx growth, but I think it's actually been quite helpful to PTC growth and very, very helpful to PTC cash flow, because instead of hiring new resources that would consume cash flow, we moved resources around and let that fall to the bottom line. So I think probably not helpful to ThingWorx, although ThingWorx is clipping along at a decent growth rate but very helpful to PTC altogether kind of neutral to growth altogether very helpful to cash flow. Well, I think they simply are more impacted by the macro situation. When the economy was strong our channel was growing faster than direct. And I think small companies have less room if you will less capacity to weather a downturn, so they're more conservative. So I think in a downturn situation, small and medium businesses, which is what our channel cover they're the first ones to start getting conservative on spending. And I mean we've seen that. I think for example, a lot of the start-up companies aren't hiring. And if they're not hiring they don't need expansions and so forth. So I would attribute that the channel is relatively more macro sensitive than the direct sales force. Now on the rebound it goes the other way of course. Thank you. Hey, Tyler. Yes, Tyler, so we thought a lot about how to describe this. And what we really owe you is transparency to how bookings and macro affect ARR because ARR is the key metric. And we're in this funny situation, where what happened in the quarter didn't align to any of our scenarios because bookings was a little softer and churn frankly was shockingly good. So what we decided is if we really want to tell you what exactly happened to bookings we're going to tell you exactly what happened to churn and we probably ought to tell you what happened to deferred and then maybe we ought to get into year-over-year comps because as you know bookings is where the volatility is. So we decided, we'll disclose it, we'll quantify it, as 0.5 percentage point of slowdown. So 0.5 percentage point you can do the math it's about $8 million on $1.603 billion. So we had $8 million less in bookings than what it took to maintain a 16% growth rate, but $3 million more in bookings than what it took to hit the high end of the guidance range we gave you. So, I think if you look at it that way, in the year now we've lost $8 million and that will show up four quarters. And it won't compound but the $8 million will show up in the next four quarters. I think as we look forward the pipeline looks pretty decent. The forecast looks good. The real question will be, post rates, does the business come in or not. And that's sort of an unknown. But to us, Q1 while it was a little bit softer than the previous two quarters, actually it was not a bad quarter. Yes. I mean nothing changed materially in the quarter. But to kind of remind you, just in general what's happening. SAP has given up share, Oracle has given up share. In our view, Dassault has given up quite a bit of share, because we passed them in the last year and we're opening up quite a gap now. And we think Siemens has given up some share. Siemens has been posting actually negative numbers in terms of PLM growth of late, and it will be interesting to see at the next earnings report. I encourage you all to dig in and try to parse it apart, because I think Siemens is losing a lot of momentum. They have some structural changes happening, so it's a little hard to kind of tease it all out and they don't provide much disclosure. But I think you're going to see -- Siemens would be our toughest competitor and you're going to see us post growth rates approaching 20% and it wouldn't surprise me if theirs has a negative number on the front of it when they report this quarter. Hi, Steve. Yes. Steve, I mean we don't disclose. We don't report bookings. We don't guide bookings. We provide color. And because, again, the scenario was a little strange compared to the guidance scenarios, softer on bookings, stronger on free cash flow to avoid having to disclose a lot more detail, we netted it out and netted it out as better than guidance but a slowdown of about $8 million for the year 0.5 percentage point. Yes, it's little bit Steve, like with the ARR situation where our guidance contains a little bit of a buffer and we didn't need it. Great. Thank you. Hello, Saket. Yes. Well, let me address the churn piece first and I'll circle back to the push or cancellation on bookings. On churn, you remember that we gave you scenarios that had churn getting worse, when we were clear, we have no evidence that that is happening or will happen, it just seems prudent to allow for the possibility. So, we're allowing for a possibility that would require a reversal in trend, but we did not get the reversal in trend. We got actually more of the same improving trend. And I think we were clear that certainly pricing helps, but it doesn't really account for the strength we're seeing. I mean the strength we're seeing is fundamentally just good renewals. And to put it in perspective, Creo and Windchill, represent roughly 70% of our ARR just those two products. And if you took the churn rate for Creo and Windchill in the quarter and you annualized it for the entire year, it would be less than 3% churn on those two massive product bases. So I mean, we're talking about fundamentally strong adoption of our technology, mission-critical technology. You can't switch from it. You can't stop using it. You can't stop paying for it, I mean unless you're winding your business down. So, I think it's just good fundamental sticky software that people are continuing to use. And I think there's not really a lot of layoffs happening in our marketplace right now our customers. A lot of layoffs happening in tech, but I don't think so many engineers in the world of product development for physical products are getting laid off. And then coming back to the push and cancel, I mean, I think it's mostly push. What happens is typically you've got a purchase order and it needs some level of approval. Maybe last quarter, it needed a higher level of approval, another signature maybe somebody sat on that signature because they're saying, couldn't we do this next quarter? Couldn't we start this project a little later? So I think it's pushing. There's no competitive dynamics. And generally it's not being canceled, because companies do need this technology. They're just delaying a little bit. The second factor would be expansion, sometimes are driven by hiring. If a company is hiring a lot of engineers, well, now they need to go back and buy more CAD and PLM seats for those engineers. There probably is a slowdown in hiring, which is slowing down expansions, but nothing structural happening. It's just sort of the natural delays the cholesterol if you will that gets in the way of doing deals when people are getting nervous about the economy. Yes. Okay. You've got a couple of different questions for me there. Let me say, the wildcard Jay is what happens with the economy. There's nothing again structurally happening that would cause our share gain or our seat growth to differ from the trend as it has been other than just a macro slowdown. And in the past, like in 2020, when there was a macro slowdown then we had an acceleration on the back end of it. We had a tough quarter, I think it was Q3 right Kristian, yes, Q3 of 2020 and a monster quarter in Q4 and it was like a snapback to where we work. So, even if there's a slowdown, we might get that effect, but that's the wildcard. Otherwise nothing in the industry is happening that would in my view change the trend. In terms of some of the critical functionality, yes, generative design is important. The ANSYS simulation is important. But the thing I think is really carrying the day is this concept that our guys call model-based enterprise. And what that really means is, companies are trying to make 2D drawings go away. In the world of engineering, there has been forever a really messed up process, where engineers create 3D models to really conceptualize the parts and how they fit together and to simulate them with technologies like ANSYS and everything is done in 3D. And then the very last step is, they convert that all to 2D drawings. They dumb it down and leave a lot of information behind and the drawings get sent out to the supply chain and to the factory and everything else. And then, for example, at suppliers they get these drawings and they turn around and remodel them in 3D. And the factory gets the data and they might have to remodel, so they can generate tool paths off it and whatnot. So the industry has said for a long time, we shouldn't need drawings, but we need to figure out how to get different processes that aren't so dependent on them, because all the procurement processes, the supplier collaboration processes are based on drawings and red lines and so forth. So what's happening now is many, many companies are saying, okay, this is it. That drawing process has to go now. What we have to do is model it in 3D. It has to be 3D -- annotated 3D models go out to suppliers, annotated 3D models go down in the manufacturing process, annotated 3D models end up in the service process, there's not going to be any more drawings. Now that requires a lot more adoption of CAD, because suddenly now a lot more people need a CAD suite rather than an Acrobat viewer, PDF suite, if you will. We're not just talking about viewing a PDF file; we're now talking about interacting directly with the 3D data. So I think that's a driver for the whole industry, but I certainly can tell you here at PTC, it's a driver. Many more suites of CAD software are sold when a company decides to move away from drawings. And on their side, they can shut a whole department down. And it's a department that not only leaks value, it actually actively destroys it by dumbing data down that then has to be smartened back up by somebody else downstream. So I think that's a big factor this model-based enterprise stuff. That's the whole capability around annotated 3D models and whatnot and viewing technologies and markup and collaboration. But certainly, generative design and simulation, 3D printing, additive manufacturing, those are all quite interesting as well. Now, finally, on your last question about the smallest R&D budget. I'm an R&D guy, so I'm not going to lose and we have not been losing the product battle. We've actually been winning the product battle. And I think what it is, is just, R&D is not about body count, it's about strategy, it's about project selection, it's about execution. Some of our larger competitors spend a lot of time and energy developing nonsensical products; products that don't work; don't make any sense. Autodesk was famous for that for many years. But some of our French and German competitors, French in particular, they've developed a lot of 3D experience, blah, blah, blah, that these are products that actually mean anything to anybody, but there's engineers working on them. So, I think, at PTC, we're just much more serious, much more focused. We prioritize what we do. We execute it well. We don't get in too many rework loops. We're just very efficient. And I think that's the winning recipe. Throwing bodies at R&D is not a winning strategy. Executing a good strategy efficiently is what it takes to win and we're doing fine in the product front. You know this. Our products are very strong and, if anything, getting stronger despite the fact that we spend less in R&D. And then, finally, one last comment. It's not like we don't spend much on R&D. Creo has 500 engineers working on it. Windchill has 500 engineers working on it. If you have 1000 engineers on it you just have more people tripping all over each other. So I think also I don't want you to think we don't spend much. We're not quite as extravagant as other people, but we're executing very, very well within what is a substantial spend envelope. Thanks. Yeah. So on the first question, how's Q2 looking, at the start of the quarter here, we're more or less still at the start of the quarter because if you look at our quarter, a majority of our business is done in the third month of the quarter. So it's very difficult in the first month to really understand how things are trending. I mean we're starting the quarter with a decent pipeline. We're starting the quarter with a decent forecast. The real question will be in the last week or two of the quarter, are we able to close these deals or do they slide. If they slide, bookings will be soft again. If they close, actually we'll have a pretty stellar bookings quarter based on how things are forecasted at the moment or maybe we'll end up somewhere in between. What was the second question? Sorry, I didn't write it down. ServiceMax, yes. So ServiceMax, I mean you see I'm very excited about it. You can probably sense that through the call here. That's because customers are very excited about it. I mean, we had a thesis of what this was going to mean. We've gotten into it. We found how many customers had independently purchased software from both of us, but also how many customers ServiceMax has that looked like PTC customers and how many customers PTC have that look like they should be ServiceMax customers. And a lot of common customers immediately contacted me, immediately contacted Neil and said \"Hey can we get together? Can you fly out and see us? Can we come visit you? We want to hear this story.\" To be honest, we're pushing back a little bit on them saying \"Could you just give us a little bit of time to figure out the details?\" So we're really targeting that for LiveWorx. I mean obviously, we'll talk to a lot of customers before LiveWorx, but that will be kind of the grand unveiling of that sort of infinity concept that I had on that slide. And I think it will be very exciting. I think there'll be many, many excited customers. Yeah. I think maybe a couple of thoughts. One thing I said Jason is that PLM is moving from a nice-to-have to a must-have, and for example, this concept I was talking about earlier model-based enterprise where you're going to interact with 3D models. And 3D models are too big to e-mail around. By the way, when you're interacting with a 3D design, it's not one file, it can be dozens, hundreds or thousands of files and you need a system to find them all and fit them together and present it to you so that you can understand what's going on. So, I think what's happening this is all forms of digital transformation is that companies are saying, we're going to get rid of paper drawings and PDF files. We're going to go to 3D. Therefore everybody in the company who interacts with product data is going to need a PLM seat and they're going to need some type of a 3D seat. It might be a Viewer, it might be CAD, whatever. But it's driving proliferation of PLM out from the engineering department, where it's always been into purchasing into manufacturing now into the service technicians. We pretty quickly envision service technicians out in the field on their phone interacting with 3D models when they're standing in front of a piece of equipment if not augmenting it right onto the piece of equipment. So, I think that's what's happening is it's becoming a true enterprise system versus a departmental system, while at the same time it's becoming a must-have rather than a nice-to-have. I think it's those trends that are really driving this proliferation of PLM, which frankly is good for the whole industry, but I think PTC is taking share in the industry at the same time. Great. Okay. So, let me just wrap up here. Thank you all for spending time with us. In the next quarter, we have quite a busy investor schedule. So, I just want to share with you some of the things happening in case you want to participate. So, Kristian and I together are going tomorrow and Friday, we're going to -- tomorrow at dinner and Friday in the morning we're going to participate in an RBC roadshow in New York. Then on February 27th, we're hosting a headquarters visit that JPMorgan is conducting here in Boston. On March 8th, we're both going to the Morgan Stanley TMT Conference in San Francisco. Meanwhile on my own behalf, I'm going to the Wolfe Conference in New York on February 28th. Kristian additionally is going to the Baird Conference in Utah on March 2nd; to the JPMorgan Global High Yield Conference in Miami on March 6th. And Kristian's going on a Barclays Virtual Bus Tour or probably hosting a Barclays Virtual Bus Tour on March 15th. And then one of our executives Kevin Wrenn, who's our Chief Product Officer is doing the Loop Virtual Conference on March 13th. So, lots of IR touch points here in the coming quarter. Hope to see many of you in the course of one or more of those events. And if not hope to catch you again in about 90 days on our Q2 earnings call. So, thanks again and have a good evening everybody."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by, and welcome to today's PTC 2024 Fourth Quarter Conference Call. During this presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be opened for open questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Shimao, PTC's Head of Investor Relations. Matt, please go ahead.\nMatt Shimao: Good afternoon. Thank you, Aaron, and welcome to PTC's fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2024 conference call. On the call today are Neil Barua, Chief Executive Officer; and Kristian Talvitie, Chief Financial Officer. Today's conference call is being broadcast live through an audio webcast, and a replay of the call will be available later today at www.ptc.com. During this call, PTC will make forward-looking statements, including guidance as to future operating results. Because such statements deal with future events, actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements can be found in PTC's annual report on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as well as in today's press release. The forward-looking statements, including guidance provided during this call are valid only as of today's date, November 6, 2024, and PTC assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. During the call, PTC will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in today's press release made available on our website. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to PTC's Chief Executive Officer, Neil Barua.\nNeil Barua: Thanks, Matt. I've been traveling the globe, meeting with customers, listening to their perspectives and supporting the teams to close deals. I'm hearing one consistent theme from the companies that build the products the world relies upon, \"Neil, we need to shorten our development time lines as quickly as possible with the highest quality to remain competitive. This includes our hardware, mechanical, electronic and embedded software processes that all need to come together for a final product. Please help us do this as PTC's core offerings are the key to unlock this value.\" This is PTC's North Star as we are best positioned across these critical dimensions to address the needs of our customers have. It is tangible of the momentum. And while it might not show up every quarter in a linear fashion, I'm orderly convinced of our long-term trajectory due to this tectonic shift happening within the key verticals we serve. In fiscal 2024, our free cash flow growth was solid, up 25% year-over-year. Our constant currency ARR growth was up 12% year-over-year. I am proud of the team as these results were driven in a selling environment that remain difficult, an environment that is consistent with what we have been articulating over the course of the past two years. We also delivered despite several organizational moves we made over the past two quarters. There were varying pockets of relative strength, such as areas in APAC and more broadly with our reseller channel. There are also pockets of relative weakness such as Western Europe. In summary, however, aggregate transaction volumes were in line with what we have been seeing over the past couple of years, which speaks to PTC's resilient business model and our diversification across the verticals and geographies we serve. This allowed us to report solid Q4 results despite the steady persistence of macroeconomic headwinds and geopolitical uncertainty. I'm also energized to announce that given the strength of our business and consistency of our free cash flow generation, we announced today a $2 billion share repurchase authorization. This provides us with another lever to further enhance shareholder value. Kristian will walk you through the details of how we plan to execute our buyback program. Let's move now to Slide 4, which highlights our product portfolio and strategy. As a reminder, our five focus areas are: one, PLM, which is driven primarily by our Windchill product; two, ALM, which is driven by our Codebeamer product; three, SLM, which is primarily driven by our ServiceMax product; four, CAD, which is driven primarily by our Creo product; and five, our continued focus on SaaS. These are the areas where we believe we can create the greatest customer value and are the areas where we have focused resources and attention. As I said earlier, our customers need to introduce new products at a faster pace and with higher quality. It is not unusual to hear from customers that they need to shorten their new product introduction timelines in half, and that's not possible without digital transformation across our workflows, which is exactly what our products enable. It is also worth highlighting that we are bringing our suite of software offerings in the areas that matter most for our customers together to help product companies improve their competitiveness. Given the unique breadth and openness of our portfolio, we can enable end-to-end digital thread initiatives, which leverage a connected flow of product data across design, manufacturing, service and ultimately, reuse. A digital thread enables product companies to breakdown silos, streamline workflows, and achieve interoperability across departments, functions and systems with a single version of the truth. It also secures the quality, consistency and traceability of product-related data, ensuring that the data is up-to-date, accessible, reliable and actionable. With a digital thread, the right data is delivered to the right people at the right time and in the right context across the value chain. The demand drivers for our core offerings are strong, and our differentiated capabilities to drive digital thread initiatives are increasingly important to our customers. There is so much we can do to help our customers drive better business outcomes. But as I mentioned last quarter, given this incredible opportunity in front of us, this underscores that we also need to evolve how we operate to deliver more value to our customers, with more precision and with more consistency. I'll turn to this now on Slide 5. Last quarter, I previewed some changes in our go-to-market efforts that we were contemplating. I'd like to get into some more detail since the first elements of these changes have been put into place. During my time here at PTC, I visited with many of our customers, and importantly, spent time with the go-to-market teams that interact with these customers. I had the chance to assess our capabilities and to examine the ways in which PTC's go-to-market teams are organized to bring value to our customers. Along with external advisers, we evaluated these elements on a qualitative basis and took the time to assess the performance of our go-to-market teams on a quantitative basis as well. The result of this evaluation is that we are making changes to our go-to-market structure that I believe will make us more effective in serving our customers and enable us to sustain the low double-digit ARR growth target for the medium term that we've previously laid out. I'd like to take a few minutes to walk you through these changes in more detail. First, we are hiring a new Chief Revenue Officer, who is expected to start in December. This leader is well known within the enterprise software space, and I expect that once he's settled in, he will drive increased focus, speed and accountability in a more vertically oriented go-to-market model. Speaking of which, the second adjustment we are making is that we are realigning PTC's selling, marketing and customer success motions around the five key verticals we already serve, particularly in North America and Europe. Those are industrial products, federal, aerospace and defense, electronics and high tech, automotive and lastly, medical technology and life sciences. The rationale for this vertically focused realignment is simple. It's an extension of our mantra of putting more wood behind the arrows that we believe deliver the greatest value to our customers and ultimately to our company and our shareholders. By aligning our go-to-market organization along industry lines, we will increase the specialization of our sellers, which will enhance their industry knowledge and allow them to be more effective at understanding the needs of their customers, how to help with their digital transformation journeys, and how to provide relevant industry-specific feedback to our product development teams. Similarly, by having customer success teams that specialize in certain verticals, they will be more familiar with the pain points that affect their [checked] customers and can act more quickly with more precision to solve these challenges. Frankly, I believe that we have been leaving money on the table with our previous structure and that there are significant opportunities to enhance our ARR growth by selling to and serving our customers in this manner. We have a large pool of customers, and their need for digital transformation can be met by the portfolio of products we have today. Yet we aren't fully capitalizing on this because of how we currently operate. Consider, for example, a customer in the automotive sector. In some cases, that customer's lead salesperson within PTC might also be addressing customers in the med tech and high-tech spaces. And while that automotive customer might have certain brands and divisions using our Windchill product for PLM, they might not be standardized on it. The automotive industry is under immense pressure to transform to software-defined vehicles, which, of course, comes with tremendous unique challenges, some of which can be addressed with our Codebeamer product, working alongside and integrated with Windchill. By adjusting the PTC teams that serve this customer to focus exclusively on the auto industry, for example, we believe that our selling and customer success teams will be able to cross-sell our solutions. And this will also enable us to address these customers' unique industry-specific challenges more swiftly and effectively. Underpinning this transformation are three cultural tenets that I think are worth highlighting because we believe they will ultimately drive value to our customers and to PTC overall. First, focus on what matters the most for our customers; second, drive increased speed internally and deliver value to our customers more quickly; and third, be more accountable for our decisions from start to finish. As part of this transformation, we have also reduced spans and layers within the go-to-market organization, while also eliminating certain overlay functions. To be clear, this is not an exercise in cost cutting. Rather, we believe reorganizing our customer-facing resources will make us more effective in capturing the vast opportunity that is ahead of us. We expect to redeploy the run rate costs associated with these people back into the re-architected go-to-market organization. We will be hiring quota-carrying salespeople and also specialized technical resources in our customer success organization that align with our five key verticals. There will be approximately $20 million of cash outflows associated with these changes. Kristian will cover more details in his discussion. Let me wrap up my comments about this go-to-market realignment by saying that I believe the opportunities to improve our effectiveness are significant here at PTC. We have started to make the required changes to our organization. We are confident that these changes will lead to repeatable and scalable go-to-market motions that will serve us well. And the guidance that Kristian will walk you through takes into consideration the possibility for some near-term disruptions associated with this realignment. Although we are taking significant measures to avoid meaningful stumbling blocks, we must acknowledge that we are evolving our go-to-market organization and the potential near-term risk associated with doing that. We believe we have taken a responsible approach here and look forward to updating you on future earnings calls. Finally, I thought it was worth spending most of my time today, as I just did, sharing my thoughts and expectations related to our go-to-market alignment. This took precedence over sharing some excellent customer stories. And so this quarter, we put the customer stories into the appendix slides of our earnings presentations. I'll continue to highlight customer stories on a consistent basis in future quarters. With that, I'll hand the call over to Kristian to take you through our Q4 and full-year financial results and future guidance.\nKristian Talvitie: Thanks, Neil, and hello, everyone. Starting off with Slide 7, PTC again delivered solid financial results in terms of both ARR and free cash flow in a continued challenging selling environment. As you know, we believe ARR and free cash flow are the most important metrics to assess the performance of our business. To help investors understand our performance, excluding the impact of foreign exchange volatility, we provide ARR guidance and disclose our ARR results on a constant currency basis. At the end of Q4, our constant currency ARR using our fiscal 2024 plan FX rates was $2.207 billion, up 12% year-over-year. Deferred ARR came in as expected. Moving on to cash flow. In Q4, our free cash flow results were also solid as we resolved the collection timing issues we saw last quarter. For the full-year, our free cash flow was $736 million, up 25%. Over the medium term, we continue to expect our free cash flow to grow faster than our ARR, with our non-GAAP operating expenses expected to grow at roughly half the rate of ARR. A basic tenet of our subscription business model and budgeting process is that there's natural operating leverage we benefit from as our ARR grows. In fiscal 2024, our operating efficiency expanded by 370 basis points to 42% compared to 38% in fiscal 2023. Moving to Slide 8. There are a few key takeaways here. First, as I just mentioned, we expect that our OpEx will grow at approximately half the rate of ARR over time. You can see that on this slide. On the right-hand side, you can see our constant currency ARR CAGR from fiscal 2021 through fiscal 2025 is approximately 15%, and our expected OpEx CAGR is approximately 6%. This is the leverage I was mentioning on the previous slide. While this is a little less than 50%, this is also because we had a couple of acquisitions over this time and there's additional leverage as those get integrated. Point being that while OpEx growing at 50% of ARR growth may not work out exactly that way in any given year, we've been delivering on this and think that it remains a good rule of thumb as you think about modeling our business over the medium term. Secondly, we also talk about our disciplined approach to budgeting and investment decisions, and I think that shows up pretty clearly on this slide as well. While our overall OpEx CAGR is expected to be approximately 6%, it's really more like 4% in SG&A and 11% in R&D. I think this punctuates the point that we've made previously that given the challenging selling environment we've been in for some time, it hasn't really made sense to be investing a lot incrementally into sales and marketing or G&A for that matter. Additionally, we believe there is incremental room for effectiveness within the spend envelope we have today as evidenced by the go-to-market realignment Neil elaborated on earlier. And this brings me to the final point of the slide that I'm trying to emphasize, which is that we are investing in our future growth while delivering solid free cash flow. On the slide, the blue line represents our non-GAAP R&D expense trend. You can see that the slope of the blue line inflected four years ago, following our transition to a subscription model. As our free cash flows expanded, this has enabled us to reinvest greater amounts into R&D to support our customers and drive future growth despite the challenging macro. For over a decade, from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2020, our average non-GAAP R&D expense was approximately $210 million, and our 12-year CAGR was about 2%. In contrast to that, we expect to invest approximately $400 million in non-GAAP R&D this year, and our four-year CAGR from fiscal 2021 through 2025 is expected to be approximately 11%. This evolution of our business is important to understand, and it's great for our customers because it allows us to continue to invest incrementally in our products even during a turbulent macro. Turning to Slide 9. Let's look at our ARR growth in more detail, starting with our product groups. In Q4, we delivered 10% constant currency ARR growth in CAD and 13% in PLM. Our topline growth has shown good resilience despite the environment we've seen over the past couple of years and is supported by our unique portfolio with a solid footprint in higher-growth segments of the market as well as the digital transformation journey of our customers. These underlying strengths are further supported by our subscription model, our low churn rate, and the propensity for our customer base to prioritize their own R&D investments through challenging times. Moving to our ARR by region. Our constant currency organic ARR growth was solid across Americas, Europe and APAC, with growth in the low to mid-double digits. Across all regions, our year-over-year organic constant currency growth rates in Q4 were similar to the growth rates we saw in Q3. Turning to Slide 10. We took on a lot of debt over the past three years, and we've been diligently paying that down. During Q4, we paid down $63 million and ended Q4 with cash and cash equivalents of $266 million and gross debt of $1.753 billion. During fiscal 2024, our gross debt balance decreased by $569 million. We used $694 million, substantially all the free cash flow we generated this year, to pay down our debt, as we said we would. This was partially offset by an increase in gross debt of $125 million in Q1 related to pure variants and the imputed interest for ServiceMax, which we discussed in detail on our Q1 call. We were 1.9x levered at the end of Q4. As you know, our long-term goal, assuming our debt-to-EBITDA ratio is below 3x, remains to return approximately 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases, while also taking into consideration the interest rate environment and strategic opportunities. I'm pretty sure I don't need to do the math for you, but the $2 billion authorization that we now have in place through fiscal 2027 is clearly more than 50% of the free cash flow we expect to generate over that period. This year, as you also all know, we have a $500 million bond that's coming due in February, which we intend to retire at that time with cash on hand and by drawing on our revolving credit facility. And in line with what we've said previously, we intend to buy back approximately $300 million of our common stock in fiscal 2025 commencing this quarter. Also, as you know, we aim to maintain a low cash balance given the consistency and predictability of the business. As such, assuming we have excess cash, we expect to return it to shareholders. And the authorization we now have in place gives us a lot of flexibility in how we do that. Our fully diluted share count in fiscal 2024 was 121 million, and we currently expect fully diluted shares to be approximately flat in fiscal 2025. Moving to Slide 11. Before I take you through our guidance, let me walk you through how we guide and report ARR. As I said earlier, we believe constant currency ARR is the best way to evaluate the topline performance of our business because it removes FX fluctuations from the analysis, positive or negative. If you take a look at Slide 24 in our appendix, you'll see the extent to which FX volatility impacted as reported ARR over the past eight quarters. For fiscal 2024, we provided constant currency ARR guidance and reported constant currency ARR results for all periods using our fiscal 2024 plan FX rates, which were as of September 30, 2023. We also recast historical constant currency ARR amounts back to fiscal 2019 at those fiscal 2024 plan FX rates for comparative purposes. For fiscal 2025, we are taking the exact same approach. We set our constant currency ARR guidance, and we'll report constant currency ARR results for all periods using our fiscal 2025 plan FX rates, which are as of September 30, 2024. We also recast historical constant currency ARR amounts back to fiscal 2019 at our fiscal 2025 plan FX rates for comparative purposes. You can find the recast historicals in the financial data tables for Q4 2024 that are posted on our IR website. And on this slide, you can see the recast constant currency ARR amounts for the past eight quarters. With that, I'll take you through our guidance on Slide 12. All of the ARR amounts on this slide are based on our fiscal 2025 plan FX rates. For constant currency ARR, we expect growth of 9% to 10% for fiscal 2025 and approximately 10.5% for Q1. I'll get into more detail on constant currency ARR on the next two slides. On cash flows, we are guiding for free cash flow of $835 million to $850 million in fiscal 2025, which absorbs the approximately $20 million of outflows for severance and consulting fees related to our go-to-market realignment. Given that the amount is relatively small, we are not calling out any restructuring charge, so all of this will flow through the sales and marketing and COGS lines on our P&L. And reiterating what Neil said earlier, we expect to be reinvesting the run rate expense back into the go-to-market organization throughout the year. In fiscal 2025, we expect similar invoicing seasonality compared to the previous four years. Based on this and our expected cash outflows, we expect approximately 55% or more of our free cash flow to be generated in the first half of the year and for fiscal Q4 to be our lowest cash generation quarter. Note that our cash flow guidance is not on a constant currency basis, so FX fluctuations and interest rate changes can have an impact in either direction. For Q1, we are guiding for free cash flow of approximately $230 million, which absorbs approximately $12 million of the $20 million of total outflows related to the go-to-market realignment. The remainder of the payments will be spread out throughout the rest of the year. We have a high degree of confidence in our guidance for free cash flow due to the predictability of our cash collections and the disciplined budgeting structure we have in place. Importantly, we've maintained consistent billing practices over time. We primarily bill our customers annually upfront one-year at a time, regardless of the contract term length. So our free cash flow results over time are comparable. Furthermore, over the past five years, we've optimized our internal budgeting process. It starts with having a subscription business model that generates predictable cash inflows, and then we start each fiscal year by funding our business for growth at the low end of our internal ARR expectations. And as we progress through the year, we maintain or increase the level of funding based on the growth dynamics we are seeing. By proceeding in this manner, we are able to match our investments to the market environment in an agile way, while also delivering predictable free cash flow. To help you with your models, we are also providing revenue and EPS guidance. However, I'd like to reiterate my favorite reminder, ASC 606 makes revenue and EPS difficult to predict for PTC since we sell primarily on-premises subscriptions. And the way that revenue is recognized from these contracts can vary significantly based on variables that aren't necessarily relevant to the performance of the business. I did a teach-in on this subject on our Q4 fiscal 2022 call that you may want to refer to if you are new to PTC. The summary is we believe ARR and free cash flow, rather than revenue and operating income, are the best metrics to assess the performance of our business. Moving on to Slide 13. Here is an illustrative constant currency ARR model for fiscal 2025. You can see our results over the past three years, and the column on the right illustrates what's needed to get to our constant currency ARR guidance for fiscal 2025. Note that all amounts on this slide are using our FY 2025 plan FX rates. The illustrative model indicates that to hit 9.5% ARR growth, we need to add $214 million of net new ARR this year. Our fiscal 2025 guidance range assumes that we will add approximately $20 million less net new ARR in fiscal 2025 compared to 2024 and approximately $5 million less than in fiscal 2023 and 2022. It's worth noting that on an annual basis, our opening deferred ARR for the year is expected to be in line with to slightly better than what we've seen over the last three years when normalizing for the $10 million incremental we had in fiscal 2024. Additionally, our churn remains low and we expect our churn rate in fiscal 2025 to be in line with to slightly better than the improving churn rates we've had in the past three years. Our business model is resilient, and while the selling environment remains challenging, we believe that because of these dynamics and allowing for potential near-term disruption due to our go-to-market realignment that 9% to 10% ARR growth is the right target for fiscal 2025. Next, on Slide 14, here's a similar illustrative model for Q1. As you know, based on our results over the past few years, our net new ARR can be somewhat volatile in any given quarter, given dynamics such as new or renewal bookings, seasonality, timing of deferred ARR siting how much of our new bookings in any given quarter starts in the quarter, how much churn we expect in any given quarter, et cetera. We've clearly seen quarterly volatility in our results over the past few years and we expect to see some of these dynamics in Q1. This slide shows our sequential net new ARR over the past couple of years, and the column on the right illustrates that we need $20 million of sequential net new ARR growth to hit 10.5% growth in Q1. Obviously, it's impossible to predict any given quarter with that level of precision. However, I'm sure you'll note that this is below the sequential net new ARR for Q1 that we've had over the past couple of years. And as such, I think there are two factors worth noting, both timing related. First is the linearity of deferred ARR; and secondly, the mechanics of a couple of contracts that will show up as churn in Q1, but are contracted to come back into ARR later this fiscal year. Together, these two factors are expected to adversely impact our Q1 sequential net new ARR by approximately $10 million but will not have an impact on fiscal 2025. Also, we need to be mindful of any potential disruption from the go-to-market changes we're making. Importantly, we continue to keep our focus on the full-year as this is how we make incremental investment decisions over the course of the year. With all that said, we think it's worth emphasizing that after normalizing for the approximate $10 million timing impact I just called out, our Q1 sequential ARR will be in the same ballpark as the past couple of years. Turning to Slide 15. I know that most of you model free cash flow using the indirect method, which uses the P&L and balance sheet as a starting point. However, given the complexities related to ASC 606, there are inherent challenges in using the indirect method to forecast free cash flow for PTC. The model on this slide is based on what we use internally. I know that looking at it this way, may be unfamiliar to some of you, so please feel free to reach out if we can be of help. Starting at the top, for fiscal 2025 we\u2019re using 9.5% ARR growth, the midpoint of our constant currency guidance range. Next, our perpetual revenue is primarily related to our Kepware business, which is moving to subscription over time. And the primary reason that our professional services revenue is modeled to decline in fiscal 2025 is because a portion of it is transitioning to DxP over time. These three line items get us to our expected cash generation for the year, assuming no significant fluctuations in FX rates. Moving down to the cost sections. I'd like to highlight that the approximately $20 million of cash outflows related to our go-to-market realignment are embedded in the cost of revenue and operating expenses line. Even as we reinvest in the business and realign the go-to-market organization in 2025, we continue to see expansion of our operating efficiency metric due to our recurring subscription model combined with our budgeting process. Continuing to move down the model, we provide guidance assumptions for stock comp, amortization, CapEx, cash interest payments and cash tax payments. You can find these on Slide 19 of the earnings deck and also on Pages 3 and 4 of the press release. Note that the cash interest payments are expected to be approximately $90 million in fiscal 2025, significantly lower than in fiscal 2024, driven by \u2013 primarily by a decrease in debt. Also cash tax payments are expected to be $110 million in fiscal 2025, significantly higher than in fiscal 2024, reflecting higher taxable income, the utilization of our deferred tax assets and the impact of Internal Revenue Code Section 174. And finally, let's take a look at the other category. In fiscal 2024, the $82 million was primarily related to FX movements and working capital. For fiscal 2025, the main drivers of the $99 million being modeled here are FX rates, which have already moved significantly since September 30, 2024 as well as working capital to support continued growth. In this simplified illustrative model, the impact of FX fluctuations are captured on a net basis in the other line. In reality, FX fluctuations that are net positive for free cash flow result in higher cash generation and cash disbursements and FX fluctuations that are negative for free cash flow result in lower cash generation and cash disbursements. All of this sums up to our expected free cash flow of approximately $843 million, which is the midpoint of our fiscal 2025 free cash flow guidance range. So in conclusion, PTC has a strong portfolio and strategy, a track record of operational discipline and clear value creation opportunities. We're focused on what matters most for our customers, and we're aligning our operations accordingly so that we can scale our business in a consistent manner. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to the operator for today's Q&A session.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, as mentioned, we will begin our Q&A session now. [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from the line of Ken Wong with Oppenheimer & Co. Your line is live.\nKen Wong: Fantastic. I wanted to just ask a question in terms of the go-to-market disruption. Neil, you mentioned that Kristian has baked that into the guidance I guess, one, when would you assume that you hit sort of peak disruption. And then I couldn't help but notice that in Q1, you're growing 10.5% and 11% on an adjusted basis. Is that the right way to think about the growth rate, assuming you guys can manage through the disruption with minimal impact?\nNeil Barua: Let me take the \u2013 Ken, thanks for the question. Let me take the front end and Kristian could talk about the way in which we're thinking about the year. So we're not expecting disruption. In fact, we've been really thoughtful and have gone to already great lengths to prevent disruption. We've got a number of mechanisms. We've done it before to make sure that we prevent that disruption across the team as we're going through this transformation. At the same time, though, we are also recognizing that as in many go-to-market transitions that happen across every company, there can be some friction within the sales team. Just like all our best efforts, at the end of the day, these are people, not spreadsheets. Emotion is there and a lot of management that goes into them. But again, we're hyper-focused on making sure that we minimize it. But in contrast to your question to setting guidance conservatively to kind of artificially engineer a beat and raise cadence, we set our guidance in a way that gives us some room, Ken, in case we end up seeing any short-term disruptions over the course of the next number of quarters. Kristian, do you want to take the second piece?\nKristian Talvitie: I think you just did.\nNeil Barua: Okay. Good.\nKen Wong: All right, perfect. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you for your questions. Our next question is from the line of Daniel Jester with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is live.\nDaniel Jester: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just on the market. I know there's five pillars on the product side of what you're really focused on. Maybe, Neil, we can have an update as to what you expect to see from maybe variation in terms of performance of the business and maybe double-click on ServiceMax and Codebeamer? Thank you.\nNeil Barua: Yes. Good question. So as you can see from the results from our PLM and CAD breakout, we continue to have strong performance across those categories across last year. And what's driving that is this \u2013 the Windchill proliferation, which will \u2013 the strategy of this go-to-market transformation is within the verticals that are using Windchill, how to continue to penetrate that more in a precise and consistent manner across the enterprise. So Windchill is something we continue to see momentum in. We're building more momentum. And with this vertical strategy, we'll have even more precision by the key verticals we already serve with nomenclature and examples of other customers in those verticals that are using Windchill at scale like we're seeing in many cases already. But we have plenty of wood to chop to take down all those dollars in ARR that we could have as we expand Windchill. So that's a category that we're really leaning into. Codebeamer, as you asked, last year, and particularly in Q4, two out of the 10 largest automotive OEM companies with revenue, two out of them are expanding Codebeamer even in Q4 at pace, and so that's good. Additional three-plus customers that have been using Codebeamer already in deployment have decided to expand that usage. So we're starting to see this element of Codebeamer as it gets deployed in the environment as software engineers are using it as they're seeing how software interacts with the hardware engineers, mechanical engineers, customers are saying, we want more Codebeamer. So we're going to press on that. You're going to see continued emphasis on how Codebeamer, Windchill work even more comprehensively together, which will continue to accelerate the PLM for us that we're starting to see in the market. And then lastly, I know I didn't talk about customers, as I mentioned on the call, but there's a great case study that we're seeing continued indications and customer deployments on with ServiceMax, to your question, around one of the largest manufacturers of cranes in the world has been a large Creo, Windchill customer for almost a few decades. And we've been working on this with the ServiceMax team for the last call it, 12 to 18 months with this customer, with our new release that I mentioned in the summertime around Windchill and ServiceMax connected on trouble tickets being able to flow back into Windchill from ServiceMax. That customer did a very comprehensive proposal and an RFP that looked at all the competitive offerings, and they chose us because of ServiceMax's integration with Windchill and the flow of product data from engineering to service and back, which was the key differentiator for us. So we see continued emphasis there. Momentum continues to build, and we look forward to a good year on both fronts.\nDaniel Jester: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question is from the line of Saket Kalia with Barclays. Your line is live.\nSaket Kalia: Okay. Great. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question here. Neil, maybe for you. I know you spend a lot of time with customers, and you called out Western Europe in your prepared remarks. So I'd love to just zoom into that geography a little bit. What are you hearing from customers there about willingness to spend right now? And how do you sort of envision 2025 in Europe from just a demand perspective?\nNeil Barua: Yes, great question. I have been spending a lot of time in Europe and rest of world and also here in North America meeting customers, as you mentioned. I think what we're seeing in the dynamic, we saw some of that in Q4. We delivered solid results, as we said, for ARR and really great results on cash flow for Q4. But in terms of having a blowout quarter for Q4 in ARR, we had a few deals in Western Europe, in particular, like we noted, that either pushed out or got smaller in the deal value that we're really pushing on getting done over the course of Q4, which I believe we'll still get in due time over the course of this year. And the dynamic that's happening \u2013 and at the same time, by the way, we won a number of deals that were at the same value that we thought in Western Europe and closed those in Q4. I think what we're working through is particularly within the automotive vertical in Germany, there is obviously a lot of pressure around just the cost structure, the speed in which they're developing cars, the Tier 1 suppliers that supply those folks, all those components of how do you really create competitiveness versus Chinese OEMs. We're seeing a lot of that pressure occur as we've all been reading in the press. I've been sitting in boardrooms with all of these customers. That's the bad news, kind of the highlights of the media reports. I believe that this is forcing our customers that we're serving in this specific vertical in Western Europe to rethink how they're actually operating as a business to remain competitive. And that comes down to, first, Codebeamer, was continue to blow momentum within Western Europe because software now needs to work at the same speed as mechanical hardware, mechatronic systems within these OEMs, that need to have Codebeamer implemented to do that to keep pace with the Chinese development cycle. So I think that's a net positive for us, despite the macro and the issues that the German automakers are dealing with. So that's a positive. On the second piece is on Windchill, they're looking at thinking about PLM, how to move product data faster than their enterprise because they need to stay alive. And so I don't want to get too aggressive on saying it's going to be a wide-open field for us to go execute and win a lot of deals in Western Europe because there is a backdrop of uncertainty. But within the business, there's a lot of urgency and need to change the way they're actually doing business. And our technology underpins that change, so I'm bullish around the requirement, Saket. I'm bullish around the urgency for them to do it. I'm cautious around how they're actually going to spend those dollars over the course of the next couple of years. And we'll see how that goes over the course of this year. We factor that into how we put this range of guidance as well.\nSaket Kalia: Makes sense. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thanks for your question. Our next question is from the line of Joe Vruwink with Baird. Your line is live.\nJoseph Vruwink: Great. Thanks. On the go-to-market change, would you say that initiating the timing now means the structure is mature ahead of needing to be positioned for maybe any benefit from renewed spending that customers might pursue around macro improvement? And I guess, I ask because there's the potential always after a U.S. election that industrial orders pick up. If you did see an improvement in industrial sentiment vis-a-vis PMI, do you think there's a lag for your business? So you expect your pipelines to replenish maybe later in 2025? And that really simply lines up with when this new structure is going to be mature anyways? And so all of that is ultimately compatible with the changes you're now making?\nNeil Barua: Yes, great question. I would say that our teams are already underway and getting ready and executing across the plan. And there are several things we're working through around account plans, assignments, all that great stuff that every team needs to do to organize for being able to face the vertical opportunities that exist, and we're working through that. And that's the area that we believe we're not expecting disruption, but we're taking account that some things in other situations to adjust for that if something does happen. But what we won't have is not being ready for the opportunities that we see in the current pipeline. And if somehow or another, business actually changes versus the last two years of the sluggish sales environment, our vertical approach are ready with experience in these verticals at scale with big customers. We're primed to take advantage of incremental demand and being able to continue to be well versed to take advantage of that and not have as much of a lag. So I'm looking forward to if we could get manufacturing and PMIs to tick up, PTC is ready for that. We've been ready for a while, and we're going to be even more ready as we verticalize the business, which we're doing and it's underway. And we're looking forward to how that translates over the course of this year into next.\nJoseph Vruwink: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next line is from the line of Adam Borg with Stifel. Your line is live.\nAdam Borg: Awesome. Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe for Neil, you talked a little bit about the go-to-market focus around five key verticals. And I believe Saket's question talked a little bit about what you're seeing in the automotive. I was hoping you could talk a little bit, is there anything else interesting happening in the other four verticals worth commenting, both positive or negative? And maybe, Kristian, if you could just remind us what the current ARR mix is for each of those top five verticals, that would be really helpful? Thanks so much.\nNeil Barua: I'll start with the one that's top of everyone's mind across the world. I was in India a couple of weeks ago. It's the same dynamic. Federal, aerospace and defense is just continuing to be an area that is facing significant backlog and demand, and they're trying to move that faster through their business to deliver the products that are being asked from their customers. And so in India, I was in U.K., here in North America spending a lot of time, that segment, I think, is continuing to be an area we're leaning into. We have a lot of experience. We have a lot of credibility there. We're going to continue to do that. I'm going out to Washington, D.C. to make sure we continue to promote this, again, in a vertical marketing perspective already going into that model. We believe there's a lot of really interesting dynamics happening in the federal, aerospace and defense across the world. We're very well positioned there. On med tech and life sciences, we're also seeing an interesting other dynamic where a lot of these companies have gotten very big through a lot of acquisitions, and they're now being forced to really develop products in a faster pace. That requires PLM at the heart of an epicenter of moving product data as fast as possible to manufacturing, and so we're seeing some really interesting trends occurring in med tech and life sciences. We had a couple of really interesting wins that happened in the last couple of quarters of 2024, and we expect that to continue because again, it's a survival and existence of their business to actually put these frameworks and systems together like Windchill, like Codebeamer, like Creo and ServiceMax to be able to deal with the competitive nature of their business. And then, Adam, getting back to your other question. If we talk about the vertical exposure across the major industries, the industrial space is kind of high 20s for us. FA&D is in the \u2013 around 15%. Electronics and high tech, also in that same mid-teens. Automotive, in the kind of low teens. Med tech, in the low teens. And then the other, what we would, I guess, call non-core verticals make up the difference, which is also around kind of 15-ish percent of the business.\nAdam Borg: Awesome. Thanks again.\nOperator: Great. Thank you for your question. Our next question is from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Your line is live.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Hi. Thank you. Good evening. With regard to the digital thread comments, maybe we could tie that into the vertical comments you had this evening. That is which verticals would you say are furthest along in terms of adoption \u2013 adopting three or more solutions or three or more of your various three-letter acronyms, as indicative of implementing closed loop life cycle management? And then with regard to auto, when you last reported your segments as a percentage of revenue, which was six years ago, it was mid-teens percent, but your exposure to auto was very different. Back then, it was largely powertrains, some supply chain, never really body. But would you say now that with the evolution of automotive systems requirements, that your whole exposure and delivery of software to automotive is going to be fundamentally different than your more limited exposure in the past?\nNeil Barua: Yes, great question, Jay. I'll start with the second one. On automotive, I think there's been a massive shift. And our determination and our foothold in that market, I think, is very different than whatever that prior stat was given. And the reason for it is it's predominantly the influx of Windchill and Codebeamer in that group. And this, as you know well, this includes the OEMs and Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3 suppliers. Codebeamer is taking hold on that, and we're just pushing all accelerators. Windchill is also right along for the ride, and you'll see more and more of that come into it versus the design guys, the factory guys, those are there. They're great competitors of ours. We're more focused on helping our customers deal with this entire problem statement of how to build software-defined vehicles at speed to compete against the Chinese. And our tools and our software, Jay, as you know well, is very well placed there. In some cases, by the way, they're looking at Creo. They're looking at other things that we have across the portfolio. But the majority of the strength in that group, and you'll see that continue \u2013 again, it might not happen in a linear fashion, but the ultimate over the medium and long-term will be you will see Windchill and Codebeamer really wrap their arms around that space in an aggressive fashion. That's the strategy and kind of direction that we've got. On your first part of your question on digital thread across verticals, there's not really one that's taken \u2013 I could say, wow, they've really taken on hold. And that's the amazing part of this business, Jay, which is we look at those verticals, and this is my point of we've got a lot of money on the table to go tell them around how Creo, Windchill, Codebeamer work together. And on the aftermarket service side, how does ServiceMax fit into it, across all the other things that we've got. But in those four core areas, we've got a real opportunity with \u2013 in certain segments, already customers using it, but let's promote it across the entire vertical. And that's the area that we're going to keep pressing on. We're going to build product integrations around. We're going to get our messaging consistent around. We're going to do customer reference-ability on. And that's where we think we've got the ability to have a sustainable, low double-digit growth rate in the medium and long-term. That's the goal that we're pushing for and from our perspective.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question is from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Your line is live.\nAndrew Obin: Yes. Good evening.\nNeil Barua: Andrew.\nAndrew Obin: Hey. How are you? So we're sitting here right after the election, and we ended up going to a bunch of industry shows. And it just seems a lot of uncertainty that we were picking up from election, this multiyear de-stock really impacting people's budgets that have disrupted operations. Post the election, do you feel there is more uncertainty than usual about 2025 calendar year budgets? Or because the comps have gotten so much easier and we are past the election that sort of created this uncertainty, that visibility has gotten better? Thank you.\nNeil Barua: Yes. To be fair, we're 24 hours post the election results. So I was with two customers today already. And what I will say is their commentary and their desires are similar to what it was 48 hours ago, which is around how to make sure we are set up to deal with all the complexities of the world, which includes geopolitical uncertainty. But that's only one facet of it. There is supply chain uncertainty. There is workforce disruption uncertainty and retirements, aging. There's complexity of products that consumers are demanding now as we \u2013 again, I'll note the Chinese OEMs. They have opened up the world to saying, let's give the users all this complexity and configuration of products in very different ways. And when you add all that together, what we're hearing from customers, again, 24 hours, but previous to that is we need technology that PTC provides to be relevant to have product data move faster through our organization through highly configured models and variances of their products. That includes software, that includes hardware, that includes electronics and mechanical, so that we could survive. And I think that's going to be, in any scenario, a need that will continue to accelerate regardless of administration and regardless of push in certain geographies versus the others. So that's why we're \u2013 what I said was, we're working through a tectonic shift. I'm utterly convinced around the long-term view of it. The linear nature of this on a quarterly basis, you can pick and choose that number. But this business is moving in these verticals because of the urgency of our customers to survive and to remain competitive. And I think those dynamics are perfectly suited for what PTC has to offer.\nAndrew Obin: So realignment is a bigger source of uncertainty into 2025 versus macro. Is that fair to say?\nNeil Barua: I think Andrew, if I could say, I think it's everything. I don't think there's going to be, at least in the last 24 hours, less uncertainty. I think it's \u2013 we're going to see how the next couple of quarters play out, and we'll be ready for it. But right now, we're focused, Andrew, on delivering what our customers are needing from us. And depending on the changes in the environment, we'll be ready for it. We have been ready for it through multiple different administrations for 35-plus years, and we were successful as a company. And we're going to deal the same way going forward for the next 35 years.\nAndrew Obin: That's a great answer. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. And ladies and gentlemen, a reminder to please stay on the call at the conclusion of today. Neil is going to be back on to close us out. We have a final question from today from the line of Jason Celino with KeyBanc. Your line is live.\nJason Celino: Hey. I appreciate you fitting me in. Maybe for Kristian, if we play back the tape from 90 days ago, I think when you gave us an initial framework for FY2025, you technically said double digits for ARR growth. Now if I look at the guide, technically, it's single digits at the midpoint. So curious like what has changed in these 90 days. I don't know if it was macro or if it's just the incremental conservatism around the go-to-market kind of changes, but just curious on the hair that I'm splitting here.\nKristian Talvitie: Yes. I think it's the latter, Jason. I think it's just conservatism around potential impact of the go-to-market realignment.\nJason Celino: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. And ladies and gentlemen, as promised, that will wrap up our Q&A session for today. And I'd like to turn the line back over to Neil to close this out. Thank you.\nNeil Barua: Thank you, everyone, for joining us and for your questions today. Kristian and Matt will be both on the road in the weeks ahead, participating in investor conferences. Kristian will be in New York, mid-November, hosting a Mizuho dinner and attending the RBC conference. Kristian will also be going to London, while I'm in Asia in early December, and we'll be at the NASDAQ Conference. Matt will be at the Wells Fargo, UBS and Barclays conferences on the West Coast in early December. And thank you again, and we really look forward to engaging with you. Thanks.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Neil Barua",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt. I've been traveling the globe, meeting with customers, listening to their perspectives and supporting the teams to close deals. I'm hearing one consistent theme from the companies that build the products the world relies upon, \"Neil, we need to shorten our development time lines as quickly as possible with the highest quality to remain competitive. This includes our hardware, mechanical, electronic and embedded software processes that all need to come together for a final product. Please help us do this as PTC's core offerings are the key to unlock this value.\" This is PTC's North Star as we are best positioned across these critical dimensions to address the needs of our customers have. It is tangible of the momentum. And while it might not show up every quarter in a linear fashion, I'm orderly convinced of our long-term trajectory due to this tectonic shift happening within the key verticals we serve. In fiscal 2024, our free cash flow growth was solid, up 25% year-over-year. Our constant currency ARR growth was up 12% year-over-year. I am proud of the team as these results were driven in a selling environment that remain difficult, an environment that is consistent with what we have been articulating over the course of the past two years. We also delivered despite several organizational moves we made over the past two quarters. There were varying pockets of relative strength, such as areas in APAC and more broadly with our reseller channel. There are also pockets of relative weakness such as Western Europe. In summary, however, aggregate transaction volumes were in line with what we have been seeing over the past couple of years, which speaks to PTC's resilient business model and our diversification across the verticals and geographies we serve. This allowed us to report solid Q4 results despite the steady persistence of macroeconomic headwinds and geopolitical uncertainty. I'm also energized to announce that given the strength of our business and consistency of our free cash flow generation, we announced today a $2 billion share repurchase authorization. This provides us with another lever to further enhance shareholder value. Kristian will walk you through the details of how we plan to execute our buyback program. Let's move now to Slide 4, which highlights our product portfolio and strategy. As a reminder, our five focus areas are: one, PLM, which is driven primarily by our Windchill product; two, ALM, which is driven by our Codebeamer product; three, SLM, which is primarily driven by our ServiceMax product; four, CAD, which is driven primarily by our Creo product; and five, our continued focus on SaaS. These are the areas where we believe we can create the greatest customer value and are the areas where we have focused resources and attention. As I said earlier, our customers need to introduce new products at a faster pace and with higher quality. It is not unusual to hear from customers that they need to shorten their new product introduction timelines in half, and that's not possible without digital transformation across our workflows, which is exactly what our products enable. It is also worth highlighting that we are bringing our suite of software offerings in the areas that matter most for our customers together to help product companies improve their competitiveness. Given the unique breadth and openness of our portfolio, we can enable end-to-end digital thread initiatives, which leverage a connected flow of product data across design, manufacturing, service and ultimately, reuse. A digital thread enables product companies to breakdown silos, streamline workflows, and achieve interoperability across departments, functions and systems with a single version of the truth. It also secures the quality, consistency and traceability of product-related data, ensuring that the data is up-to-date, accessible, reliable and actionable. With a digital thread, the right data is delivered to the right people at the right time and in the right context across the value chain. The demand drivers for our core offerings are strong, and our differentiated capabilities to drive digital thread initiatives are increasingly important to our customers. There is so much we can do to help our customers drive better business outcomes. But as I mentioned last quarter, given this incredible opportunity in front of us, this underscores that we also need to evolve how we operate to deliver more value to our customers, with more precision and with more consistency. I'll turn to this now on Slide 5. Last quarter, I previewed some changes in our go-to-market efforts that we were contemplating. I'd like to get into some more detail since the first elements of these changes have been put into place. During my time here at PTC, I visited with many of our customers, and importantly, spent time with the go-to-market teams that interact with these customers. I had the chance to assess our capabilities and to examine the ways in which PTC's go-to-market teams are organized to bring value to our customers. Along with external advisers, we evaluated these elements on a qualitative basis and took the time to assess the performance of our go-to-market teams on a quantitative basis as well. The result of this evaluation is that we are making changes to our go-to-market structure that I believe will make us more effective in serving our customers and enable us to sustain the low double-digit ARR growth target for the medium term that we've previously laid out. I'd like to take a few minutes to walk you through these changes in more detail. First, we are hiring a new Chief Revenue Officer, who is expected to start in December. This leader is well known within the enterprise software space, and I expect that once he's settled in, he will drive increased focus, speed and accountability in a more vertically oriented go-to-market model. Speaking of which, the second adjustment we are making is that we are realigning PTC's selling, marketing and customer success motions around the five key verticals we already serve, particularly in North America and Europe. Those are industrial products, federal, aerospace and defense, electronics and high tech, automotive and lastly, medical technology and life sciences. The rationale for this vertically focused realignment is simple. It's an extension of our mantra of putting more wood behind the arrows that we believe deliver the greatest value to our customers and ultimately to our company and our shareholders. By aligning our go-to-market organization along industry lines, we will increase the specialization of our sellers, which will enhance their industry knowledge and allow them to be more effective at understanding the needs of their customers, how to help with their digital transformation journeys, and how to provide relevant industry-specific feedback to our product development teams. Similarly, by having customer success teams that specialize in certain verticals, they will be more familiar with the pain points that affect their [checked] customers and can act more quickly with more precision to solve these challenges. Frankly, I believe that we have been leaving money on the table with our previous structure and that there are significant opportunities to enhance our ARR growth by selling to and serving our customers in this manner. We have a large pool of customers, and their need for digital transformation can be met by the portfolio of products we have today. Yet we aren't fully capitalizing on this because of how we currently operate. Consider, for example, a customer in the automotive sector. In some cases, that customer's lead salesperson within PTC might also be addressing customers in the med tech and high-tech spaces. And while that automotive customer might have certain brands and divisions using our Windchill product for PLM, they might not be standardized on it. The automotive industry is under immense pressure to transform to software-defined vehicles, which, of course, comes with tremendous unique challenges, some of which can be addressed with our Codebeamer product, working alongside and integrated with Windchill. By adjusting the PTC teams that serve this customer to focus exclusively on the auto industry, for example, we believe that our selling and customer success teams will be able to cross-sell our solutions. And this will also enable us to address these customers' unique industry-specific challenges more swiftly and effectively. Underpinning this transformation are three cultural tenets that I think are worth highlighting because we believe they will ultimately drive value to our customers and to PTC overall. First, focus on what matters the most for our customers; second, drive increased speed internally and deliver value to our customers more quickly; and third, be more accountable for our decisions from start to finish. As part of this transformation, we have also reduced spans and layers within the go-to-market organization, while also eliminating certain overlay functions. To be clear, this is not an exercise in cost cutting. Rather, we believe reorganizing our customer-facing resources will make us more effective in capturing the vast opportunity that is ahead of us. We expect to redeploy the run rate costs associated with these people back into the re-architected go-to-market organization. We will be hiring quota-carrying salespeople and also specialized technical resources in our customer success organization that align with our five key verticals. There will be approximately $20 million of cash outflows associated with these changes. Kristian will cover more details in his discussion. Let me wrap up my comments about this go-to-market realignment by saying that I believe the opportunities to improve our effectiveness are significant here at PTC. We have started to make the required changes to our organization. We are confident that these changes will lead to repeatable and scalable go-to-market motions that will serve us well. And the guidance that Kristian will walk you through takes into consideration the possibility for some near-term disruptions associated with this realignment. Although we are taking significant measures to avoid meaningful stumbling blocks, we must acknowledge that we are evolving our go-to-market organization and the potential near-term risk associated with doing that. We believe we have taken a responsible approach here and look forward to updating you on future earnings calls. Finally, I thought it was worth spending most of my time today, as I just did, sharing my thoughts and expectations related to our go-to-market alignment. This took precedence over sharing some excellent customer stories. And so this quarter, we put the customer stories into the appendix slides of our earnings presentations. I'll continue to highlight customer stories on a consistent basis in future quarters. With that, I'll hand the call over to Kristian to take you through our Q4 and full-year financial results and future guidance. Let me take the \u2013 Ken, thanks for the question. Let me take the front end and Kristian could talk about the way in which we're thinking about the year. So we're not expecting disruption. In fact, we've been really thoughtful and have gone to already great lengths to prevent disruption. We've got a number of mechanisms. We've done it before to make sure that we prevent that disruption across the team as we're going through this transformation. At the same time, though, we are also recognizing that as in many go-to-market transitions that happen across every company, there can be some friction within the sales team. Just like all our best efforts, at the end of the day, these are people, not spreadsheets. Emotion is there and a lot of management that goes into them. But again, we're hyper-focused on making sure that we minimize it. But in contrast to your question to setting guidance conservatively to kind of artificially engineer a beat and raise cadence, we set our guidance in a way that gives us some room, Ken, in case we end up seeing any short-term disruptions over the course of the next number of quarters. Kristian, do you want to take the second piece? Okay. Good. Yes. Good question. So as you can see from the results from our PLM and CAD breakout, we continue to have strong performance across those categories across last year. And what's driving that is this \u2013 the Windchill proliferation, which will \u2013 the strategy of this go-to-market transformation is within the verticals that are using Windchill, how to continue to penetrate that more in a precise and consistent manner across the enterprise. So Windchill is something we continue to see momentum in. We're building more momentum. And with this vertical strategy, we'll have even more precision by the key verticals we already serve with nomenclature and examples of other customers in those verticals that are using Windchill at scale like we're seeing in many cases already. But we have plenty of wood to chop to take down all those dollars in ARR that we could have as we expand Windchill. So that's a category that we're really leaning into. Codebeamer, as you asked, last year, and particularly in Q4, two out of the 10 largest automotive OEM companies with revenue, two out of them are expanding Codebeamer even in Q4 at pace, and so that's good. Additional three-plus customers that have been using Codebeamer already in deployment have decided to expand that usage. So we're starting to see this element of Codebeamer as it gets deployed in the environment as software engineers are using it as they're seeing how software interacts with the hardware engineers, mechanical engineers, customers are saying, we want more Codebeamer. So we're going to press on that. You're going to see continued emphasis on how Codebeamer, Windchill work even more comprehensively together, which will continue to accelerate the PLM for us that we're starting to see in the market. And then lastly, I know I didn't talk about customers, as I mentioned on the call, but there's a great case study that we're seeing continued indications and customer deployments on with ServiceMax, to your question, around one of the largest manufacturers of cranes in the world has been a large Creo, Windchill customer for almost a few decades. And we've been working on this with the ServiceMax team for the last call it, 12 to 18 months with this customer, with our new release that I mentioned in the summertime around Windchill and ServiceMax connected on trouble tickets being able to flow back into Windchill from ServiceMax. That customer did a very comprehensive proposal and an RFP that looked at all the competitive offerings, and they chose us because of ServiceMax's integration with Windchill and the flow of product data from engineering to service and back, which was the key differentiator for us. So we see continued emphasis there. Momentum continues to build, and we look forward to a good year on both fronts. Yes, great question. I have been spending a lot of time in Europe and rest of world and also here in North America meeting customers, as you mentioned. I think what we're seeing in the dynamic, we saw some of that in Q4. We delivered solid results, as we said, for ARR and really great results on cash flow for Q4. But in terms of having a blowout quarter for Q4 in ARR, we had a few deals in Western Europe, in particular, like we noted, that either pushed out or got smaller in the deal value that we're really pushing on getting done over the course of Q4, which I believe we'll still get in due time over the course of this year. And the dynamic that's happening \u2013 and at the same time, by the way, we won a number of deals that were at the same value that we thought in Western Europe and closed those in Q4. I think what we're working through is particularly within the automotive vertical in Germany, there is obviously a lot of pressure around just the cost structure, the speed in which they're developing cars, the Tier 1 suppliers that supply those folks, all those components of how do you really create competitiveness versus Chinese OEMs. We're seeing a lot of that pressure occur as we've all been reading in the press. I've been sitting in boardrooms with all of these customers. That's the bad news, kind of the highlights of the media reports. I believe that this is forcing our customers that we're serving in this specific vertical in Western Europe to rethink how they're actually operating as a business to remain competitive. And that comes down to, first, Codebeamer, was continue to blow momentum within Western Europe because software now needs to work at the same speed as mechanical hardware, mechatronic systems within these OEMs, that need to have Codebeamer implemented to do that to keep pace with the Chinese development cycle. So I think that's a net positive for us, despite the macro and the issues that the German automakers are dealing with. So that's a positive. On the second piece is on Windchill, they're looking at thinking about PLM, how to move product data faster than their enterprise because they need to stay alive. And so I don't want to get too aggressive on saying it's going to be a wide-open field for us to go execute and win a lot of deals in Western Europe because there is a backdrop of uncertainty. But within the business, there's a lot of urgency and need to change the way they're actually doing business. And our technology underpins that change, so I'm bullish around the requirement, Saket. I'm bullish around the urgency for them to do it. I'm cautious around how they're actually going to spend those dollars over the course of the next couple of years. And we'll see how that goes over the course of this year. We factor that into how we put this range of guidance as well. Yes, great question. I would say that our teams are already underway and getting ready and executing across the plan. And there are several things we're working through around account plans, assignments, all that great stuff that every team needs to do to organize for being able to face the vertical opportunities that exist, and we're working through that. And that's the area that we believe we're not expecting disruption, but we're taking account that some things in other situations to adjust for that if something does happen. But what we won't have is not being ready for the opportunities that we see in the current pipeline. And if somehow or another, business actually changes versus the last two years of the sluggish sales environment, our vertical approach are ready with experience in these verticals at scale with big customers. We're primed to take advantage of incremental demand and being able to continue to be well versed to take advantage of that and not have as much of a lag. So I'm looking forward to if we could get manufacturing and PMIs to tick up, PTC is ready for that. We've been ready for a while, and we're going to be even more ready as we verticalize the business, which we're doing and it's underway. And we're looking forward to how that translates over the course of this year into next. I'll start with the one that's top of everyone's mind across the world. I was in India a couple of weeks ago. It's the same dynamic. Federal, aerospace and defense is just continuing to be an area that is facing significant backlog and demand, and they're trying to move that faster through their business to deliver the products that are being asked from their customers. And so in India, I was in U.K., here in North America spending a lot of time, that segment, I think, is continuing to be an area we're leaning into. We have a lot of experience. We have a lot of credibility there. We're going to continue to do that. I'm going out to Washington, D.C. to make sure we continue to promote this, again, in a vertical marketing perspective already going into that model. We believe there's a lot of really interesting dynamics happening in the federal, aerospace and defense across the world. We're very well positioned there. On med tech and life sciences, we're also seeing an interesting other dynamic where a lot of these companies have gotten very big through a lot of acquisitions, and they're now being forced to really develop products in a faster pace. That requires PLM at the heart of an epicenter of moving product data as fast as possible to manufacturing, and so we're seeing some really interesting trends occurring in med tech and life sciences. We had a couple of really interesting wins that happened in the last couple of quarters of 2024, and we expect that to continue because again, it's a survival and existence of their business to actually put these frameworks and systems together like Windchill, like Codebeamer, like Creo and ServiceMax to be able to deal with the competitive nature of their business. And then, Adam, getting back to your other question. If we talk about the vertical exposure across the major industries, the industrial space is kind of high 20s for us. FA&D is in the \u2013 around 15%. Electronics and high tech, also in that same mid-teens. Automotive, in the kind of low teens. Med tech, in the low teens. And then the other, what we would, I guess, call non-core verticals make up the difference, which is also around kind of 15-ish percent of the business. Yes, great question, Jay. I'll start with the second one. On automotive, I think there's been a massive shift. And our determination and our foothold in that market, I think, is very different than whatever that prior stat was given. And the reason for it is it's predominantly the influx of Windchill and Codebeamer in that group. And this, as you know well, this includes the OEMs and Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3 suppliers. Codebeamer is taking hold on that, and we're just pushing all accelerators. Windchill is also right along for the ride, and you'll see more and more of that come into it versus the design guys, the factory guys, those are there. They're great competitors of ours. We're more focused on helping our customers deal with this entire problem statement of how to build software-defined vehicles at speed to compete against the Chinese. And our tools and our software, Jay, as you know well, is very well placed there. In some cases, by the way, they're looking at Creo. They're looking at other things that we have across the portfolio. But the majority of the strength in that group, and you'll see that continue \u2013 again, it might not happen in a linear fashion, but the ultimate over the medium and long-term will be you will see Windchill and Codebeamer really wrap their arms around that space in an aggressive fashion. That's the strategy and kind of direction that we've got. On your first part of your question on digital thread across verticals, there's not really one that's taken \u2013 I could say, wow, they've really taken on hold. And that's the amazing part of this business, Jay, which is we look at those verticals, and this is my point of we've got a lot of money on the table to go tell them around how Creo, Windchill, Codebeamer work together. And on the aftermarket service side, how does ServiceMax fit into it, across all the other things that we've got. But in those four core areas, we've got a real opportunity with \u2013 in certain segments, already customers using it, but let's promote it across the entire vertical. And that's the area that we're going to keep pressing on. We're going to build product integrations around. We're going to get our messaging consistent around. We're going to do customer reference-ability on. And that's where we think we've got the ability to have a sustainable, low double-digit growth rate in the medium and long-term. That's the goal that we're pushing for and from our perspective. Andrew. Yes. To be fair, we're 24 hours post the election results. So I was with two customers today already. And what I will say is their commentary and their desires are similar to what it was 48 hours ago, which is around how to make sure we are set up to deal with all the complexities of the world, which includes geopolitical uncertainty. But that's only one facet of it. There is supply chain uncertainty. There is workforce disruption uncertainty and retirements, aging. There's complexity of products that consumers are demanding now as we \u2013 again, I'll note the Chinese OEMs. They have opened up the world to saying, let's give the users all this complexity and configuration of products in very different ways. And when you add all that together, what we're hearing from customers, again, 24 hours, but previous to that is we need technology that PTC provides to be relevant to have product data move faster through our organization through highly configured models and variances of their products. That includes software, that includes hardware, that includes electronics and mechanical, so that we could survive. And I think that's going to be, in any scenario, a need that will continue to accelerate regardless of administration and regardless of push in certain geographies versus the others. So that's why we're \u2013 what I said was, we're working through a tectonic shift. I'm utterly convinced around the long-term view of it. The linear nature of this on a quarterly basis, you can pick and choose that number. But this business is moving in these verticals because of the urgency of our customers to survive and to remain competitive. And I think those dynamics are perfectly suited for what PTC has to offer. I think Andrew, if I could say, I think it's everything. I don't think there's going to be, at least in the last 24 hours, less uncertainty. I think it's \u2013 we're going to see how the next couple of quarters play out, and we'll be ready for it. But right now, we're focused, Andrew, on delivering what our customers are needing from us. And depending on the changes in the environment, we'll be ready for it. We have been ready for it through multiple different administrations for 35-plus years, and we were successful as a company. And we're going to deal the same way going forward for the next 35 years. Thank you, everyone, for joining us and for your questions today. Kristian and Matt will be both on the road in the weeks ahead, participating in investor conferences. Kristian will be in New York, mid-November, hosting a Mizuho dinner and attending the RBC conference. Kristian will also be going to London, while I'm in Asia in early December, and we'll be at the NASDAQ Conference. Matt will be at the Wells Fargo, UBS and Barclays conferences on the West Coast in early December. And thank you again, and we really look forward to engaging with you. Thanks."

            "content": "Thanks, Neil, and hello, everyone. Starting off with Slide 7, PTC again delivered solid financial results in terms of both ARR and free cash flow in a continued challenging selling environment. As you know, we believe ARR and free cash flow are the most important metrics to assess the performance of our business. To help investors understand our performance, excluding the impact of foreign exchange volatility, we provide ARR guidance and disclose our ARR results on a constant currency basis. At the end of Q4, our constant currency ARR using our fiscal 2024 plan FX rates was $2.207 billion, up 12% year-over-year. Deferred ARR came in as expected. Moving on to cash flow. In Q4, our free cash flow results were also solid as we resolved the collection timing issues we saw last quarter. For the full-year, our free cash flow was $736 million, up 25%. Over the medium term, we continue to expect our free cash flow to grow faster than our ARR, with our non-GAAP operating expenses expected to grow at roughly half the rate of ARR. A basic tenet of our subscription business model and budgeting process is that there's natural operating leverage we benefit from as our ARR grows. In fiscal 2024, our operating efficiency expanded by 370 basis points to 42% compared to 38% in fiscal 2023. Moving to Slide 8. There are a few key takeaways here. First, as I just mentioned, we expect that our OpEx will grow at approximately half the rate of ARR over time. You can see that on this slide. On the right-hand side, you can see our constant currency ARR CAGR from fiscal 2021 through fiscal 2025 is approximately 15%, and our expected OpEx CAGR is approximately 6%. This is the leverage I was mentioning on the previous slide. While this is a little less than 50%, this is also because we had a couple of acquisitions over this time and there's additional leverage as those get integrated. Point being that while OpEx growing at 50% of ARR growth may not work out exactly that way in any given year, we've been delivering on this and think that it remains a good rule of thumb as you think about modeling our business over the medium term. Secondly, we also talk about our disciplined approach to budgeting and investment decisions, and I think that shows up pretty clearly on this slide as well. While our overall OpEx CAGR is expected to be approximately 6%, it's really more like 4% in SG&A and 11% in R&D. I think this punctuates the point that we've made previously that given the challenging selling environment we've been in for some time, it hasn't really made sense to be investing a lot incrementally into sales and marketing or G&A for that matter. Additionally, we believe there is incremental room for effectiveness within the spend envelope we have today as evidenced by the go-to-market realignment Neil elaborated on earlier. And this brings me to the final point of the slide that I'm trying to emphasize, which is that we are investing in our future growth while delivering solid free cash flow. On the slide, the blue line represents our non-GAAP R&D expense trend. You can see that the slope of the blue line inflected four years ago, following our transition to a subscription model. As our free cash flows expanded, this has enabled us to reinvest greater amounts into R&D to support our customers and drive future growth despite the challenging macro. For over a decade, from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2020, our average non-GAAP R&D expense was approximately $210 million, and our 12-year CAGR was about 2%. In contrast to that, we expect to invest approximately $400 million in non-GAAP R&D this year, and our four-year CAGR from fiscal 2021 through 2025 is expected to be approximately 11%. This evolution of our business is important to understand, and it's great for our customers because it allows us to continue to invest incrementally in our products even during a turbulent macro. Turning to Slide 9. Let's look at our ARR growth in more detail, starting with our product groups. In Q4, we delivered 10% constant currency ARR growth in CAD and 13% in PLM. Our topline growth has shown good resilience despite the environment we've seen over the past couple of years and is supported by our unique portfolio with a solid footprint in higher-growth segments of the market as well as the digital transformation journey of our customers. These underlying strengths are further supported by our subscription model, our low churn rate, and the propensity for our customer base to prioritize their own R&D investments through challenging times. Moving to our ARR by region. Our constant currency organic ARR growth was solid across Americas, Europe and APAC, with growth in the low to mid-double digits. Across all regions, our year-over-year organic constant currency growth rates in Q4 were similar to the growth rates we saw in Q3. Turning to Slide 10. We took on a lot of debt over the past three years, and we've been diligently paying that down. During Q4, we paid down $63 million and ended Q4 with cash and cash equivalents of $266 million and gross debt of $1.753 billion. During fiscal 2024, our gross debt balance decreased by $569 million. We used $694 million, substantially all the free cash flow we generated this year, to pay down our debt, as we said we would. This was partially offset by an increase in gross debt of $125 million in Q1 related to pure variants and the imputed interest for ServiceMax, which we discussed in detail on our Q1 call. We were 1.9x levered at the end of Q4. As you know, our long-term goal, assuming our debt-to-EBITDA ratio is below 3x, remains to return approximately 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases, while also taking into consideration the interest rate environment and strategic opportunities. I'm pretty sure I don't need to do the math for you, but the $2 billion authorization that we now have in place through fiscal 2027 is clearly more than 50% of the free cash flow we expect to generate over that period. This year, as you also all know, we have a $500 million bond that's coming due in February, which we intend to retire at that time with cash on hand and by drawing on our revolving credit facility. And in line with what we've said previously, we intend to buy back approximately $300 million of our common stock in fiscal 2025 commencing this quarter. Also, as you know, we aim to maintain a low cash balance given the consistency and predictability of the business. As such, assuming we have excess cash, we expect to return it to shareholders. And the authorization we now have in place gives us a lot of flexibility in how we do that. Our fully diluted share count in fiscal 2024 was 121 million, and we currently expect fully diluted shares to be approximately flat in fiscal 2025. Moving to Slide 11. Before I take you through our guidance, let me walk you through how we guide and report ARR. As I said earlier, we believe constant currency ARR is the best way to evaluate the topline performance of our business because it removes FX fluctuations from the analysis, positive or negative. If you take a look at Slide 24 in our appendix, you'll see the extent to which FX volatility impacted as reported ARR over the past eight quarters. For fiscal 2024, we provided constant currency ARR guidance and reported constant currency ARR results for all periods using our fiscal 2024 plan FX rates, which were as of September 30, 2023. We also recast historical constant currency ARR amounts back to fiscal 2019 at those fiscal 2024 plan FX rates for comparative purposes. For fiscal 2025, we are taking the exact same approach. We set our constant currency ARR guidance, and we'll report constant currency ARR results for all periods using our fiscal 2025 plan FX rates, which are as of September 30, 2024. We also recast historical constant currency ARR amounts back to fiscal 2019 at our fiscal 2025 plan FX rates for comparative purposes. You can find the recast historicals in the financial data tables for Q4 2024 that are posted on our IR website. And on this slide, you can see the recast constant currency ARR amounts for the past eight quarters. With that, I'll take you through our guidance on Slide 12. All of the ARR amounts on this slide are based on our fiscal 2025 plan FX rates. For constant currency ARR, we expect growth of 9% to 10% for fiscal 2025 and approximately 10.5% for Q1. I'll get into more detail on constant currency ARR on the next two slides. On cash flows, we are guiding for free cash flow of $835 million to $850 million in fiscal 2025, which absorbs the approximately $20 million of outflows for severance and consulting fees related to our go-to-market realignment. Given that the amount is relatively small, we are not calling out any restructuring charge, so all of this will flow through the sales and marketing and COGS lines on our P&L. And reiterating what Neil said earlier, we expect to be reinvesting the run rate expense back into the go-to-market organization throughout the year. In fiscal 2025, we expect similar invoicing seasonality compared to the previous four years. Based on this and our expected cash outflows, we expect approximately 55% or more of our free cash flow to be generated in the first half of the year and for fiscal Q4 to be our lowest cash generation quarter. Note that our cash flow guidance is not on a constant currency basis, so FX fluctuations and interest rate changes can have an impact in either direction. For Q1, we are guiding for free cash flow of approximately $230 million, which absorbs approximately $12 million of the $20 million of total outflows related to the go-to-market realignment. The remainder of the payments will be spread out throughout the rest of the year. We have a high degree of confidence in our guidance for free cash flow due to the predictability of our cash collections and the disciplined budgeting structure we have in place. Importantly, we've maintained consistent billing practices over time. We primarily bill our customers annually upfront one-year at a time, regardless of the contract term length. So our free cash flow results over time are comparable. Furthermore, over the past five years, we've optimized our internal budgeting process. It starts with having a subscription business model that generates predictable cash inflows, and then we start each fiscal year by funding our business for growth at the low end of our internal ARR expectations. And as we progress through the year, we maintain or increase the level of funding based on the growth dynamics we are seeing. By proceeding in this manner, we are able to match our investments to the market environment in an agile way, while also delivering predictable free cash flow. To help you with your models, we are also providing revenue and EPS guidance. However, I'd like to reiterate my favorite reminder, ASC 606 makes revenue and EPS difficult to predict for PTC since we sell primarily on-premises subscriptions. And the way that revenue is recognized from these contracts can vary significantly based on variables that aren't necessarily relevant to the performance of the business. I did a teach-in on this subject on our Q4 fiscal 2022 call that you may want to refer to if you are new to PTC. The summary is we believe ARR and free cash flow, rather than revenue and operating income, are the best metrics to assess the performance of our business. Moving on to Slide 13. Here is an illustrative constant currency ARR model for fiscal 2025. You can see our results over the past three years, and the column on the right illustrates what's needed to get to our constant currency ARR guidance for fiscal 2025. Note that all amounts on this slide are using our FY 2025 plan FX rates. The illustrative model indicates that to hit 9.5% ARR growth, we need to add $214 million of net new ARR this year. Our fiscal 2025 guidance range assumes that we will add approximately $20 million less net new ARR in fiscal 2025 compared to 2024 and approximately $5 million less than in fiscal 2023 and 2022. It's worth noting that on an annual basis, our opening deferred ARR for the year is expected to be in line with to slightly better than what we've seen over the last three years when normalizing for the $10 million incremental we had in fiscal 2024. Additionally, our churn remains low and we expect our churn rate in fiscal 2025 to be in line with to slightly better than the improving churn rates we've had in the past three years. Our business model is resilient, and while the selling environment remains challenging, we believe that because of these dynamics and allowing for potential near-term disruption due to our go-to-market realignment that 9% to 10% ARR growth is the right target for fiscal 2025. Next, on Slide 14, here's a similar illustrative model for Q1. As you know, based on our results over the past few years, our net new ARR can be somewhat volatile in any given quarter, given dynamics such as new or renewal bookings, seasonality, timing of deferred ARR siting how much of our new bookings in any given quarter starts in the quarter, how much churn we expect in any given quarter, et cetera. We've clearly seen quarterly volatility in our results over the past few years and we expect to see some of these dynamics in Q1. This slide shows our sequential net new ARR over the past couple of years, and the column on the right illustrates that we need $20 million of sequential net new ARR growth to hit 10.5% growth in Q1. Obviously, it's impossible to predict any given quarter with that level of precision. However, I'm sure you'll note that this is below the sequential net new ARR for Q1 that we've had over the past couple of years. And as such, I think there are two factors worth noting, both timing related. First is the linearity of deferred ARR; and secondly, the mechanics of a couple of contracts that will show up as churn in Q1, but are contracted to come back into ARR later this fiscal year. Together, these two factors are expected to adversely impact our Q1 sequential net new ARR by approximately $10 million but will not have an impact on fiscal 2025. Also, we need to be mindful of any potential disruption from the go-to-market changes we're making. Importantly, we continue to keep our focus on the full-year as this is how we make incremental investment decisions over the course of the year. With all that said, we think it's worth emphasizing that after normalizing for the approximate $10 million timing impact I just called out, our Q1 sequential ARR will be in the same ballpark as the past couple of years. Turning to Slide 15. I know that most of you model free cash flow using the indirect method, which uses the P&L and balance sheet as a starting point. However, given the complexities related to ASC 606, there are inherent challenges in using the indirect method to forecast free cash flow for PTC. The model on this slide is based on what we use internally. I know that looking at it this way, may be unfamiliar to some of you, so please feel free to reach out if we can be of help. Starting at the top, for fiscal 2025 we're using 9.5% ARR growth, the midpoint of our constant currency guidance range. Next, our perpetual revenue is primarily related to our Kepware business, which is moving to subscription over time. And the primary reason that our professional services revenue is modeled to decline in fiscal 2025 is because a portion of it is transitioning to DxP over time. These three line items get us to our expected cash generation for the year, assuming no significant fluctuations in FX rates. Moving down to the cost sections. I'd like to highlight that the approximately $20 million of cash outflows related to our go-to-market realignment are embedded in the cost of revenue and operating expenses line. Even as we reinvest in the business and realign the go-to-market organization in 2025, we continue to see expansion of our operating efficiency metric due to our recurring subscription model combined with our budgeting process. Continuing to move down the model, we provide guidance assumptions for stock comp, amortization, CapEx, cash interest payments and cash tax payments. You can find these on Slide 19 of the earnings deck and also on Pages 3 and 4 of the press release. Note that the cash interest payments are expected to be approximately $90 million in fiscal 2025, significantly lower than in fiscal 2024, driven by \u2013 primarily by a decrease in debt. Also cash tax payments are expected to be $110 million in fiscal 2025, significantly higher than in fiscal 2024, reflecting higher taxable income, the utilization of our deferred tax assets and the impact of Internal Revenue Code Section 174. And finally, let's take a look at the other category. In fiscal 2024, the $82 million was primarily related to FX movements and working capital. For fiscal 2025, the main drivers of the $99 million being modeled here are FX rates, which have already moved significantly since September 30, 2024 as well as working capital to support continued growth. In this simplified illustrative model, the impact of FX fluctuations are captured on a net basis in the other line. In reality, FX fluctuations that are net positive for free cash flow result in higher cash generation and cash disbursements and FX fluctuations that are negative for free cash flow result in lower cash generation and cash disbursements. All of this sums up to our expected free cash flow of approximately $843 million, which is the midpoint of our fiscal 2025 free cash flow guidance range. So in conclusion, PTC has a strong portfolio and strategy, a track record of operational discipline and clear value creation opportunities. We're focused on what matters most for our customers, and we're aligning our operations accordingly so that we can scale our business in a consistent manner. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to the operator for today's Q&A session. I think you just did. Yes. I think it's the latter, Jason. I think it's just conservatism around potential impact of the go-to-market realignment."

During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Shimao, PTC's Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMatt Shimao: Good afternoon. Thank you, Adam, and welcome to PTC's fiscal 2024 third quarter conference call. On the call today are Neil Barua, Chief Executive Officer, and Kristian Talvitie, Chief Financial Officer. Today's conference call is being broadcast live through an audio webcast and a replay of the call will be available later today at www.ptc.com. During this call, PTC will make forward-looking statements, including guidance as to future operating results. Because such statements deal with future events, actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements can be found in PTC's annual report on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and other filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as in today's press release. The forward-looking statements, including guidance provided during this call, are valid only as of today's date, July 31, 2024, and PTC assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. During the call, PTC will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in today's press release made available on our website. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to PTC's Chief Executive Officer, Neil Barua.\nNeil Barua: Thanks, Matt. In Q3, we again delivered solid constant currency ARR growth, up 12% year-over-year, demonstrating that our portfolio products is resonating with customers. Our Q3 free cash flow growth was also solid, rising 29% year-over-year. Kristian will take you through our quarterly results and forward-looking guidance in detail. Before we get into more detail, I want to recognize Mike DiTullio, who will transition out of the President and Chief Operating Officer roles at the end of the fiscal year and continue as an advisor to me into 2025. Mike's part in PTC success has been profound over his tenure of more than 25 years. We certainly wouldn't be the company we are today without him. In addition, he's been a great partner to me as I've stepped into the CEO role. We've been discussing his future plans and we both agree that it's the right time to start this transition process. When we start fiscal 2025, we'll no longer have the COO position within our leadership structure. At this stage of my CEO tenure, my approach is to be close to the business and be more directly involved with operations and execution, especially for our key priorities. Accordingly, I will be assuming many of Mike's responsibilities. Additionally, I'd like to reiterate what I said on last quarter's call, which is that I'm turning over lots of stones and looking at everything in this company in order to usher in a new phase of focus and effectiveness across the entire company. To that end, while Mike's change was externally visible because we filed an 8-K, there are numerous other changes that we have already made and are making across many different areas of the organization. This is an ongoing process that we're doing with the intent of driving more effectiveness in the pursuit of our incredible growth potential. Let's move down to slide 4, which highlights our product portfolio and strategy. As a reminder, our five focus areas are, one, PLM, which is driven primarily by our Windchill product; two, ALM, which is driven by our Codebeamer product; three, SLM, which is primarily driven by ServiceMax; four, CAD, which is driven primarily by Creo; and five, our continued focus on SaaS. These are the areas where we can create the greatest customer value and are the areas where we are focusing our resources and attention. At the most basic level, our customers need to introduce new products at a faster pace and with higher quality. It is not unusual to hear from customers that they need to shorten their new product introduction timelines in half. That's not possible without digital transformation across their workflows, which is exactly what our products enable. It's also worth highlighting that we are bringing our suite of software offerings together to help product companies improve their competitiveness. Given the unique breadth and openness of our portfolio, we can enable end-to-end digital threat initiatives, which leverage a connected flow of product data across design, manufacturing, service, and ultimately reuse. A digital thread enables product companies to break down silos, streamline workflows, and achieve interoperability across departments, functions, and systems, a single version of truth. It also secures the quality, consistency, and traceability of product-related data, ensuring that the data is up-to-date, accessible, reliable, and actionable. With a digital thread, the right data is delivered to the right people at the right time and in the right context across the value chain. The demand drivers for our core offerings are strong and our differentiated capabilities to drive digital thread initiatives are increasingly important to our customers. There is so much we can do to help our customers drive better business outcomes. To unlock this potential, I have started to focus on our operations, taking a fresh look at ways to continue driving improvements. On last quarter's call, we discussed rebalancing some R&D resources away from creating new standalone IoT and augmented reality applications to instead support growth of our core products. That was just the first step, putting in place an organizational design that enables us to scale more programmatically will set us up for continued success in the future. We are now primarily turning our attention to optimizing our go-to-market and G&A activities. As I mentioned upfront, we've leaned out the go-to-market management structure, so there are less layers between me and our customers. At this point, we are moving forward without the chief operating officer and chief revenue officer roles, and I will be working directly with our Head of Sales and Head of Customer Success. We are actively looking at every facet of our business to continue driving alignment and effectiveness across our entire company. It is about focusing on customer value and getting more effective with each dollar we spend to support them and capture that demand. The opportunities to achieve this are significant here at PTC. We are in the early innings of doing this work and we expect the heavy lifting to continue in fiscal 2025. I'd like to turn now to discuss three of our focus areas to illustrate the significant value we bring to customers. This quarter, I'll touch on what we have been seeing with customers of our Windchill PLM, Codebeamer ALM, and ServiceMax SLM products. Starting with PLM on slide 5, this is product lifecycle management, and Windchill is our flagship PLM product. PLM systems tend to be really sticky and are mission critical for our customers. This is software that historically had the function of helping CAD engineers keep track of their CAD files. Now PLM is at the epicenter of digital transformation initiatives at product companies. As I explained last quarter, product companies are increasingly focused on compressing the time it takes to get new products to market. And at the same time, their products continue to get much more complex, both to design and produce. The complexity becomes untenable. Quality and time to market gets impacted. Sooner or later, it becomes very clear that having an advanced PLM system is a strategic necessity. In general, manufacturing companies have a long way to go in terms of their digital transformation journeys. And when a product company gets really serious about optimizing and automating their design and manufacturing processes, we tend to see large PLM expansion projects and step function increases in ARR as customers expand their Windchill deployments in terms of both seats and functionality. A good example of this is our Q3 win at a supplier to the automotive industry that specializes in cabling and wiring harness solutions. Given the rise of software-defined vehicles and the importance of electronic wiring systems, the role of this company in the automotive supply chain has grown. It's interesting that this company already appreciated the value of leveraging their PLM system beyond engineering to drive better business outcomes. They are using Windchill within R&D, but they're currently using homegrown tools to drive collaboration across their engineering, supply chain, manufacturing, and quality assurance teams. Over time, maintaining their homegrown system became unsustainable from both a complexity and cost standpoint. They found it compelling that extending Windchill beyond engineering is easy to implement and provides quick time to value, and they decided to standardize on their Windchill system as their backbone for enterprise-wide collaboration around their product data. Turning to slide 6, the second customer example for today is a medical equipment customer that has been using our Creo CAD and Windchill PLM products for years now. What's interesting is that this customer wants to unlock value by going with the digital thread approach I highlighted a few minutes ago. Our Codebeamer ALM product helped to complete their digital thread vision. After being a Codebeamer customer for about a year testing out the product, they decided they were all in and ready to move forward with their digital thread initiative, and in Q3, they signed a deal with us that will expand their ARR by 190%. As a reminder, ALM, or Application Lifecycle Management, helps engineers keep track of product requirements and tests to ensure that all requirements are met. This traceability is very important in safety-critical and regulated industries, including the automotive and medical equipment markets, and is growing in importance across other industries because of the trend towards software-driven products of all types. Products now contain more embedded software than ever, and for many products, there's been an explosion in the number of unique software configurations that need to be developed and updated over time. Codebeamer is a next-gen platform that enables industrial companies to manage this increasing level of complexity. Codebeamer is differentiated from legacy ALM offerings in two key ways. First, Codebeamer has industry-leading traceability capabilities, and second, Codebeamer also helps with time to market by supporting Agile development processes. Consider, for example, what happens when a company has a product in the field that fails? Regulators immediately want to understand which version of the software that product had, and might even demand that more stringent new requirements be placed on new products the company makes. Codebeamer is becoming the solution of choice to deal with this new reality. Codebeamer is a big part of completing the digital thread vision for this customer because software plays such a critical role in their new product innovations. Before having Codebeamer, they face challenges managing their high volume of software requirements, which led to unnecessary delays in getting new products to market as well as exposure to risk. As a medical equipment company, software innovation and regulatory traceability are front and center for this customer and the value Codebeamer brought to them gave them the confidence to rely on PTC in a more holistic way. They are expanding their Windchill and Codebeamer deployments and will use Windchill as the foundation for their digital thread. The digital thread is becoming increasingly strategic to customers across many industries as product companies see the potential to improve their competitiveness by managing the complete lifecycle of their products in a more integrated manner. What is most important to thread together can be different for different customers. But having visibility to a more complete picture and being able to gain actionable insights through a digital thread of product data is becoming table stakes as the competitive environment continues to intensify across many industries. Turning to the third customer example for today, which is a ServiceMax SLM win on slide 7. SLM is Service Lifecycle Management and one of our main products here is ServiceMax, the industry leader in field service management for high value, long lifecycle products. In Q3, we landed a new PTC customer because of ServiceMax. This customer engineers, manufacturers and services industrial and electrical power systems around the world and they like that ServiceMax has become part of PTC. The drivers behind this win were similar in many ways to the elevator company when we highlighted on last quarter's call. The point is that many product companies are not only focused on managing complexity and accelerating time to market, they are also looking for new sources of top line and bottom line growth. In this example, the customer had a CEO led initiative to better leverage their install base to grow aftermarket revenue in a repeatable and cost-effective manner. Because of organizational silos, the customer currently has fragmented service business operation, which impacts their field service productivity and customer service. They struggle to compete with smaller local vendors for aftermarket contracts to service their own products. The customer made the strategic decision that it was time to transform their service operations and they selected ServiceMax. The ServiceMax system will be their software foundation and single source of truth for their aftermarket services and customer service initiatives. Before going out into the field, the ServiceMax application will help their service technicians understand everything they need to know about the specific product that needs servicing, so that they can bring the right parts with them. The ServiceMax application will also schedule and route the field technicians efficiently and guide the field technicians through complex procedures. As typical of ServiceMax deals, the selection process was very thorough and ServiceMax came on top based on product capabilities they're aligned with the priorities of the customer to drive more proactive customer service, improve visibility into their install base of products, drive higher aftermarket attach rates and improve field technician utilization. Lastly, we also remain encouraged by our other focus areas that they didn't provide examples for this quarter, which are CAD and SaaS. We have been reinvesting in our business, consistently growing our annual R&D investment footprint to provide greater value to our customers. In Q3, we made incremental progress in each of our five focus areas towards executing in a scalable fashion and focusing our investments on the product advancements that customers care the most about. As I emphasized earlier, you should expect to see a continued focus on aligning all our resources across all operational functions in this company behind our five focus areas. This is foundational work and we will be disciplined about seeing it through. It will take time and progress may not be linear, but we will leave no stone unturned, as I said, as we focus on scaling our business and further improving the consistency of our execution With that, I'll hand the call over to Kristian to take you through our Q3 financial results and future guidance.\nKristian Talvitie : Thank you, Neil. And hello, everyone. Starting off with slide 9, PTC again delivered solid financial results in terms of both ARR and free cash flow in a continued challenging selling environment. As you know, we believe ARR and free cash flow are the most important metrics to assess the performance of our business. To help investors understand our business performance, excluding the impact of foreign exchange volatility, we provide ARR guidance and disclose our ARR results on a constant currency basis. At the end of Q3, our constant currency ARR was $2.125 billion, up 12% year-over-year and within our guidance range. Our free cash flow results were also solid, up 29% year-over-year, while at the same time continuing to invest in our key focus areas. However, we came in a bit below our guidance of approximately $220 million due to timing. We have a high degree of confidence in our cash flow guidance and targets due to the predictability of our cash collections and the disciplined resource allocation structure we have in place. With the timing issues resolved, we continue to expect free cash flow of $725 million in fiscal 2024 million and continue to be confident that our business model positions us to deliver solid, predictable results. Turning to slide 10, let's look at our ARR growth in more detail. Starting with our product groups, in Q3, we delivered 10% constant currency ARR growth in CAD and 13% growth in PLM. Despite the overall demand environment, which has been sluggish for a couple of years now, our top line has shown good resilience. Our solid ARR growth is supported by our unique portfolio with a solid footprint in high growth segments of the market and the digital transformation journeys of our customers. These underlying strengths are further supported by our subscription model, our low churn rate and the propensity for our customer base to prioritize their own R&D investments through challenging times. Moving to our ARR by region, our constant currency organic ARR growth was solid across the Americas, Europe and APAC, with growth in the low to mid-double-digits. Across all regions, our year-over-year organic constant currency growth rates in Q3 were similar to the growth rates we saw in Q2. Moving to slide 11. First of all, given the consistency and predictability of our free cash flow, we aim to maintain a low cash balance. As you know, our long term goal, assuming our debt to EBITDA ratio is below 3 times, remains to return approximately 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases while also taking into consideration the interest rate environment and strategic opportunities. Given the strategic acquisitions, namely ServiceMax and Codebeamer that we've done over the past couple of years and the debt we took on to fund them, we've paused our share repurchase program. As we said before, we intend to use substantially all of our free cash flow to pay down our debt in fiscal 2024. And as we've been saying, we'll revisit the prioritization of paydown and share repurchases when we get to fiscal 2025. We were 2.2 times levered at the end of Q3. During the quarter, we paid down our debt by $195 million and ended Q3 with cash and cash equivalents of $248 million and gross debt of $1.8 billion. We continue to expect that we'll end fiscal 2024 with gross debt of approximately $1.7 billion. Lastly, we expect fully diluted shares are approximately 121 million in fiscal 2024, up by approximately 1.5 million shares year-over-year. With that, I'll take you through our guidance on slide 12. Reflecting our year-to-date performance and our outlook for Q4, we're updating our fiscal 2024 constant currency ARR guidance, lowering the high end of the range by $20 million and now expect to end the year with constant currency ARR growth of 11% to 12%. It's worth noting we're updating our revenue guidance accordingly, reducing the high end by $20 million. We're reiterating our free cash flow guidance of approximately $725 million in fiscal 2024, given our year-to-date performance and Q4 outlook. For Q4, we're guiding for free cash flow of approximately $83 million and constant currency ARR of $2.2 billion to $2.22 billion, which corresponds to year-over-year growth of 11% to 12%. We believe we've set our guidance appropriately. I'll get a little more into ARR guidance details on the next slide. But before I do, I'd also like to reiterate my favorite reminder. To help you with your models, we're providing revenue and EPS guidance, but ASC 606 makes revenue and EPS difficult to predict for PTC since we primarily sell on-premises subscriptions. And the way revenue is recognized from these contracts can vary significantly based on variables that aren't necessarily relevant to the performance of the business. I did a teach-in on this subject on our Q4 2022 call that you may want to refer to if you are new to PTC. The summary is we believe ARR and free cash flow, rather than revenue and operating income, are the best metrics to assess the performance of our business. Importantly, we've maintained consistent billing practices over time. We primarily bill our customers annually upfront one year at a time regardless of contract term lengths, so our free cash flow results over time are comparable. Moving to slide 13, here's an illustrative constant currency ARR model for Q4. You can see our results over the past 11 quarters and the column on the far right illustrates what is needed to get to the midpoint of our constant currency ARR guidance. The illustrative model indicates that, to hit the midpoint of our Q4 guidance range, we need $85 million of sequential net new ARR growth. This is approximately $10 million more than we added in Q4 of the previous two fiscal years. And this year, we expect to benefit from Codebeamer cross-selling ServiceMax with an aligned and enabled sales force and approximately $5 million more deferred ARR than we had in Q4 of fiscal 2023. We think our guidance range for Q4 and the full year balance both risk and opportunity. And looking out a little further ahead to our fiscal 2025. And here, keep in mind that we're still in the middle of our detailed planning process. But I would not be surprised if our official fiscal 2025 guidance, when we give it next quarter, was in the low double-digit ARR growth range, consistent with our medium-term targets and in line with our performance over the past couple of years. Again, balancing both risk and opportunity. I also anticipate our free cash flow guidance would be somewhere within the $825 million to $875 million dollar range we previously communicated. Additionally, as we think about capital allocation, I think you will see us resume share repurchases in fiscal 2025 in and around the $300 million level as we balance debt pay down with returning capital to shareholders. Obviously, we'll provide our official guidance on next quarter's call, but we just wanted to provide some directional thinking that we feel pretty comfortable with, given the recurring nature of our business model and the budgeting process we have in place. In conclusion, PTC has a strong portfolio, solid strategy, and a great team of people with deep expertise and strong customer relationships. We're focused on disciplined and consistent execution to ensure we deliver on the value creation opportunities we have ahead of us. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And with that, our first question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho.\nSiti Panigrahi: Neil, I want to ask about the demand environment. How has that changed over the past quarter? Has it gotten worse or still the same? And when you look at the environment turning around, what do you need to see on the macro data or which leading indicator you'd look at before you start feeling more confident about things turning around?\nNeil Barua: On the first question, in Q3, we saw very small puts and takes across all geographic regions and verticals. Absolutely no discernible change in any trend there. As we've been saying very consistently, the demand environment in Q3 was consistent with what we've seen over the past couple of years. Good thing, by the way, is our pipeline going to Q4 is strong. In terms of what I'm looking for, what Kristian and I are looking for in terms of areas where we would feel the environment's getting better, is how we think about close rates. And consistently, for the past few years, close rates have been difficult and challenged. Once those close rates on a growing pipeline become better, it is my indication of when the environment is better for PTC in terms of securing the deals in a more accelerated manner. But I absolutely feel good about the demand. In fact, our sequential growth and pipeline is increasing, and so we're focusing on closing deals and how they actually attribute to in-quarter ARR.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke with Citi.\nTyler Radke: I guess on the demand environment, understandably it's choppy out there. We heard from Microsoft yesterday talking about EMEA weakness. But could you just talk about the trends that you saw play out throughout the quarter? And I know that you're making some go-to-market tweaks as well with taking on more of the customer work, Neil. But how much of this do you think is kind of execution versus macro? And what are you kind of assuming on the environment here in Q4?\nNeil Barua: First of all, I'm actually pleased with the performance that we delivered in Q3. In terms of over the course of the quarter, again, very small puts and takes of any change in trend across geos and verticals. I think we've been focusing and executing quite well in this challenging environment. And again, to be clear, no real change in terms of what we're seeing in terms of customer behavior. And again, maybe different than others on other calls, but I've been very consistent around the environment has been challenged. Even post Q2, we mentioned its challenged and it remains as such because of this point around close rates. And going into Q4, the way in which we're thinking about this is, and I'll take the piece around guidance, the update to the high end of our guidance takes into account how the deals we landed in Q3 will show up in Q4 ARR. It also factors in the close rates we expect in Q4 based on the further maturation of deals in our pipeline. In our view, how those will impact Q4 in-quarter ARR. So that guidance range we feel is appropriate, balancing up the risks and opportunity from what we see from now to the end of the quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink with Baird.\nJoe Vruwink: Neil, maybe you can expand a bit on what you've observed at PTC and also maybe feedback from customers where ultimately operating a flat org structure and taking on the roles and responsibilities you outlined at the start where that makes the most sense and you see an opportunity to actually move results forward.\nNeil Barua: A consistent theme from my prior calls around where are we putting wood behind which arrows and that is driven by our belief around where we could drive the most customer value and where we have the highest right to win. And so, that's how we set forward the five priorities of the company that I've been consistently talking about for the last couple of quarters. We did some repositioning of product and R&D capabilities in IoT ARR back to core products to reinforce those priorities to deliver a better outcome of those priorities over the next number of years. The same is happening now across all these other functions. In particular now, the focus is around the go-to-market function, by which it's not around efficiency. It is around are we using every person we have in this company effectively towards those five priorities. And so, we're working through making sure whoever is targeting PLM expansion capabilities is adequately enabled, is adequately incented, is structured in our go-to-market model by which they can be successful that delivers value to the customer and returns to the company. And so, that's what we're working through. And the other stones that we're kind of working through is because we've set these priorities very clearly, we're all really energized by these priorities because we're seeing, to your question, a lot of customer demand and pull from it. We're looking at anything we're spending money in that can be better utilized using that same dollar on things that could accelerate those priorities, whether it be greater R&D capabilities, which we've been doing it, whether it be making sure we position the rest of your organization to serve those customers towards those five priorities. So that's how we're looking at it currently. And again, much work to do, early innings and heavy lifting will continue into 2025.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Tusa with J.P. Morgan.\nStephen Tusa: Obviously, a lot of different cross currents here in the macro, whether it's the kind of budget questions around AI and things like that. Obviously, your key competitor had quite a significant miss. They talked about geopolitics a bit. I guess you guys aren't seeing that. Can you just remind us of maybe how you differ from Dassault [ph] and maybe what makes your model a bit more resilient perhaps? And are you seeing kind of geopolitical issues? Or when you talk about the macro, is it something just a bit more, I guess, financially or business related to customers being a bit more cautious on budgets like we've been hearing for the last year-and-a-half, two years?\nNeil Barua: Look, from a PTC standpoint, again, I just want to keep reiterating this. We did not see any discernible change in trend amongst geographies and verticals. Whatever our competitor mentioned, we didn't really see that same dynamic happen in that vertical at PTC. I'm not sure what we're doing different than them, in particular, but we didn't see that dynamic play out here. Partly, we've been very consistent around making sure everyone's clear in the way we're actually operating is within a challenging sales environment. And we've been seeing that and not getting ahead of our skis thinking it's going to change, but being operating under that environment. And I think that discipline with a great product portfolio, I think, is differentiated across the industry with a movement towards building the business towards these five priorities that is more consistent to create the execution. Kristian called, is why I believe we're continuing to deliver the types of results we are and why Kristian and I are looking at Q4 and making sure with this growing pipeline, we continue to make sure we deliver on the commitments that we're making and drive customer value.\nStephen Tusa: I guess just a follow-up, great answer first of all, but just the follow-up. Looking at next year, obviously, you guys have pretty high confidence in, I guess, giving us a framework for next year in this environment. What kind of environment are we talking about to get below the double digit range in ARR? Secondarily, how close are you guys to having the playbook ready to respond on the cash side? Like you said, you would be able to in that environment. I don't think we're going to that type of scenario, but it seems like your model is very defensive from this perspective. It would take a lot to drive you to that point. Just curious what the mindset is around defending the cash at this stage.\nNeil Barua: You want to start, Kristian?\nKristian Talvitie: Again, I don't think we really want to get into the nitty gritty details of the guidance for next year. As I said, we're still working through the detailed planning process. That said, I think that we've seen our \u2013 we'll call it budgeting process, play out here this year. As we've articulated, we start the year with a range of expected outcomes on the top line. We start the year with a spend run rate. And as we progress through the year, as we get more comfortable, we release more incremental funding into the system. So that's how we try to gauge it and we would continue to try to do that and we're frankly doing it right now already in preparation for next year and that's how we're thinking about it. So we're really talking about modulating incremental expense into next year and hopefully not putting ourselves in a situation where we've got to actually pare back expense. I think we feel pretty comfortable about it.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Borg with Stifel.\nAdam Borg: Neil, maybe for you, it's great to hear the continued kind of turning over all the stones as you take a fresh look at the entire organization. As we think about go-to-market and potential changes there, how do we think about the potential risk of disruptions from those changes in the near term and how is that contemplated in guidance?\nNeil Barua: One of the benefits of having been here now 18 months, maybe a little bit longer, is I've had the time to process, be part of the organization, to think through and observe. I'm part of a number of customer conversations, etc. I've had a great transition process with Mike DiTullio, as I mentioned, and I feel confident that my thoughtfulness, our thoughtfulness around what to change from position of strength, not a position of weakness, is actually a very exciting thing for many people here at PTC to make sure we're enabling them to be as successful as they can across these five priorities. So I actually believe that the work we're doing fundamentally is going to be a huge value to a lot of people here at PTC to unleash even greater work that they've been doing. And so, to that end, these are going to be very intentional moves. I've done it a number of times in my career and it's to drive more effectiveness and I feel really good about our ability to manage through these changes.\nAdam Borg: Maybe just a quick housekeeping for Kristian. I know we lowered the top end of the ARR range by $20 million and I apologize if I missed it. I think last quarter it was lowered due to some ARR contracts being renegotiated, more deferred ARR. Is that what we're talking about here or is there something different? And I apologize if I missed it.\nKristian Talvitie: No, there were no other changes to the deferred ARR, like we talked about last quarter. This was simply reflecting \u2013 this is I think what Neil was saying earlier, reflecting how our Q3 results came in and the composition of those deals and how they roll into ARR in Q3 and Q4 and beyond and the outlook to the best of our ability for Q4 as well, given the deals that are in play and the pipeline and expectations around what the composition of those deals is going to look like as they materialize into ARR.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Tilton with Wolfe Research.\nJoshua Tilton: I actually kind of want to follow up on that last question. I want to ask a little differently. Kristian, I always appreciate your cabin teach-ins. And one of the things you emphasize is kind of the relationship between ARR and free cash flow. And I guess if I look, free cash flow missed by $10 million in the quarter and you're also lowering the midpoint to the full year ARR number by $10 million as well. Kind of implies that there was a $10 million dollar deal or $10 million of ARR that should have landed this quarter and is no longer in the guidance. I guess, is that the right read? And if so, is that because the deal is going to close in later periods or is this just you guys being prudent? Any color there would be great.\nKristian Talvitie: It's a great question, Josh. No, and that actually is not the case at all. On free cash flow is actually simply timing. Just being completely candid, we had a bunch of collections that were due in the last two days of the quarter. The last two days of the quarter happened to be a Saturday and Sunday. We were hopeful that we were going to get that cash in on Friday or before, but obviously customers have a contractual right to actually pay it the following week. And so, that's what happened on the cash flow. We were hopeful that we were going to get it on the week before. We've now got that cash, so hence there's no change to the cash flow forecast for the year. That's the timing issue.\nJoshua Tilton: And just to confirm also, more of a clarification, I think heading into the second half, you guys still had $10 million more in deferred ARR in the balance this year versus last year. Is all $10 million of that remaining? Some of that recognized this quarter. Can you just help us understand that?\nKristian Talvitie: Yeah, it was about half of it in last quarter and half of it this quarter. Sorry, I'll be more precise. Half of it in Q3 and about half of it in Q4.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia with Barclays.\nSaket Kalia: Neil, maybe for you, it feels like close rates is one of, if not maybe the major reason here for just the revised ARR guide. And so, the question is, can we maybe talk about that metric anecdotally, of course, for ServiceMax and Codebeamer cross-sell? I know the team really enabled PTC sellers to go after those opportunities this year. How has that sort of trended and kind of how are you feeling about those businesses when you think about kind of close rates?\nNeil Barua: Let me make a piece of this clear around close rates. Our assumption going into Q4 about close rates and looking at a deal by deal match ratio of the pipeline is no different than our view of close rates that have been evident for the most part in general for the last few years. The dynamic of what we're doing on Q4 right now in terms of guidance, how we think about it is we now know what happened in Q3. We now know the composition, meaning how the deals that we closed in Q3 are going to actually go into ARR, whether they all came into Q3 or whether part of it goes into Q4 ARR or part of it goes into the next subsequent years. So now we have that data point. We have now made the assessment around all the deals that are maturing in the pipeline and the close rates is consistent with what we've seen prior quarters and years. So it's continued challenge on the close rate, not worse, not better. And we've made assumptions around how that ARR when it closes actually comes into ARR. And that's the area where the precision is difficult for the company, given is it going to be a deal that ramps over time? Is it all going to come into one quarter? And looking at all those factors, we determined the guidance range that we put with the risk and opportunities balance. In terms of PTC and ServiceMax, Saket, what I will say anecdotally is we are continuing to be pleased, excited about the buildup in momentum of Codebeamer and the interest and reception we're getting from the market, the reception that we're getting from customers that are testing out like the example that I gave to you that are thinking about broadening the expansion of the utilization across the company in Codebeamer. And on ServiceMax, the business is starting to work in terms of continued buildup of really good pipeline as well as close that happened for the last year-to-date through Q3 and quite a lot of very interesting deals that we're assuming will close in Q4 to allow for a really strong jump off into next year that we will make sure we continue. So on both fronts, all systems go and we're very pleased so far with the momentum. We still have to close and continue that momentum sustained over the next number of years.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Celino with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nJason Celino: How are you baking in \u2013 well, let me rephrase, your customers' decision-making, whether it's close rates or pipeline or whether they want to expand, how are they baking in the US election into that process? You serve some industries like automotive and aerospace and defense that are sensitive to that. And then how are you baking that into the guidance framework, if at all?\nNeil Barua: It's the first time in my career where I've been spending so much time with executives and customers across the world, and they ask me who's going to win the election in the US. It's a consistent and quite a confusing time for everyone around what happens in the US. That being said, I think for the most part, customers are understanding that whoever gets put in the office, a lot of things don't dramatically change depending on the composition, what happens across all different constituents of the US election. And so, part of what we're seeing and part of what we're continuing to assume and hearing, most importantly, for our customers is we got to get on with digital transformation, regardless of if this person's in office or that person's in office, because we are not becoming competitive if we can't deliver products faster, with better quality, and a more sustainable cost structure, given all the things that are happening around the world. I will say that geopolitics, the environment, the uncertainty, wars have been consistent for the last number of years, which is why we continue to say we've not said that the environment's getting better. We don't believe it's getting worse based on this. And we're going to navigate through this time period. And we've thought through that in the way in which we set the guidance here.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets.\nMichael Richards: It's Mike Richards on for Matt. So I appreciate the early look into 2025. So maybe how should we be thinking about the drivers of that low double-digit growth and how that sort of evolves from this year as it pertains to the five focus areas? And even acknowledging that it's a decade-long journey for SaaS, maybe how that might contribute more to growth as we move forward.\nNeil Barua: Again, I think we'll get into providing more details when we give the official fiscal 2025 guidance next quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Neil, Kristian, one of our observations about your largest market historically, namely the CAD market, is that over the last year, the share shifting that we have seen in the prior few years, which worked out to your benefit, has somewhat abated. In other words, share seems much more stable of late in that market. If it should turn out that the CAD market becomes increasingly competitive, how do you think about your competitive responses, perhaps in pricing or packaging or some other means? And again, if it were to become more competitive, how might that affect your broader cross-selling initiatives or ability to close cross-selling? And then secondarily, Neil, I liked your comments on the internal stone turning. Could you elaborate on the R&D changes that you're making, particularly in terms of the common platform that you've been working on, namely Atlas, which we frankly have not heard a good deal about lately?\nNeil Barua: On the first part on CAD, we have two awesome ways in which we're addressing the market. As you know, Jay, we've got Onshape, industry's only cloud-native CAD application, and we got Creo, which is awesome, as you know. And so, those two together, we feel have competitiveness. I am not talking about Onshape. It's a great part of our business, building momentum. We feel very good about it, competitive positioning. It's starting to scale. I will talk about it when it has a meaningful impact at an aggregate level to the financials of the business. But, strategically, we continue to make sure our chips are being placed to ensure that Onshape is successful against some of the other solutions that are out there from our competitors. And then you've got Creo, which is a very strong tool. And our belief is the connection of Creo to Windchill and ultimately Codebeamer, the three together, is a very strong value proposition for many customers thinking about how they think about the digital thread. So, Jay, I would say in the CAD business, we're ready, we're competing, we're in several different dynamics of deals that might cause share shifts, might not. As you know, it's not an easy business to do share shifts, but we believe we have a very comprehensive offering on both fronts, industry leading, scale player in Creo, and Onshape, which is starting to hit their stride here and we're going to continue to focus in on it. On your point around turning over stones on R&D, what I'll say is we're focusing in particularly on go-to-market and G&A. We're making sure on R&D, we are focusing on making sure the team is aligned to deliver on the roadmap. Every single one of our customers, Jay, is saying, we love your products, we love where you're going in terms of building feature functionality, scalability of those products, just do it. And so, job number one for the R&D team is keep doing that and do it with precision, energy because our customers need it. So that's number one. Including by the way, the Atlas team, because that is a fundamental layer by which we have the ability to offer our SaaS offerings. And two, continue to build innovative offerings. We're continuing to build ways in which we could add generative AI into our products. We're continuing to do \u2013 we just released an awesome integration of ServiceMax to Windchill on-time with great quality on July 11th of this month. We have another release of a ServiceMax ability to \u2013 now have ServiceMax able to be sold alongside Windchill in the federal space. So we're continuing to build some of these innovations, including with Codebeamer, Windchill and Creo and Onshape to make sure we're at the best-in-class here. I'll pause there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Clark Jeffries with Piper Sandler.\nClark Jeffries: I wanted to ask Kristian, we're asking a lot of questions here about close rates and pipeline, but maybe going back to that framework that you've set around ARR and what you need to believe on a sequential ARR basis. I just wanted to maybe have the discussion on \u2013 in relation to that $85 million for Q4, you called out the $5 million related to some of those existing contracts. What is the percentage in that $85 million that's going to come from uplift or pricing, drivers that are relatively in-hand versus new sales or upsells that might be more sensitive to execution?\nNeil Barua: I guess we could take a stab at it. I think I would think about it in a few different buckets. There is some benefit from pricing. As you know, we tend to be pretty customer friendly on that front, but there's certainly some benefit from that. I would say consistent with what's been in the past couple of years. Then I would probably start moving up the stack and thinking about the channel. The channel has been a pretty consistent performer really for a number of years now. And we haven't really seen any meaningful changes in one direction or the other that would indicate a change in the trend there. So that gives us some level of comfort. Then I would move up also more into our kind of base business and base transactions. And again, the kind of volumes that we've seen there have been pretty consistent. And then lastly, you get to the large deals and that's really where the volatility is in any given quarter. And of course, it's also those large deals where you see the other dynamics come into play. Not only is it going to close in the quarter, but if it closes, how much of it's in quarter start? Is it a ramp deal? Is it all starting in the quarter, et cetera? And that's the part that's on a quarter-by-quarter basis difficult to predict with a high degree of certainty.\nOperator: Thank you. I will now hand the call back over to Neil Barua for closing remarks.\nNeil Barua: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Here's what's ahead specific to investor conferences. August 20th, Steve Dertien, our CTO, will join the Rosenblatt Virtual Tech Summit Conference. September 4th, Kristian will be at the Citi Global Tech Conference in New York. On behalf of the team, thank you again and we look forward to engaging with you.\nKristian Talvitie: Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Neil Barua",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt. In Q3, we again delivered solid constant currency ARR growth, up 12% year-over-year, demonstrating that our portfolio products is resonating with customers. Our Q3 free cash flow growth was also solid, rising 29% year-over-year. Kristian will take you through our quarterly results and forward-looking guidance in detail. Before we get into more detail, I want to recognize Mike DiTullio, who will transition out of the President and Chief Operating Officer roles at the end of the fiscal year and continue as an advisor to me into 2025. Mike's part in PTC success has been profound over his tenure of more than 25 years. We certainly wouldn't be the company we are today without him. In addition, he's been a great partner to me as I've stepped into the CEO role. We've been discussing his future plans and we both agree that it's the right time to start this transition process. When we start fiscal 2025, we'll no longer have the COO position within our leadership structure. At this stage of my CEO tenure, my approach is to be close to the business and be more directly involved with operations and execution, especially for our key priorities. Accordingly, I will be assuming many of Mike's responsibilities. Additionally, I'd like to reiterate what I said on last quarter's call, which is that I'm turning over lots of stones and looking at everything in this company in order to usher in a new phase of focus and effectiveness across the entire company. To that end, while Mike's change was externally visible because we filed an 8-K, there are numerous other changes that we have already made and are making across many different areas of the organization. This is an ongoing process that we're doing with the intent of driving more effectiveness in the pursuit of our incredible growth potential. Let's move down to slide 4, which highlights our product portfolio and strategy. As a reminder, our five focus areas are, one, PLM, which is driven primarily by our Windchill product; two, ALM, which is driven by our Codebeamer product; three, SLM, which is primarily driven by ServiceMax; four, CAD, which is driven primarily by Creo; and five, our continued focus on SaaS. These are the areas where we can create the greatest customer value and are the areas where we are focusing our resources and attention. At the most basic level, our customers need to introduce new products at a faster pace and with higher quality. It is not unusual to hear from customers that they need to shorten their new product introduction timelines in half. That's not possible without digital transformation across their workflows, which is exactly what our products enable. It's also worth highlighting that we are bringing our suite of software offerings together to help product companies improve their competitiveness. Given the unique breadth and openness of our portfolio, we can enable end-to-end digital threat initiatives, which leverage a connected flow of product data across design, manufacturing, service, and ultimately reuse. A digital thread enables product companies to break down silos, streamline workflows, and achieve interoperability across departments, functions, and systems, a single version of truth. It also secures the quality, consistency, and traceability of product-related data, ensuring that the data is up-to-date, accessible, reliable, and actionable. With a digital thread, the right data is delivered to the right people at the right time and in the right context across the value chain. The demand drivers for our core offerings are strong and our differentiated capabilities to drive digital thread initiatives are increasingly important to our customers. There is so much we can do to help our customers drive better business outcomes. To unlock this potential, I have started to focus on our operations, taking a fresh look at ways to continue driving improvements. On last quarter's call, we discussed rebalancing some R&D resources away from creating new standalone IoT and augmented reality applications to instead support growth of our core products. That was just the first step, putting in place an organizational design that enables us to scale more programmatically will set us up for continued success in the future. We are now primarily turning our attention to optimizing our go-to-market and G&A activities. As I mentioned upfront, we've leaned out the go-to-market management structure, so there are less layers between me and our customers. At this point, we are moving forward without the chief operating officer and chief revenue officer roles, and I will be working directly with our Head of Sales and Head of Customer Success. We are actively looking at every facet of our business to continue driving alignment and effectiveness across our entire company. It is about focusing on customer value and getting more effective with each dollar we spend to support them and capture that demand. The opportunities to achieve this are significant here at PTC. We are in the early innings of doing this work and we expect the heavy lifting to continue in fiscal 2025. I'd like to turn now to discuss three of our focus areas to illustrate the significant value we bring to customers. This quarter, I'll touch on what we have been seeing with customers of our Windchill PLM, Codebeamer ALM, and ServiceMax SLM products. Starting with PLM on slide 5, this is product lifecycle management, and Windchill is our flagship PLM product. PLM systems tend to be really sticky and are mission critical for our customers. This is software that historically had the function of helping CAD engineers keep track of their CAD files. Now PLM is at the epicenter of digital transformation initiatives at product companies. As I explained last quarter, product companies are increasingly focused on compressing the time it takes to get new products to market. And at the same time, their products continue to get much more complex, both to design and produce. The complexity becomes untenable. Quality and time to market gets impacted. Sooner or later, it becomes very clear that having an advanced PLM system is a strategic necessity. In general, manufacturing companies have a long way to go in terms of their digital transformation journeys. And when a product company gets really serious about optimizing and automating their design and manufacturing processes, we tend to see large PLM expansion projects and step function increases in ARR as customers expand their Windchill deployments in terms of both seats and functionality. A good example of this is our Q3 win at a supplier to the automotive industry that specializes in cabling and wiring harness solutions. Given the rise of software-defined vehicles and the importance of electronic wiring systems, the role of this company in the automotive supply chain has grown. It's interesting that this company already appreciated the value of leveraging their PLM system beyond engineering to drive better business outcomes. They are using Windchill within R&D, but they're currently using homegrown tools to drive collaboration across their engineering, supply chain, manufacturing, and quality assurance teams. Over time, maintaining their homegrown system became unsustainable from both a complexity and cost standpoint. They found it compelling that extending Windchill beyond engineering is easy to implement and provides quick time to value, and they decided to standardize on their Windchill system as their backbone for enterprise-wide collaboration around their product data. Turning to slide 6, the second customer example for today is a medical equipment customer that has been using our Creo CAD and Windchill PLM products for years now. What's interesting is that this customer wants to unlock value by going with the digital thread approach I highlighted a few minutes ago. Our Codebeamer ALM product helped to complete their digital thread vision. After being a Codebeamer customer for about a year testing out the product, they decided they were all in and ready to move forward with their digital thread initiative, and in Q3, they signed a deal with us that will expand their ARR by 190%. As a reminder, ALM, or Application Lifecycle Management, helps engineers keep track of product requirements and tests to ensure that all requirements are met. This traceability is very important in safety-critical and regulated industries, including the automotive and medical equipment markets, and is growing in importance across other industries because of the trend towards software-driven products of all types. Products now contain more embedded software than ever, and for many products, there's been an explosion in the number of unique software configurations that need to be developed and updated over time. Codebeamer is a next-gen platform that enables industrial companies to manage this increasing level of complexity. Codebeamer is differentiated from legacy ALM offerings in two key ways. First, Codebeamer has industry-leading traceability capabilities, and second, Codebeamer also helps with time to market by supporting Agile development processes. Consider, for example, what happens when a company has a product in the field that fails? Regulators immediately want to understand which version of the software that product had, and might even demand that more stringent new requirements be placed on new products the company makes. Codebeamer is becoming the solution of choice to deal with this new reality. Codebeamer is a big part of completing the digital thread vision for this customer because software plays such a critical role in their new product innovations. Before having Codebeamer, they face challenges managing their high volume of software requirements, which led to unnecessary delays in getting new products to market as well as exposure to risk. As a medical equipment company, software innovation and regulatory traceability are front and center for this customer and the value Codebeamer brought to them gave them the confidence to rely on PTC in a more holistic way. They are expanding their Windchill and Codebeamer deployments and will use Windchill as the foundation for their digital thread. The digital thread is becoming increasingly strategic to customers across many industries as product companies see the potential to improve their competitiveness by managing the complete lifecycle of their products in a more integrated manner. What is most important to thread together can be different for different customers. But having visibility to a more complete picture and being able to gain actionable insights through a digital thread of product data is becoming table stakes as the competitive environment continues to intensify across many industries. Turning to the third customer example for today, which is a ServiceMax SLM win on slide 7. SLM is Service Lifecycle Management and one of our main products here is ServiceMax, the industry leader in field service management for high value, long lifecycle products. In Q3, we landed a new PTC customer because of ServiceMax. This customer engineers, manufacturers and services industrial and electrical power systems around the world and they like that ServiceMax has become part of PTC. The drivers behind this win were similar in many ways to the elevator company when we highlighted on last quarter's call. The point is that many product companies are not only focused on managing complexity and accelerating time to market, they are also looking for new sources of top line and bottom line growth. In this example, the customer had a CEO led initiative to better leverage their install base to grow aftermarket revenue in a repeatable and cost-effective manner. Because of organizational silos, the customer currently has fragmented service business operation, which impacts their field service productivity and customer service. They struggle to compete with smaller local vendors for aftermarket contracts to service their own products. The customer made the strategic decision that it was time to transform their service operations and they selected ServiceMax. The ServiceMax system will be their software foundation and single source of truth for their aftermarket services and customer service initiatives. Before going out into the field, the ServiceMax application will help their service technicians understand everything they need to know about the specific product that needs servicing, so that they can bring the right parts with them. The ServiceMax application will also schedule and route the field technicians efficiently and guide the field technicians through complex procedures. As typical of ServiceMax deals, the selection process was very thorough and ServiceMax came on top based on product capabilities they're aligned with the priorities of the customer to drive more proactive customer service, improve visibility into their install base of products, drive higher aftermarket attach rates and improve field technician utilization. Lastly, we also remain encouraged by our other focus areas that they didn't provide examples for this quarter, which are CAD and SaaS. We have been reinvesting in our business, consistently growing our annual R&D investment footprint to provide greater value to our customers. In Q3, we made incremental progress in each of our five focus areas towards executing in a scalable fashion and focusing our investments on the product advancements that customers care the most about. As I emphasized earlier, you should expect to see a continued focus on aligning all our resources across all operational functions in this company behind our five focus areas. This is foundational work and we will be disciplined about seeing it through. It will take time and progress may not be linear, but we will leave no stone unturned, as I said, as we focus on scaling our business and further improving the consistency of our execution With that, I'll hand the call over to Kristian to take you through our Q3 financial results and future guidance. On the first question, in Q3, we saw very small puts and takes across all geographic regions and verticals. Absolutely no discernible change in any trend there. As we've been saying very consistently, the demand environment in Q3 was consistent with what we've seen over the past couple of years. Good thing, by the way, is our pipeline going to Q4 is strong. In terms of what I'm looking for, what Kristian and I are looking for in terms of areas where we would feel the environment's getting better, is how we think about close rates. And consistently, for the past few years, close rates have been difficult and challenged. Once those close rates on a growing pipeline become better, it is my indication of when the environment is better for PTC in terms of securing the deals in a more accelerated manner. But I absolutely feel good about the demand. In fact, our sequential growth and pipeline is increasing, and so we're focusing on closing deals and how they actually attribute to in-quarter ARR. First of all, I'm actually pleased with the performance that we delivered in Q3. In terms of over the course of the quarter, again, very small puts and takes of any change in trend across geos and verticals. I think we've been focusing and executing quite well in this challenging environment. And again, to be clear, no real change in terms of what we're seeing in terms of customer behavior. And again, maybe different than others on other calls, but I've been very consistent around the environment has been challenged. Even post Q2, we mentioned its challenged and it remains as such because of this point around close rates. And going into Q4, the way in which we're thinking about this is, and I'll take the piece around guidance, the update to the high end of our guidance takes into account how the deals we landed in Q3 will show up in Q4 ARR. It also factors in the close rates we expect in Q4 based on the further maturation of deals in our pipeline. In our view, how those will impact Q4 in-quarter ARR. So that guidance range we feel is appropriate, balancing up the risks and opportunity from what we see from now to the end of the quarter. A consistent theme from my prior calls around where are we putting wood behind which arrows and that is driven by our belief around where we could drive the most customer value and where we have the highest right to win. And so, that's how we set forward the five priorities of the company that I've been consistently talking about for the last couple of quarters. We did some repositioning of product and R&D capabilities in IoT ARR back to core products to reinforce those priorities to deliver a better outcome of those priorities over the next number of years. The same is happening now across all these other functions. In particular now, the focus is around the go-to-market function, by which it's not around efficiency. It is around are we using every person we have in this company effectively towards those five priorities. And so, we're working through making sure whoever is targeting PLM expansion capabilities is adequately enabled, is adequately incented, is structured in our go-to-market model by which they can be successful that delivers value to the customer and returns to the company. And so, that's what we're working through. And the other stones that we're kind of working through is because we've set these priorities very clearly, we're all really energized by these priorities because we're seeing, to your question, a lot of customer demand and pull from it. We're looking at anything we're spending money in that can be better utilized using that same dollar on things that could accelerate those priorities, whether it be greater R&D capabilities, which we've been doing it, whether it be making sure we position the rest of your organization to serve those customers towards those five priorities. So that's how we're looking at it currently. And again, much work to do, early innings and heavy lifting will continue into 2025. Look, from a PTC standpoint, again, I just want to keep reiterating this. We did not see any discernible change in trend amongst geographies and verticals. Whatever our competitor mentioned, we didn't really see that same dynamic happen in that vertical at PTC. I'm not sure what we're doing different than them, in particular, but we didn't see that dynamic play out here. Partly, we've been very consistent around making sure everyone's clear in the way we're actually operating is within a challenging sales environment. And we've been seeing that and not getting ahead of our skis thinking it's going to change, but being operating under that environment. And I think that discipline with a great product portfolio, I think, is differentiated across the industry with a movement towards building the business towards these five priorities that is more consistent to create the execution. Kristian called, is why I believe we're continuing to deliver the types of results we are and why Kristian and I are looking at Q4 and making sure with this growing pipeline, we continue to make sure we deliver on the commitments that we're making and drive customer value. You want to start, Kristian? One of the benefits of having been here now 18 months, maybe a little bit longer, is I've had the time to process, be part of the organization, to think through and observe. I'm part of a number of customer conversations, etc. I've had a great transition process with Mike DiTullio, as I mentioned, and I feel confident that my thoughtfulness, our thoughtfulness around what to change from position of strength, not a position of weakness, is actually a very exciting thing for many people here at PTC to make sure we're enabling them to be as successful as they can across these five priorities. So I actually believe that the work we're doing fundamentally is going to be a huge value to a lot of people here at PTC to unleash even greater work that they've been doing. And so, to that end, these are going to be very intentional moves. I've done it a number of times in my career and it's to drive more effectiveness and I feel really good about our ability to manage through these changes. Let me make a piece of this clear around close rates. Our assumption going into Q4 about close rates and looking at a deal by deal match ratio of the pipeline is no different than our view of close rates that have been evident for the most part in general for the last few years. The dynamic of what we're doing on Q4 right now in terms of guidance, how we think about it is we now know what happened in Q3. We now know the composition, meaning how the deals that we closed in Q3 are going to actually go into ARR, whether they all came into Q3 or whether part of it goes into Q4 ARR or part of it goes into the next subsequent years. So now we have that data point. We have now made the assessment around all the deals that are maturing in the pipeline and the close rates is consistent with what we've seen prior quarters and years. So it's continued challenge on the close rate, not worse, not better. And we've made assumptions around how that ARR when it closes actually comes into ARR. And that's the area where the precision is difficult for the company, given is it going to be a deal that ramps over time? Is it all going to come into one quarter? And looking at all those factors, we determined the guidance range that we put with the risk and opportunities balance. In terms of PTC and ServiceMax, Saket, what I will say anecdotally is we are continuing to be pleased, excited about the buildup in momentum of Codebeamer and the interest and reception we're getting from the market, the reception that we're getting from customers that are testing out like the example that I gave to you that are thinking about broadening the expansion of the utilization across the company in Codebeamer. And on ServiceMax, the business is starting to work in terms of continued buildup of really good pipeline as well as close that happened for the last year-to-date through Q3 and quite a lot of very interesting deals that we're assuming will close in Q4 to allow for a really strong jump off into next year that we will make sure we continue. So on both fronts, all systems go and we're very pleased so far with the momentum. We still have to close and continue that momentum sustained over the next number of years. It's the first time in my career where I've been spending so much time with executives and customers across the world, and they ask me who's going to win the election in the US. It's a consistent and quite a confusing time for everyone around what happens in the US. That being said, I think for the most part, customers are understanding that whoever gets put in the office, a lot of things don't dramatically change depending on the composition, what happens across all different constituents of the US election. And so, part of what we're seeing and part of what we're continuing to assume and hearing, most importantly, for our customers is we got to get on with digital transformation, regardless of if this person's in office or that person's in office, because we are not becoming competitive if we can't deliver products faster, with better quality, and a more sustainable cost structure, given all the things that are happening around the world. I will say that geopolitics, the environment, the uncertainty, wars have been consistent for the last number of years, which is why we continue to say we've not said that the environment's getting better. We don't believe it's getting worse based on this. And we're going to navigate through this time period. And we've thought through that in the way in which we set the guidance here. Again, I think we'll get into providing more details when we give the official fiscal 2025 guidance next quarter. On the first part on CAD, we have two awesome ways in which we're addressing the market. As you know, Jay, we've got Onshape, industry's only cloud-native CAD application, and we got Creo, which is awesome, as you know. And so, those two together, we feel have competitiveness. I am not talking about Onshape. It's a great part of our business, building momentum. We feel very good about it, competitive positioning. It's starting to scale. I will talk about it when it has a meaningful impact at an aggregate level to the financials of the business. But, strategically, we continue to make sure our chips are being placed to ensure that Onshape is successful against some of the other solutions that are out there from our competitors. And then you've got Creo, which is a very strong tool. And our belief is the connection of Creo to Windchill and ultimately Codebeamer, the three together, is a very strong value proposition for many customers thinking about how they think about the digital thread. So, Jay, I would say in the CAD business, we're ready, we're competing, we're in several different dynamics of deals that might cause share shifts, might not. As you know, it's not an easy business to do share shifts, but we believe we have a very comprehensive offering on both fronts, industry leading, scale player in Creo, and Onshape, which is starting to hit their stride here and we're going to continue to focus in on it. On your point around turning over stones on R&D, what I'll say is we're focusing in particularly on go-to-market and G&A. We're making sure on R&D, we are focusing on making sure the team is aligned to deliver on the roadmap. Every single one of our customers, Jay, is saying, we love your products, we love where you're going in terms of building feature functionality, scalability of those products, just do it. And so, job number one for the R&D team is keep doing that and do it with precision, energy because our customers need it. So that's number one. Including by the way, the Atlas team, because that is a fundamental layer by which we have the ability to offer our SaaS offerings. And two, continue to build innovative offerings. We're continuing to build ways in which we could add generative AI into our products. We're continuing to do \u2013 we just released an awesome integration of ServiceMax to Windchill on-time with great quality on July 11th of this month. We have another release of a ServiceMax ability to \u2013 now have ServiceMax able to be sold alongside Windchill in the federal space. So we're continuing to build some of these innovations, including with Codebeamer, Windchill and Creo and Onshape to make sure we're at the best-in-class here. I'll pause there. I guess we could take a stab at it. I think I would think about it in a few different buckets. There is some benefit from pricing. As you know, we tend to be pretty customer friendly on that front, but there's certainly some benefit from that. I would say consistent with what's been in the past couple of years. Then I would probably start moving up the stack and thinking about the channel. The channel has been a pretty consistent performer really for a number of years now. And we haven't really seen any meaningful changes in one direction or the other that would indicate a change in the trend there. So that gives us some level of comfort. Then I would move up also more into our kind of base business and base transactions. And again, the kind of volumes that we've seen there have been pretty consistent. And then lastly, you get to the large deals and that's really where the volatility is in any given quarter. And of course, it's also those large deals where you see the other dynamics come into play. Not only is it going to close in the quarter, but if it closes, how much of it's in quarter start? Is it a ramp deal? Is it all starting in the quarter, et cetera? And that's the part that's on a quarter-by-quarter basis difficult to predict with a high degree of certainty. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Here's what's ahead specific to investor conferences. August 20th, Steve Dertien, our CTO, will join the Rosenblatt Virtual Tech Summit Conference. September 4th, Kristian will be at the Citi Global Tech Conference in New York. On behalf of the team, thank you again and we look forward to engaging with you."

            "name": "Kristian Talvitie",
            "content": "Thank you, Neil. And hello, everyone. Starting off with slide 9, PTC again delivered solid financial results in terms of both ARR and free cash flow in a continued challenging selling environment. As you know, we believe ARR and free cash flow are the most important metrics to assess the performance of our business. To help investors understand our business performance, excluding the impact of foreign exchange volatility, we provide ARR guidance and disclose our ARR results on a constant currency basis. At the end of Q3, our constant currency ARR was $2.125 billion, up 12% year-over-year and within our guidance range. Our free cash flow results were also solid, up 29% year-over-year, while at the same time continuing to invest in our key focus areas. However, we came in a bit below our guidance of approximately $220 million due to timing. We have a high degree of confidence in our cash flow guidance and targets due to the predictability of our cash collections and the disciplined resource allocation structure we have in place. With the timing issues resolved, we continue to expect free cash flow of $725 million in fiscal 2024 million and continue to be confident that our business model positions us to deliver solid, predictable results. Turning to slide 10, let's look at our ARR growth in more detail. Starting with our product groups, in Q3, we delivered 10% constant currency ARR growth in CAD and 13% growth in PLM. Despite the overall demand environment, which has been sluggish for a couple of years now, our top line has shown good resilience. Our solid ARR growth is supported by our unique portfolio with a solid footprint in high growth segments of the market and the digital transformation journeys of our customers. These underlying strengths are further supported by our subscription model, our low churn rate and the propensity for our customer base to prioritize their own R&D investments through challenging times. Moving to our ARR by region, our constant currency organic ARR growth was solid across the Americas, Europe and APAC, with growth in the low to mid-double-digits. Across all regions, our year-over-year organic constant currency growth rates in Q3 were similar to the growth rates we saw in Q2. Moving to slide 11. First of all, given the consistency and predictability of our free cash flow, we aim to maintain a low cash balance. As you know, our long term goal, assuming our debt to EBITDA ratio is below 3 times, remains to return approximately 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases while also taking into consideration the interest rate environment and strategic opportunities. Given the strategic acquisitions, namely ServiceMax and Codebeamer that we've done over the past couple of years and the debt we took on to fund them, we've paused our share repurchase program. As we said before, we intend to use substantially all of our free cash flow to pay down our debt in fiscal 2024. And as we've been saying, we'll revisit the prioritization of paydown and share repurchases when we get to fiscal 2025. We were 2.2 times levered at the end of Q3. During the quarter, we paid down our debt by $195 million and ended Q3 with cash and cash equivalents of $248 million and gross debt of $1.8 billion. We continue to expect that we'll end fiscal 2024 with gross debt of approximately $1.7 billion. Lastly, we expect fully diluted shares are approximately 121 million in fiscal 2024, up by approximately 1.5 million shares year-over-year. With that, I'll take you through our guidance on slide 12. Reflecting our year-to-date performance and our outlook for Q4, we're updating our fiscal 2024 constant currency ARR guidance, lowering the high end of the range by $20 million and now expect to end the year with constant currency ARR growth of 11% to 12%. It's worth noting we're updating our revenue guidance accordingly, reducing the high end by $20 million. We're reiterating our free cash flow guidance of approximately $725 million in fiscal 2024, given our year-to-date performance and Q4 outlook. For Q4, we're guiding for free cash flow of approximately $83 million and constant currency ARR of $2.2 billion to $2.22 billion, which corresponds to year-over-year growth of 11% to 12%. We believe we've set our guidance appropriately. I'll get a little more into ARR guidance details on the next slide. But before I do, I'd also like to reiterate my favorite reminder. To help you with your models, we're providing revenue and EPS guidance, but ASC 606 makes revenue and EPS difficult to predict for PTC since we primarily sell on-premises subscriptions. And the way revenue is recognized from these contracts can vary significantly based on variables that aren't necessarily relevant to the performance of the business. I did a teach-in on this subject on our Q4 2022 call that you may want to refer to if you are new to PTC. The summary is we believe ARR and free cash flow, rather than revenue and operating income, are the best metrics to assess the performance of our business. Importantly, we've maintained consistent billing practices over time. We primarily bill our customers annually upfront one year at a time regardless of contract term lengths, so our free cash flow results over time are comparable. Moving to slide 13, here's an illustrative constant currency ARR model for Q4. You can see our results over the past 11 quarters and the column on the far right illustrates what is needed to get to the midpoint of our constant currency ARR guidance. The illustrative model indicates that, to hit the midpoint of our Q4 guidance range, we need $85 million of sequential net new ARR growth. This is approximately $10 million more than we added in Q4 of the previous two fiscal years. And this year, we expect to benefit from Codebeamer cross-selling ServiceMax with an aligned and enabled sales force and approximately $5 million more deferred ARR than we had in Q4 of fiscal 2023. We think our guidance range for Q4 and the full year balance both risk and opportunity. And looking out a little further ahead to our fiscal 2025. And here, keep in mind that we're still in the middle of our detailed planning process. But I would not be surprised if our official fiscal 2025 guidance, when we give it next quarter, was in the low double-digit ARR growth range, consistent with our medium-term targets and in line with our performance over the past couple of years. Again, balancing both risk and opportunity. I also anticipate our free cash flow guidance would be somewhere within the $825 million to $875 million dollar range we previously communicated. Additionally, as we think about capital allocation, I think you will see us resume share repurchases in fiscal 2025 in and around the $300 million level as we balance debt pay down with returning capital to shareholders. Obviously, we'll provide our official guidance on next quarter's call, but we just wanted to provide some directional thinking that we feel pretty comfortable with, given the recurring nature of our business model and the budgeting process we have in place. In conclusion, PTC has a strong portfolio, solid strategy, and a great team of people with deep expertise and strong customer relationships. We're focused on disciplined and consistent execution to ensure we deliver on the value creation opportunities we have ahead of us. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Again, I don't think we really want to get into the nitty gritty details of the guidance for next year. As I said, we're still working through the detailed planning process. That said, I think that we've seen our \u2013 we'll call it budgeting process, play out here this year. As we've articulated, we start the year with a range of expected outcomes on the top line. We start the year with a spend run rate. And as we progress through the year, as we get more comfortable, we release more incremental funding into the system. So that's how we try to gauge it and we would continue to try to do that and we're frankly doing it right now already in preparation for next year and that's how we're thinking about it. So we're really talking about modulating incremental expense into next year and hopefully not putting ourselves in a situation where we've got to actually pare back expense. I think we feel pretty comfortable about it. No, there were no other changes to the deferred ARR, like we talked about last quarter. This was simply reflecting \u2013 this is I think what Neil was saying earlier, reflecting how our Q3 results came in and the composition of those deals and how they roll into ARR in Q3 and Q4 and beyond and the outlook to the best of our ability for Q4 as well, given the deals that are in play and the pipeline and expectations around what the composition of those deals is going to look like as they materialize into ARR. It's a great question, Josh. No, and that actually is not the case at all. On free cash flow is actually simply timing. Just being completely candid, we had a bunch of collections that were due in the last two days of the quarter. The last two days of the quarter happened to be a Saturday and Sunday. We were hopeful that we were going to get that cash in on Friday or before, but obviously customers have a contractual right to actually pay it the following week. And so, that's what happened on the cash flow. We were hopeful that we were going to get it on the week before. We've now got that cash, so hence there's no change to the cash flow forecast for the year. That's the timing issue. Yeah, it was about half of it in last quarter and half of it this quarter. Sorry, I'll be more precise. Half of it in Q3 and about half of it in Q4. Thanks, everybody."

[Operator Instructions]  \n I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Shimao, PTC's Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nMatthew Shimao: Good afternoon. Thank you, John, and welcome to PTC's Fiscal 2024 Second Quarter Conference Call. On the call today are Neil Barua, Chief Executive Officer; and Kristian Talvitie, Chief Financial Officer. Today's conference call is being broadcast live through an audio webcast, and a replay of the call will be available later today at www.ptc.com. \n During this call, PTC will make forward-looking statements, including guidance as to future operating results. Because such statements deal with future events, actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.  \n Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements can be found in PTC's annual report on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as well as in today's press release. The forward-looking statements, including guidance provided during this call are valid only as of today's date, May 1, 2024, and PTC assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements.  \n During the call, PTC will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in today's press release made available on our website.  \n With that, I'd like to turn the call over to PTC's Chief Executive Officer, Neil Barua. \nNeil Barua: Thanks, Matt. I'm proud of what the PTC team accomplished during our second fiscal quarter. We again delivered solid results, which Kristian will take you through in detail. This quarter continues to demonstrate that PTC is on the right track and that our portfolio of products is resonating with customers. Before going into more detail about our strategy and discussing some proof points from the quarter, I'd like to address our mid-term targets, which we have updated today.  \n To be clear, we are not changing our cash flow guidance. What we have updated is our mid-term ARR growth targets. We are now targeting constant currency ARR growth in the low double digits over the mid-term, which is consistent with the performance we have delivered over the past 5 years through varying macroeconomic conditions.  \n In addition, we feel very good about our ability to hit our cash flow targets even while we appropriately reinvest into the business for product development. This is because we have a disciplined process to manage our internal spending based on the level of ARR growth we are seeing.  \n This year, as an example, our internal spend framework assumed 10% to 12% ARR growth. In addition to adding incremental investment to drive multiyear growth, we are also proactively managing our existing spend. We are able to do this effectively by leveraging the skill sets of our global R&D teams where we could shift the focus of these resources towards the product areas that create the greatest customer value.  \n In addition, we have confidence in generating increasing operating leverage from our go-to-market and G&A teams. The investments we make are aligned to the market environment and our 5 focus areas to ensure appropriate resource allocation towards the areas that create the greatest customer value.  \n As an example, we are currently in the process of rebalancing resources primarily in R&D, away from creating new stand-alone IoT and AR applications to instead support PLM, ALM and SLM growth. While these are not huge movements of people and there will not be a restructuring charge associated with this, it is an example of how we plan to put a greater focus on driving our priorities more effectively.  \n As a reminder, our 5 focus areas include: number one, PLM, which has driven primarily by our Windchill product; number two, ALM, which is driven by our Codebeamer product; number three, SLM, which is primarily driven by ServiceMax; number four, CAD, which is driven primarily by Creo; and lastly, number five, our continued focus on SaaS.  \n I'd like to turn now to discuss 2 of our focus areas to illustrate the significant value we bring to customers. This quarter, I'll touch on what we have been seeing with customers of our Windchill PLM and ServiceMax SLM products.  \n Starting with PLM. This is product life cycle management, and Windchill is our flagship PLM product. PLM systems tend to be highly configured, really sticky and our mission-critical system of record for our customers. This is software that historically had the function of helping CAD engineers keep track of their CAD files. Part of the reason PTC's growth has been so solid over the last few years is because PLM systems have grown in importance at product companies.  \n Today's products are more complex, typically with embedded electronics and software and even the mechanical components are now more complex. To drive revenue growth, product companies have become increasingly focused on producing more variants of their products.  \n Mixing certain hardware configurations with other software configurations, while at the same time, compressing the time it takes to get new products to market. That's a tall order. Simply put, product companies that offer multiple configurations of their products face a diversity and scale challenge. And sooner or later, it becomes clear to these companies that having an advanced PLM system is a strategic necessity. \n In general, manufacturing companies have a long way to go in terms of their digital transformation journeys. When a product company gets really serious about optimizing and automating their workflows, we tend to see large PLM expansion projects. This creates a step function increase in ARR as customers expand their Windchill deployments in terms of both seats and functionality.  \n This is what we saw in a leading medical equipment company with over $5 billion of annual revenue and 20,000 employees, getting new products to market faster is a top business priority for them. As a first step, they standardize on Windchill within R&D across all their business divisions and harmonize their engineering practices related to product changes and configuration management. By doing this, they established a solid engineering foundation that ensures the traceability work performed and updates made for both productivity gains and also to remain compliant with regulations.  \n Before standardizing on Windchill, this customer did not have an authoritative source of truth for their product data. So whenever they ran into conflicting product data in their system, they lost a lot of time figuring out why that happened and what to do about it.\n While the first step for this customer was expanding Windchill within R&D, they also want to accelerate their new product introduction time lines. To do this, they needed to drive earlier collaboration around new products, across other operational functions outside of R&D. To accomplish this goal, they decided to leverage their Windchill system as a backbone for enterprise-wide collaboration around product data, and they expanded their Windchill deployment to teams, including manufacturing, supply chain, quality, regulatory, compliance and marketing. For example, providing the supply chain team with relevant product data earlier in the process enables any issues around component availability or component pricing to be identified earlier resulting in less need for products to be redesigned or reworked later.  \n Turning to the second customer example for today, which is about cross-selling service mix, SLM into our base. First, a reminder that SLM is service lifecycle management, and our main product here is ServiceMax, which we acquired a little over a year ago.  \n ServiceMax is the industry leader in field service management for high-value long lifecycle products. Our customers are not only facing complexity challenges, competitive pressures have also increased.  \n Globalization has forced companies to be more efficient if they want to remain competitive. They are looking for new steady sources of top line growth and margin expansion.  \n In order to drive scalable service revenue expanding their focus with digital tools on their services operations is key. The example I want to highlight here is one of the largest elevator companies in the world with billions in annual revenue. After struggling with disparate disconnected systems that got in the way of providing good service to their customers, they decided to embark on a complete service transformation to improve both the growth and profitability of their services business.  \n In the future, when their service technicians go into the field to service an elevator, they will know, using the ServiceMax application about the specific elevator so they bring the right parts to the work site. They will know the service history and have service instructions for that specific elevator. And of course, they'll be scheduled and routed efficiently to the job site.  \n Furthermore, the elevator business is highly regulated and the ServiceMax application will ease the regulatory compliance burden by having traceable records of the work performed during service calls. This is how ServiceMax helps our customers.  \n We've been focused on cross-selling ServiceMax into our strong base of customers where we have established customer trust. As of the start of fiscal '24, we aligned the PTC sales team with the ServiceMax sales thresholds to go to market together. And this collaboration played a big role in getting this deal across the finish line.  \n We also remain encouraged by our other focus areas that I didn't provide examples for this quarter, which are Codebeamer ALM, CAD and SaaS. In each of our 5 focus areas, we made incremental progress during Q2 towards executing in a scalable fashion and focusing our investments on the product advancements that customers care the most about.  \n As many of you know, during my transition period before taking over as CEO, I spent time listening to employees, digging into our product strategy, speaking with customers and partners to understand their needs and how we address them. As a result of the time I spend on this, I feel good about our product portfolio and strategy, which guides our 5 focus areas. You should expect to see a continued emphasis on focusing our resources in the areas that create the greatest customer value and where we have a right to win.  \n I've also started to focus on our operations. I begin to examine where we excel and have room for improvement. As you know, PTC has been on a multiyear journey to improve efficiencies. But my early observations are that PTC will benefit from a fresh look at innovative ways to continue to drive operational improvements. I'm turning over lots of stones, and we'll look at everything to usher in a new phase of focus and effectiveness across the entire company.  \n With that, I'll hand the call over to Kristian to take you through our Q2 financial results. \nKristian Talvitie: Thanks, Neil. Hello, everyone. Starting off with Slide 8. PTC, again, delivered solid financial results in terms of both ARR and free cash flow in a challenging selling environment. As you know, we believe ARR and free cash flow are the most important metrics to assess the performance of our business.  \n To help investors understand our business performance, excluding the impact of FX volatility, we provide ARR guidance and disclose our ARR results on a constant currency basis. At the end of Q2, our constant currency ARR was $2.075 billion, up 12% year-over-year and above our guidance range. Note that we acquired ServiceMax in Q2 of fiscal '23, so we're no longer excluding ServiceMax from our organic ARR results. \n In Q2 '24, our cash flow results also came in ahead of our guidance with operating cash flow of $251 million and free cash flow of $247 million, both of which were up 19% year-over-year. Our cash flow performance is driven by our ARR and operating efficiency. And in Q2, we extended our track record of disciplined operational management while continuing to invest in our key focus areas.  \n Turning to Slide 9. Let's look at our ARR growth at a more detailed level. Starting with our product groups in CAD, we delivered 11% constant currency ARR growth in Q2 with the growth primarily driven by Creo. In PLM, our constant currency ARR growth was 13%, primarily driven by Windchill. Despite the overall demand environment, which has been sluggish for many quarters now, our top line has shown good resilience. Our solid ARR growth is supported by our unique portfolio with a solid footprint and higher growth segments of the market and the digital transformation journeys of our customers. These underlying strengths are further supported by our subscription model, our low churn rate and the propensity for our customer base to prioritize their own R&D investments through challenging times. \n Moving to our ARR by region. Our constant currency organic ARR growth was solid across Americas, Europe and APAC, with growth in the low to mid-double digits. Across all regions, our year-over-year organic constant currency growth rates in Q2 were similar to the growth rates we saw in Q1.  \n Moving to Slide 10. First of all, given the consistency and predictability of our free cash flow, we aim to maintain a low cash balance. And as you know, our long-term goal, assuming our debt-to-EBITDA ratio is below 3x, remains to return approximately 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases while also taking into consideration the interest rate environment and strategic opportunities.  \n So given the strategic acquisitions, namely ServiceMax and Codebeamer that we've done over the past 2 years, we paused our share repurchase program. And as we've said before, we intend to use substantially all of our free cash flow to pay down our debt in fiscal '24.  \n Heading into fiscal '25, we'll revisit the prioritization of debt paydown and share repurchases. We were 2.3x levered at the end of Q2. During the quarter, we paid down our debt by $256 million, and we ended Q2 with cash and cash equivalents of $249 million and gross debt of $2.011 billion. We expect to end the year with gross debt of approximately $1.7 billion.  \n Lastly, we now expect our diluted share count to increase by approximately 1.5 million shares in fiscal '24 versus our previous expectation of approximately 1 million shares under the accounting rules, specifically ASC 260, a higher share price results in incrementally higher diluted share count.  \n With that, I'll take you through our guidance on Slide 11. We're reiterating our fiscal '24 free cash flow guidance and narrowing our fiscal '24 constant currency ARR guidance range. We're taking the low end of the ARR guidance up by $10 million, reflecting our solid first half performance. We're taking the high end of the range down by $10 million, reflecting a change to the deferred ARR, we expect to recognize in the back half of the year.  \n You'll recall that we said we had approximately $20 million more deferred ARR in the back half of fiscal '24 compared to fiscal '23. We've reduced this by $10 million as we've renegotiated a handful of customer contracts. While not commonplace with existing contracts, renegotiations do sometimes happen. Some of you may recall that we had a handful of these during COVID as well. \n The field teams do a good job here, working with customers in what I like to call a customer-friendly but commercially responsible manner, meaning we're doing the right thing for the customer now while also ensuring that these deals will result in a higher exit run rate and better contractual terms for PTC.  \n We remain squarely focused on long-term value creation for our customers and our shareholders. It's worth noting that we're updating our fiscal '24 revenue guidance accordingly, taking the low end up by $10 million, reducing the high end by $10 million. Additionally, we're lowering the entire range by $10 million due to the impact of FX.  \n As you'll recall, we do not guide to constant currency revenue. Our EPS guidance reflects our first half performance and the impacts of the narrowing of the revenue range and the FX impact as well. And lastly, our free cash flow is also impacted by FX, but we're reiterating the $725 million guidance given the first half results.  \n For Q3, we're guiding for free cash flow of approximately $220 million in constant currency ARR of $2.115 billion to $2.13 billion, which corresponds to year-over-year growth of 11% to 12%. We believe we've set our Q3 and full year guidance appropriately. I'll get into more ARR guidance details on the next 2 slides. But before we do, I'd also like to reiterate my favorite reminder. \n To help you with your models, we're providing revenue and EPS guidance. But ASC 606 makes revenue and EPS difficult to predict for PTC since we sell primarily on-premise subscriptions and the way revenue is recognized from these contracts can vary significantly based on variables that aren't necessarily relevant to the performance of the business.  \n I did a teach-in on this subject on our Q4 '22 call that you may want to refer to if you're new to PTC. The summary is we believe ARR and free cash flow rather than revenue and operating income are the best metrics to assess the performance of our business. Importantly, we've maintained consistent billing practices over time. We primarily bill our customers annually upfront 1 year at a time, regardless of contract term lengths. So our free cash flow results over time are comparable.  \n Let's turn to Slide 12, and here's an illustration of what's needed to get to the midpoint of our constant currency ARR guidance for fiscal '24. As you can see from the slide, to hit the midpoint of our fiscal '24 guidance range, we need $145 million of sequential ARR growth in the second half of fiscal '24. This is approximately $20 million more than we added in the second half of the previous 2 fiscal years. And in the second half of fiscal '24, we expect to benefit from Codebeamer, cross-selling ServiceMax with an aligned and enabled sales force and $10 million more of deferred ARR than we had in the second half of fiscal '23.  \n Moving on to Slide 13. Here's an illustrative constant currency ARR model for Q3 '24. You can see our results here over the past 10 quarters, and the column on the far right illustrates what's needed to get to the midpoint of our constant currency ARR guidance.  \n This illustrative model indicates that to hit the midpoint of our Q3 guidance range, we need $48 million of sequential net ARR growth. Because our ARR trends tend to see some seasonality, the most relevant comparison is the sequential growth in Q3 of fiscal '23 and Q3 of fiscal '22. We think our guidance range for Q3 of '24 and the full year balances both risk and opportunity.  \n Finally, on free cash flow, I want to reiterate the point that Neil made earlier. We continue to have a high degree of confidence in our cash flow guidance and targets due to the predictability of our cash collections and the disciplined resource allocation structure we have in place.  \n In conclusion, PTC has a strong portfolio and strategy and a great team of people with deep expertise and strong customer relationships. We're focused on disciplined and consistent execution to ensure we deliver on the value creation opportunities we have ahead of us.  \n With that, I'd like to turn the call over to the operator and begin the Q&A session. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nay Soe Naing from Berenberg. \nNay Soe Naing: Maybe if you could start with the update in your mid-term ARR growth outlook, please. Maybe break it down a little bit more in terms of -- obviously, you had reiterated your mid-teens growth outlook as recently as last quarter, it's only been probably 2 months or so now. So what's changed in those 2 months? And also, if you may, could you reference it back to the growth building blocks that you have provided in your previous earnings pack as well, please? \nNeil Barua: Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll start with the first one and Kristian could add. \n After taking over as CEO, Feb 14, I've been doing my assessment of the business, as I mentioned, across all dimensions on this one on the mid-term target and just to make sure we level set on this piece. For this year, we've updated our constant currency error guidance to 11% to 13%, as Kristian stated. For sake of understanding what low double digit means, I see that as plus or minus that range. And again, over the past 5 years, as you've been following the company, we've gone from 10% growth 1 year to 15% for an average of about 12% through varying macroeconomic conditions. \n So when I took a look at how I want to put my stamp in a credible way around the company moving forward in the view of the mid-term targets, I looked at all those variables. I also looked at the fact of the current conditions of the market and felt it was the appropriate thing to do to make the mid-term target towards that low double digits versus have the mid-teens target out there. \n Kristian, do you want to add? \nKristian Talvitie: Yes. I mean the only other thing that I would say is that every time we talk about mid-teens, we had to caveat the status of the economy and so on. So I think this is just cleaner way to do it. \nNay Soe Naing: Sorry, I literally just got disconnected and I got reconnected just now, but I'll just read the transcript afterwards. But I didn't catch any of the answers, unfortunately. \nKristian Talvitie: They were the best answers we've ever given. \nNay Soe Naing: I'm sure. So I'll eagerly wait for the transcript to come up. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Daniel Jester from BMO Capital Markets. \nDaniel Jester: Maybe on the balance sheet, you made great progress deleveraging well in advance of your leverage target that you want to hit by the end of the year. I guess, one, why not today sort of move forward with the reassessment of the capital deployment strategy. And maybe two, Neil, maybe you have any comments about how you view inorganic growth as the driver of longer-term opportunity? \nKristian Talvitie: It's Kristian. Thanks, Dan. So I think your question is around why are we not starting buybacks sooner? I guess that's maybe the gist of it. And I mean, I think I'll just try to hit it this way. Listen, we still have $2 billion-plus in debt outstanding. Interest rate environment is still not favorable. The rate on the revolving credit facility we have is almost 7%. And after today's comments by the Fed, it doesn't look like those are going to get any better anytime soon. We've got a couple of quarters left to get through the year here, and we'll revaluate. \nNeil Barua: And on the M&A piece, we've clearly done a number of M&A deals over the history of PTC. That continues to be something that we'll always look at as opportunities to accelerate the strategy of the business. However, given my assessment of the business, currently, I like the areas -- the focus areas that we are aligned towards as a company to execute across organically those priorities is extremely effectively over the next number of quarters and years. \n That being said, if there are tuck-in acquisitions or things that make a lot of sense to do, we'll always take a look at it. But currently, my focus on making sure the execution around the organic priorities of the business are well taken care of. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Ken Wong from Oppenheimer & Co. \nHoi-Fung Wong: Great. This one is for you, Kristian. On the medium-term growth, I guess, we roughly estimate that maybe $100 million is coming out of ARR, yet you guys are still able to meet free cash flow targets. I guess, should we assume you guys have that same level of confidence in hitting those targets as you did previously? \nKristian Talvitie: Yes is the short answer. \nHoi-Fung Wong: All right. Fair enough. And then for you, Neil, in terms of best practices that you're trying to implement here, I guess maybe this kind of piggybacks on what I just asked Kristian, but like what do you -- what should we expect in terms of driving that incremental operating leverage? \nNeil Barua: As you know, Ken, we've been doing a nice job. The team has been doing a nice job for many years, driving greater effectiveness within the business. But I'm focused on the stones that I'm turning is making sure within the business around how we interact with our customers, the go-to-market motions from a direct and indirect standpoint are done as effectively as we can with the best practices that are out there, but also an assessment of what's the best thing for our customers and internally here at PTC.\n G&A, we've been efficient on that. We'll continue to turn over every rock there. As I mentioned, a two-pronged strategy every year around incremental investments and then what can we take and reposition existing spend to more focused areas that could drive greater customer value and ultimately, value for all the shareholders. And so we're taking a look at that, and we'll continue to drive forward around all those vectors to make sure we're driving the business with greater focus and effectiveness as we move forward. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin from Bank of America. \nAndrew Obin: So you mentioned on the call that the selling environment has been sluggish. Has this bottomed out? And any view on what needs to happen for a macro uplift in the software environment? And also for an industrial guy, if you can point out which verticals are particularly weak, I would imagine maybe life sciences, ag, machinery, but just any color there. \nNeil Barua: I'll start, Kristian, you could add. I don't see right now any change in the selling environment. It's been tough going for at least 6 quarters now here at PTC. That didn't change in Q2 despite having solid results. So the team continues to deliver despite a challenging selling environment. We look at every metric, GDP, PMI, you name it. We have not seen a change yet given some maybe positivity, they have not turned into a trend. \n I will say from a broad base outside of industries -- outside of specific industries, the point that I think we're trying to articulate is the challenging selling environment really is punctuated in the larger deals. So these are the large digital transformation deals that are 7, 8 figure that I'm truly excited about seeing how the pipelines building on that. That continues to be challenged, the same by which it's been for the last 6-plus quarters around the large yield in getting those projects to be the key priority by which you could get the signed PO and begin implementation. \n That's the area we continue to work through. To be clear, we continue to do well around securing those, but those are the areas by which the challenging selling environment really impacts us the most, and I don't see that changing right now in the current environment. Kristian, anything to add? \nKristian Talvitie: No, I think that's right. \nAndrew Obin: And any specific verticals that just stand out as being particularly weak within certain industries? \nNeil Barua: From our perspective, we are -- I feel good about the key industry verticals that you know we play in, Andrew, doing well. Some are doing better than others. I'd say, all are going through digital transformation in a very serious manner. So we feel good about our position in those verticals. It's a question of the largest deals in those verticals. How much can we actually execute and close within a certain quarter. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays. \nSaket Kalia: Okay. Great. Neil, I'll keep it to one, just maybe for you. When you joined, I think one of the things that was really interesting that you talked about was just being more discerning about resource allocation. And maybe very specifically putting more wood behind the arrow for PLM, while maybe managing other areas like IoT and AR. And you correct me there if I'm wrong. But maybe the question is, what's the next step in that evolution. And as you think about sort of that investment in PLM, what are the areas that you want to bolster the most inside that business? Does that make sense? \nNeil Barua: Yes. Great question, Saket. And just -- I want to make sure I make this point again. We did say and I did say put wood behind more -- wood behind the arrows that matter the most for customer value. \n We already have done that, started that process. This IoT, AR, those 2 sentences I mentioned, is a very significant first move of executing across that point that I made to all of you for the last 6 months. And what that will allow us to do is make sure in the concept of PLM, as you asked, Windchill, which is this wonderful system that I referenced a great customer is now getting enterprise adoption. There is more we can do around making sure that there's 3 components. \n Number one, Windchill and the ability for all the enterprise groups that I mentioned have really understanding and visibility and viewability of the data that is coursing through an engineering group as an example, right? And so the product development around making sure the user experience, the viewing of that data is best-in-class. We're working through that with these dollars that we're repositioning from IoT, AR. \n We're working through stronger integration points by which Creo and the CAD design tools can more seamlessly move through the enterprise within Windchill. We're working through Codebeamer and Windchill integration points by which software configuration management with hardware configuration management can be even more clearly done for an enterprise. We're working through a ServiceMax-Windchill integration, and we're going to keep working through that by which product data can now be seen in the field and vice versa. So those are the 2 big themes. \n And the third other theme that we're putting wood behind the arrow within PLM is using the foundation of Windchill and all the great things that AI could do and copilots could do with a seamless data stack within Windchill. Over time, we'll work through how does that create value for our customers as well in a differentiated way for them as they use this as an enterprise system. \n So a lot of great things, Saket, happening on that. And again, theme around focus on the priorities, focus on the core, and let's bring the cavalry behind it, because our customers are really needing it and requiring us for us to show up in this manner and the opportunities is there in front of us. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. \nJay Vleeschhouwer: Neil, your comments just now an answer to Saket's question, I think touched on an important point about the portfolio, where cross-selling necessarily has the corollary of increasingly integrating products across the portfolio. So more closely coupling the products rather than loosely coupling the products. So over time, what do you think that might mean in terms of, let's say, the regularity of the business. \n SLM historically was quite a variable lumpy business. the ALM business is on a good trajectory. But as you increasingly closely couple the various 3-letter acronyms of the business, how do you think about retention? How do you think about variability of the business? \nNeil Barua: Yes. Great question. Thank you for asking, Jay. It is a journey. And as a reminder, we've done a really nice job, and it will continue to have open integrations in the environment. We're not a closed system. And when a customer looks at us, they could see best-of-breed PLM, best-of-breed CAD, best-of-breed SLM, best-of-breed ALM, and we believe we have all of them, right? But the customer can choose from that and feel okay for the interoperability with other systems that they may choose for ALM, SLM, PLM or CAD. So that will be the philosophy we continue to have. \n That being said, our customers are really pushing on us because there's real value given the credibility PTC has with them of creating even more distinct integration points, UI interfaces that are seamless between Codebeamer and Windchill. Obviously, we have a very strong tightened integration already with Creo and Windchill, we could do more with that, right? And now as you mentioned, ServiceMax, which I will correct you for a little bit, ServiceMax is a very stable recurring revenue business that is native SaaS. \n So it takes away the lumpiness from the SLM business that might have existed historically. It helps with that. But the main point strategically is as we create better value props, as I answered in Saket's question, for the customer to have product data run, [ while we through ] their enterprise for all the collaboration, time-to-market benefits, quality benefits, we believe customers will choose PTC for a greater number of those best-of-breed solutions in a one-stop shop. \n But we will make it so it's customer value-driven versus edicts from us saying it's only us you could play within a closed system versus being open. So we're taking the customer view, and I think it's going to win out, Jay, in the long term. \nJay Vleeschhouwer: In the meantime, for, let's say, the remainder of this year or early next year, how would you describe your pipeline of large deals that might have, as you saw in Q2, significantly pronounced 606 effects? Incremental, obviously, in the case of Q2, apparently in Europe, especially. So is there any way to predict the 606 effects and fold that into guidance? \nKristian Talvitie: If there was a way to predict the 606 effects, Jay, trust me, we'd be happy to share it with you. \nJay Vleeschhouwer: Understood. \nNeil Barua: The answer is we can't do that, Jay. \nJay Vleeschhouwer: Okay. Noted. \nNeil Barua: I will say, though, that the pipeline of large deals, we feel good about. It's healthy and sales team, all of us are focused on closing them. The timing of those always top, as I mentioned, but we have a really nice pipeline that's been growing on those large-sized deals across the world, quite frankly. So we feel good about what we're entering in the second half year. \nKristian Talvitie: And Jay, not trying to be snarky about the 606 thing. I mean you will remember that the main drivers are the kind of contract and there's the upfront contracts and there's the ratable contracts, the term length of the contract. So those are probably the 2 main drivers. Term length we can try and incent customers to move in a certain direction. But ultimately, they're going to make the right decision for them. And that includes both on new and renewal -- new and renewal transactions. \n And then as it relates to the ratable versus the upfront contracts, we still have a small base of perpetual support that we're still converting. So every time that happens, you're taking a ratable contract and moving it to an upfront contract. We have -- we're -- as you know, transitioning customers to SaaS. So every time you do that, you're taking an upfront contract and moving into a ratable contract. The moving parts, the volatility is -- well, you get the picture. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Stephen Tusa from JPMorgan. \nC. Stephen Tusa: So the net new ARR has been up nicely the last couple of quarters. You have it guided, I guess, down just year-over-year. You can kind of like cut these numbers any way you want. But any -- is that a reflection of the macro you were talking about? And then when does this now $10 million of deferred go live? Are you expecting that in the 3Q or the 4Q? \nKristian Talvitie: So let's start the -- I guess, we'll go in reverse order. The $10 million of deferred is also split probably pretty evenly between Q3 and Q4. The other $10 million, let's just be clear, those are still contractual commitments that will -- that have just moved to a future period, right? So they haven't gone away. They've just gotten larger and moved to a future period. \n In terms of the macro. Again, I think Neil mentioned earlier, we haven't really seen any change really in any direction here over the past few quarters. And as it relates to tying that back to Q2 results, Q3 guidance in any given quarter, there can be a little volatility around lumpiness of deals, start dates and prediction of those that can cause minor swings in either direction. So all in all, we're pleased with the results for Q2. We think we've set the Q3 guidance appropriately and steady as she goes. \nC. Stephen Tusa: And then just one last one on the -- in the appendix, you had in the last presentation, I believe, guided for like cash taxes in '25 and '26. I think it was -- that wasn't in the appendix this time around. Anything moving around on that cash tax guide for the next couple of years? \nKristian Talvitie: No, not specifically. I think we were just trying to again, tighten up the disclosures. And it was -- to be honest, it was a little weird. We were giving points on certain line items and not other line items. And so we just tidied up the more detailed disclosures to fiscal '24. And otherwise, we remain on target for the other -- for '25 and '26. But there is... \nC. Stephen Tusa: Sorry, one more just to get Neil involved. Is there a dynamic here where your customers are evaluating their IT budgets in regard to AI and that's slowing these pipelines from closing because they've obviously been faced with a different kind of choice that seems like a bit generational in nature. And so is that something you're seeing as far as these extended close rates that there's potentially a bit of reallocation into these new technologies? \nNeil Barua: Absolutely not. And the reason why I say it was such firmness is because in our segment of the market, there is plenty of POC-ing and experimentation and conversations. And what I will say is we're involved in those, right, on a fair number of them. Because while I'm not coming out promoting this on calls like my other peers, we are building and working through a number of ideas around practical use cases for copilots. We've actually put out, like I mentioned last earnings call, a beta for GenAI solution for service that we're getting good feedback on. \n Where I'm going with this, Steve, is that I believe that AI is not taken away from IT prioritization currently as they're thinking through what the POCs are and what the use cases are, and quite frankly, what they're going to do with it. And vice versa, what are vendors actually going to charge for. So we've got some work to do as an industry around it. I actually think it will happen, but there's no way in which causing anything different than the selling environment because now we have an AI coming on the top of ERP, CRM or PLM migrations. \n We still are at the top of the heap in terms of the large systems because lastly, and I'll summarize this, I think most of our customers have realized that a digital foundation is necessary before you do anything practical on AI at scale. And that's why you need a system like what we have to offer a PLM, ALM, CAD, SLM, and I think the customer base is primed for that. So we feel good about that dynamic, Steve. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Blair Abernethy from Rosenblatt Securities. \nBlair Abernethy: Neil, just one more on the product side, Onshape, CAD, Arena PLM, that's SaaS part of the business, how is adoption going there and growth rates in those businesses? How are they faring this year? And then secondly, as you look to deemphasize some of the other areas, AR and IoT as an example, would that be something you would consider spinning off at some point? \nNeil Barua: So on Onshape and Arena, I want to be clear. Those are very important parts of our business. I'm not talking to them on a call like this up until a question is asked. Because the 5 focus areas drive the greatest amount of customer value and ultimately, economic value for us currently. \n Now the Onshape and Arena team are tasked with getting on those 5 priority lists, sooner rather than later, and they are working hard at that. And what I will give you color on is I'm very enthused about what's happening in Onshape right now. I think the dynamic of a great product at a time when we have the openness, the customer friendliness of that tool in a SaaS platform is a huge differentiator versus the others that are out there, right, outside of PTC. So we feel good about the strategic positioning. I feel good about what I'm seeing so far in terms of Onshape momentum, and we're keeping a close eye as that evolves around the momentum and by which that becomes part of the top 5 priorities of the company. \n Arena, similarly, we're seeing good trends there. PLM, they have a very strong set of capabilities, particularly with supply chain. And the module there is catching some really interesting themes. I feel good about the progress we're seeing in Arena for the last couple of quarters. We're staying close to them and making sure that, that momentum builds. \n But in summary, those 2 businesses, I'm actually really rooting for them with the resources they have, with the attention that they've got from a great leader in Dave Katzman to make sure that they make it on the high priority list. They're not being ignored, they got the momentum and we're making sure that we take advantage of that scale. \n And so that just answers your last question. I'm more focused on making sure Onshape creates a disruptive force in the competitive market right now and build on the momentum versus anything else outside the business. So I'm looking forward to their continued -- continued recognition and their support as well as productivity within PTC. \n One thing, sorry to interrupt because I think it is important to make this point to the team here. We're not abandoning IoT and AR. We're absolutely not abandoning those 2 areas. And I'll take AR first. AR, we're not doing stand-alone applications, new product road map, expending resources for things that are discrete markets that have very little tied to our core systems. \n So that -- those cost items and more importantly the focus will be built upon AR tools that actually make sense within our core systems like Windchill, ServiceMax, et cetera, versus stand-alone applications, which has been the case for the last few years. So we're stopping that. We're still going to support the current customers because that's important since they're part of the entire ecosystem and similarly in IoT, we'll make sure that we support what we've done in SCO, SCP, but position that IoT strength that ThingWorx capability to enable this Windchill expansion in the enterprise. And so we're positioning that to be the emphasis and where we allocate the cost, not an abandonment, whatsoever. It's a repositioning of the focus of where IoT and AR technologies actually makes sense for us. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. \nMatthew Hedberg: We've spent a lot of time in the past, it feels like several years talking about above-average PLM growth, but seeing CAD continued to grow double digits is really impressive. I guess when you think about -- obviously, macros remain still a bit uneven, but like what are the core drivers there beyond just SaaS, which Creo+ is still early. I guess what I'm trying to get is like this above pure growth rate. How do we explain it? Because it's a question that we often get from folks and it feels like you guys continue to outperform on that line item. \nNeil Barua: So I'll start, and Kristian, if you want to add anything. The -- you're right. We are happy with what we're seeing in terms of our CAD growth rate. And I believe, given my work on this and talking to customers, it's because we have a really great product in Creo. And subsequent to that, we have a growing, very small business in Onshape, right? \n That's as I mentioned, doing well, and we expect to do even better as the years come by, given the competitive dynamic. So I believe we have a really strong product. I also believe tying this into, as I mentioned, the customer example of the med tech company that's deploying Windchill. What I didn't mention is they had disparate CAD systems as well. And when they went through the Windchill consolidation to make sure Windchill seats expanded within the enterprise, they actually did the same thing with their CAD systems, right? Which helped the business for PTC on that area. So there's a level of customers seeing the digital thread and having PTC be part of that, that's helping, I think, the CAD piece. And so that's one theme. \n And then two is, around the world, there has been more interest and movement from 2D to 3D. In Japan, that I was in just a couple -- a month ago, the world is still in 2D. They are now moving to digitize, and that's moving to 3D models, which allows for potentially Creo and Onshape to be competitive, some of the offerings out there. \n So there's a bit of the competitive positioning occurring. I don't think it's the majority of the growth, but it helps us as we display some of the seats in other competitors with some of the dynamics that we have with the full portfolio. \nKristian Talvitie: Yes. And then, of course, in addition, I know everybody knows this, but the model, we've talked about that before the subscription model, the sales model that we have or contracting model also adds to that growth rate. \nMatthew Hedberg: Appreciate it, guys. Well done. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Joshua Tilton from Wolfe Research. \nArsenije Matovic: This is Arsenije Matovic on for Joshua Tilton. Just a quick question on indirect performance versus direct channel. I think indirect was diluted from growth, about 2 points on a tougher comp. I guess, what's your expectations for the performance of the channel throughout the year? Are they facing any macro headwinds that direct channel isn't facing? And then one brief follow-up. \nNeil Barua: Yes. I've been spending much more time with the channel had out there in Europe with some of our bigger ones next week. What I'll say is, we're -- and under my leadership, we're really making sure the channel is operating with the same sort of energy and focus as the direct side, which, as you could see, we've been delivering solid results on. \n And by that, I mean, how do we really position our channel partners to really think through the driving of the pipeline and the bookings and the ARR growth that we've been seeing on the direct side and the consistency that we've been showing. And so we're working through that through enablement, through, again, prioritizing the focus areas, showing them what's been working, et cetera, supporting them like I will be next week. \n So we're making sure that we revitalize the trend lines of the channel to deliver the growth on ARR versus just renewed deals. And so we're going to push on that. And I have a high expectation that if we have the channel partner, they must also deliver the same type of results as we're seeing and pushing our direct teams to do so. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Adam Borg from Stifel. \nAdam Borg: Awesome. Maybe for Neil. Obviously, it's great to hear the strategy around the 5 focus areas. And just maybe drilling into the fifth area of SaaS. Maybe just an update on how Creo+, the Windchill+ are resonating. Obviously, we've talked about this being a decade-long journey. But maybe just give us an update on how these conversations are going and how we should think about that in the coming years. \nNeil Barua: Sure. Great question. It is a priority. We continue to build momentum there. We have not slowed down in terms of our approach, our customer conversations and our intensity to make sure we work through all the automation and back-office elements to make the experience really great. We're working through a number of conversions where we're learning a lot and making sure we continue to sharpen our sword, so to speak, to make sure the next conversion happens more seamlessly. \n As I mentioned, to reiterate, I see this as a 10-plus year journey. We will do it hand-in-hand with customers so the experience is good. So I think that's been working well. We've also put out new releases of Windchill+ specific to the med device sector, that has greater emphasis around compliance and regulatory issues that we've embedded into our product. We're looking forward to continued view of how that is received in the marketplace. \n So we are not laying off the accelerator within our Plus strategy across even Creo. We're just -- we're putting out a release now, Creo+. So we continue to invest into it. Again, it will be a long journey. As I mentioned, I view 10-plus years. It might happen earlier. We're building the rep, so to speak, to make sure that we're ready for at-scale conversion into our Plus strategy, and we continue to invest our resources and attention on that front and feel progress is okay to good on that front over the last few quarters. \nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink from Baird. \nJoseph Vruwink: Neil, just going back to the big deals in PLM, this is something we're hearing more regularly as well, particularly, it seems like it comes up as part of enterprise ERP decisions. But also, the feedback seems to be more recently that customers just need to end up spending more time studying what PLM can do and the studying process and I think appreciating the workloads that matter, it just contributes to longer sales cycles. \n So I'm wondering if you could maybe characterize how you think about close rate assumptions on this big pipeline. And if you converted at a high rate and these are very large ACV deals, what might that mean for kind of the upper bound of ranges? I imagine the low double-digit ARR growth rate, you're talking about that's probably more of a base case planning assumption. So I guess I'm poking at what the upper end of ranges could be ultimately. \nNeil Barua: Yes. So we have a broad portfolio, not just large PLM expansion deals or displacements to be clear, right? And there's some parts of the portfolio are faster cycle, close rates, some are longer. Very large deals, to your point, like PLM deals take a while given some of the closing dynamics that we mentioned. \n What I can say is I can't predict when the close rate and selling environment changes. I'm not smart enough to tell you when the world gets steadier, geopolitics becomes less of an issue, interest rate, whatever all the dynamics that causes stress in the system for our customers, I can't predict that. \n But what I can do is control the level of conversations, the clarity of describing to our customers the value of enterprise PLM, which is what we're internally working on in execution to the external market by which they all know that if you don't deploy enterprise PLM, you as a product company will no longer exist in a few years. \n And I fundamentally believe that, that is how important a construct of PLM is to our customers, because cycle times, new product introductions, quality, collaboration across the entire enterprise to deliver great products and customer experience. If you don't do that, we're seeing it across the board, you're dead. And I believe our job is to show what others have already done at PTC using Windchill as well as ALM, CAD as well as SLM and make sure we show the business value. \n And so if you just heard what's happening internally, we're working through that aggressively so that this conversation becomes an easier way in which the customers can see, even if I'm in a stressed macro environment, I need this. Because many customers are already doing this, as you can see from results, but there's plenty more of wood to chop for us. And if the selling environment changes and we have a large pipeline, you guys do math better than me, clearly, we have greater opportunity to execute around ARR growth, that's higher than what we put in terms of our aspirations, but I'm not assuming that until I see that change. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our Q&A session. I would like to turn the call over back to Neil for closing remarks. \nNeil Barua: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Here's what's ahead specific to investor conferences. May 14, Kevin Wrenn, our CPO, will attend the Bank of America Industrials Conference in New York; May 20, KT and I will be at the JPMorgan Conference in Boston; Early June, KT will attend the Baird Conference on the 4th and the Wolfe Conference on the 5th in New York City. On June 4, I'll attend the Stifel Conference in Boston. PTC will also join 2 virtual conferences this quarter, KT at the BMO Conference on June 11, and Steve Dertien, our CTO, will attend the Rosenblatt Conference on June 12. \n On behalf of the entire PTC team, thank you again, and we look forward to engaging with you. \nKristian Talvitie: Thanks, everyone. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Neil Barua",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt. I'm proud of what the PTC team accomplished during our second fiscal quarter. We again delivered solid results, which Kristian will take you through in detail. This quarter continues to demonstrate that PTC is on the right track and that our portfolio of products is resonating with customers. Before going into more detail about our strategy and discussing some proof points from the quarter, I'd like to address our mid-term targets, which we have updated today.  \n To be clear, we are not changing our cash flow guidance. What we have updated is our mid-term ARR growth targets. We are now targeting constant currency ARR growth in the low double digits over the mid-term, which is consistent with the performance we have delivered over the past 5 years through varying macroeconomic conditions.  \n In addition, we feel very good about our ability to hit our cash flow targets even while we appropriately reinvest into the business for product development. This is because we have a disciplined process to manage our internal spending based on the level of ARR growth we are seeing.  \n This year, as an example, our internal spend framework assumed 10% to 12% ARR growth. In addition to adding incremental investment to drive multiyear growth, we are also proactively managing our existing spend. We are able to do this effectively by leveraging the skill sets of our global R&D teams where we could shift the focus of these resources towards the product areas that create the greatest customer value.  \n In addition, we have confidence in generating increasing operating leverage from our go-to-market and G&A teams. The investments we make are aligned to the market environment and our 5 focus areas to ensure appropriate resource allocation towards the areas that create the greatest customer value.  \n As an example, we are currently in the process of rebalancing resources primarily in R&D, away from creating new stand-alone IoT and AR applications to instead support PLM, ALM and SLM growth. While these are not huge movements of people and there will not be a restructuring charge associated with this, it is an example of how we plan to put a greater focus on driving our priorities more effectively.  \n As a reminder, our 5 focus areas include: number one, PLM, which has driven primarily by our Windchill product; number two, ALM, which is driven by our Codebeamer product; number three, SLM, which is primarily driven by ServiceMax; number four, CAD, which is driven primarily by Creo; and lastly, number five, our continued focus on SaaS.  \n I'd like to turn now to discuss 2 of our focus areas to illustrate the significant value we bring to customers. This quarter, I'll touch on what we have been seeing with customers of our Windchill PLM and ServiceMax SLM products.  \n Starting with PLM. This is product life cycle management, and Windchill is our flagship PLM product. PLM systems tend to be highly configured, really sticky and our mission-critical system of record for our customers. This is software that historically had the function of helping CAD engineers keep track of their CAD files. Part of the reason PTC's growth has been so solid over the last few years is because PLM systems have grown in importance at product companies.  \n Today's products are more complex, typically with embedded electronics and software and even the mechanical components are now more complex. To drive revenue growth, product companies have become increasingly focused on producing more variants of their products.  \n Mixing certain hardware configurations with other software configurations, while at the same time, compressing the time it takes to get new products to market. That's a tall order. Simply put, product companies that offer multiple configurations of their products face a diversity and scale challenge. And sooner or later, it becomes clear to these companies that having an advanced PLM system is a strategic necessity. \n In general, manufacturing companies have a long way to go in terms of their digital transformation journeys. When a product company gets really serious about optimizing and automating their workflows, we tend to see large PLM expansion projects. This creates a step function increase in ARR as customers expand their Windchill deployments in terms of both seats and functionality.  \n This is what we saw in a leading medical equipment company with over $5 billion of annual revenue and 20,000 employees, getting new products to market faster is a top business priority for them. As a first step, they standardize on Windchill within R&D across all their business divisions and harmonize their engineering practices related to product changes and configuration management. By doing this, they established a solid engineering foundation that ensures the traceability work performed and updates made for both productivity gains and also to remain compliant with regulations.  \n Before standardizing on Windchill, this customer did not have an authoritative source of truth for their product data. So whenever they ran into conflicting product data in their system, they lost a lot of time figuring out why that happened and what to do about it.\n While the first step for this customer was expanding Windchill within R&D, they also want to accelerate their new product introduction time lines. To do this, they needed to drive earlier collaboration around new products, across other operational functions outside of R&D. To accomplish this goal, they decided to leverage their Windchill system as a backbone for enterprise-wide collaboration around product data, and they expanded their Windchill deployment to teams, including manufacturing, supply chain, quality, regulatory, compliance and marketing. For example, providing the supply chain team with relevant product data earlier in the process enables any issues around component availability or component pricing to be identified earlier resulting in less need for products to be redesigned or reworked later.  \n Turning to the second customer example for today, which is about cross-selling service mix, SLM into our base. First, a reminder that SLM is service lifecycle management, and our main product here is ServiceMax, which we acquired a little over a year ago.  \n ServiceMax is the industry leader in field service management for high-value long lifecycle products. Our customers are not only facing complexity challenges, competitive pressures have also increased.  \n Globalization has forced companies to be more efficient if they want to remain competitive. They are looking for new steady sources of top line growth and margin expansion.  \n In order to drive scalable service revenue expanding their focus with digital tools on their services operations is key. The example I want to highlight here is one of the largest elevator companies in the world with billions in annual revenue. After struggling with disparate disconnected systems that got in the way of providing good service to their customers, they decided to embark on a complete service transformation to improve both the growth and profitability of their services business.  \n In the future, when their service technicians go into the field to service an elevator, they will know, using the ServiceMax application about the specific elevator so they bring the right parts to the work site. They will know the service history and have service instructions for that specific elevator. And of course, they'll be scheduled and routed efficiently to the job site.  \n Furthermore, the elevator business is highly regulated and the ServiceMax application will ease the regulatory compliance burden by having traceable records of the work performed during service calls. This is how ServiceMax helps our customers.  \n We've been focused on cross-selling ServiceMax into our strong base of customers where we have established customer trust. As of the start of fiscal '24, we aligned the PTC sales team with the ServiceMax sales thresholds to go to market together. And this collaboration played a big role in getting this deal across the finish line.  \n We also remain encouraged by our other focus areas that I didn't provide examples for this quarter, which are Codebeamer ALM, CAD and SaaS. In each of our 5 focus areas, we made incremental progress during Q2 towards executing in a scalable fashion and focusing our investments on the product advancements that customers care the most about.  \n As many of you know, during my transition period before taking over as CEO, I spent time listening to employees, digging into our product strategy, speaking with customers and partners to understand their needs and how we address them. As a result of the time I spend on this, I feel good about our product portfolio and strategy, which guides our 5 focus areas. You should expect to see a continued emphasis on focusing our resources in the areas that create the greatest customer value and where we have a right to win.  \n I've also started to focus on our operations. I begin to examine where we excel and have room for improvement. As you know, PTC has been on a multiyear journey to improve efficiencies. But my early observations are that PTC will benefit from a fresh look at innovative ways to continue to drive operational improvements. I'm turning over lots of stones, and we'll look at everything to usher in a new phase of focus and effectiveness across the entire company.  \n With that, I'll hand the call over to Kristian to take you through our Q2 financial results. Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll start with the first one and Kristian could add. \n After taking over as CEO, Feb 14, I've been doing my assessment of the business, as I mentioned, across all dimensions on this one on the mid-term target and just to make sure we level set on this piece. For this year, we've updated our constant currency error guidance to 11% to 13%, as Kristian stated. For sake of understanding what low double digit means, I see that as plus or minus that range. And again, over the past 5 years, as you've been following the company, we've gone from 10% growth 1 year to 15% for an average of about 12% through varying macroeconomic conditions. \n So when I took a look at how I want to put my stamp in a credible way around the company moving forward in the view of the mid-term targets, I looked at all those variables. I also looked at the fact of the current conditions of the market and felt it was the appropriate thing to do to make the mid-term target towards that low double digits versus have the mid-teens target out there. \n Kristian, do you want to add? And on the M&A piece, we've clearly done a number of M&A deals over the history of PTC. That continues to be something that we'll always look at as opportunities to accelerate the strategy of the business. However, given my assessment of the business, currently, I like the areas -- the focus areas that we are aligned towards as a company to execute across organically those priorities is extremely effectively over the next number of quarters and years. \n That being said, if there are tuck-in acquisitions or things that make a lot of sense to do, we'll always take a look at it. But currently, my focus on making sure the execution around the organic priorities of the business are well taken care of. As you know, Ken, we've been doing a nice job. The team has been doing a nice job for many years, driving greater effectiveness within the business. But I'm focused on the stones that I'm turning is making sure within the business around how we interact with our customers, the go-to-market motions from a direct and indirect standpoint are done as effectively as we can with the best practices that are out there, but also an assessment of what's the best thing for our customers and internally here at PTC.\n G&A, we've been efficient on that. We'll continue to turn over every rock there. As I mentioned, a two-pronged strategy every year around incremental investments and then what can we take and reposition existing spend to more focused areas that could drive greater customer value and ultimately, value for all the shareholders. And so we're taking a look at that, and we'll continue to drive forward around all those vectors to make sure we're driving the business with greater focus and effectiveness as we move forward. I'll start, Kristian, you could add. I don't see right now any change in the selling environment. It's been tough going for at least 6 quarters now here at PTC. That didn't change in Q2 despite having solid results. So the team continues to deliver despite a challenging selling environment. We look at every metric, GDP, PMI, you name it. We have not seen a change yet given some maybe positivity, they have not turned into a trend. \n I will say from a broad base outside of industries -- outside of specific industries, the point that I think we're trying to articulate is the challenging selling environment really is punctuated in the larger deals. So these are the large digital transformation deals that are 7, 8 figure that I'm truly excited about seeing how the pipelines building on that. That continues to be challenged, the same by which it's been for the last 6-plus quarters around the large yield in getting those projects to be the key priority by which you could get the signed PO and begin implementation. \n That's the area we continue to work through. To be clear, we continue to do well around securing those, but those are the areas by which the challenging selling environment really impacts us the most, and I don't see that changing right now in the current environment. Kristian, anything to add? From our perspective, we are -- I feel good about the key industry verticals that you know we play in, Andrew, doing well. Some are doing better than others. I'd say, all are going through digital transformation in a very serious manner. So we feel good about our position in those verticals. It's a question of the largest deals in those verticals. How much can we actually execute and close within a certain quarter. Yes. Great question, Saket. And just -- I want to make sure I make this point again. We did say and I did say put wood behind more -- wood behind the arrows that matter the most for customer value. \n We already have done that, started that process. This IoT, AR, those 2 sentences I mentioned, is a very significant first move of executing across that point that I made to all of you for the last 6 months. And what that will allow us to do is make sure in the concept of PLM, as you asked, Windchill, which is this wonderful system that I referenced a great customer is now getting enterprise adoption. There is more we can do around making sure that there's 3 components. \n Number one, Windchill and the ability for all the enterprise groups that I mentioned have really understanding and visibility and viewability of the data that is coursing through an engineering group as an example, right? And so the product development around making sure the user experience, the viewing of that data is best-in-class. We're working through that with these dollars that we're repositioning from IoT, AR. \n We're working through stronger integration points by which Creo and the CAD design tools can more seamlessly move through the enterprise within Windchill. We're working through Codebeamer and Windchill integration points by which software configuration management with hardware configuration management can be even more clearly done for an enterprise. We're working through a ServiceMax-Windchill integration, and we're going to keep working through that by which product data can now be seen in the field and vice versa. So those are the 2 big themes. \n And the third other theme that we're putting wood behind the arrow within PLM is using the foundation of Windchill and all the great things that AI could do and copilots could do with a seamless data stack within Windchill. Over time, we'll work through how does that create value for our customers as well in a differentiated way for them as they use this as an enterprise system. \n So a lot of great things, Saket, happening on that. And again, theme around focus on the priorities, focus on the core, and let's bring the cavalry behind it, because our customers are really needing it and requiring us for us to show up in this manner and the opportunities is there in front of us. Yes. Great question. Thank you for asking, Jay. It is a journey. And as a reminder, we've done a really nice job, and it will continue to have open integrations in the environment. We're not a closed system. And when a customer looks at us, they could see best-of-breed PLM, best-of-breed CAD, best-of-breed SLM, best-of-breed ALM, and we believe we have all of them, right? But the customer can choose from that and feel okay for the interoperability with other systems that they may choose for ALM, SLM, PLM or CAD. So that will be the philosophy we continue to have. \n That being said, our customers are really pushing on us because there's real value given the credibility PTC has with them of creating even more distinct integration points, UI interfaces that are seamless between Codebeamer and Windchill. Obviously, we have a very strong tightened integration already with Creo and Windchill, we could do more with that, right? And now as you mentioned, ServiceMax, which I will correct you for a little bit, ServiceMax is a very stable recurring revenue business that is native SaaS. \n So it takes away the lumpiness from the SLM business that might have existed historically. It helps with that. But the main point strategically is as we create better value props, as I answered in Saket's question, for the customer to have product data run, [ while we through ] their enterprise for all the collaboration, time-to-market benefits, quality benefits, we believe customers will choose PTC for a greater number of those best-of-breed solutions in a one-stop shop. \n But we will make it so it's customer value-driven versus edicts from us saying it's only us you could play within a closed system versus being open. So we're taking the customer view, and I think it's going to win out, Jay, in the long term. The answer is we can't do that, Jay. I will say, though, that the pipeline of large deals, we feel good about. It's healthy and sales team, all of us are focused on closing them. The timing of those always top, as I mentioned, but we have a really nice pipeline that's been growing on those large-sized deals across the world, quite frankly. So we feel good about what we're entering in the second half year. Absolutely not. And the reason why I say it was such firmness is because in our segment of the market, there is plenty of POC-ing and experimentation and conversations. And what I will say is we're involved in those, right, on a fair number of them. Because while I'm not coming out promoting this on calls like my other peers, we are building and working through a number of ideas around practical use cases for copilots. We've actually put out, like I mentioned last earnings call, a beta for GenAI solution for service that we're getting good feedback on. \n Where I'm going with this, Steve, is that I believe that AI is not taken away from IT prioritization currently as they're thinking through what the POCs are and what the use cases are, and quite frankly, what they're going to do with it. And vice versa, what are vendors actually going to charge for. So we've got some work to do as an industry around it. I actually think it will happen, but there's no way in which causing anything different than the selling environment because now we have an AI coming on the top of ERP, CRM or PLM migrations. \n We still are at the top of the heap in terms of the large systems because lastly, and I'll summarize this, I think most of our customers have realized that a digital foundation is necessary before you do anything practical on AI at scale. And that's why you need a system like what we have to offer a PLM, ALM, CAD, SLM, and I think the customer base is primed for that. So we feel good about that dynamic, Steve. So on Onshape and Arena, I want to be clear. Those are very important parts of our business. I'm not talking to them on a call like this up until a question is asked. Because the 5 focus areas drive the greatest amount of customer value and ultimately, economic value for us currently. \n Now the Onshape and Arena team are tasked with getting on those 5 priority lists, sooner rather than later, and they are working hard at that. And what I will give you color on is I'm very enthused about what's happening in Onshape right now. I think the dynamic of a great product at a time when we have the openness, the customer friendliness of that tool in a SaaS platform is a huge differentiator versus the others that are out there, right, outside of PTC. So we feel good about the strategic positioning. I feel good about what I'm seeing so far in terms of Onshape momentum, and we're keeping a close eye as that evolves around the momentum and by which that becomes part of the top 5 priorities of the company. \n Arena, similarly, we're seeing good trends there. PLM, they have a very strong set of capabilities, particularly with supply chain. And the module there is catching some really interesting themes. I feel good about the progress we're seeing in Arena for the last couple of quarters. We're staying close to them and making sure that, that momentum builds. \n But in summary, those 2 businesses, I'm actually really rooting for them with the resources they have, with the attention that they've got from a great leader in Dave Katzman to make sure that they make it on the high priority list. They're not being ignored, they got the momentum and we're making sure that we take advantage of that scale. \n And so that just answers your last question. I'm more focused on making sure Onshape creates a disruptive force in the competitive market right now and build on the momentum versus anything else outside the business. So I'm looking forward to their continued -- continued recognition and their support as well as productivity within PTC. \n One thing, sorry to interrupt because I think it is important to make this point to the team here. We're not abandoning IoT and AR. We're absolutely not abandoning those 2 areas. And I'll take AR first. AR, we're not doing stand-alone applications, new product road map, expending resources for things that are discrete markets that have very little tied to our core systems. \n So that -- those cost items and more importantly the focus will be built upon AR tools that actually make sense within our core systems like Windchill, ServiceMax, et cetera, versus stand-alone applications, which has been the case for the last few years. So we're stopping that. We're still going to support the current customers because that's important since they're part of the entire ecosystem and similarly in IoT, we'll make sure that we support what we've done in SCO, SCP, but position that IoT strength that ThingWorx capability to enable this Windchill expansion in the enterprise. And so we're positioning that to be the emphasis and where we allocate the cost, not an abandonment, whatsoever. It's a repositioning of the focus of where IoT and AR technologies actually makes sense for us. So I'll start, and Kristian, if you want to add anything. The -- you're right. We are happy with what we're seeing in terms of our CAD growth rate. And I believe, given my work on this and talking to customers, it's because we have a really great product in Creo. And subsequent to that, we have a growing, very small business in Onshape, right? \n That's as I mentioned, doing well, and we expect to do even better as the years come by, given the competitive dynamic. So I believe we have a really strong product. I also believe tying this into, as I mentioned, the customer example of the med tech company that's deploying Windchill. What I didn't mention is they had disparate CAD systems as well. And when they went through the Windchill consolidation to make sure Windchill seats expanded within the enterprise, they actually did the same thing with their CAD systems, right? Which helped the business for PTC on that area. So there's a level of customers seeing the digital thread and having PTC be part of that, that's helping, I think, the CAD piece. And so that's one theme. \n And then two is, around the world, there has been more interest and movement from 2D to 3D. In Japan, that I was in just a couple -- a month ago, the world is still in 2D. They are now moving to digitize, and that's moving to 3D models, which allows for potentially Creo and Onshape to be competitive, some of the offerings out there. \n So there's a bit of the competitive positioning occurring. I don't think it's the majority of the growth, but it helps us as we display some of the seats in other competitors with some of the dynamics that we have with the full portfolio. Yes. I've been spending much more time with the channel had out there in Europe with some of our bigger ones next week. What I'll say is, we're -- and under my leadership, we're really making sure the channel is operating with the same sort of energy and focus as the direct side, which, as you could see, we've been delivering solid results on. \n And by that, I mean, how do we really position our channel partners to really think through the driving of the pipeline and the bookings and the ARR growth that we've been seeing on the direct side and the consistency that we've been showing. And so we're working through that through enablement, through, again, prioritizing the focus areas, showing them what's been working, et cetera, supporting them like I will be next week. \n So we're making sure that we revitalize the trend lines of the channel to deliver the growth on ARR versus just renewed deals. And so we're going to push on that. And I have a high expectation that if we have the channel partner, they must also deliver the same type of results as we're seeing and pushing our direct teams to do so. Sure. Great question. It is a priority. We continue to build momentum there. We have not slowed down in terms of our approach, our customer conversations and our intensity to make sure we work through all the automation and back-office elements to make the experience really great. We're working through a number of conversions where we're learning a lot and making sure we continue to sharpen our sword, so to speak, to make sure the next conversion happens more seamlessly. \n As I mentioned, to reiterate, I see this as a 10-plus year journey. We will do it hand-in-hand with customers so the experience is good. So I think that's been working well. We've also put out new releases of Windchill+ specific to the med device sector, that has greater emphasis around compliance and regulatory issues that we've embedded into our product. We're looking forward to continued view of how that is received in the marketplace. \n So we are not laying off the accelerator within our Plus strategy across even Creo. We're just -- we're putting out a release now, Creo+. So we continue to invest into it. Again, it will be a long journey. As I mentioned, I view 10-plus years. It might happen earlier. We're building the rep, so to speak, to make sure that we're ready for at-scale conversion into our Plus strategy, and we continue to invest our resources and attention on that front and feel progress is okay to good on that front over the last few quarters. Yes. So we have a broad portfolio, not just large PLM expansion deals or displacements to be clear, right? And there's some parts of the portfolio are faster cycle, close rates, some are longer. Very large deals, to your point, like PLM deals take a while given some of the closing dynamics that we mentioned. \n What I can say is I can't predict when the close rate and selling environment changes. I'm not smart enough to tell you when the world gets steadier, geopolitics becomes less of an issue, interest rate, whatever all the dynamics that causes stress in the system for our customers, I can't predict that. \n But what I can do is control the level of conversations, the clarity of describing to our customers the value of enterprise PLM, which is what we're internally working on in execution to the external market by which they all know that if you don't deploy enterprise PLM, you as a product company will no longer exist in a few years. \n And I fundamentally believe that, that is how important a construct of PLM is to our customers, because cycle times, new product introductions, quality, collaboration across the entire enterprise to deliver great products and customer experience. If you don't do that, we're seeing it across the board, you're dead. And I believe our job is to show what others have already done at PTC using Windchill as well as ALM, CAD as well as SLM and make sure we show the business value. \n And so if you just heard what's happening internally, we're working through that aggressively so that this conversation becomes an easier way in which the customers can see, even if I'm in a stressed macro environment, I need this. Because many customers are already doing this, as you can see from results, but there's plenty more of wood to chop for us. And if the selling environment changes and we have a large pipeline, you guys do math better than me, clearly, we have greater opportunity to execute around ARR growth, that's higher than what we put in terms of our aspirations, but I'm not assuming that until I see that change. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Here's what's ahead specific to investor conferences. May 14, Kevin Wrenn, our CPO, will attend the Bank of America Industrials Conference in New York; May 20, KT and I will be at the JPMorgan Conference in Boston; Early June, KT will attend the Baird Conference on the 4th and the Wolfe Conference on the 5th in New York City. On June 4, I'll attend the Stifel Conference in Boston. PTC will also join 2 virtual conferences this quarter, KT at the BMO Conference on June 11, and Steve Dertien, our CTO, will attend the Rosenblatt Conference on June 12. \n On behalf of the entire PTC team, thank you again, and we look forward to engaging with you."

            "name": "Kristian Talvitie",
            "content": "Thanks, Neil. Hello, everyone. Starting off with Slide 8. PTC, again, delivered solid financial results in terms of both ARR and free cash flow in a challenging selling environment. As you know, we believe ARR and free cash flow are the most important metrics to assess the performance of our business.  \n To help investors understand our business performance, excluding the impact of FX volatility, we provide ARR guidance and disclose our ARR results on a constant currency basis. At the end of Q2, our constant currency ARR was $2.075 billion, up 12% year-over-year and above our guidance range. Note that we acquired ServiceMax in Q2 of fiscal '23, so we're no longer excluding ServiceMax from our organic ARR results. \n In Q2 '24, our cash flow results also came in ahead of our guidance with operating cash flow of $251 million and free cash flow of $247 million, both of which were up 19% year-over-year. Our cash flow performance is driven by our ARR and operating efficiency. And in Q2, we extended our track record of disciplined operational management while continuing to invest in our key focus areas.  \n Turning to Slide 9. Let's look at our ARR growth at a more detailed level. Starting with our product groups in CAD, we delivered 11% constant currency ARR growth in Q2 with the growth primarily driven by Creo. In PLM, our constant currency ARR growth was 13%, primarily driven by Windchill. Despite the overall demand environment, which has been sluggish for many quarters now, our top line has shown good resilience. Our solid ARR growth is supported by our unique portfolio with a solid footprint and higher growth segments of the market and the digital transformation journeys of our customers. These underlying strengths are further supported by our subscription model, our low churn rate and the propensity for our customer base to prioritize their own R&D investments through challenging times. \n Moving to our ARR by region. Our constant currency organic ARR growth was solid across Americas, Europe and APAC, with growth in the low to mid-double digits. Across all regions, our year-over-year organic constant currency growth rates in Q2 were similar to the growth rates we saw in Q1.  \n Moving to Slide 10. First of all, given the consistency and predictability of our free cash flow, we aim to maintain a low cash balance. And as you know, our long-term goal, assuming our debt-to-EBITDA ratio is below 3x, remains to return approximately 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases while also taking into consideration the interest rate environment and strategic opportunities.  \n So given the strategic acquisitions, namely ServiceMax and Codebeamer that we've done over the past 2 years, we paused our share repurchase program. And as we've said before, we intend to use substantially all of our free cash flow to pay down our debt in fiscal '24.  \n Heading into fiscal '25, we'll revisit the prioritization of debt paydown and share repurchases. We were 2.3x levered at the end of Q2. During the quarter, we paid down our debt by $256 million, and we ended Q2 with cash and cash equivalents of $249 million and gross debt of $2.011 billion. We expect to end the year with gross debt of approximately $1.7 billion.  \n Lastly, we now expect our diluted share count to increase by approximately 1.5 million shares in fiscal '24 versus our previous expectation of approximately 1 million shares under the accounting rules, specifically ASC 260, a higher share price results in incrementally higher diluted share count.  \n With that, I'll take you through our guidance on Slide 11. We're reiterating our fiscal '24 free cash flow guidance and narrowing our fiscal '24 constant currency ARR guidance range. We're taking the low end of the ARR guidance up by $10 million, reflecting our solid first half performance. We're taking the high end of the range down by $10 million, reflecting a change to the deferred ARR, we expect to recognize in the back half of the year.  \n You'll recall that we said we had approximately $20 million more deferred ARR in the back half of fiscal '24 compared to fiscal '23. We've reduced this by $10 million as we've renegotiated a handful of customer contracts. While not commonplace with existing contracts, renegotiations do sometimes happen. Some of you may recall that we had a handful of these during COVID as well. \n The field teams do a good job here, working with customers in what I like to call a customer-friendly but commercially responsible manner, meaning we're doing the right thing for the customer now while also ensuring that these deals will result in a higher exit run rate and better contractual terms for PTC.  \n We remain squarely focused on long-term value creation for our customers and our shareholders. It's worth noting that we're updating our fiscal '24 revenue guidance accordingly, taking the low end up by $10 million, reducing the high end by $10 million. Additionally, we're lowering the entire range by $10 million due to the impact of FX.  \n As you'll recall, we do not guide to constant currency revenue. Our EPS guidance reflects our first half performance and the impacts of the narrowing of the revenue range and the FX impact as well. And lastly, our free cash flow is also impacted by FX, but we're reiterating the $725 million guidance given the first half results.  \n For Q3, we're guiding for free cash flow of approximately $220 million in constant currency ARR of $2.115 billion to $2.13 billion, which corresponds to year-over-year growth of 11% to 12%. We believe we've set our Q3 and full year guidance appropriately. I'll get into more ARR guidance details on the next 2 slides. But before we do, I'd also like to reiterate my favorite reminder. \n To help you with your models, we're providing revenue and EPS guidance. But ASC 606 makes revenue and EPS difficult to predict for PTC since we sell primarily on-premise subscriptions and the way revenue is recognized from these contracts can vary significantly based on variables that aren't necessarily relevant to the performance of the business.  \n I did a teach-in on this subject on our Q4 '22 call that you may want to refer to if you're new to PTC. The summary is we believe ARR and free cash flow rather than revenue and operating income are the best metrics to assess the performance of our business. Importantly, we've maintained consistent billing practices over time. We primarily bill our customers annually upfront 1 year at a time, regardless of contract term lengths. So our free cash flow results over time are comparable.  \n Let's turn to Slide 12, and here's an illustration of what's needed to get to the midpoint of our constant currency ARR guidance for fiscal '24. As you can see from the slide, to hit the midpoint of our fiscal '24 guidance range, we need $145 million of sequential ARR growth in the second half of fiscal '24. This is approximately $20 million more than we added in the second half of the previous 2 fiscal years. And in the second half of fiscal '24, we expect to benefit from Codebeamer, cross-selling ServiceMax with an aligned and enabled sales force and $10 million more of deferred ARR than we had in the second half of fiscal '23.  \n Moving on to Slide 13. Here's an illustrative constant currency ARR model for Q3 '24. You can see our results here over the past 10 quarters, and the column on the far right illustrates what's needed to get to the midpoint of our constant currency ARR guidance.  \n This illustrative model indicates that to hit the midpoint of our Q3 guidance range, we need $48 million of sequential net ARR growth. Because our ARR trends tend to see some seasonality, the most relevant comparison is the sequential growth in Q3 of fiscal '23 and Q3 of fiscal '22. We think our guidance range for Q3 of '24 and the full year balances both risk and opportunity.  \n Finally, on free cash flow, I want to reiterate the point that Neil made earlier. We continue to have a high degree of confidence in our cash flow guidance and targets due to the predictability of our cash collections and the disciplined resource allocation structure we have in place.  \n In conclusion, PTC has a strong portfolio and strategy and a great team of people with deep expertise and strong customer relationships. We're focused on disciplined and consistent execution to ensure we deliver on the value creation opportunities we have ahead of us.  \n With that, I'd like to turn the call over to the operator and begin the Q&A session. Yes. I mean the only other thing that I would say is that every time we talk about mid-teens, we had to caveat the status of the economy and so on. So I think this is just cleaner way to do it. They were the best answers we've ever given. It's Kristian. Thanks, Dan. So I think your question is around why are we not starting buybacks sooner? I guess that's maybe the gist of it. And I mean, I think I'll just try to hit it this way. Listen, we still have $2 billion-plus in debt outstanding. Interest rate environment is still not favorable. The rate on the revolving credit facility we have is almost 7%. And after today's comments by the Fed, it doesn't look like those are going to get any better anytime soon. We've got a couple of quarters left to get through the year here, and we'll revaluate. Yes is the short answer. No, I think that's right. If there was a way to predict the 606 effects, Jay, trust me, we'd be happy to share it with you. And Jay, not trying to be snarky about the 606 thing. I mean you will remember that the main drivers are the kind of contract and there's the upfront contracts and there's the ratable contracts, the term length of the contract. So those are probably the 2 main drivers. Term length we can try and incent customers to move in a certain direction. But ultimately, they're going to make the right decision for them. And that includes both on new and renewal -- new and renewal transactions. \n And then as it relates to the ratable versus the upfront contracts, we still have a small base of perpetual support that we're still converting. So every time that happens, you're taking a ratable contract and moving it to an upfront contract. We have -- we're -- as you know, transitioning customers to SaaS. So every time you do that, you're taking an upfront contract and moving into a ratable contract. The moving parts, the volatility is -- well, you get the picture. So let's start the -- I guess, we'll go in reverse order. The $10 million of deferred is also split probably pretty evenly between Q3 and Q4. The other $10 million, let's just be clear, those are still contractual commitments that will -- that have just moved to a future period, right? So they haven't gone away. They've just gotten larger and moved to a future period. \n In terms of the macro. Again, I think Neil mentioned earlier, we haven't really seen any change really in any direction here over the past few quarters. And as it relates to tying that back to Q2 results, Q3 guidance in any given quarter, there can be a little volatility around lumpiness of deals, start dates and prediction of those that can cause minor swings in either direction. So all in all, we're pleased with the results for Q2. We think we've set the Q3 guidance appropriately and steady as she goes. No, not specifically. I think we were just trying to again, tighten up the disclosures. And it was -- to be honest, it was a little weird. We were giving points on certain line items and not other line items. And so we just tidied up the more detailed disclosures to fiscal '24. And otherwise, we remain on target for the other -- for '25 and '26. But there is... Yes. And then, of course, in addition, I know everybody knows this, but the model, we've talked about that before the subscription model, the sales model that we have or contracting model also adds to that growth rate. Thanks, everyone."

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to PTC's Chief Executive Officer, Jim Heppelmann.\nJim Heppelmann: Thank you, Matt. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. There may be an issue displaying the presentation materials. So if you don't see them, I invite you to go to investor.ptc.com, you'll find the same presentation materials there and you can follow along. We are right now on slide three. I'm pleased to report that PTC's Q1 results provided a good start to our fiscal '24. We delivered solid financial results, while in parallel, making great progress on CEO succession. Over the past six months, Neil and I have run a textbook transition process and we're nearing the culmination. We spent a lot of time together and traveled the world extensively to accomplish the goals we articulated of a seamless transition that ensures continuity in PTC's strategy and momentum. Neil is ready to be CEO. He understands our business well. He's fully committed to our strategy and he has the full support of an outstanding executive team. I'm confident that PTC will continue to drive growth and profitability well as in the future under Neil's leadership. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Neil to discuss the Q1 results. Neil?\nNeil Barua: Thank you, Jim. We're on slide five. Today, I'll focus my comments on three topics: first, what I've learned about PTC over the past several months; second, the drivers of PTC's durable and consistent growth; and third, driving further value creation with discipline and consistent execution. After my remarks, I'll hand over the call to Kristian to take you through our Q1 results and our guidance. Then we will have a Q&A session. Up front, I'd like to say a big thank you to Jim for sharing his industry insight and wealth of knowledge over the past year. The transition has gone very well and has been helpful to have Jim participate as I've engaged with customers, employees and investors. I'm honored to be taking over the CEO role on February 14 with PTC on a solid trajectory. Credit to Jim and the team, we have a great strategy based on a differentiated portfolio of assets and led by a strong team. As I said, my initial focus is on ensuring that we keep building on our momentum with disciplined and consistent execution. Turning to slide six. Our customers design, manufacture and service products. Most of our large customers produce and service the world's most critical assets, for example, wind turbines, tractors, automobiles and MRI machines. The biggest learning I've had relates to what I am seeing in our customer base and how much we could do for them. Digital transformation has clearly taken hold with our customers, around the world, and finally is here to stay. Industrial companies can't have manual, antiquated or disconnected workflows if they want to be competitive in today's complex world. Our customers need to modernize the portion of their operations that spans from design to manufacturing to service. Importantly, our core products are the essential foundation for that. Turning to slide seven. Industrial companies are still at early stages of leveraging product data effectively across their organizations, but they have started to move on in a meaningful way. We see the opportunity the same way our customers do. Digital transformation is a journey. Our broad portfolio provides a lot of opportunity to help our customers be competitive, irrespective of soft PMIs and economic cycles. Next on slide eight. My second major learning is that the overall PTC team is strong and capable. As I visited our offices around the world, I spent a lot of time doing skip-level, one-on-one meetings and town halls. I was inspired by the caliber and spirit of our people. I was impressed by their extensive product understanding and deep customer relationships. Their enthusiasm is palpable. They realize the opportunity ahead of us and that we have a portfolio of capabilities to win big. Turning to slide nine. I also feel very good about the strength of my highly experienced leadership team and how we will operate, going forward. My style is to bring what I'm hearing from customers into the conversation and capture the energy and ideas from each team member. This collaborative framework is already working well. And as a team, we are making progress in aligning on PTC's value-creation opportunities going forward, and our focus energies towards that. Let's turn to slide 10. On our past couple of earnings calls, we have been sharing this framework, which shows the cumulative drivers that support our top line growth. Fiscal \u201824 is expected to be our eighth consecutive year of double-digit organic constant currency ARR growth. A key point to understand is that our top line growth is sustainable, supported by the many layers of cumulative drivers that we have built over time. Each layer contributes to our ability and drive value for customers and as our customers continue to invest in digital transformation, our comprehensive product portfolio differentiates PTC. This is because PTC is the only company that can help industrial manufacturers drive closed loop product lifecycle management across engineering, manufacturing quality and service. Moving to slide 11. We have also been sharing this framework on recent earnings calls which shows the cumulative drivers that support our bottom line growth. As with the previous slide, every layer in this framework is important. The key point on this slide is that our strong free cash flow growth in recent years is attributed not only to our solid top line growth, but also to our subscription license business model and strong operational discipline. I am fully aligned with Kristian on the paramount importance over free cash flow guidance, and we have a high-level of confidence in the targets we've provided. Turning to Slide 12. My philosophy on resource allocation is that focus and discipline are important. To that end, it is our view that we have a compelling portfolio in place. The key things to get right are to focus on evolving customer needs and to drive strong and consistent execution towards that. To ensure this consistency, we will put a clear focus on our highest ROI opportunities. We will be disciplined and unemotional when it comes to prioritizing our time and resources on the products and product integrations that will create the most value for our customers. To use an analogy, we plan to put more wood beyond the most important arrows to ensure we drive the best outcomes for our customers and PTC. Let's now turn our attention to these priorities. Expanding our PLM or product lifecycle management footprint at customers both within engineering departments and enterprise-wide. There are two main reasons for this secular trend. First, PLM systems have evolved to meet the complexities faced today by industrial manufacturing companies. As just one example, the Volvo Group, whose Chief Digital Officer and Chief Technology Officer I was speaking to yesterday, uses Windchill to manage their platform product strategy, which leverages modular components. The sophisticated configuration management capabilities of Windchill have enabled the Volvo Group to produce more product variants while at the same time lowering their unique part count, which is good for the Volvo Group's top line as well as their bottom line. Industrial companies have come to understand that their ERP systems are inadequate to handle these types of complexities. They now view their PLM systems as strategic and spending on PLM is in focus. Secondly, industrial companies are facing competitive pressures and are looking for new ways to drive productivity and efficiency as they digitally transform. They also rearchitect their workflows to streamline inefficiencies and drive collaboration with their manufacturing, quality and service operations. Again, it is the PLM system that takes center-stage as this happens, because the PLM system is becoming the system of record for product data, and that makes the PLM system the epicenter for digital transformation of product companies. Increasingly, PLM systems are being leveraged as the backbone for sharing product data across departments, as well as with design and supply chain partners. This is good news for PTC. The market is coming to us where we are strong. Another large value creation opportunity is cross selling. PTC has done this successfully over the years, and we have additions to the portfolio that are meeting evolving customer needs and therefore present significant opportunities for PTC: One is, ALM or Application Lifecycle Management, which is led by Codebeamer and is now augmented by our acquisition of Pure variants. Here we have the most modern and capable ALM solution in the market. Products now contain more embedded software than ever, and for many products there has been an explosion in the number of unique software configurations that need to be developed and updated over time. Codebeamer is the next-gen software development platform that enables industrial companies to manage this increasing level of complexity. Pure variants augments Codebeamer with industry-leading software variant management capabilities, which is a key differentiator. While demand from the Auto industry and its suppliers are a strong driver of ALM growth, demand for ALM tools is expanding in other verticals as well due to the trend towards software-driven products of all types. Clearly, this is an interesting growth opportunity and we have been increasing our investments and focus in this area. A second cross-sell opportunity is ServiceMax. We acquired ServiceMax in January 2023 and the strategic fit with PTC is solid. For many of our customers, growing the services business is their top priority. As a system of record for high value, long lifecycle assets in the field, ServiceMax significantly enhances our SLM or Service Lifecycle Management portfolio, enabling PTC to now offer the industry's first truly comprehensive solution for service process optimization. The opportunity set here is large, and this segment is underpenetrated today, with most of our wins replacing homegrown or stretchy-based systems. ServiceMax has approximately 300 customers and PTC has approximately 3,000, with the exact same profile. Industrial companies that produce complex, high value assets. This provides us with clear cross-sell opportunities and we have now aligned the PTC sales teams with the ServiceMax sales specialists to go to market together. We are building momentum, but keep in mind that this will take some time to develop because sales cycles for this type of product are long given their new implementations for the most part. Clearly, continuing to grow CAD and converting our install base over to SaaS across all products are two additional opportunities, which overlap to some extent, because we will see conversion of Creo customers to our Creo Plus SaaS offering over time, much like Windchill plus. For customers, moving to SaaS enables a different collaboration paradigm that brings significant productivity benefits, making real-time, multi-user collaboration possible. Beyond the productivity benefits, customers also want the lower total cost of ownership and improved security posture that SaaS offers. As we have stated previously, we see this as another 10-plus-year journey for our customers. We have visibility to solid growth in our core on-premise business; and therefore, don't need to rush things and force customers to move before they are ready. The opportunity will be with us for a long time. Therefore, our focus is making sure our SaaS transition is done with an optimized customer experience. It is a tight community, so credibility and references are important. Wrapping up on slide 13. I'm honored to be stepping in at such an exciting time. There are so many good things happening at PTC and so many opportunities to drive further value. In part because of the portfolio of products that Jim and the team built over the years and the distinct needs of the market, PTC is well-positioned to deliver sustainable ARR and free cash flow growth, based on layers of cumulative growth and profit drivers. We are putting, as I said, more wood behind the most important arrows to drive the best outcomes for our customers, and I am focused on working with the team to enhance PTC's execution on the opportunities that drive the most customer and shareholder value. We plan to host an Investor Day this year and share more about our key medium to long-term opportunities. We are working towards becoming more consistent with our messaging, and more focused in how we prioritize our time and resources. It is a great time to be at PTC because we have a clear path to unlocking a lot of value. With that, I'll hand the call over to Kristian to take you through our Q1 financial results.\nKristian Talvitie: Thanks, Neil, and hello, everyone. Starting off with slide 15, PTC, again, delivered solid financial results in terms of both ARR and free cash flow, which we believe are the most important metrics to assess the performance of our business. Our constant currency ARR growth was 23% in Q1 and on an organic basis excluding ServiceMax our growth was 13%. Note, that we acquired ServiceMax in Q2 of fiscal '23, so starting next quarter Q2 of fiscal '24, we will no longer exclude ServiceMax from our organic results. To help investors understand our business performance, excluding the impact of FX volatility, we've been providing ARR guidance and disclosing our ARR results on a constant currency basis. At the end of Q1 our constant currency ARR was $2.016 billion, slightly above the guidance range we provided for the quarter. In Q1, our cash flow results also came in slightly ahead of our guidance, with operating cash flow of $187 million and free cash flow of $183 million. As a reminder, our Q1 cash flows included a $30 million of imputed interest related to the deferred payment for ServiceMax. Our cash flow performance is driven by our ARR and operating efficiency. And in Q1, we extended our track-record of disciplined operational management, while continuing to invest in key priorities like ALM and SaaS. Turning to slide 16. Let's look at our ARR growth by geographic region. Although FX continues to be volatile and the selling environment remained challenging in Q1, our constant currency organic ARR growth was solid across the Americas, Europe and APAC with growth in the low to mid-double-digits. On APAC our year-over-year organic constant currency growth increased to 14% in Q1, compared to 12% in Q4. And in the Americas and Europe, our organic year-over-year constant currency growth in Q1 was comparable to what we saw in Q4. Turning to slide 17. Let's look at our ARR growth by product group. In CAD, we delivered 10% constant currency ARR growth in Q1 with the growth, primarily driven by Creo. In PLM, our constant currency ARR growth was 33%, 19 points of this growth was attributable to ServiceMax; and therefore, our organic constant currency growth in Q1 was 14%. In PLM, our organic growth was primarily driven by Windchill and also supported by strong percentage growth in ALM, thanks to Codebeamer. Although the manufacturing PMIs have indicated a sluggish overall demand environment for many quarters now, our topline has shown good resilience. Part of this is because of our subscription license model, our low churn rates and the propensity for our customer-base to prioritize R&D investments through challenging times. In addition, as Neil explained earlier, our solid ARR growth is being supported by the digital transformation journeys of our customers, which we believe is a secular trend. Moving to slide 18. We ended the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $265 million. Given the consistency and predictability of our free cash flow, we aim to maintain a low cash balance and prefer to maximize debt reduction. Our gross debt was $2.267 billion with an aggregate interest-rate of 5.7%. During Q1, our gross debt decreased by $55 million. We used $181 million of cash to paydown debt, which was partially offset by $96 million, primarily related to Pure Systems and the $30 million imputed interest payment related to the final payment for the ServiceMax transaction, which we discussed previously. We were 2.8 times levered at the end of Q1 '24, and expect that to trend down throughout the remainder of the year as we are prioritizing paying down our debt this fiscal year. We intend to use substantially all of our free cash flow to paydown our debt this year and expect to end the year with gross debt of approximately $1.7 billion. In connection with this, we have temporarily paused our share repurchase program and expect our diluted share count to increase by approximately 1 million shares in fiscal '24. Heading into fiscal \u201825, we'll revisit the prioritization of debt paydown and share repurchases. Our long-term goal assuming our debt-to-EBITDA ratio is below 3 times, remains to return approximately 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases while also taking into consideration the interest rate environment and strategic opportunities. With that, I'll take you through our guidance on Slide 19. We're maintaining our fiscal '24 guidance, and following our solid Q1 results, we believe we're well positioned to deliver on our guidance for the full-year. For Q2, our constant currency ARR guidance range of $2.05 billion to $2.065 billion corresponds to year-over-year growth of 11% to 12%, I'll get into more details on the next slide. On cash flows, we're guiding to free cash flow of approximately $240 million in the second quarter. To help you with your models, we are continuing to provide revenue and EPS guidance, but as a reminder, ASC 606 makes revenue and EPS difficult to predict for PTC since we sell primarily on-premises subscription license -- licenses and the way revenue is recognized from these contracts can vary significantly based on variables that we don't believe are necessarily relevant to the performance of the business. I actually did a teach-in on this subject on our Q4 \u201822 call that you may want to refer to, if you're new to PTC. The summary is, we believe ARR and free cash flow, rather than revenue and operating income are the best metrics to assess the performance of our business. Importantly, we've maintained consistent billing practices over-time, and we primarily bill our customers annually, upfront, one-year at a time regardless of contract term lengths. So, our free cash flow results overtime are comparable. Moving on to slide 20. Here's an illustrative constant currency ARR model for Q2 '24. You can see our results over the past nine quarters, and the column on the far right illustrates what is needed to get to the midpoint of our constant currency ARR guidance. This illustrative model indicates that to hit the midpoint of our Q2 guidance range, we need $41 million of sequential net ARR growth. Because our ARR tends to see some seasonality, the most relevant comparison is the sequential growth in Q2 of '23 and Q2 of '22. We believe we've set our Q2 '24 constant currency guidance range prudently, which reflects an ongoing sluggish selling environment. Putting this into the context of the full-year, let's turn to slide 21. Here is a repeat of the slide we showed last quarter, which illustrates what's needed to get to the midpoint of our constant currency ARR guidance for fiscal \u201824. Looking at the full-year perspective naturally removes a lot of the quarterly volatility related to large transactions and ramp deal and start date dynamics. As you can see on the slide, for illustrative purposes, even if the full-year is flattish with the last two years from a net new ARR perspective, given the incremental $20 million of deferred ARR in the back half, which we've talked about before, we would be at 12% growth for the year. We think the full-year guidance range of 11% to 14% balances both risk and opportunity. Finally, on free cash flow, we continue to have a high degree of confidence in our quarterly and full-year guidance because of the predictability of our cash collections and the disciplined budgeting process, we have in place. So in conclusion, PTC has strong portfolio and strategy and a great team of people with deep expertise and strong customer relationships. We're focused on disciplined and consistent execution to ensure we deliver on the value creation opportunities we have ahead of us. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Joshua Tilton with Wolfe Research. Joshua, your line is open.\nJoshua Tilton: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I'll try and sneak it, maybe two in here, if I can. Just the first one, I thought it was pretty interesting that you mentioned the selling environment kind of still remains challenging and sluggish this quarter. I guess my questions is, was it more challenging than you guys were expecting 90 days ago? Is it any better than Q4? And maybe kind of how do you expect that selling environment to be for the rest of the year?\nNeil Barua: Yes. Thanks for the question. This is Neil. We haven't seen any change. It's been a sluggish sales environment for a number of years now, particularly around the approval cycles of our customers. It's just taking a lot, and it has been for multiple years. Nothing has changed worse or better since I've been here during the transition time, and currently how we're looking at Q2.\nJoshua Tilton: And maybe given that answer and the guidance that's kind of out there, it is implying that a lot of growth, especially in the net new ARR, is to come through in the second half. And, I guess maybe just remind us, I know you have the deferred ARR balance, but what's kind of giving you guys the confidence in that second half net new ARR growth, especially in the context of the 2Q guide?\nNeil Barua: Yes. I'll start, and Kristian could add if I missed anything. First of all, looking at the pipeline of opportunities, I feel confident around the number and the size of the deals, the criticality of the customers, the importance of the customers that we're working with hand-in-hand to get to a conclusion, to move them down this digital transformation journey. And so, when we look at that, that pipeline is interesting to us in a manner that gives us confidence around the guidance that we gave to you that we are now targeting. And so, that's an element of it. Again, to be clear, this doesn't assume that anything changes in the selling environment from now to the end of the year. There's just an element of pipeline and a seasonality that we've always had, quite frankly, in the second-half, where these types of deals we've historically been able to close out and our intent is to do the same this year.\nJoshua Tilton: Super helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Clark Jeffries with Piper Sandler. Clark, your line is open.\nClark Jeffries: Hello. Thank you for taking the question. Great to see the resiliency of the business. Neil, I was hoping you could expand on your comments around the timeline for the cross-sell for ServiceMax. It seems like you've made some early progress in aligning the go-to-market. But could you help us think through what that success in cross-sell looks like in fiscal '24? What it looks like in fiscal '25? And what's a reasonable timeline to reach its stride in terms of reaching the existing customer base as well? Thank you.\nNeil Barua: Yes, Clarke, great question. Thank you for asking it. Look, the first year -- since clearly, I'm very familiar with ServiceMax, given my background, the first year has been integration work and really getting to know the ways in which the ServiceMax team could interact in a precise way with the PTC team. We did that. We accomplished that. We had early success, which creates some momentum. Secondly, after we saw that, we've implemented a far more constructive and direct selling process by which the ServiceMax sellers are now very much tied into how the PTC sellers are going forward, in this fiscal year. And what that's caused is two things. The customer base is now understanding of the PTC broader value proposition of the digital thread and why ServiceMax is so critical to be part of that, number one. So that's creating a level of interest, engage rate and, quite frankly, momentum that we've already been seeing. And two, the sellers now have a familiarity of speaking the language that's necessary for ServiceMax to begin scale. I foresee this year to be a time period, given the sales cycles of ServiceMax, these are all new implementations for the most part, even if they are already existing PTC customers. That takes a bit of time. And I see this year as building that momentum by which, as we said when we made the ServiceMax acquisition, this is a mid-teens-plus grower. And my expectation is, this year is the building blocks by which the subsequent years really define that sustainable mid-teens growth over or above with ServiceMax.\nClark Jeffries: Perfect. I really appreciate the color. Look forward to the Analyst Day. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Yun Kim with Loop Capital. And Yun, your line is open.\nYun Kim: Hi, congrats on a solid quarter, Jim, Neil and Kristian. ARR growth, Creo CAD has been incredibly resilient for a long time. How do you see that playing out this year? Can it keep growing in the double digit consistently this year? And do you need Creo+ to kick-in to provide a tailwind for it to keep growing in the double digits?\nNeil Barua: Great question. And one of the great things with the transition with Jim is I'm far more well-versed in the amazing product that we have in Creo. And like you said, good performance from Creo. We expect that to continue. This is Creo on-premises, Creo throughout the course of this year, given the differentiation, given the strength of that product. And quite frankly, Creo+ is very limited, if at all, in terms of impacting our Creo results and the strength of it, in the near to maybe even the medium term. Like I said, that SaaS journey will be a 10-plus year journey. We're already seeing the strength of Creo on-prem, feel like that double-digit growth is sustainable. Creo+ over time, as the market adopts it, is cherry on the top.\nYun Kim: If I could just sneak one in for Kristian. Kristian, I believe this is a big -- much, much bigger year for renewals. Do you expect to continue to focus on increasing contract length? And remind us where we are in terms of overall contract length where that has been trending, and any update on the churn rate?\nKristian Talvitie: Yes. Hey, Yun, thanks for the question. Churn rate continues to be low and steady, so let's start with that one. And yes, we will continue to try and move contracts to longer-term contracts, which we believe is beneficial for our customers as well as actually for PTC. So we'll continue to try and move in that direction. And then lastly, I think, your question was around the average contract length, which as it stands right now, still hovers around a two-year term.\nYun Kim: Thanks so much.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Matt, your line is now open.\nMatt Hedberg: Great. Thanks, guys. And Jim, congrats on the run as well and Neil officially taking over on, I think, the 14th, you said. So great run, Jim and Neil, looking forward to this next journey here. I guess, I had a question, Neil. You mentioned -- there's been a lot of focus on Creo+ and Windchill+. And you had some comments in your prepared remarks on the SaaS transition. I don't think a lot of people feel like this is really like what we typically see in a SaaS transition because I think you're not trying to like push customers there, but to move to the SaaS variants. But just maybe how do you kind of philosophically think about that? And are there things perhaps that you can do to sort of show the functionality, that's where it's going in the plus variants? And I don't know, maybe there's some pricing or incentives that could drive that behavior. But it feels like it's an accretive thing for you and beneficial to the customer as well.\nNeil Barua: Great question, Matt. Thanks for asking it. It's important to us. Let me just make sure I reiterate this. We have a view, I have a view, that was consistent with Jim's view that the industry will go do SaaS. That's an inevitability. As I said, we believe it's going to be, in my estimation, a 10-plus-year journey. It could be wrong, it could move faster, could take a little bit longer. But the way in which we're thinking about it here, with already some momentum built, particularly in Windchill+, Creo+ we launched a couple of quarters ago, we're building with customers already, the resilience, the scalability, the repeatability of a SaaS offering by which when other customers of similar complexity or size or segments are ready to take it on, we have built the strength and the capabilities to do that. And so, the way in which we're doing is, we're not taking any foot off the accelerator in terms of our focus, energy, investment into our plus strategy. But we do want to force customers, different than others out there, but it's very important philosophically as you ask for us to have a way in which we work with our customers as they need to migrate for their value prop to move from an on-prem system to a SaaS offering, we will be there hand-in-hand to do that. And our ultimate belief is, that will reward us in a meaningful way. When the dam breaks, we might -- we will not only get the conversion of our existing on-prem customers to the SaaS offering, but have a differentiated offer for those in other competitive environments that might want to move to the best-in-class solution at PTC.\nMatt Hedberg: Got it. Thanks a lot. Super helpful.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Adam Borg with Stifel. And Adam, your line is now open.\nAdam Borg: Awesome. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Maybe for Neil, it was pretty interesting when you talked in your script about focusing resources towards the highest priority areas. A lot of focus, obviously, on PLM, the upsell opportunities you've had. Maybe talk a little bit about IoT and AR and how you're thinking about those opportunities? And then, I have a quick follow-up.\nNeil Barua: Yes. Very important question. And to be clear, I'm going to be very consistent around making sure, across the broad portfolio of capabilities we have, to make sure with all of you, we focus in not only internally, but as we report our messaging to you around the largest value creation from an aggregate dollar perspective, those priorities, which I made around PLM, SLM, with ServiceMax, ALM, the CAD piece of it as well as how we transition our customers to SaaS. That doesn't mean IoT, AR, Servigistics Arbortext, FlexPLM aren't important. I have and we have leaders there, capable leaders working through that, many of which are important to our digital thread, many of which of those products are important to industrial manufacturers going through a digital transformation. And what I meant by prioritization and focus is as a general way in which the company has done for many years now, during the planning process, I'm making sure with the team here that, like I said, we put more wood behind the arrows that create the highest value creation opportunities and make sure those that might not have as strong of an outlook or have a different investment profile, we look at that with the time horizon and make the right concise decision to prioritize where we put the investment dollars, and where we may want to de-prioritize a few of those based on the outlook of that business. Right now, we have a very broad portfolio, I feel good about it. But, we've been doing it consistently over the last three years just making sure we're placing the next incremental dollar in the highest value creation opportunities, going forward.\nAdam Borg: Incredibly helpful. I really appreciate that. Maybe just a quick follow-up for Kristian just on the model. I think the guidance implies on OpEx, a 200-basis-point increase in OpEx spend relative to the guidance you talked about 90 days ago. Maybe talk a little bit more about what are the areas that you're looking to drive increased investments? Thanks so much.\nKristian Talvitie: Yes. Hey, Adam, it's Kristian. No, I mean, I think that our OpEx guidance for the year is pretty well in line -- it remains unchanged from really what we would have said 90 days ago. In terms of areas where we're investing incrementally this year, it's what we've been talking about. There's ALM in particular, there's some investments into SaaS, which includes Windchill+, includes Creo+, actually includes some Atlas those are areas where we've got incremental investment going this year. But in terms of change to the investment profile from last quarter, I'm not sure I'm tracking with you.\nAdam Borg: Got it. We can talk more offline. Thanks so much.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink with Baird. Joe, your line is open.\nJoe Vruwink: Great. Thanks for taking my question, and also wanted to extend my best wishes to Jim. Another one on just maybe more recent performance. So 1Q was a good quarter for new ARR added. You finished above guidance. I think, you grew that line 20% year-on-year. Anything to call out just in terms of what drove the upside in the 1Q plan? And then, maybe looking to 2Q, any discrete factors that would explain kind of a year-over-year decline in new ARR added? Or maybe relatedly, is deferred ARR factoring any more or less in the outlook today?\nKristian Talvitie: Yes. Hey, it's Kristian. Thanks. Good question. So again, I think Q1, again, despite a challenging environment, I think we executed well. I think that across geographies, across product segments, hopefully, that showed through in our results. As far as the full-year is concerned, again, we are maintaining our full-year guidance, as we start looking at Q2 here. I think, we're just trying to be prudent on the immediate-term outlook. But as a reminder, I guess, for everybody as it gets back to the -- there's ARR and then there's cash flow. And on the cash flow side of things, whether there could be more volatility on ARR on the cash flow side of things, both from a quarterly and annual guidance perspective, I think, we feel very good about that guidance. But otherwise, I think seasonality is kind of in line with last year from an ARR perspective, taking into account the incremental deferred we've talked about ad Nauseam.\nJoe Vruwink: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke with Citi. And Tyler, your line is now open.\nTyler Radke: Thanks so much for the question and congrats to you, Neil, and Jim. Look forward to the next journey here. Neil, you talked about how you made a number of observations across the product portfolio in your time here. One of the things that stood out to me was on your comments on the SaaS transition, kind of talking about it as a 10-year journey. I think in the past, PTC had talked about it, maybe a little bit more medium-term than that. So I'm just wondering, and maybe the question is for Kristian, is there any impact we should think about on the medium or long-term financial targets, as it relates to that? And then conversely, what are you seeing on the on-prem side maybe that surprised you to the upside that's giving you that confidence, that it's about a little bit of a longer time frame? Thank you.\nNeil Barua: Hey, Tyler. So let me try, and then Kristian could add to this. The two actually are related, your two questions. And as you know, the on-prem business is delivering really solid growth. And one of the reasons why we talk about PLM, PLM expansion, we are still in the early innings of PLM, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, in the early innings of being the system of record for product data across our customer base. It is happening in many cases. But there is, as far as the eye can see, in all the travels Jim and I have been doing to meet with customers, it is now happening. And so -- and this is based on our on-premise Windchill systems. So that gives the confidence as we think through structuring, scaling, enabling our sellers, the marketing around it, to make Windchill that system of record for product data that we're seeing in already some of our customers, that's why I have the confidence around really putting the wood behind the arrow around that initiative, combined with the ALM initiative that has a very interesting growth factor that we talked about, that is predominantly on-premise. It will move to cloud over time. But those two growth vectors are and the wood behind those two arrows are on-premise to be crystal clear. And then as a prior question asked, our Creo on-premise business is solid and rocking and rolling. So those three things combined, lastly, with the ServiceMax cross-sell, which is a SaaS product, as you know, Tyler, those give the confidence around the continuation and the types of guidance that we put out in the mid and long term. That being said, for the mid-teens and the -- midterm to long-term ARR guidance, there is an element of SaaS starting to transition into that ARR growth rate in the mid- to long-term. My point around the 10-year is the industry and all our customers will take, in aggregate, that long, but we already are taking Windchill+, some Creo+ customers along in the journey. And that should accrete in the mid and long term. And maybe we see the dam break earlier and it accretes faster, but our estimate is to be tempered here and to work with customers hand-in-hand to get that upside on the SaaS transition. Kristian, anything to add?\nKristian Talvitie: I think that was spectacular.\nNeil Barua: That's the first time Kristian Talvitie complimented me. Thank you, Kristian.\nTyler Radke: Thank you, guys. And so just to clarify, no changes to the medium- or long-term targets? Sounds like no, but I just wanted to clarify.\nNeil Barua: No.\nTyler Radke: Awesome. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Yes. Your next question comes from the line of Matt Broome with Mizuho Securities. Matt, your line is open.\nMatt Broome: All right, thanks very much. I'll add my congratulations to both Jim and Neil. So maybe just on partnerships, it's clearly a lot happening with Ansys right now. I'm just curious if you have a view on how this proposed acquisition by Synopsys might affect your partnership there. And maybe if you could remind us the sort of materiality or the strategic importance of that partnership to you.\nNeil Barua: Yes. Look, Ansys has been a good partner of ours for many years and will continue to be a good partner. They are part of how we talk about and have a value prop around Creo and the added simulation capabilities. And we help them similarly, right, around what they're doing on simulation with ours. So it's a very good partnership for both sides and critical to both sides to a certain extent. To be clear, too, this is actually if the deal goes through, right? I'm not a regulator so I can't speculate on that. But if the deal goes through and Synopsys is the eventual owner of Ansys, the great thing for us is there's zero overlap that we have with Synopsys, which might, over time, I don't know yet, but might, over time, create an opportunity for us.\nMatt Broome: Excellent. And then maybe if I could just also ask just how your business in China resolved during the quarter? And if you've seen any incremental impacts from any sort of regulatory restrictions there? Thanks.\nNeil Barua: Yes. We haven't seen China be a drag on us.\nMatt Broome: Perfect. Thanks very much.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Stephen Tusa with JPMorgan. And Stephen, your line is now open.\nStephen Tusa: Hey, guys. Good evening.\nNeil Barua: Hey, Steve.\nStephen Tusa: Kristian didn\u2019t come across to me as the managing uptight, but that was a heck of a comment to the new boss. Smart move.\nKristian Talvitie: I wanted to say it might be the first time I've complimented anybody.\nJim Heppelmann: And I might second that.\nStephen Tusa: I think just going back to the question on costs. I think in last quarter's presentation, you said that non-operating, kind of non-GAAP operating would be up 6% to 7% I think you're saying now 7% to 8% or something like that. I think that's what the prior question was referring to. Maybe that's 4 times or something like that. I think that was probably the source of that question. Just curious as well on that.\nKristian Talvitie: Yes, that would be FX-related.\nStephen Tusa: Yes, okay. That makes sense. And then just on your ARR kind of leverage down to free cash, you beat ARR this quarter by a little. You raised -- you beat cash by $3 million. It was like a 20% to 25% drop through on that ARR beat. Is there anything to that math? I know you guys have said with upside ARR, you'll probably invest some of that away so we should just keep an eye on your cash guidance. But is there anything to math like that, where if you get a little bit of that extra ARR, that like it's kind of hard to invest in a way that you will get some upside drop-through on that ultimately? Or am I thinking too much?\nKristian Talvitie: Really, no, no. That's a great question. And so let's just -- I think the right -- the thing that you need to remember with ARR and cash flow is, we'll call it ARR equates to invoicing and then cash flow relates to collections and payments. And so our standard terms are 30 days, and depending on the customer, our average terms are definitely longer than 30 days. But let's just work with 30 days, which means that any incremental ARR that we get in a quarter, that comes in the last month of the quarter actually, isn't impacting that quarter's cash collections and therefore that quarter's cash flows. That all goes to the subsequent quarter. So you have to just remember that time lag when you're thinking about it. Does that make sense, Steve?\nStephen Tusa: Yes. Yes, makes a ton of sense. One last one for you on cash. Last quarter, you said 55% of the year will come in the first half. I think this quarter, it's now 58%, so a little more front-end loaded. Again, anything going on there? I mean, it would, I guess, make us feel -- we all feel, I guess, better about the year when it's a little more front-end loaded. But anything going on there from a timing perspective that stands out?\nKristian Talvitie: Yes, I feel better when it's more front-end loaded too, Steve. And I think what we said, if we're going to be super technical about it, is more than 55%. And now we're just kind of honing in on the map and saying it's going to be more like 58%. But otherwise, I think we had great collections performance here in Q1 and the outlook for Q2 is solid as well. So I think we feel pretty good about the range for Q2 and obviously our outlook for the year.\nStephen Tusa: Great. Thanks a lot. Appreciate the color.\nKristian Talvitie: Thanks.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Jay, your line is now open.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Thank you. You noted on the call your closed-loop life cycle strategy and your cross-selling structure and process. The question I have is about customers' receptivity to cross-selling. And what I mean is, do you see any correlation between the likelihood of cross-selling and the size of the customer or the customer's products and/or perhaps the end market? Is there anything that will make a customer in industry X or where product Y more receptive to your multi-solution cross-selling approach than perhaps another customer might be? Then a follow-up.\nNeil Barua: Yes. Thanks for the question, Jay. In terms of ServiceMax cross-sell, a key factor is having product companies, OEM manufacturers having long life cycle assets in the field. And if you want to double-click, critical assets within life sciences, electronics and high tech, the industrial manufacturing space, the ones that are in the field for a long time, the product companies are now needing service revenue to offset any declines or lack of new product innovation to make sure that they're getting a consistent durable revenue stream themselves. So that's a consistent correlation that we're seeing from a customer lens. Two is when a customer has Windchill, one thing that's really interesting is this past quarter, we won a very large industrial manufacturing win at ServiceMax, over a 7-digit-plus deal that, quite frankly, I was trying to win for five straight years at ServiceMax on our own unsuccessfully. And we were able to take this deal down because the customer has Creo and Windchill. And they, over time, as they implemented ServiceMax, want the asset field record, the system of record of the asset to actually flow back to their PLM system. So the combined solution, Jay, of -- and the correlation point of a customer with Windchill with long life cycle assets that they produce is a really nice makeup, which brings that math of 300 ServiceMax customers equated with 3,000 similar like-minded PTC customers. Last thing quickly on ALM, which is actually a big cross-sell for us as well, that's interesting to us on the other side of it. So as we mentioned I think last earnings call, we've been seeing Codebeamer as a tip of the spear where we're particularly in automotive, automotive suppliers where now we're getting in the conversation as we're showing them the Codebeamer value prop, we also have a PLM system that might not be PTC, how can the two work together with hardware configuration management, with software configuration management, Codebeamer. Should we actually look at PTC for the combined offering? That's interesting to us. We're starting to see it. I wouldn't call it a trend yet but it's another opportunity that might have a correlation that we're starting to see some early signs of, Jay.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Okay. Also, over the last two or more years, it's been demonstrable that Creo and Windchill have gained share, as you know. And I think there are some describable reasons for that. But over the course of fiscal -- of calendar '23, it did look as though CAD market shares were beginning to stabilize. And I'm wondering if you are beginning to see any evolutions or new dynamics in either CAD or PLM suggesting that customer requirements or selection criteria or anything of that kind might be changing from what they've been over the past number of years as it might affect your Creo or Windchill momentum?\nNeil Barua: Yes. I'm going to -- I'll take the Windchill piece, and maybe I could ask Jim as I'm getting deeper into the Creo piece to comment on that. But one of the interesting things we're seeing with our prioritization of putting wood behind more of the arrow in the PLM expansion category, which is predominantly Windchill, as you know, Jay, is when customers are going through an ERP migration, particularly SAP to S/4HANA, we're seeing that as a really interesting point where the customer is looking at what workflows belong in ERP system versus MBS versus a PLM system. And we're actually feeling advantaged when that introspection is happening to have more functionality being put within a PLM system, which makes Windchill far more important in the transition process. So that's a theme we're starting to see, number one. And number two, again to reiterate, the idea of having a broad portfolio not only on the SLM side, ALM side, I believe we're starting to have the customer conversations where having a Windchill PLM system becomes more critical to have a common data flow over time through the thread. And we'll see whether that amounts to competitive placements, but we see that as a continuation of some themes that are interesting for us for Windchill expansion. Jim, do you want to talk about Creo?\nJim Heppelmann: Yes, maybe I could add. Jay, I think your point is that PTC has had good double-digit growth, steady as she goes, for some years now with Creo. And some of the competitors have lost momentum and then seemingly gained some of it back. I think you know we have one European competitor in particular whose customers aren't that happy, and that dynamic serves us very well. Now it looks like they have some momentum, but I think you remember, too, they put through some fairly nasty price increases, which I think might cover up a little bit what's really happening because the price increases might give them some short-term growth but actually exacerbate the problem that the customers are frustrated about. So I don't know. I feel like our business has been steady. And we think, as Neil said clearly before, will continue to be steady. Creo+ maybe offering a bit of a tailwind over time. I think that we're in a position to take share with Creo and to take share on the other end of the customer base with Onshape. And so I like our CAD prospects.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Very good, thank you.\nOperator: And your final question comes from the line of Saket Kalia with Barclays. Saket, your line is now open.\nSaket Kalia: Okay great guys, hey thanks for squeezing me in here. I'll keep it to 1 question. Just first off, congrats, Neil, on the upcoming appointment, and Jim, tip my cap to you for all the years at PTC and the industry. The question I want to focus on here maybe for Kristian and Neil is just the ALM business overall, right, really spearheaded by Codebeamer. How do we -- can you just maybe give some contours on roughly how big that business is from an ARR perspective, how fast it's growing roughly? And Kristian, you talked about sort of the range of outcomes in sort of this ARR guide. How much can Codebeamer sort of affect that range of outcomes? Because it just sounds like there's a lot of excitement, a lot of product success there. I wanted to just put some numbers around it to the extent we could.\nNeil Barua: Yes. I mean, I'll start, Saket. Good to hear your voice. I'll let Kristian talk about if we do break out ALM from a size perspective. But it is, from my perspective, nowhere near the size of Creo and Windchill at this current time. However, the pace of growth is extremely exciting. I mean, as fast as I've seen West Coast start-ups start growing, I'm starting to see that same level of percentage growth year-over-year. We got some work to do so it's not going to be a straight up into the right line. But that being said, one of the things we've been seeing is Codebeamer is catching fire. I think we mentioned that as a quote from last quarter's call. And we're seeing as the adoption occurs or a POC occurs at a large automotive company that, for example, Jim and I were in Japan. Once they start testing out, this thing goes big relatively quick. As an example, we won a very -- what we thought was a very large Codebeamer, not the one that we press released, another one within Q4, right, of last year of a large European auto maker. This last quarter, we got an add-on order already of sizable value from that same customer. So that's leading to this excitement piece, number one. Number two is some of these deals with Codebeamer are very substantial size, right? Not only the add-on orders but like the size of the deal because the users that need software development tools like Codebeamer, are, in some cases, a lot larger of a population than the mechanical engineers. And so that's why it has such a what we call a prioritization of the high dollar value creation opportunities. That's why part of that.\nJim Heppelmann: Could I just add? It's also a very strategic high ground. It's an important piece of business to win.\nSaket Kalia: Absolutely, absolutely. Anything we could talk about in terms of, again, just sort of contours, rough sizing, because it does feel like an important sort of long-term investment area?\nNeil Barua: Yes, here. So let's just try rough sizing and say it this way. This year, we ought to pass through the $100 million mark on ARR with our ALM segment.\nJim Heppelmann: To be clear though, that would be the integrity product we previously had plus the Codebeamer product added together, yes.\nSaket Kalia: So like a total ALM portfolio would be $100 million by the end of this year?\nKristian Talvitie: At some point this year, yes, and it's growing faster than the...\nNeil Barua: Accretive to growth.\nKristian Talvitie: The overall company growth. It's accretive to growth.\nSaket Kalia: Got it, got it. Guys, very helpful. Again, tip my cap to both of you. Well done.\nJim Heppelmann: Great. Thank you. So I think that's the end of the questions. So before Neil wraps it up, I'd like to just take a minute to personally close out with PTC's investor community and to thank all of you for so many years of support. During my tenure, I always listened carefully and took investor input seriously, and it helped shape our strategies and allowed the PTC team to really move the needle on value creation. I know Neil will do the same. The transition process with Neil has been lengthy, thoughtful, and frankly, it was even a lot of fun. As a result, I can tell you with confidence that Neil and team are ready to go. Neil has my congratulations and full support. So I want to sign off then by saying thanks, and goodbye one last time, knowing I'm leaving a strong company in good hands. Over to you, Neil.\nNeil Barua: Thanks, Jim, truly, and thank you, everyone, for joining us and for your questions today. In the weeks ahead, Kristian, Mike DiTullio, Matt Shimao and I will be on the road participating in investor conferences, and it would be great to keep the dialogue going. During the last week of February, Kristian will be at the JPMorgan Credit Conference in Miami. Matt will attend the Wolfe Conference in New York. During the first week of March, we'll be at the Morgan Stanley and KeyBanc conferences in San Francisco, then Mike DiTullio will attend the Virtual Loop conference during the second week of March. And also, we have two bus tours coming to visit us at our Boston headquarters next week. Those visits will be hosted by Kristian and me. Please reach out to JPMorgan or Piper Sandler if you're interested. And on behalf of the team, thank you, again, and we look forward to engaging with you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Neil Barua",
            "content": "Thank you, Jim. We're on slide five. Today, I'll focus my comments on three topics: first, what I've learned about PTC over the past several months; second, the drivers of PTC's durable and consistent growth; and third, driving further value creation with discipline and consistent execution. After my remarks, I'll hand over the call to Kristian to take you through our Q1 results and our guidance. Then we will have a Q&A session. Up front, I'd like to say a big thank you to Jim for sharing his industry insight and wealth of knowledge over the past year. The transition has gone very well and has been helpful to have Jim participate as I've engaged with customers, employees and investors. I'm honored to be taking over the CEO role on February 14 with PTC on a solid trajectory. Credit to Jim and the team, we have a great strategy based on a differentiated portfolio of assets and led by a strong team. As I said, my initial focus is on ensuring that we keep building on our momentum with disciplined and consistent execution. Turning to slide six. Our customers design, manufacture and service products. Most of our large customers produce and service the world's most critical assets, for example, wind turbines, tractors, automobiles and MRI machines. The biggest learning I've had relates to what I am seeing in our customer base and how much we could do for them. Digital transformation has clearly taken hold with our customers, around the world, and finally is here to stay. Industrial companies can't have manual, antiquated or disconnected workflows if they want to be competitive in today's complex world. Our customers need to modernize the portion of their operations that spans from design to manufacturing to service. Importantly, our core products are the essential foundation for that. Turning to slide seven. Industrial companies are still at early stages of leveraging product data effectively across their organizations, but they have started to move on in a meaningful way. We see the opportunity the same way our customers do. Digital transformation is a journey. Our broad portfolio provides a lot of opportunity to help our customers be competitive, irrespective of soft PMIs and economic cycles. Next on slide eight. My second major learning is that the overall PTC team is strong and capable. As I visited our offices around the world, I spent a lot of time doing skip-level, one-on-one meetings and town halls. I was inspired by the caliber and spirit of our people. I was impressed by their extensive product understanding and deep customer relationships. Their enthusiasm is palpable. They realize the opportunity ahead of us and that we have a portfolio of capabilities to win big. Turning to slide nine. I also feel very good about the strength of my highly experienced leadership team and how we will operate, going forward. My style is to bring what I'm hearing from customers into the conversation and capture the energy and ideas from each team member. This collaborative framework is already working well. And as a team, we are making progress in aligning on PTC's value-creation opportunities going forward, and our focus energies towards that. Let's turn to slide 10. On our past couple of earnings calls, we have been sharing this framework, which shows the cumulative drivers that support our top line growth. Fiscal \u201824 is expected to be our eighth consecutive year of double-digit organic constant currency ARR growth. A key point to understand is that our top line growth is sustainable, supported by the many layers of cumulative drivers that we have built over time. Each layer contributes to our ability and drive value for customers and as our customers continue to invest in digital transformation, our comprehensive product portfolio differentiates PTC. This is because PTC is the only company that can help industrial manufacturers drive closed loop product lifecycle management across engineering, manufacturing quality and service. Moving to slide 11. We have also been sharing this framework on recent earnings calls which shows the cumulative drivers that support our bottom line growth. As with the previous slide, every layer in this framework is important. The key point on this slide is that our strong free cash flow growth in recent years is attributed not only to our solid top line growth, but also to our subscription license business model and strong operational discipline. I am fully aligned with Kristian on the paramount importance over free cash flow guidance, and we have a high-level of confidence in the targets we've provided. Turning to Slide 12. My philosophy on resource allocation is that focus and discipline are important. To that end, it is our view that we have a compelling portfolio in place. The key things to get right are to focus on evolving customer needs and to drive strong and consistent execution towards that. To ensure this consistency, we will put a clear focus on our highest ROI opportunities. We will be disciplined and unemotional when it comes to prioritizing our time and resources on the products and product integrations that will create the most value for our customers. To use an analogy, we plan to put more wood beyond the most important arrows to ensure we drive the best outcomes for our customers and PTC. Let's now turn our attention to these priorities. Expanding our PLM or product lifecycle management footprint at customers both within engineering departments and enterprise-wide. There are two main reasons for this secular trend. First, PLM systems have evolved to meet the complexities faced today by industrial manufacturing companies. As just one example, the Volvo Group, whose Chief Digital Officer and Chief Technology Officer I was speaking to yesterday, uses Windchill to manage their platform product strategy, which leverages modular components. The sophisticated configuration management capabilities of Windchill have enabled the Volvo Group to produce more product variants while at the same time lowering their unique part count, which is good for the Volvo Group's top line as well as their bottom line. Industrial companies have come to understand that their ERP systems are inadequate to handle these types of complexities. They now view their PLM systems as strategic and spending on PLM is in focus. Secondly, industrial companies are facing competitive pressures and are looking for new ways to drive productivity and efficiency as they digitally transform. They also rearchitect their workflows to streamline inefficiencies and drive collaboration with their manufacturing, quality and service operations. Again, it is the PLM system that takes center-stage as this happens, because the PLM system is becoming the system of record for product data, and that makes the PLM system the epicenter for digital transformation of product companies. Increasingly, PLM systems are being leveraged as the backbone for sharing product data across departments, as well as with design and supply chain partners. This is good news for PTC. The market is coming to us where we are strong. Another large value creation opportunity is cross selling. PTC has done this successfully over the years, and we have additions to the portfolio that are meeting evolving customer needs and therefore present significant opportunities for PTC: One is, ALM or Application Lifecycle Management, which is led by Codebeamer and is now augmented by our acquisition of Pure variants. Here we have the most modern and capable ALM solution in the market. Products now contain more embedded software than ever, and for many products there has been an explosion in the number of unique software configurations that need to be developed and updated over time. Codebeamer is the next-gen software development platform that enables industrial companies to manage this increasing level of complexity. Pure variants augments Codebeamer with industry-leading software variant management capabilities, which is a key differentiator. While demand from the Auto industry and its suppliers are a strong driver of ALM growth, demand for ALM tools is expanding in other verticals as well due to the trend towards software-driven products of all types. Clearly, this is an interesting growth opportunity and we have been increasing our investments and focus in this area. A second cross-sell opportunity is ServiceMax. We acquired ServiceMax in January 2023 and the strategic fit with PTC is solid. For many of our customers, growing the services business is their top priority. As a system of record for high value, long lifecycle assets in the field, ServiceMax significantly enhances our SLM or Service Lifecycle Management portfolio, enabling PTC to now offer the industry's first truly comprehensive solution for service process optimization. The opportunity set here is large, and this segment is underpenetrated today, with most of our wins replacing homegrown or stretchy-based systems. ServiceMax has approximately 300 customers and PTC has approximately 3,000, with the exact same profile. Industrial companies that produce complex, high value assets. This provides us with clear cross-sell opportunities and we have now aligned the PTC sales teams with the ServiceMax sales specialists to go to market together. We are building momentum, but keep in mind that this will take some time to develop because sales cycles for this type of product are long given their new implementations for the most part. Clearly, continuing to grow CAD and converting our install base over to SaaS across all products are two additional opportunities, which overlap to some extent, because we will see conversion of Creo customers to our Creo Plus SaaS offering over time, much like Windchill plus. For customers, moving to SaaS enables a different collaboration paradigm that brings significant productivity benefits, making real-time, multi-user collaboration possible. Beyond the productivity benefits, customers also want the lower total cost of ownership and improved security posture that SaaS offers. As we have stated previously, we see this as another 10-plus-year journey for our customers. We have visibility to solid growth in our core on-premise business; and therefore, don't need to rush things and force customers to move before they are ready. The opportunity will be with us for a long time. Therefore, our focus is making sure our SaaS transition is done with an optimized customer experience. It is a tight community, so credibility and references are important. Wrapping up on slide 13. I'm honored to be stepping in at such an exciting time. There are so many good things happening at PTC and so many opportunities to drive further value. In part because of the portfolio of products that Jim and the team built over the years and the distinct needs of the market, PTC is well-positioned to deliver sustainable ARR and free cash flow growth, based on layers of cumulative growth and profit drivers. We are putting, as I said, more wood behind the most important arrows to drive the best outcomes for our customers, and I am focused on working with the team to enhance PTC's execution on the opportunities that drive the most customer and shareholder value. We plan to host an Investor Day this year and share more about our key medium to long-term opportunities. We are working towards becoming more consistent with our messaging, and more focused in how we prioritize our time and resources. It is a great time to be at PTC because we have a clear path to unlocking a lot of value. With that, I'll hand the call over to Kristian to take you through our Q1 financial results. Yes. Thanks for the question. This is Neil. We haven't seen any change. It's been a sluggish sales environment for a number of years now, particularly around the approval cycles of our customers. It's just taking a lot, and it has been for multiple years. Nothing has changed worse or better since I've been here during the transition time, and currently how we're looking at Q2. Yes. I'll start, and Kristian could add if I missed anything. First of all, looking at the pipeline of opportunities, I feel confident around the number and the size of the deals, the criticality of the customers, the importance of the customers that we're working with hand-in-hand to get to a conclusion, to move them down this digital transformation journey. And so, when we look at that, that pipeline is interesting to us in a manner that gives us confidence around the guidance that we gave to you that we are now targeting. And so, that's an element of it. Again, to be clear, this doesn't assume that anything changes in the selling environment from now to the end of the year. There's just an element of pipeline and a seasonality that we've always had, quite frankly, in the second-half, where these types of deals we've historically been able to close out and our intent is to do the same this year. Yes, Clarke, great question. Thank you for asking it. Look, the first year -- since clearly, I'm very familiar with ServiceMax, given my background, the first year has been integration work and really getting to know the ways in which the ServiceMax team could interact in a precise way with the PTC team. We did that. We accomplished that. We had early success, which creates some momentum. Secondly, after we saw that, we've implemented a far more constructive and direct selling process by which the ServiceMax sellers are now very much tied into how the PTC sellers are going forward, in this fiscal year. And what that's caused is two things. The customer base is now understanding of the PTC broader value proposition of the digital thread and why ServiceMax is so critical to be part of that, number one. So that's creating a level of interest, engage rate and, quite frankly, momentum that we've already been seeing. And two, the sellers now have a familiarity of speaking the language that's necessary for ServiceMax to begin scale. I foresee this year to be a time period, given the sales cycles of ServiceMax, these are all new implementations for the most part, even if they are already existing PTC customers. That takes a bit of time. And I see this year as building that momentum by which, as we said when we made the ServiceMax acquisition, this is a mid-teens-plus grower. And my expectation is, this year is the building blocks by which the subsequent years really define that sustainable mid-teens growth over or above with ServiceMax. Great question. And one of the great things with the transition with Jim is I'm far more well-versed in the amazing product that we have in Creo. And like you said, good performance from Creo. We expect that to continue. This is Creo on-premises, Creo throughout the course of this year, given the differentiation, given the strength of that product. And quite frankly, Creo+ is very limited, if at all, in terms of impacting our Creo results and the strength of it, in the near to maybe even the medium term. Like I said, that SaaS journey will be a 10-plus year journey. We're already seeing the strength of Creo on-prem, feel like that double-digit growth is sustainable. Creo+ over time, as the market adopts it, is cherry on the top. Great question, Matt. Thanks for asking it. It's important to us. Let me just make sure I reiterate this. We have a view, I have a view, that was consistent with Jim's view that the industry will go do SaaS. That's an inevitability. As I said, we believe it's going to be, in my estimation, a 10-plus-year journey. It could be wrong, it could move faster, could take a little bit longer. But the way in which we're thinking about it here, with already some momentum built, particularly in Windchill+, Creo+ we launched a couple of quarters ago, we're building with customers already, the resilience, the scalability, the repeatability of a SaaS offering by which when other customers of similar complexity or size or segments are ready to take it on, we have built the strength and the capabilities to do that. And so, the way in which we're doing is, we're not taking any foot off the accelerator in terms of our focus, energy, investment into our plus strategy. But we do want to force customers, different than others out there, but it's very important philosophically as you ask for us to have a way in which we work with our customers as they need to migrate for their value prop to move from an on-prem system to a SaaS offering, we will be there hand-in-hand to do that. And our ultimate belief is, that will reward us in a meaningful way. When the dam breaks, we might -- we will not only get the conversion of our existing on-prem customers to the SaaS offering, but have a differentiated offer for those in other competitive environments that might want to move to the best-in-class solution at PTC. Yes. Very important question. And to be clear, I'm going to be very consistent around making sure, across the broad portfolio of capabilities we have, to make sure with all of you, we focus in not only internally, but as we report our messaging to you around the largest value creation from an aggregate dollar perspective, those priorities, which I made around PLM, SLM, with ServiceMax, ALM, the CAD piece of it as well as how we transition our customers to SaaS. That doesn't mean IoT, AR, Servigistics Arbortext, FlexPLM aren't important. I have and we have leaders there, capable leaders working through that, many of which are important to our digital thread, many of which of those products are important to industrial manufacturers going through a digital transformation. And what I meant by prioritization and focus is as a general way in which the company has done for many years now, during the planning process, I'm making sure with the team here that, like I said, we put more wood behind the arrows that create the highest value creation opportunities and make sure those that might not have as strong of an outlook or have a different investment profile, we look at that with the time horizon and make the right concise decision to prioritize where we put the investment dollars, and where we may want to de-prioritize a few of those based on the outlook of that business. Right now, we have a very broad portfolio, I feel good about it. But, we've been doing it consistently over the last three years just making sure we're placing the next incremental dollar in the highest value creation opportunities, going forward. Hey, Tyler. So let me try, and then Kristian could add to this. The two actually are related, your two questions. And as you know, the on-prem business is delivering really solid growth. And one of the reasons why we talk about PLM, PLM expansion, we are still in the early innings of PLM, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, in the early innings of being the system of record for product data across our customer base. It is happening in many cases. But there is, as far as the eye can see, in all the travels Jim and I have been doing to meet with customers, it is now happening. And so -- and this is based on our on-premise Windchill systems. So that gives the confidence as we think through structuring, scaling, enabling our sellers, the marketing around it, to make Windchill that system of record for product data that we're seeing in already some of our customers, that's why I have the confidence around really putting the wood behind the arrow around that initiative, combined with the ALM initiative that has a very interesting growth factor that we talked about, that is predominantly on-premise. It will move to cloud over time. But those two growth vectors are and the wood behind those two arrows are on-premise to be crystal clear. And then as a prior question asked, our Creo on-premise business is solid and rocking and rolling. So those three things combined, lastly, with the ServiceMax cross-sell, which is a SaaS product, as you know, Tyler, those give the confidence around the continuation and the types of guidance that we put out in the mid and long term. That being said, for the mid-teens and the -- midterm to long-term ARR guidance, there is an element of SaaS starting to transition into that ARR growth rate in the mid- to long-term. My point around the 10-year is the industry and all our customers will take, in aggregate, that long, but we already are taking Windchill+, some Creo+ customers along in the journey. And that should accrete in the mid and long term. And maybe we see the dam break earlier and it accretes faster, but our estimate is to be tempered here and to work with customers hand-in-hand to get that upside on the SaaS transition. Kristian, anything to add? That's the first time Kristian Talvitie complimented me. Thank you, Kristian. No. Yes. Look, Ansys has been a good partner of ours for many years and will continue to be a good partner. They are part of how we talk about and have a value prop around Creo and the added simulation capabilities. And we help them similarly, right, around what they're doing on simulation with ours. So it's a very good partnership for both sides and critical to both sides to a certain extent. To be clear, too, this is actually if the deal goes through, right? I'm not a regulator so I can't speculate on that. But if the deal goes through and Synopsys is the eventual owner of Ansys, the great thing for us is there's zero overlap that we have with Synopsys, which might, over time, I don't know yet, but might, over time, create an opportunity for us. Yes. We haven't seen China be a drag on us. Hey, Steve. Yes. Thanks for the question, Jay. In terms of ServiceMax cross-sell, a key factor is having product companies, OEM manufacturers having long life cycle assets in the field. And if you want to double-click, critical assets within life sciences, electronics and high tech, the industrial manufacturing space, the ones that are in the field for a long time, the product companies are now needing service revenue to offset any declines or lack of new product innovation to make sure that they're getting a consistent durable revenue stream themselves. So that's a consistent correlation that we're seeing from a customer lens. Two is when a customer has Windchill, one thing that's really interesting is this past quarter, we won a very large industrial manufacturing win at ServiceMax, over a 7-digit-plus deal that, quite frankly, I was trying to win for five straight years at ServiceMax on our own unsuccessfully. And we were able to take this deal down because the customer has Creo and Windchill. And they, over time, as they implemented ServiceMax, want the asset field record, the system of record of the asset to actually flow back to their PLM system. So the combined solution, Jay, of -- and the correlation point of a customer with Windchill with long life cycle assets that they produce is a really nice makeup, which brings that math of 300 ServiceMax customers equated with 3,000 similar like-minded PTC customers. Last thing quickly on ALM, which is actually a big cross-sell for us as well, that's interesting to us on the other side of it. So as we mentioned I think last earnings call, we've been seeing Codebeamer as a tip of the spear where we're particularly in automotive, automotive suppliers where now we're getting in the conversation as we're showing them the Codebeamer value prop, we also have a PLM system that might not be PTC, how can the two work together with hardware configuration management, with software configuration management, Codebeamer. Should we actually look at PTC for the combined offering? That's interesting to us. We're starting to see it. I wouldn't call it a trend yet but it's another opportunity that might have a correlation that we're starting to see some early signs of, Jay. Yes. I'm going to -- I'll take the Windchill piece, and maybe I could ask Jim as I'm getting deeper into the Creo piece to comment on that. But one of the interesting things we're seeing with our prioritization of putting wood behind more of the arrow in the PLM expansion category, which is predominantly Windchill, as you know, Jay, is when customers are going through an ERP migration, particularly SAP to S/4HANA, we're seeing that as a really interesting point where the customer is looking at what workflows belong in ERP system versus MBS versus a PLM system. And we're actually feeling advantaged when that introspection is happening to have more functionality being put within a PLM system, which makes Windchill far more important in the transition process. So that's a theme we're starting to see, number one. And number two, again to reiterate, the idea of having a broad portfolio not only on the SLM side, ALM side, I believe we're starting to have the customer conversations where having a Windchill PLM system becomes more critical to have a common data flow over time through the thread. And we'll see whether that amounts to competitive placements, but we see that as a continuation of some themes that are interesting for us for Windchill expansion. Jim, do you want to talk about Creo? Yes. I mean, I'll start, Saket. Good to hear your voice. I'll let Kristian talk about if we do break out ALM from a size perspective. But it is, from my perspective, nowhere near the size of Creo and Windchill at this current time. However, the pace of growth is extremely exciting. I mean, as fast as I've seen West Coast start-ups start growing, I'm starting to see that same level of percentage growth year-over-year. We got some work to do so it's not going to be a straight up into the right line. But that being said, one of the things we've been seeing is Codebeamer is catching fire. I think we mentioned that as a quote from last quarter's call. And we're seeing as the adoption occurs or a POC occurs at a large automotive company that, for example, Jim and I were in Japan. Once they start testing out, this thing goes big relatively quick. As an example, we won a very -- what we thought was a very large Codebeamer, not the one that we press released, another one within Q4, right, of last year of a large European auto maker. This last quarter, we got an add-on order already of sizable value from that same customer. So that's leading to this excitement piece, number one. Number two is some of these deals with Codebeamer are very substantial size, right? Not only the add-on orders but like the size of the deal because the users that need software development tools like Codebeamer, are, in some cases, a lot larger of a population than the mechanical engineers. And so that's why it has such a what we call a prioritization of the high dollar value creation opportunities. That's why part of that. Yes, here. So let's just try rough sizing and say it this way. This year, we ought to pass through the $100 million mark on ARR with our ALM segment. Accretive to growth. Thanks, Jim, truly, and thank you, everyone, for joining us and for your questions today. In the weeks ahead, Kristian, Mike DiTullio, Matt Shimao and I will be on the road participating in investor conferences, and it would be great to keep the dialogue going. During the last week of February, Kristian will be at the JPMorgan Credit Conference in Miami. Matt will attend the Wolfe Conference in New York. During the first week of March, we'll be at the Morgan Stanley and KeyBanc conferences in San Francisco, then Mike DiTullio will attend the Virtual Loop conference during the second week of March. And also, we have two bus tours coming to visit us at our Boston headquarters next week. Those visits will be hosted by Kristian and me. Please reach out to JPMorgan or Piper Sandler if you're interested. And on behalf of the team, thank you, again, and we look forward to engaging with you."

            "name": "Kristian Talvitie",
            "content": "Thanks, Neil, and hello, everyone. Starting off with slide 15, PTC, again, delivered solid financial results in terms of both ARR and free cash flow, which we believe are the most important metrics to assess the performance of our business. Our constant currency ARR growth was 23% in Q1 and on an organic basis excluding ServiceMax our growth was 13%. Note, that we acquired ServiceMax in Q2 of fiscal '23, so starting next quarter Q2 of fiscal '24, we will no longer exclude ServiceMax from our organic results. To help investors understand our business performance, excluding the impact of FX volatility, we've been providing ARR guidance and disclosing our ARR results on a constant currency basis. At the end of Q1 our constant currency ARR was $2.016 billion, slightly above the guidance range we provided for the quarter. In Q1, our cash flow results also came in slightly ahead of our guidance, with operating cash flow of $187 million and free cash flow of $183 million. As a reminder, our Q1 cash flows included a $30 million of imputed interest related to the deferred payment for ServiceMax. Our cash flow performance is driven by our ARR and operating efficiency. And in Q1, we extended our track-record of disciplined operational management, while continuing to invest in key priorities like ALM and SaaS. Turning to slide 16. Let's look at our ARR growth by geographic region. Although FX continues to be volatile and the selling environment remained challenging in Q1, our constant currency organic ARR growth was solid across the Americas, Europe and APAC with growth in the low to mid-double-digits. On APAC our year-over-year organic constant currency growth increased to 14% in Q1, compared to 12% in Q4. And in the Americas and Europe, our organic year-over-year constant currency growth in Q1 was comparable to what we saw in Q4. Turning to slide 17. Let's look at our ARR growth by product group. In CAD, we delivered 10% constant currency ARR growth in Q1 with the growth, primarily driven by Creo. In PLM, our constant currency ARR growth was 33%, 19 points of this growth was attributable to ServiceMax; and therefore, our organic constant currency growth in Q1 was 14%. In PLM, our organic growth was primarily driven by Windchill and also supported by strong percentage growth in ALM, thanks to Codebeamer. Although the manufacturing PMIs have indicated a sluggish overall demand environment for many quarters now, our topline has shown good resilience. Part of this is because of our subscription license model, our low churn rates and the propensity for our customer-base to prioritize R&D investments through challenging times. In addition, as Neil explained earlier, our solid ARR growth is being supported by the digital transformation journeys of our customers, which we believe is a secular trend. Moving to slide 18. We ended the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $265 million. Given the consistency and predictability of our free cash flow, we aim to maintain a low cash balance and prefer to maximize debt reduction. Our gross debt was $2.267 billion with an aggregate interest-rate of 5.7%. During Q1, our gross debt decreased by $55 million. We used $181 million of cash to paydown debt, which was partially offset by $96 million, primarily related to Pure Systems and the $30 million imputed interest payment related to the final payment for the ServiceMax transaction, which we discussed previously. We were 2.8 times levered at the end of Q1 '24, and expect that to trend down throughout the remainder of the year as we are prioritizing paying down our debt this fiscal year. We intend to use substantially all of our free cash flow to paydown our debt this year and expect to end the year with gross debt of approximately $1.7 billion. In connection with this, we have temporarily paused our share repurchase program and expect our diluted share count to increase by approximately 1 million shares in fiscal '24. Heading into fiscal \u201825, we'll revisit the prioritization of debt paydown and share repurchases. Our long-term goal assuming our debt-to-EBITDA ratio is below 3 times, remains to return approximately 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases while also taking into consideration the interest rate environment and strategic opportunities. With that, I'll take you through our guidance on Slide 19. We're maintaining our fiscal '24 guidance, and following our solid Q1 results, we believe we're well positioned to deliver on our guidance for the full-year. For Q2, our constant currency ARR guidance range of $2.05 billion to $2.065 billion corresponds to year-over-year growth of 11% to 12%, I'll get into more details on the next slide. On cash flows, we're guiding to free cash flow of approximately $240 million in the second quarter. To help you with your models, we are continuing to provide revenue and EPS guidance, but as a reminder, ASC 606 makes revenue and EPS difficult to predict for PTC since we sell primarily on-premises subscription license -- licenses and the way revenue is recognized from these contracts can vary significantly based on variables that we don't believe are necessarily relevant to the performance of the business. I actually did a teach-in on this subject on our Q4 \u201822 call that you may want to refer to, if you're new to PTC. The summary is, we believe ARR and free cash flow, rather than revenue and operating income are the best metrics to assess the performance of our business. Importantly, we've maintained consistent billing practices over-time, and we primarily bill our customers annually, upfront, one-year at a time regardless of contract term lengths. So, our free cash flow results overtime are comparable. Moving on to slide 20. Here's an illustrative constant currency ARR model for Q2 '24. You can see our results over the past nine quarters, and the column on the far right illustrates what is needed to get to the midpoint of our constant currency ARR guidance. This illustrative model indicates that to hit the midpoint of our Q2 guidance range, we need $41 million of sequential net ARR growth. Because our ARR tends to see some seasonality, the most relevant comparison is the sequential growth in Q2 of '23 and Q2 of '22. We believe we've set our Q2 '24 constant currency guidance range prudently, which reflects an ongoing sluggish selling environment. Putting this into the context of the full-year, let's turn to slide 21. Here is a repeat of the slide we showed last quarter, which illustrates what's needed to get to the midpoint of our constant currency ARR guidance for fiscal \u201824. Looking at the full-year perspective naturally removes a lot of the quarterly volatility related to large transactions and ramp deal and start date dynamics. As you can see on the slide, for illustrative purposes, even if the full-year is flattish with the last two years from a net new ARR perspective, given the incremental $20 million of deferred ARR in the back half, which we've talked about before, we would be at 12% growth for the year. We think the full-year guidance range of 11% to 14% balances both risk and opportunity. Finally, on free cash flow, we continue to have a high degree of confidence in our quarterly and full-year guidance because of the predictability of our cash collections and the disciplined budgeting process, we have in place. So in conclusion, PTC has strong portfolio and strategy and a great team of people with deep expertise and strong customer relationships. We're focused on disciplined and consistent execution to ensure we deliver on the value creation opportunities we have ahead of us. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Yes. Hey, Yun, thanks for the question. Churn rate continues to be low and steady, so let's start with that one. And yes, we will continue to try and move contracts to longer-term contracts, which we believe is beneficial for our customers as well as actually for PTC. So we'll continue to try and move in that direction. And then lastly, I think, your question was around the average contract length, which as it stands right now, still hovers around a two-year term. Yes. Hey, Adam, it's Kristian. No, I mean, I think that our OpEx guidance for the year is pretty well in line -- it remains unchanged from really what we would have said 90 days ago. In terms of areas where we're investing incrementally this year, it's what we've been talking about. There's ALM in particular, there's some investments into SaaS, which includes Windchill+, includes Creo+, actually includes some Atlas those are areas where we've got incremental investment going this year. But in terms of change to the investment profile from last quarter, I'm not sure I'm tracking with you. Yes. Hey, it's Kristian. Thanks. Good question. So again, I think Q1, again, despite a challenging environment, I think we executed well. I think that across geographies, across product segments, hopefully, that showed through in our results. As far as the full-year is concerned, again, we are maintaining our full-year guidance, as we start looking at Q2 here. I think, we're just trying to be prudent on the immediate-term outlook. But as a reminder, I guess, for everybody as it gets back to the -- there's ARR and then there's cash flow. And on the cash flow side of things, whether there could be more volatility on ARR on the cash flow side of things, both from a quarterly and annual guidance perspective, I think, we feel very good about that guidance. But otherwise, I think seasonality is kind of in line with last year from an ARR perspective, taking into account the incremental deferred we've talked about ad Nauseam. I think that was spectacular. I wanted to say it might be the first time I've complimented anybody. Yes, that would be FX-related. Really, no, no. That's a great question. And so let's just -- I think the right -- the thing that you need to remember with ARR and cash flow is, we'll call it ARR equates to invoicing and then cash flow relates to collections and payments. And so our standard terms are 30 days, and depending on the customer, our average terms are definitely longer than 30 days. But let's just work with 30 days, which means that any incremental ARR that we get in a quarter, that comes in the last month of the quarter actually, isn't impacting that quarter's cash collections and therefore that quarter's cash flows. That all goes to the subsequent quarter. So you have to just remember that time lag when you're thinking about it. Does that make sense, Steve? Yes, I feel better when it's more front-end loaded too, Steve. And I think what we said, if we're going to be super technical about it, is more than 55%. And now we're just kind of honing in on the map and saying it's going to be more like 58%. But otherwise, I think we had great collections performance here in Q1 and the outlook for Q2 is solid as well. So I think we feel pretty good about the range for Q2 and obviously our outlook for the year. Thanks. At some point this year, yes, and it's growing faster than the... The overall company growth. It's accretive to growth."
