At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.\nKristina Kazarian: Good morning, and welcome to the MPLX fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at mplx.com, under the Investors tab. Joining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan, Chairman, President and CEO; Pam Beall, CFO; and other members of the executive team. We invite you to read the safe harbor statements and non-GAAP disclaimer on Slide 2. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the call and during the question-and-answer session that follows. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC. Now with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Hennigan: Thanks, Kristina. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call. Earlier today, we\u2019ve reported adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2020 of $1.4 billion and full year 2020 adjusted EBITDA of $5.2 billion. Considering the unprecedented challenges our industry faced throughout 2020, we're proud of the way our performance highlighted the resiliency and stability of our underlying business. Despite the difficult macro environment, we were able to grow total BcF for 2020 compared to 2019. Additionally, our results demonstrate our commitment to executing on the priorities we laid out for the year. We made strides on optimizing our portfolio, announcing the sale of the Javelina facility in Corpus Christi, Texas. While not large in size, this is an example of the continued effort we're making to focus on the assets that have long-term strategic value to the company. We reduced our capital spend in 2020 by over $700 million from the target. We also took necessary steps to address our long-term cost structure achieving our target to reduce forecasted operating expenses by over $200 million. These expense reductions were key to offset earnings headwinds, particularly in the L&S segment, and we believe they will be enduring long term. Our cost reduction efforts are particularly meaningful when you consider we have not compromised our commitment to safely operating our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees and support the communities in which we operate. As a result of these concerted efforts, we were able to generate excess cash flow for the full year 2020 after self-funding our distribution and capital program. This inflection occurred earlier than our original target of 2021 and gave us the financial flexibility to begin repurchasing units in the fourth quarter of 2020. Today, we also announced a growth capital outlook for 2021 of $800 million, focused on investments in projects expected to deliver our highest returns. This outlook represents a continued reduction in capital spend as we work to high grade our portfolio of investments, focusing on projects that achieve robust returns, irrespective of the market environment. We remain committed to strict capital and expense discipline, and that discipline, combined with EBITDA growing over time, supports our continuing goal of generating excess cash for 2021 and providing the opportunity to return incremental capital to our unitholders. Shifting to Slide 5, I'd like to provide some comments on our responsibilities around sustainability and corporate leadership. Last quarter, we discussed the publication of our 2020 climate perspectives report, highlighting opportunities and strategic planning work the company is engaged in related to climate scenarios. We also discussed our goal to reduce methane emission intensity in the G&P business. It's important that we set objectives for the organization that drive our continuous improvement on ESG. Our focus on leading in sustainable energy positions us to deliver strong results in this space from lowering the carbon intensity of our operations and products to improving energy efficiency and conserving natural resources while using innovative technologies to do it. We believe the goals we are setting and our transparent disclosures on how we plan to achieve them, position us well for the future. I'm proud to see some of our team's efforts in the ESG arena recognized in 2020 with API's Distinguished Pipeline Safety Award as well as 2 EPA Energy Star Challenge awards for energy efficiency. These accomplishments highlight that at all levels of our business, our team members are proactive and engaged in ensuring the safety of those in the communities where we have the privilege to operate and protecting the environment we all share. Now let me turn the call over to Pam to discuss our operational and financial results.\nPam Beall: Thanks, Mike, and good morning. As Mike mentioned earlier, MPLX delivered fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 billion and full year EBITDA of $5.2 billion. Distributable cash flow of $1.2 billion for the fourth quarter provided strong distribution coverage of 1.58 times, and we ended the year with leverage of 3.9 times. Our quick response to the challenging demand environment allowed us to increase our EBITDA by $100 million for the year. In the L&S segment, the strength of our underlying contracts and operating expense reductions more than offset the impact of lower volumes in the system. The gathering and processing segment also benefited from lower operating expenses, partially offsetting the impact of production curtailment in certain basins. I'm pleased to report that our 2020 results represent the first full year that MPLX has funded both our total capital investments and distributions to our unitholders with $266 million of excess cash flow after these activities. During the fourth quarter, we began to implement the Board-authorized unit repurchase program of up to $1 billion of our outstanding publicly traded common units. Looking forward, we expect our assets to continue to provide strong cash flow. Our capital allocation will continue to focus on fully funding our capital needs and distributions with cash generated from operations, while maintaining an investment-grade credit profile and returning excess cash to our unitholders. We expect to maintain the distribution and the pace of unit repurchases will depend on several factors, including: excess cash available, alternative investment opportunities and the business and market conditions. During 2021, we expect to invest approximately $800 million in growth capital and $165 million in maintenance capital. Slide 7 outlines the fourth quarter logistics and storage segment highlights. Volumes across our pipeline and terminal systems were lower compared with the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily driven by lower utilization at MPC's refineries. However, we continue to execute on our operating expense reductions to offset lower throughput. During the quarter, we continued to progress our strategy of creating an integrated crude oil and natural gas logistics systems from the Permian to the Gulf Coast. We expect the Wink to Webster crude oil pipeline in which MPLX has an equity interest to continue to place assets in service throughout 2021. In line with our focus on projects with minimal return risk, the pipeline system has 100% of its contractable capacity committed with minimum volume commitments. As we progress construction activities for the Whistler natural gas pipeline, we expect a start-up of the project in the second half of 2021. And finally, we continue to work towards an in-service date in the second half of the year for the NGL takeaway solution. As a reminder, this project is an optimized approach compared to the BANGL project as it was originally contemplated, largely utilizing existing infrastructure with minimal capital investment by MPLX. Outside of the Permian, we ran a successful open season for the expansion of the Salt Lake City core pipeline, with the 11,000 barrel per day expansion expected to be completed later this year. While we're on the topic of our logistics and storage segment, I wanted to take a moment to discuss the renewal of the marine contract between MPC and MPLX. This contract was renewed in January for an additional five-year term for the same capacity of boats and barges. As mentioned on the prior call, the renewal terms include a reset of the contracted equipment rates to current market levels. Based on changes in market rates, we're estimating a reduction to our marine services EBITDA, it will be less than $100 million or less than 2% of our full year 2020 EBITDA. We continue to hear concerns from the investor community regarding MPLX's exposure to contract renewals with our sponsor, MPC, and we'd like to take this opportunity to highlight that many of these assets that MPLX operates are fit-for-purpose to MPC's business and in most cases, the optimal solution MPC has for its logistics needs. We fully expect MPC to renew contracts with MPLX as they mature over time. We do not expect MPC to commit incremental capital to duplicate systems that already exist. Now moving on to our gathering and processing business. Slide 8 provides fourth quarter segment highlights. For the fourth quarter of 2020, gathered volumes were lower than the same period last year across our footprint due to lower dry gas volumes in the Utica, a planned outage in the Marcellus and production curtailments in other regions. Processed and fractionated volumes were also lower than the same period last year, except for the Marcellus, where processed volumes increased 8% and fractionated volumes increased 10%. During the fourth quarter, in the Marcellus, our processing units continued to run at high utilization rates, setting a record 6 Bcf per day in the region. We also achieved record fractionation volumes of 300,000 barrels per day at our Hopedale facility following the third quarter completion of an 80,000 barrel per day expansion. In the past, we provided an estimate of the impact to earnings of a $0.05 move in NGL prices. With the planned sale of the Javelina refinery off gas processing facility in Corpus Christi, we do expect a reduction in our direct commodity price exposure. For 2021, we would expect a $0.05 change in the weighted average NGL basket to have an approximate $20 million annual impact to EBITDA. While higher NGL prices will have less of a direct impact to MPLX earnings, rising NGL prices will have an indirect benefit, providing an incentive for producers to shift drilling to rich gas areas where our processing and fractionation infrastructure can be more highly utilized. Looking forward to 2021, in the Northeast, we have opportunities to optimize our plant utilization as we expect producers to pursue modest production growth while maintaining free cash flow. We also expect to bring the Smithburg 1 facility online around the middle of the year, and we expect to see incremental ethane recovery with improving economics. On Slide 9, moving to our fourth quarter financial highlights. Total L&S segment adjusted EBITDA was $884 million and the gathering and processing segment contributed $471 million in adjusted EBITDA. For the quarter, we generated approximately $1.2 billion of distributable cash flow and returned $742 million to our unitholders through distributions. We also repurchased $33 million of publicly held units during the quarter. The bridge on Slide 10 shows the change in adjusted EBITDA from the fourth quarter of 2019 to the fourth quarter of 2020. The logistics and storage segment increased $31 million year-over-year, primarily driven by lower operating expenses and partially offset by decreased pipeline and terminal volumes due to lower utilization at MPC refineries. The gathering and processing segment increased $5 million, benefiting from lower operating expenses and higher processed and fractionated volumes in Marcellus. Slide 9 provides a summary of key financial highlights and select balance sheet information. We ended the year with a leverage ratio of 3.9 time, approximately $3.3 billion available on our bank revolver and $1.5 billion available on our intercompany facility with MPC. We intend to maintain our investment-grade credit profile, and we expect our leverage to be approximately 4 times in 2021 and to decline over time with modest growth in EBITDA. As I mentioned earlier, for the first time in the company's history, we generated excess cash after capital and investments -- capital investments and distributions for the full year of 2020. With the progress made in 2020, our continued capital and expense discipline and growth in EBITDA, we expect to continue generating excess cash flow for 2021, providing financial flexibility to pursue value-creating opportunities for our unitholders, including unit repurchases. And now let me turn the call back to Kristina.\nKristina Kazarian: Thanks, Pam. [Operator Instructions]. You may reprompt for additional questions as time permits. With that, we will now open the line to questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nShneur Gershuni: Maybe to start off, you generated excess free cash flow after distributions in 2019 -- sorry, in 2020, and it looks that way in 2021 or assuming that's the plan in 2021. Leverage is currently at 3.9 times. I was wondering if you can share with us the order of priorities before this excess cash split between, say, leverage buybacks and distribution increases. Just wondering if you can sort of rank order the priorities as you think about that excess cash generation on a go-forward basis.\nMike Hennigan: Shneur, it's Mike. I'll give you some color on that. First off, I would try to remind everybody that it's not a set it and just let it go on forever. We're going to continue to look at where we stand on each of the parameters and then make decisions more dynamically rather than not. So where we've been, Shneur, is we've been comfortable with our leverage and a lot of people have asked us, how do you feel about that. And we've been running around 4 times for some pretty consistent amount of time. So we're comfortable there and the way we look at it right at the moment is -- and we started this just towards the end of the fourth quarter. But we look at where we're trading, where the equity is trading. And right now, we have a DPU yield of around 12%. We got a DCF yield of around 17%. And if the equity is going to trade at that kind of level then our priority in the short-term would obviously be to buy back units. We'd love to be able to do all of the above. But as you mentioned, you're going to have to prioritize as things go on and conditions change, et cetera. Love to be able to have a program that hits the highest priority at the time. But we're going to kind of look at it quarter-to-quarter or more dynamically and decide what we think is the best use. And right now, trading at 17% DCF, that's probably the highest priority we have right now because leverage is in a good spot, the market is not rewarding distribution growth right at the moment. But I think some of these things can change over time. I think the key for us, and I'm hoping the market is realizing that our goal was to get to free cash flow to put ourselves in this position. We got there a little earlier than we were expecting, which was good. And at the end of the day, I'm hoping that 2020 has shown the market that we have pretty consistent earnings. There's been a lot of questions around the stability and the consistency of the earnings. So hopefully, the year, as everybody used the word unprecedented, has played itself out and continues. As everyone knows, we're not through with the pandemic yet, but once we establish post the pandemic, I think we're going to be in a mode where we're going to continue to grow earnings. Like we've said over time, we are going to continue to look at cost-cutting that we made as a major effort this year. And then to your question is, we'll be dynamic and report out each time what we think is the best use of that return of capital. I would give one last comment that our distribution is still a pretty healthy return of capital as is, and we've stated many times that we support that distribution. We think it's very solid. We think this past year has shown that, and then we're going to continue to grow DCF and grow our earnings and see what the best use is. I'm hoping that helps you.\nShneur Gershuni: No, that does, and really do appreciate the direct answer, actually. Just to -- as a follow-up question, I don't want to overuse the word unprecedented, but 2020 was. And certainly, in terms of your responses to it, when I think about maintenance capital, you've got $165 million. I think, it's the forecast for this year. When I sort of think about that number, is that kind of the new run rate that you're sort of thinking about as the assets stand today? Is there any catch-up in there that you didn't do in 2020, and that should be lower as we sort of think about '22, assuming an apples-to-apples asset profile? Just wondering if you can sort of talk about the makeup of that $165 million.\nPam Beall: Yes, Shneur, it's Pam. I'll take that one. So in 2019, our maintenance capital was actually about $200 million, and it dropped significantly last year. So a number of factors, certainly, influencing that. One is what was happening just across the space and in terms of a lower utilization of our refining assets and refining logistics assets at MPC's refineries. So that was having a significant influence on the downward pressure. And certainly, with a lot of uncertainties driving some of those costs lower, that made sense. So there is a nice increase that you see in 2021 of $165 million. A couple of things to keep in mind, MPC and MPLX both expense out a lot of maintenance. So when you look at our maintenance activities, we, for example, expense API 653 tank work. A lot of companies would capitalize that work. And so we are maintaining our assets in a fashion that will allow us to continue to have reliability and integrity. So it's -- don't just look at the maintenance capital and draw conclusions about how well we're maintaining our assets from that metric alone. And then just something else to keep in mind, as part of the ANDX inherited contracts with ANDV, there was a provision where we would be reimbursed for some of the maintenance activity. And so that also is causing the maintenance capital number to be a little bit lower. And over time, as those contracts roll off and those -- that tank work is complete, the maintenance capital related to that activity would certainly increase. The other thing we've mentioned from time to time is the fact that in the gathering and processing segment of the business, those assets are really new. We've spent a tremendous amount of capital, particularly in the Marcellus and Utica. And so the expected maintenance for those assets have been quite low. So it will obviously change over time. It will also be influenced by the assets that are in our portfolio, as MPC continues to evaluate its portfolio as part of its optimization. And so I can't say that this is a fixed run rate, Shneur. I think we're just going to have to give you some guidance as we move forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJeremy Tonet: Just want to start off with the G&P side of the business here. And it seems like Marcellus processing volumes are continuing to grow, but there's been kind of declines across other basins. And just wondering if you could update us with regards to producer-customer conversations, and I guess, what expectations you have for activity across your G&P footprint this year. Should we expect those declines to continue? Or do you see them kind of abating?\nMike Hennigan: Jeremy, it's Mike. Thanks for that question. One of the things that we've talked constantly about is the G&P space and what our expectation is because a lot of people have questioned overall. And I'll give you -- big picture is we still feel really good about the business. We think it's going to grow earnings over time. Our -- as you pointed out, our Marcellus and Permian areas are continuing to grow, although we have seen some declines in some of the other areas. We've been pretty open about -- we're in eight basins today, and we're going to look to optimize that at some point, but the market hasn't been willing to give us the right offer for that -- those other assets that we think maybe belong in someone else's portfolio. So we're happy to keep them to keep generating cash and proceed in the mode that we've been in. But I think the big takeaway overall is the expectation in natural gas, in our opinion, has started to move back towards a positive dynamic. There's been a lot of discussion going into the pandemic about where gas was and being overwhelmed by associated gas, et cetera, et cetera. We had not been believers in that, and a lot of people were calling us on our view there. But at the same time, I think it's kind of played out a little bit as we were expecting, which is natural gas is going to be an important dynamic going forward. The earnings growth, we think will be good, but not double digit. We've said that many times as well. We're not expecting the robust growth that was there before. So producers in that space, similar to the oil space, are looking at their portfolios and trying to manage their balance sheets and their cash flow, et cetera. So I think this slow growth model is starting to play itself out a little more or becoming a little more obvious, I think, to investors than was in the past. So our conversations continue along the same activity that we've been seeing. Some areas, not going to get a lot of capital deployment. Other areas is kind of core to some of the bigger players. We've mentioned many times that our core areas are the Marcellus and the Permian. We're seeing growth in those areas. To your point, we're seeing a little bit of decline in the other areas. But as long as we're still kicking off cash in those areas, we still believe it's a contribution to the enterprise.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. And then just wanted to go back to, I guess, the opening remarks with regards to the barge contract renewals. Was that -- $100 million was -- in 2021, was that the impact there? And just are there any other kind of contract renewals over the next three years or so that we should be thinking about that could have changes in the rates when they're renewed?\nPam Beall: Yes. It's Pam, and I'll take that, Jeremy. So yes, we said it's less than $100 million, which is less than 2% of the 2020 annual EBITDA. And we have a lot of contracts between MPC and MPLX. The largest contracts that have the most EBITDA related to MPLX came about in 2018. So they have a long life. And those were refining logistics and fuels distribution. And keep in mind, the pipeline contracts that we have are all FERC-based rates. So we -- yes, there will be contracts that come up for renewal. There are no other contracts that I'm aware of that actually have this kind of an automatic rate reset provision baked into the agreement. It's just the way it was structured. It was about a five- to six-year period of time that it was in place and then it just is an automatic update on market rates. And so at sometimes, that's going to be a benefit to MPC. Sometimes that will be a benefit to MPLX as market conditions do change over time. There are rate escalation or fee escalation provisions in those agreements as well. So just keep that kind of thing in mind. But -- and as I said in the prepared remarks, we fully expect that MPC is going to renew these contracts with MPLX. In many cases, it has no other ingress or egress to its facility. So we fully expect these contracts are going to be renewed, and MPC owns a majority interest of MPLX and gets a lot of cash back from MPLX. So we think it's in the mutual interest of MPC and MPLX to continue the positive relationship that we have enjoyed.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Mackay with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJohn Mackay: Just maybe I want to circle back on a little bit of what Jeremy was getting into. Can you talk a little bit about the Javelina asset sale? And maybe what the impact to EBITDA it would be? And then just if you take that impact, add in the kind of marine recontracting, just talk about some of the other puts and takes on how you get comfortable with 2021 EBITDA being flat to maybe up a little bit.\nPam Beall: Yes. Happy to take that one, John. The Javelina assets, it's a good asset. We expect to close on it here in the fourth -- in the first quarter of 2021. It just didn't really fit our long-term plan. It's really a fractionation facility that processes refinery off gas. It's on the smaller side in terms of EBITDA contribution. So it's not something that's going to make a significant impact on our outlook for 2021. And then in terms of our expectations for 2021, I think maybe one way to think about this is, if you go back and just analyze kind of our weakest quarter which was the second quarter and then analyze our strongest quarter, which was the third quarter, you're going to come up with something in the range of $4.9 billion to $5.3 billion of EBITDA, okay? And we're going to continue to pursue cost reductions. So think about some cost reductions in 2021 offsetting some of the headwinds associated with the marine contract rate resetting. So I hope that's helpful to keep in mind. And then where 2021 shakes out is really going to depend in large part with the recovery, the recovery of volumes for the MPC system as well as the recovery for producers and their production volumes.\nJohn Mackay: That's really helpful. Maybe just one on CapEx and a follow-up. I mean if we look at the $800 million growth CapEx guidance, it looks like there's still some kind of room in there if we think about what you need to spend on the G&P side and then just what is left on Wink to Webster and Whistler. Just curious if you can kind of talk about where that could move to once those larger projects roll off?\nPam Beall: Yes. I think it's premature to talk about where it might move to. Certainly, there could be opportunity for that CapEx to come in lower. And again, I think it's really something that's going to be tied to what we're seeing in the producer community, both on the crude gathering side as well as the gas side of the business. So I think it'd be prudent for us to wait and see how that unfolds throughout the year. So -- but yes, we'll continue to look at all those opportunities where maybe we don't have to spend as much capital as we move through the year. I would say about roughly half of the expected CapEx is going to be on the G&P side of the business and roughly half is going to be on the L&S side of the business. And we do have some completion of some pipeline expansions. Certainly, you mentioned the Whistler project's going to take a little bit more capital in 2021 as we wrap up there. But largely on the G&P side, it's going to be dependent on the macroeconomic outlook and what producers do with the drill bits.\nJohn Mackay: That's great.\nMike Hennigan: Mike, the other thing I just want to add kind of goes to the question Shneur asked in the beginning is, our whole deployment of capital and return of capital is going to try and be as dynamic as we can be, as we go throughout the year. So in a big picture, we say these are about the guidelines that we're giving you. But as we go out through the year before we pull the trigger on any capital spend, where we still have the choice, something that's not already in progress, we're going to continue to look at what's the best use. And like I said, for our equity trades where it is, we'll deploy more capital towards it because in our opinion, it's been undervalued. But we'll compare that versus the choices we have on capital deployment as well as the long-term strategy in supporting the customer base that we have. So hopefully, it will be a little bit more dynamic and a little bit more thoughtful as far as long term. And I really just want to emphasize, we're going to try and use that word strict capital discipline and make that part of our mantra and strict cost discipline and make that part of our mantra. That's some of the things that we're trying to put a little more emphasis on than we have in the past.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nMichael Blum: I guess the first question I wanted to ask was just on Wink to Webster and Whistler. Can you remind us what the duration of those contracts are? And the reason I'm asking that is it would seem at this point those pipelines are adding capacity that probably maybe isn't needed right now by the market. So I just want to understand how long those cash flows are protected?\nMike Hennigan: Michael, it's Mike. So on those projects, if you recall, I'll give you a big picture, and then I'll answer your question. We had stated a couple of years ago that we had significant capital deployment opportunities in three big projects: Whistler and Wink to Webster, two you're referencing. And then the third was BANGL. And the issue that we had in front of us is that Whistler and Wink to Webster, we got MVC protection. And then to your direct question, those contracts vary but put them in the 10-plus year environment. So very long-term. We'll use the rounded number of 10 as a guidepost for you. But at the end of the day, we have long-term commitments. We have MVC protection on it. And that's why we went forward with those two projects. That's why Wink to Webster and Whistler became part of our mantra. On BANGL, although we like the project, and although it was something in our mind, it could have been a long-term winner for us. We did not get MVC protection the way we would like to from the customer base. It was not something that they were willing to commit to, and we understand the reasoning. But as a result of that, without that long-term commitment and without that long-term MVC, our commercial team looked at it and kind of rethought what's the best way to do it and not deploy capital or put that capital at risk in the original intent, and we changed that quite a bit down to a much lower capital solution using some existing pipe and partnering with some other players, et cetera, and became a win where we were able to satisfy the customers' needs but not put ourselves at risk on the deployment of capital that wasn't backed as strongly as we would like. So Wink to Webster and Whistler ended up where we wanted it to be, long-term contracts to your question, MVC protected, and we think they're going to be terrific projects. We think the modified or smaller BANGL project is also good. It's just not what the original intent was because of the very point. We did not get that long-term MVC-protected portion of the contract. Does that make sense to you?\nMichael Blum: Absolutely. I appreciate the answer very much. The second question I had is just wanted to go back to a comment made during the prepared remarks. I think you talked about potentially optimizing processing capacity in the Northeast. I just want to understand better exactly what you meant by that. Would you -- are you considering idling processing plants? Or is there something else in that comment to understand?\nPam Beall: No. It's Pam. Let me take that one. So there clearly are opportunities for us to have higher utilization of some of the plants that we have in the Northeast. And some of the pipeline work that we've undertaken over the past couple of years is going to allow us to shift volumes. So perhaps there are some opportunities to where we might have really high utilization, and we need to shift some volumes to a different location. But that's what we mean about the opportunity to optimize the assets. It's not that we're looking to actually -- to the extent there was an opportunity, it made sense, we'd certainly consider it, but we're not looking necessarily at shuttering any plants, but being able to balance volumes across the system with the investments that we've made. And then just the best return that we can get on our capital is filling up the plants that we already have in place without allocating capital to new additions. So that's the thought there.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Christine Cho with Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nChristine Cho: Pam, I wanted to maybe start off with I think it was a comment you said in prepared remarks about increased ethane recovery. And I was just curious, is the Shell cracker that I think is supposed to start up later this year going to change anything on the fractionation side for you? Is more ethane going to get fractionated rather than getting rejected through your facilities? And would that be incremental cash flow? Or is that already being collected through in MVC?\nMike Hennigan: Christine, it's Mike. I'm going to let Greg make a comment on that. But before I turn it to him, I'll just say, one of the things in general in the Northeast is continuing, like I mentioned earlier, growth area. We still are very bullish in the Marcellus. As Pam was trying to answer Michael's question, there's a little bit lower utilization in the Utica side of the Northeast. So that we're trying to look to ways that we can optimize that capital that's already been deployed. Overall, we still are pretty bullish in the area. When you think longer term, where do we think the natural gas business is going. We still think the 2 core areas that we're in are the important areas to be in for natural gas overall. So from a long-term perspective, we still feel real good about it. The dynamics will change up there, and I'll let Greg give you some comments on the Shell situation. But whether it's shell or some of these other pipelines that are happening, over time, those things will work themselves out because in our view, it's still a very cost-effective area for production and natural gas. Obviously, I always say it doesn't beat associated because that's a different economic. But for on-purpose gas, we're still believers that the area that we're in is a good area. And as things continue to develop, we think we'll find opportunities to grow earnings there. Greg, do you want to add anything on the Shell question?\nGregory Floerke: Yes. Thanks, Mike. Christine, Greg Floerke here. We currently recover the large majority of the ethane in the basin. We have mentioned, I think, previously that we have a purity ethane line that connects all of our processing plants. We actually recover ethane at the processing plants and not centralize at a fractionator. So we have a lot of flexibility to recover and then transport on our own line to all the takeaway points currently to the Gulf Coast, Canada and the East Coast on the various pipelines. As our producer customers continue to sell ethane into those markets and have commitments into those markets and on other pipelines, we believe that likely continues post start-up of the Shell Monaca cracker, which would require then incremental recovery of ethane that's currently being rejected into a residue gas stream at all of these processing plant locations. So therefore, we'd expect to see incremental requirement to recover -- and there's plenty of ethane still in being rejected, that's still recoverable. But we would expect to see incremental recovery at our plants. We do have capacity in place without adding to recover on behalf of our producer customers. And we do -- that is incremental. It's on a fee basis in terms of the processing and the pipeline to the delivery points.\nChristine Cho: Got it. Very helpful. And then I guess on a follow-up, maybe moving over to L&S. Given MPC's plans to expand eastward in terms of placing product into PADD I via the Laurel or Manor pipes following multiple shutdowns at local East Coast refineries. Is there an opportunity for MPLX to somehow participate in MPC's west to east movement if PADD I becomes increasingly short product once demand recovers further?\nMike Hennigan: Christine, it's Mike. I don't know that there's going to be a capital opportunity for MPLX. There's some existing assets, as I know you're aware of, a couple of other competitive assets that are out there that would fill MPC's need because they are existing. There's opportunities for us in regard to tankage and things like that. But I don't think you're going to see any large capital expenditure from us to support that need. We'll see if things change or if the dynamic around the market supply and demand changes. But for right now, I would tell you that I don't see us putting a lot of capital into that opportunity.\nPam Beall: Yes. If it were, it would probably be around debottlenecking some of the pipelines we already have to make sure that we get the volume into those systems that MPC wants to move eastward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nKeith Stanley: I wanted to revisit the recontracting question from earlier. So specifically with the oil pipelines from the IPO where the contract expires next year. Can you say -- are those in the negotiation there? Are the new rates negotiated with MPC for the oil pipelines? Or is there a mechanism already set by which the rates would automatically adjust when you recontract?\nPam Beall: Yes. It's Pam. The overwhelming majority of our pipelines, whether we're talking crude or products, are FERC-based rates. So that's really what dictates the fees that we'll receive on those pipelines. And that fluctuates over time with the FERC index changes and PPI.\nKeith Stanley: Okay. So, you don't have\nPam Beall: No. I don't -- yes. So it's really going to be driven by the market rates and FERC rates that are in place today.\nKeith Stanley: Okay. So the rates have been changing with the index over this time period already?\nPam Beall: Yes, they do. They fluctuate each year.\nKeith Stanley: Got it. Okay. Second question. Just thinking about recovery in volumes, how can we think about the company's leverage to an eventual recovery in MPC's throughput volumes? I'm just thinking L&S EBITDA never really declined much in 2020 because you offset it with cost cuts. But how can we think about leverage to volumes on the way back up? Is it material as a driver for MPLX? Or is it pretty modest because of your contract structures?\nPam Beall: Well, I think as you look -- as you highlighted, we were able to mitigate some of the impact on the way down. We will see some improvements on the way back up. I think it's just really difficult to predict how much that might be and when. I think it's going to depend on which areas of the geography MPC sees the most robust recovery. So again, we're just -- we have a cautious optimism for 2021, and we'll just have to wait to see how it plays out.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tristan Richardson with Truist Securities.\nTristan Richardson: Appreciate all the comments on 2021. I mean, just -- maybe just going back to the prior question. I would appreciate the outlook for cautious optimism and the parent's comments on 1Q. But one of your peers is out there and -- made the comment that they could see 2021 returning to 2019 levels. Curious do you guys see overall refined product demand recovering to 2019 this year?\nMike Hennigan: Tristan, it's Mike. One of the things that I've tried to tell people is, I don't spend a lot of time trying to call exactly where the market is. And I spend more time trying to think of the banks of the river. So what if it turns out to be a poor year as far as recovery relative to the pandemic? What if it does turn out to be more robust, like you're referencing? So to me, the banks of the river are still pretty wide. Do we anticipate there could be a positive upside as a result of getting past the pandemic and vaccines working their way through and an earlier recovery? So I'd say that the bull case is we get a recovery that's robust and quick. And then the bear case is, things take a little longer than people expect because the pandemic lingers and the post pandemic activity doesn't recover quite as much. So I'm hopeful that it is the first part. As Pam said, we're cautiously optimistic. We can see some of the parameters that would have people feeling that way. And obviously, we hope that's the case. But our model, though, is to spend more time saying what if it's not the case and how do we see this playing out in case it turns out to be longer, et cetera? So I'm the first to admit that I don't know exactly when it's going to recover. I hope it is more robust than earlier than later. That's obviously our hope. That's why Pam uses the word cautious optimism. At the same time, probably, our thinking is, let's prepare for the worst and just be prepared in case this thing takes longer. I mean, some of the actual facts, as people know, is as we got into the back end of December, the pandemic was hitting harder and the cases were spiking up, and we kind of saw a second wave of restrictions. And hopefully, those are going to start to come off. And I know the new administration has a priority to get vaccination into the people's arms as quickly as possible. So there's momentum in the positive side, but -- and there's momentum that cases seem to be coming down and hopefully restrictions will be coming off, but I think it's hard to tell as to when it will actually occur. And so we're just going to prepare for both scenarios, the bull scenario, the bear scenario and look at our cases and see what we think would play out in both. That's the way we kind of approach it. I hope that helps you?\nPam Beall: I think the one wildcard that Mike's hinting at as well is just this new variant on the virus. We really don't know what kind of impact that's going to have. And so just while we think that the whole country is starting to turn the corner on this situation, this is a new kind of a wildcard that's been presented. So we'll have to see how that plays out.\nTristan Richardson: No. I appreciate it. And then just one follow-up on the optimization efforts in the Northeast. Is there a cost savings number associated with pushing volumes to the most productive plants? Can that be meaningful in the G&P segment this year?\nPam Beall: No, I wouldn't suggest that there is some meaningful upside related to that.\nMike Hennigan: It's more about capital deployment and can we optimize the capital that has already been spent. So if you look at our data, we have some areas where the utilization is very high in some areas where there's opportunity. So what Pam was referring to is our commercial and operating teams are looking at, is there a way to take advantage of that unused capacity as growth occurs in an area where there is not excess capacity? That's the idea.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Ujjwal Pradhan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nUjjwal Pradhan: First one, just around the commentary that you have provided around capital allocation framework. Very helpful. You discussed the attractive cash flow yield on the units. So compared to that, when you think about new capital projects or expansions, how would you frame the return threshold that you're using internally?\nMike Hennigan: Yes, Ujjwal, it's a good question, but it's a tough one to answer. Depending on the project, aside from just the return which you're mentioning, there's a lot of factors that come into place. Like Michael asked earlier, do you have MVC protection? How long is the project? What length of term deals that you have? So there's a lot of things that come into play. Overall, what we've been trying to tell people is, we've moved the capital down for two reasons. One is we want to set the bar higher than we have in the past as far as that capital discipline. That's one thing that's driving this. And the second is where the equity is trading. And when we're trading at a 17-ish yield on DCF, that is something that you can get very quickly with no time lag, no capital lag to execute a project, no permitting risk, no execution risk, et cetera, et cetera. So you take that for what it is at that yield and then you compare it to some of the projects that may even be better than that longer term and maybe more strategic for us. But that's kind of the process that we kind of go about looking at it. If we were trading at a much more valued equity in our mind, that dynamic would be a little bit different. But at least in the short term, while we continue to trade at these higher yields, makes us really look and I use the word disciplined on whether we want to invest the capital or not. And you know this as well as anybody. When you invest capital, you're putting money out for a couple of years before you get cash flows, et cetera, et cetera. So you weigh all that in compared to the environment that we're in now. I think the most important takeaway, though, is we've been trying to move ourselves into this excess cash flow position so that we can have this discussion and have this debate. The very first question that was asked was growth -- distribution growth or leverage or buybacks or deploying in projects? So I think it's a good position to begin. I'm hoping 2020 shows stability of earnings. And then, therefore, we move into this, okay, what do we do with the excess cash that we have and think about what's the best opportunity and what's going to create the most value. And that's kind of the way we look at it. And those are the meetings that we're having internally, and we talk about all the opportunities. And then we're trying to make it as dynamic as possible so that it's a continuing discussion that will occur throughout this year. And obviously, you get to a point where you want to make a decision, and you feel good about that. And if it's a multiyear capital project, we're going to feel good about it if we decide at the time, that's the right thing to do. And if it's short-term where we buy back units, we'll feel good about that from that perspective as well. So very dynamic process. A lot of thought that goes into it. I know everybody always asks the word return, what's the return threshold, but there's a lot of other factors that go into it as well. Obviously, return being one of the most important, if not the most important, but there's other parameters that we also discuss.\nUjjwal Pradhan: Got it. That's helpful, Mike. And my next question is to Pam. Could you clarify the NGL price sensitivity you mentioned earlier after the Javelina plant sale versus the $23 million for every $0.05 change impact that you have pointed out in the past?\nPam Beall: When you say clarify. In the past -- yes, we had given a rule of thumb or metric sensitivity of $23 million in the past. So it's a small tweak. It's not a material tweak. And there are a number of factors that influence that, but a lot of it has to do with volumes that are related to product sales that we have as part of our percent of proceeds contracts of which Javelina is one. So it's not just specifically related to Javelina, but it is a small tweak. But just wanted to provide you that updated guidance as we've provided it in the past.\nOperator: I'd like to turn the call back over to Kristina Kazarian for closing remarks.\nKristina Kazarian: Sounds great. Thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in MPLX. Should you have additional questions or would you like clarification on any of the topics discussed this morning, members of our team will be available to take your calls. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Pam Beall",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike, and good morning. As Mike mentioned earlier, MPLX delivered fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 billion and full year EBITDA of $5.2 billion. Distributable cash flow of $1.2 billion for the fourth quarter provided strong distribution coverage of 1.58 times, and we ended the year with leverage of 3.9 times. Our quick response to the challenging demand environment allowed us to increase our EBITDA by $100 million for the year. In the L&S segment, the strength of our underlying contracts and operating expense reductions more than offset the impact of lower volumes in the system. The gathering and processing segment also benefited from lower operating expenses, partially offsetting the impact of production curtailment in certain basins. I'm pleased to report that our 2020 results represent the first full year that MPLX has funded both our total capital investments and distributions to our unitholders with $266 million of excess cash flow after these activities. During the fourth quarter, we began to implement the Board-authorized unit repurchase program of up to $1 billion of our outstanding publicly traded common units. Looking forward, we expect our assets to continue to provide strong cash flow. Our capital allocation will continue to focus on fully funding our capital needs and distributions with cash generated from operations, while maintaining an investment-grade credit profile and returning excess cash to our unitholders. We expect to maintain the distribution and the pace of unit repurchases will depend on several factors, including: excess cash available, alternative investment opportunities and the business and market conditions. During 2021, we expect to invest approximately $800 million in growth capital and $165 million in maintenance capital. Slide 7 outlines the fourth quarter logistics and storage segment highlights. Volumes across our pipeline and terminal systems were lower compared with the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily driven by lower utilization at MPC's refineries. However, we continue to execute on our operating expense reductions to offset lower throughput. During the quarter, we continued to progress our strategy of creating an integrated crude oil and natural gas logistics systems from the Permian to the Gulf Coast. We expect the Wink to Webster crude oil pipeline in which MPLX has an equity interest to continue to place assets in service throughout 2021. In line with our focus on projects with minimal return risk, the pipeline system has 100% of its contractable capacity committed with minimum volume commitments. As we progress construction activities for the Whistler natural gas pipeline, we expect a start-up of the project in the second half of 2021. And finally, we continue to work towards an in-service date in the second half of the year for the NGL takeaway solution. As a reminder, this project is an optimized approach compared to the BANGL project as it was originally contemplated, largely utilizing existing infrastructure with minimal capital investment by MPLX. Outside of the Permian, we ran a successful open season for the expansion of the Salt Lake City core pipeline, with the 11,000 barrel per day expansion expected to be completed later this year. While we're on the topic of our logistics and storage segment, I wanted to take a moment to discuss the renewal of the marine contract between MPC and MPLX. This contract was renewed in January for an additional five-year term for the same capacity of boats and barges. As mentioned on the prior call, the renewal terms include a reset of the contracted equipment rates to current market levels. Based on changes in market rates, we're estimating a reduction to our marine services EBITDA, it will be less than $100 million or less than 2% of our full year 2020 EBITDA. We continue to hear concerns from the investor community regarding MPLX's exposure to contract renewals with our sponsor, MPC, and we'd like to take this opportunity to highlight that many of these assets that MPLX operates are fit-for-purpose to MPC's business and in most cases, the optimal solution MPC has for its logistics needs. We fully expect MPC to renew contracts with MPLX as they mature over time. We do not expect MPC to commit incremental capital to duplicate systems that already exist. Now moving on to our gathering and processing business. Slide 8 provides fourth quarter segment highlights. For the fourth quarter of 2020, gathered volumes were lower than the same period last year across our footprint due to lower dry gas volumes in the Utica, a planned outage in the Marcellus and production curtailments in other regions. Processed and fractionated volumes were also lower than the same period last year, except for the Marcellus, where processed volumes increased 8% and fractionated volumes increased 10%. During the fourth quarter, in the Marcellus, our processing units continued to run at high utilization rates, setting a record 6 Bcf per day in the region. We also achieved record fractionation volumes of 300,000 barrels per day at our Hopedale facility following the third quarter completion of an 80,000 barrel per day expansion. In the past, we provided an estimate of the impact to earnings of a $0.05 move in NGL prices. With the planned sale of the Javelina refinery off gas processing facility in Corpus Christi, we do expect a reduction in our direct commodity price exposure. For 2021, we would expect a $0.05 change in the weighted average NGL basket to have an approximate $20 million annual impact to EBITDA. While higher NGL prices will have less of a direct impact to MPLX earnings, rising NGL prices will have an indirect benefit, providing an incentive for producers to shift drilling to rich gas areas where our processing and fractionation infrastructure can be more highly utilized. Looking forward to 2021, in the Northeast, we have opportunities to optimize our plant utilization as we expect producers to pursue modest production growth while maintaining free cash flow. We also expect to bring the Smithburg 1 facility online around the middle of the year, and we expect to see incremental ethane recovery with improving economics. On Slide 9, moving to our fourth quarter financial highlights. Total L&S segment adjusted EBITDA was $884 million and the gathering and processing segment contributed $471 million in adjusted EBITDA. For the quarter, we generated approximately $1.2 billion of distributable cash flow and returned $742 million to our unitholders through distributions. We also repurchased $33 million of publicly held units during the quarter. The bridge on Slide 10 shows the change in adjusted EBITDA from the fourth quarter of 2019 to the fourth quarter of 2020. The logistics and storage segment increased $31 million year-over-year, primarily driven by lower operating expenses and partially offset by decreased pipeline and terminal volumes due to lower utilization at MPC refineries. The gathering and processing segment increased $5 million, benefiting from lower operating expenses and higher processed and fractionated volumes in Marcellus. Slide 9 provides a summary of key financial highlights and select balance sheet information. We ended the year with a leverage ratio of 3.9 time, approximately $3.3 billion available on our bank revolver and $1.5 billion available on our intercompany facility with MPC. We intend to maintain our investment-grade credit profile, and we expect our leverage to be approximately 4 times in 2021 and to decline over time with modest growth in EBITDA. As I mentioned earlier, for the first time in the company's history, we generated excess cash after capital and investments -- capital investments and distributions for the full year of 2020. With the progress made in 2020, our continued capital and expense discipline and growth in EBITDA, we expect to continue generating excess cash flow for 2021, providing financial flexibility to pursue value-creating opportunities for our unitholders, including unit repurchases. And now let me turn the call back to Kristina. Yes, Shneur, it's Pam. I'll take that one. So in 2019, our maintenance capital was actually about $200 million, and it dropped significantly last year. So a number of factors, certainly, influencing that. One is what was happening just across the space and in terms of a lower utilization of our refining assets and refining logistics assets at MPC's refineries. So that was having a significant influence on the downward pressure. And certainly, with a lot of uncertainties driving some of those costs lower, that made sense. So there is a nice increase that you see in 2021 of $165 million. A couple of things to keep in mind, MPC and MPLX both expense out a lot of maintenance. So when you look at our maintenance activities, we, for example, expense API 653 tank work. A lot of companies would capitalize that work. And so we are maintaining our assets in a fashion that will allow us to continue to have reliability and integrity. So it's -- don't just look at the maintenance capital and draw conclusions about how well we're maintaining our assets from that metric alone. And then just something else to keep in mind, as part of the ANDX inherited contracts with ANDV, there was a provision where we would be reimbursed for some of the maintenance activity. And so that also is causing the maintenance capital number to be a little bit lower. And over time, as those contracts roll off and those -- that tank work is complete, the maintenance capital related to that activity would certainly increase. The other thing we've mentioned from time to time is the fact that in the gathering and processing segment of the business, those assets are really new. We've spent a tremendous amount of capital, particularly in the Marcellus and Utica. And so the expected maintenance for those assets have been quite low. So it will obviously change over time. It will also be influenced by the assets that are in our portfolio, as MPC continues to evaluate its portfolio as part of its optimization. And so I can't say that this is a fixed run rate, Shneur. I think we're just going to have to give you some guidance as we move forward. Yes. It's Pam, and I'll take that, Jeremy. So yes, we said it's less than $100 million, which is less than 2% of the 2020 annual EBITDA. And we have a lot of contracts between MPC and MPLX. The largest contracts that have the most EBITDA related to MPLX came about in 2018. So they have a long life. And those were refining logistics and fuels distribution. And keep in mind, the pipeline contracts that we have are all FERC-based rates. So we -- yes, there will be contracts that come up for renewal. There are no other contracts that I'm aware of that actually have this kind of an automatic rate reset provision baked into the agreement. It's just the way it was structured. It was about a five- to six-year period of time that it was in place and then it just is an automatic update on market rates. And so at sometimes, that's going to be a benefit to MPC. Sometimes that will be a benefit to MPLX as market conditions do change over time. There are rate escalation or fee escalation provisions in those agreements as well. So just keep that kind of thing in mind. But -- and as I said in the prepared remarks, we fully expect that MPC is going to renew these contracts with MPLX. In many cases, it has no other ingress or egress to its facility. So we fully expect these contracts are going to be renewed, and MPC owns a majority interest of MPLX and gets a lot of cash back from MPLX. So we think it's in the mutual interest of MPC and MPLX to continue the positive relationship that we have enjoyed. Yes. Happy to take that one, John. The Javelina assets, it's a good asset. We expect to close on it here in the fourth -- in the first quarter of 2021. It just didn't really fit our long-term plan. It's really a fractionation facility that processes refinery off gas. It's on the smaller side in terms of EBITDA contribution. So it's not something that's going to make a significant impact on our outlook for 2021. And then in terms of our expectations for 2021, I think maybe one way to think about this is, if you go back and just analyze kind of our weakest quarter which was the second quarter and then analyze our strongest quarter, which was the third quarter, you're going to come up with something in the range of $4.9 billion to $5.3 billion of EBITDA, okay? And we're going to continue to pursue cost reductions. So think about some cost reductions in 2021 offsetting some of the headwinds associated with the marine contract rate resetting. So I hope that's helpful to keep in mind. And then where 2021 shakes out is really going to depend in large part with the recovery, the recovery of volumes for the MPC system as well as the recovery for producers and their production volumes. Yes. I think it's premature to talk about where it might move to. Certainly, there could be opportunity for that CapEx to come in lower. And again, I think it's really something that's going to be tied to what we're seeing in the producer community, both on the crude gathering side as well as the gas side of the business. So I think it'd be prudent for us to wait and see how that unfolds throughout the year. So -- but yes, we'll continue to look at all those opportunities where maybe we don't have to spend as much capital as we move through the year. I would say about roughly half of the expected CapEx is going to be on the G&P side of the business and roughly half is going to be on the L&S side of the business. And we do have some completion of some pipeline expansions. Certainly, you mentioned the Whistler project's going to take a little bit more capital in 2021 as we wrap up there. But largely on the G&P side, it's going to be dependent on the macroeconomic outlook and what producers do with the drill bits. No. It's Pam. Let me take that one. So there clearly are opportunities for us to have higher utilization of some of the plants that we have in the Northeast. And some of the pipeline work that we've undertaken over the past couple of years is going to allow us to shift volumes. So perhaps there are some opportunities to where we might have really high utilization, and we need to shift some volumes to a different location. But that's what we mean about the opportunity to optimize the assets. It's not that we're looking to actually -- to the extent there was an opportunity, it made sense, we'd certainly consider it, but we're not looking necessarily at shuttering any plants, but being able to balance volumes across the system with the investments that we've made. And then just the best return that we can get on our capital is filling up the plants that we already have in place without allocating capital to new additions. So that's the thought there. Yes. If it were, it would probably be around debottlenecking some of the pipelines we already have to make sure that we get the volume into those systems that MPC wants to move eastward. Yes. It's Pam. The overwhelming majority of our pipelines, whether we're talking crude or products, are FERC-based rates. So that's really what dictates the fees that we'll receive on those pipelines. And that fluctuates over time with the FERC index changes and PPI. No. I don't -- yes. So it's really going to be driven by the market rates and FERC rates that are in place today. Yes, they do. They fluctuate each year. Well, I think as you look -- as you highlighted, we were able to mitigate some of the impact on the way down. We will see some improvements on the way back up. I think it's just really difficult to predict how much that might be and when. I think it's going to depend on which areas of the geography MPC sees the most robust recovery. So again, we're just -- we have a cautious optimism for 2021, and we'll just have to wait to see how it plays out. I think the one wildcard that Mike's hinting at as well is just this new variant on the virus. We really don't know what kind of impact that's going to have. And so just while we think that the whole country is starting to turn the corner on this situation, this is a new kind of a wildcard that's been presented. So we'll have to see how that plays out. No, I wouldn't suggest that there is some meaningful upside related to that. When you say clarify. In the past -- yes, we had given a rule of thumb or metric sensitivity of $23 million in the past. So it's a small tweak. It's not a material tweak. And there are a number of factors that influence that, but a lot of it has to do with volumes that are related to product sales that we have as part of our percent of proceeds contracts of which Javelina is one. So it's not just specifically related to Javelina, but it is a small tweak. But just wanted to provide you that updated guidance as we've provided it in the past."

            "name": "Gregory Floerke",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Mike. Christine, Greg Floerke here. We currently recover the large majority of the ethane in the basin. We have mentioned, I think, previously that we have a purity ethane line that connects all of our processing plants. We actually recover ethane at the processing plants and not centralize at a fractionator. So we have a lot of flexibility to recover and then transport on our own line to all the takeaway points currently to the Gulf Coast, Canada and the East Coast on the various pipelines. As our producer customers continue to sell ethane into those markets and have commitments into those markets and on other pipelines, we believe that likely continues post start-up of the Shell Monaca cracker, which would require then incremental recovery of ethane that's currently being rejected into a residue gas stream at all of these processing plant locations. So therefore, we'd expect to see incremental requirement to recover -- and there's plenty of ethane still in being rejected, that's still recoverable. But we would expect to see incremental recovery at our plants. We do have capacity in place without adding to recover on behalf of our producer customers. And we do -- that is incremental. It's on a fee basis in terms of the processing and the pipeline to the delivery points."

            "name": "Mike Hennigan",
            "content": "Thanks, Kristina. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call. Earlier today, we've reported adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2020 of $1.4 billion and full year 2020 adjusted EBITDA of $5.2 billion. Considering the unprecedented challenges our industry faced throughout 2020, we're proud of the way our performance highlighted the resiliency and stability of our underlying business. Despite the difficult macro environment, we were able to grow total BcF for 2020 compared to 2019. Additionally, our results demonstrate our commitment to executing on the priorities we laid out for the year. We made strides on optimizing our portfolio, announcing the sale of the Javelina facility in Corpus Christi, Texas. While not large in size, this is an example of the continued effort we're making to focus on the assets that have long-term strategic value to the company. We reduced our capital spend in 2020 by over $700 million from the target. We also took necessary steps to address our long-term cost structure achieving our target to reduce forecasted operating expenses by over $200 million. These expense reductions were key to offset earnings headwinds, particularly in the L&S segment, and we believe they will be enduring long term. Our cost reduction efforts are particularly meaningful when you consider we have not compromised our commitment to safely operating our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees and support the communities in which we operate. As a result of these concerted efforts, we were able to generate excess cash flow for the full year 2020 after self-funding our distribution and capital program. This inflection occurred earlier than our original target of 2021 and gave us the financial flexibility to begin repurchasing units in the fourth quarter of 2020. Today, we also announced a growth capital outlook for 2021 of $800 million, focused on investments in projects expected to deliver our highest returns. This outlook represents a continued reduction in capital spend as we work to high grade our portfolio of investments, focusing on projects that achieve robust returns, irrespective of the market environment. We remain committed to strict capital and expense discipline, and that discipline, combined with EBITDA growing over time, supports our continuing goal of generating excess cash for 2021 and providing the opportunity to return incremental capital to our unitholders. Shifting to Slide 5, I'd like to provide some comments on our responsibilities around sustainability and corporate leadership. Last quarter, we discussed the publication of our 2020 climate perspectives report, highlighting opportunities and strategic planning work the company is engaged in related to climate scenarios. We also discussed our goal to reduce methane emission intensity in the G&P business. It's important that we set objectives for the organization that drive our continuous improvement on ESG. Our focus on leading in sustainable energy positions us to deliver strong results in this space from lowering the carbon intensity of our operations and products to improving energy efficiency and conserving natural resources while using innovative technologies to do it. We believe the goals we are setting and our transparent disclosures on how we plan to achieve them, position us well for the future. I'm proud to see some of our team's efforts in the ESG arena recognized in 2020 with API's Distinguished Pipeline Safety Award as well as 2 EPA Energy Star Challenge awards for energy efficiency. These accomplishments highlight that at all levels of our business, our team members are proactive and engaged in ensuring the safety of those in the communities where we have the privilege to operate and protecting the environment we all share. Now let me turn the call over to Pam to discuss our operational and financial results. Shneur, it's Mike. I'll give you some color on that. First off, I would try to remind everybody that it's not a set it and just let it go on forever. We're going to continue to look at where we stand on each of the parameters and then make decisions more dynamically rather than not. So where we've been, Shneur, is we've been comfortable with our leverage and a lot of people have asked us, how do you feel about that. And we've been running around 4 times for some pretty consistent amount of time. So we're comfortable there and the way we look at it right at the moment is -- and we started this just towards the end of the fourth quarter. But we look at where we're trading, where the equity is trading. And right now, we have a DPU yield of around 12%. We got a DCF yield of around 17%. And if the equity is going to trade at that kind of level then our priority in the short-term would obviously be to buy back units. We'd love to be able to do all of the above. But as you mentioned, you're going to have to prioritize as things go on and conditions change, et cetera. Love to be able to have a program that hits the highest priority at the time. But we're going to kind of look at it quarter-to-quarter or more dynamically and decide what we think is the best use. And right now, trading at 17% DCF, that's probably the highest priority we have right now because leverage is in a good spot, the market is not rewarding distribution growth right at the moment. But I think some of these things can change over time. I think the key for us, and I'm hoping the market is realizing that our goal was to get to free cash flow to put ourselves in this position. We got there a little earlier than we were expecting, which was good. And at the end of the day, I'm hoping that 2020 has shown the market that we have pretty consistent earnings. There's been a lot of questions around the stability and the consistency of the earnings. So hopefully, the year, as everybody used the word unprecedented, has played itself out and continues. As everyone knows, we're not through with the pandemic yet, but once we establish post the pandemic, I think we're going to be in a mode where we're going to continue to grow earnings. Like we've said over time, we are going to continue to look at cost-cutting that we made as a major effort this year. And then to your question is, we'll be dynamic and report out each time what we think is the best use of that return of capital. I would give one last comment that our distribution is still a pretty healthy return of capital as is, and we've stated many times that we support that distribution. We think it's very solid. We think this past year has shown that, and then we're going to continue to grow DCF and grow our earnings and see what the best use is. I'm hoping that helps you. Jeremy, it's Mike. Thanks for that question. One of the things that we've talked constantly about is the G&P space and what our expectation is because a lot of people have questioned overall. And I'll give you -- big picture is we still feel really good about the business. We think it's going to grow earnings over time. Our -- as you pointed out, our Marcellus and Permian areas are continuing to grow, although we have seen some declines in some of the other areas. We've been pretty open about -- we're in eight basins today, and we're going to look to optimize that at some point, but the market hasn't been willing to give us the right offer for that -- those other assets that we think maybe belong in someone else's portfolio. So we're happy to keep them to keep generating cash and proceed in the mode that we've been in. But I think the big takeaway overall is the expectation in natural gas, in our opinion, has started to move back towards a positive dynamic. There's been a lot of discussion going into the pandemic about where gas was and being overwhelmed by associated gas, et cetera, et cetera. We had not been believers in that, and a lot of people were calling us on our view there. But at the same time, I think it's kind of played out a little bit as we were expecting, which is natural gas is going to be an important dynamic going forward. The earnings growth, we think will be good, but not double digit. We've said that many times as well. We're not expecting the robust growth that was there before. So producers in that space, similar to the oil space, are looking at their portfolios and trying to manage their balance sheets and their cash flow, et cetera. So I think this slow growth model is starting to play itself out a little more or becoming a little more obvious, I think, to investors than was in the past. So our conversations continue along the same activity that we've been seeing. Some areas, not going to get a lot of capital deployment. Other areas is kind of core to some of the bigger players. We've mentioned many times that our core areas are the Marcellus and the Permian. We're seeing growth in those areas. To your point, we're seeing a little bit of decline in the other areas. But as long as we're still kicking off cash in those areas, we still believe it's a contribution to the enterprise. Mike, the other thing I just want to add kind of goes to the question Shneur asked in the beginning is, our whole deployment of capital and return of capital is going to try and be as dynamic as we can be, as we go throughout the year. So in a big picture, we say these are about the guidelines that we're giving you. But as we go out through the year before we pull the trigger on any capital spend, where we still have the choice, something that's not already in progress, we're going to continue to look at what's the best use. And like I said, for our equity trades where it is, we'll deploy more capital towards it because in our opinion, it's been undervalued. But we'll compare that versus the choices we have on capital deployment as well as the long-term strategy in supporting the customer base that we have. So hopefully, it will be a little bit more dynamic and a little bit more thoughtful as far as long term. And I really just want to emphasize, we're going to try and use that word strict capital discipline and make that part of our mantra and strict cost discipline and make that part of our mantra. That's some of the things that we're trying to put a little more emphasis on than we have in the past. Michael, it's Mike. So on those projects, if you recall, I'll give you a big picture, and then I'll answer your question. We had stated a couple of years ago that we had significant capital deployment opportunities in three big projects: Whistler and Wink to Webster, two you're referencing. And then the third was BANGL. And the issue that we had in front of us is that Whistler and Wink to Webster, we got MVC protection. And then to your direct question, those contracts vary but put them in the 10-plus year environment. So very long-term. We'll use the rounded number of 10 as a guidepost for you. But at the end of the day, we have long-term commitments. We have MVC protection on it. And that's why we went forward with those two projects. That's why Wink to Webster and Whistler became part of our mantra. On BANGL, although we like the project, and although it was something in our mind, it could have been a long-term winner for us. We did not get MVC protection the way we would like to from the customer base. It was not something that they were willing to commit to, and we understand the reasoning. But as a result of that, without that long-term commitment and without that long-term MVC, our commercial team looked at it and kind of rethought what's the best way to do it and not deploy capital or put that capital at risk in the original intent, and we changed that quite a bit down to a much lower capital solution using some existing pipe and partnering with some other players, et cetera, and became a win where we were able to satisfy the customers' needs but not put ourselves at risk on the deployment of capital that wasn't backed as strongly as we would like. So Wink to Webster and Whistler ended up where we wanted it to be, long-term contracts to your question, MVC protected, and we think they're going to be terrific projects. We think the modified or smaller BANGL project is also good. It's just not what the original intent was because of the very point. We did not get that long-term MVC-protected portion of the contract. Does that make sense to you? Christine, it's Mike. I'm going to let Greg make a comment on that. But before I turn it to him, I'll just say, one of the things in general in the Northeast is continuing, like I mentioned earlier, growth area. We still are very bullish in the Marcellus. As Pam was trying to answer Michael's question, there's a little bit lower utilization in the Utica side of the Northeast. So that we're trying to look to ways that we can optimize that capital that's already been deployed. Overall, we still are pretty bullish in the area. When you think longer term, where do we think the natural gas business is going. We still think the 2 core areas that we're in are the important areas to be in for natural gas overall. So from a long-term perspective, we still feel real good about it. The dynamics will change up there, and I'll let Greg give you some comments on the Shell situation. But whether it's shell or some of these other pipelines that are happening, over time, those things will work themselves out because in our view, it's still a very cost-effective area for production and natural gas. Obviously, I always say it doesn't beat associated because that's a different economic. But for on-purpose gas, we're still believers that the area that we're in is a good area. And as things continue to develop, we think we'll find opportunities to grow earnings there. Greg, do you want to add anything on the Shell question? Christine, it's Mike. I don't know that there's going to be a capital opportunity for MPLX. There's some existing assets, as I know you're aware of, a couple of other competitive assets that are out there that would fill MPC's need because they are existing. There's opportunities for us in regard to tankage and things like that. But I don't think you're going to see any large capital expenditure from us to support that need. We'll see if things change or if the dynamic around the market supply and demand changes. But for right now, I would tell you that I don't see us putting a lot of capital into that opportunity. Tristan, it's Mike. One of the things that I've tried to tell people is, I don't spend a lot of time trying to call exactly where the market is. And I spend more time trying to think of the banks of the river. So what if it turns out to be a poor year as far as recovery relative to the pandemic? What if it does turn out to be more robust, like you're referencing? So to me, the banks of the river are still pretty wide. Do we anticipate there could be a positive upside as a result of getting past the pandemic and vaccines working their way through and an earlier recovery? So I'd say that the bull case is we get a recovery that's robust and quick. And then the bear case is, things take a little longer than people expect because the pandemic lingers and the post pandemic activity doesn't recover quite as much. So I'm hopeful that it is the first part. As Pam said, we're cautiously optimistic. We can see some of the parameters that would have people feeling that way. And obviously, we hope that's the case. But our model, though, is to spend more time saying what if it's not the case and how do we see this playing out in case it turns out to be longer, et cetera? So I'm the first to admit that I don't know exactly when it's going to recover. I hope it is more robust than earlier than later. That's obviously our hope. That's why Pam uses the word cautious optimism. At the same time, probably, our thinking is, let's prepare for the worst and just be prepared in case this thing takes longer. I mean, some of the actual facts, as people know, is as we got into the back end of December, the pandemic was hitting harder and the cases were spiking up, and we kind of saw a second wave of restrictions. And hopefully, those are going to start to come off. And I know the new administration has a priority to get vaccination into the people's arms as quickly as possible. So there's momentum in the positive side, but -- and there's momentum that cases seem to be coming down and hopefully restrictions will be coming off, but I think it's hard to tell as to when it will actually occur. And so we're just going to prepare for both scenarios, the bull scenario, the bear scenario and look at our cases and see what we think would play out in both. That's the way we kind of approach it. I hope that helps you? It's more about capital deployment and can we optimize the capital that has already been spent. So if you look at our data, we have some areas where the utilization is very high in some areas where there's opportunity. So what Pam was referring to is our commercial and operating teams are looking at, is there a way to take advantage of that unused capacity as growth occurs in an area where there is not excess capacity? That's the idea. Yes, Ujjwal, it's a good question, but it's a tough one to answer. Depending on the project, aside from just the return which you're mentioning, there's a lot of factors that come into place. Like Michael asked earlier, do you have MVC protection? How long is the project? What length of term deals that you have? So there's a lot of things that come into play. Overall, what we've been trying to tell people is, we've moved the capital down for two reasons. One is we want to set the bar higher than we have in the past as far as that capital discipline. That's one thing that's driving this. And the second is where the equity is trading. And when we're trading at a 17-ish yield on DCF, that is something that you can get very quickly with no time lag, no capital lag to execute a project, no permitting risk, no execution risk, et cetera, et cetera. So you take that for what it is at that yield and then you compare it to some of the projects that may even be better than that longer term and maybe more strategic for us. But that's kind of the process that we kind of go about looking at it. If we were trading at a much more valued equity in our mind, that dynamic would be a little bit different. But at least in the short term, while we continue to trade at these higher yields, makes us really look and I use the word disciplined on whether we want to invest the capital or not. And you know this as well as anybody. When you invest capital, you're putting money out for a couple of years before you get cash flows, et cetera, et cetera. So you weigh all that in compared to the environment that we're in now. I think the most important takeaway, though, is we've been trying to move ourselves into this excess cash flow position so that we can have this discussion and have this debate. The very first question that was asked was growth -- distribution growth or leverage or buybacks or deploying in projects? So I think it's a good position to begin. I'm hoping 2020 shows stability of earnings. And then, therefore, we move into this, okay, what do we do with the excess cash that we have and think about what's the best opportunity and what's going to create the most value. And that's kind of the way we look at it. And those are the meetings that we're having internally, and we talk about all the opportunities. And then we're trying to make it as dynamic as possible so that it's a continuing discussion that will occur throughout this year. And obviously, you get to a point where you want to make a decision, and you feel good about that. And if it's a multiyear capital project, we're going to feel good about it if we decide at the time, that's the right thing to do. And if it's short-term where we buy back units, we'll feel good about that from that perspective as well. So very dynamic process. A lot of thought that goes into it. I know everybody always asks the word return, what's the return threshold, but there's a lot of other factors that go into it as well. Obviously, return being one of the most important, if not the most important, but there's other parameters that we also discuss."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.\nKristina Kazarian: Good morning and welcome to the MPLX third quarter 2020 earnings webcast and conference call. The synchronized slides that accompany this call can be found on mplx.com under the Investors tab. On the call today are Mike Hennigan, President and CEO; Pam Beall, CFO; and other members of the management team. We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statements and non-GAAP disclaimer on Slide 2. It\u2019s a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the call and during the question-and-answer session that follows. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as our filings with the SEC. Now, I will turn over this call over to Mike Hennigan for opening remarks.\nMike Hennigan: Thanks Kristina. Good morning and thank you for joining our call. Earlier today we reported adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2020 of $1.3 billion, a slight increase versus our second quarter 2020 EBITDA. Our performance during the third quarter highlights the stability of our underlying business, the quality of our contracts and execution on our capital and operating expense reductions to help offset what we knew would be a challenging environment. With our EBITDA growing over time, and our continued emphasis on strict capital discipline, our leverage can naturally be reduced. To that end, we have obtained Board authorization for a unit repurchase program for the repurchase and retirement of up to $1 billion of the company's outstanding publicly traded limited partner common units. By getting Board approval, now this program will allow us to make repurchases of our common units at the appropriate time and provide us with an attractive opportunity to return value to our unit holders. Turning to slide four, a key part of our path to positive cash flows continued capital spending discipline. We continue to be on track to achieve our 2020 capital reduction of over $700 million, as we continue to focus on opportunities with the most attractive returns. Turning to slide five, I would take a moment to provide some comments on our responsibilities around sustainability and corporate leadership. As a result of our continued refinement of our ESG perspectives, I want to mention two additional and important initiatives the combined enterprise as established, incremental to the announcement earlier this year, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions intensity to 30% below 2014 levels by 2030. First, we've established a 2025 goal to reduce methane emissions intensity from our G&P business to 50% below 2016 levels. Second, we are focusing on conserving and managing use of water. To our efforts in this area, the combined enterprises reduced freshwater withdrawal intensity by over 10% since 2015, and expect to further reduce it by an additional 10% by 2030. Shifting to slide six, we recently published our 2020 perspectives on climate-related scenarios report. This is the fourth year the MPC enterprises published a TCFD compliant report, which highlights the opportunities and strategic planning work the company is engaged in related to climate scenarios. We also published our 2019 sustainability report in late July, which expands upon efforts in environmental, social and governance aspects of the business. With the publication of the 2019 sustainability report, we also published a Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, or SASB midstream supplement, highlighting the specific topics and metrics within our 2019 sustainability report as it pertains to SASBs industry-specific sustainability accounting standards. We look forward to continuing our ESG journey and our commitment to stakeholder engagement with our team of employees, business partners, customers and communities. We view sustainability as the fundamental process of shared value creation, and how we conduct our business enhances the performance we deliver. Now let me turn the call over to Pam to discuss our third quarter 2020 operational and financial results.\nPam Beall: Thanks, Mike. Turning to slide seven MPLX delivered third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion and distributable cash flow of $1.1 billion, which provided continued strong distribution coverage of 1.44 times. Our results for the quarter once again, highlight the resiliency of our underlying business, as well as execution of our forecasted $200 million of operating cost reductions to help offset a challenging demand environment, allowing us to continue to generate strong cash flow and adjusted EBITDA. For the quarter, we generated positive cash flow, after investments in the business and distributions to unitholders. We use this cash to reduce total debt outstanding from the end of the second quarter to the end of the third quarter, and we ended the third quarter with leverage of four times. During the quarter, we refinanced our 2021 debt maturities, at very attractive rate, along with some of our notes due in 2022, and 2024, that carried coupons of 6.25% or higher. Slide eight shows the third quarter Logistics & Storage business segment highlight. Volumes across our pipeline and terminal systems were lower compared with the third quarter of 2019, primarily driven by lower refinery utilization at MPCs refineries. However, we did see sequential increase in both pipeline and terminal throughputs versus the second quarter of 2020. During the third quarter, the Wink to Webster Permian crude oil pipeline project achieved mechanical completion on the main segment connecting the Permian Basin to Houston, Texas. The main segment of the pipeline system was commissioned with Permian crude oil from Midland to Houston in October, and service is expected to be available to shippers in the fourth quarter. We have a 15% equity ownership interest of this joint venture. The pipeline system has 100% of its contractible capacity committed with minimum volume commitments. Additional segments offering shippers further service are expected to be placed in service throughout 2021. The Whistler natural gas pipeline project also continued to progress. The two bcf per day capacity project is more than 90% committed with minimum volume commitments. We continue to expect to start up of the project in the second half of 2021. As we noted last quarter, MPLX WhiteWater Midstream and West Texas gas formed a joint venture to provide NGL takeaway capacity from MPLX and WTG's gas processing plants in the Permian to Sweeney, Texas. This optimized approach will largely use existing infrastructure with limited initial construction. Commercial NGL transportation service to Sweeney, Texas is expected to commence in the second half of 2021. Slide nine provides third quarter Gathering and Processing business segment highlight. For the third quarter of 2020, Gathered and Processed volumes were lower than the same period last year across most of our footprints. With a few exceptions, including West Texas and the Marcellus where Gathered volumes increased 3% and Processed volumes increased 8% respectively. Processed volumes in the Marcellus reached a record 5.7 billion cubic feet per day. Total Fractionated volumes averaged 567,000 barrels per day, representing a 4% increase over the third quarter of 2019. Record Fractionated volumes were primarily driven by a 10% increase in the Marcellus where volumes increased with the Hopedale 5 fractionator, which came online during the third quarter. Despite the pressure on commodity prices, as global demand remains significantly below historical levels, we remain optimistic in the outlook for both natural gas and NGL demand and price recovery. The recent recovery in futures prices is beneficial for our natural gas and NGL producer customers, as they can take advantage of hedging opportunities and realize a positive impact on operating results, as well as their borrowing base redetermination. We expect producers will continue to apply the benefits of an improving price environment to their balance sheets to address near term debt maturities and improve their financial flexibility. We\u2019re also encouraged by the consolidation that's occurring among our producers, which should result in counterparties with a stronger financial profile. Moving to our financial highlights on slide 10, adjusted EBITDA was $1.3 billion for the third quarter of 2020. The Logistics and Storage segment adjusted EBITDA was $893 million, while the Gathering and Processing segment contributed $442 million in adjusted EBITDA. For the quarter, we generated approximately $1.1 billion of distributable cash flow and we'll return for the quarter $750 million to our unitholders. This provided distribution coverage of 1.44 times. The bridge on slide 11 shows the change in adjusted EBITDA from the third quarter of 2019 to the third quarter of 2020. The Logistics and Storage segment increased $44 million year-over-year, primarily driven by lower costs, lower operating expenses, minimum volume commitments, and the completion of the Mt. Airy terminal and Utica butane expansion projects, partially offset by decreased pipeline and terminalling volumes due to lower utilization at MPC's refineries. The Gathering and Processing segment increased $18 million, primarily driven by higher volumes due to additional plants coming online, partially offset by production curtailments and shut-ins. Slide 12 provides a summary of key financial highlights and select balance sheet information. We ended the quarter with a leverage ratio of four times and approximately $3.4 billion available on our bank revolver, and $1.5 billion available on our intercompany facility with MPC. During and shortly after the quarter, we undertook several financing activities to continue to strengthen our balance sheet, by lowering our interest costs and extending maturities. These steps were outlined in the earnings release. As I mentioned earlier, for the third quarter, we generated positive cash flow after investments and distributions. With progress made in 2020, our continued capital discipline and expected growth in EBITDA, we continue to target our goal of achieving positive free cash flow after capital investments and distributions for 2021. As we reach this inflection point, we believe that we will have the financial flexibility to repurchase units or reduce debt. We will continue to prioritize an investment grade credit profile and we expect our leverage to improve over time with modest growth in EBITDA. We will be looking to implement the board authorized unit repurchase program of up to $1 billion of our outstanding publicly traded common units. The timing, price and actual number of common units repurchased, if any, will depend on several factors, including our expected excess cash available, alternative investment opportunities in the market and business conditions. And now let me turn the call back over to Kristina.\nKristina Kazarian: Thanks, Pam. As we open the call for questions, we ask that you limit yourself to one question, plus a follow up. We may re-prompt for additional question if time permits. With that, we will now open the call to questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.\nMike Hennigan: Good morning, Jeremy.\nPam Beall: Good morning, Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: Thanks. Just wanted to start off on how you're going to evaluate the balance between buybacks versus reducing leverage in 2021. And just thinking, is there a specific leverage bogey we should be thinking about here before you would start buying back units? And just also in the past, you've talked about reducing the number of geographical areas where you operate, you know, through divestitures or JVs, if you rationalizing and could that factor into the equation here as well?\nMike Hennigan: Jeremy, this is Mike, I'll start off by saying, first off, business conditions are going to continue to change and we're going to evaluate, it's going to be a dynamic program as time goes on. What we said in our prepared remarks is right at the moment with, you know, MPLX trading at a 15-plus yield, we see unit buybacks as the preferred option right at this point. Over the long term, with the base plan, if we stayed in that mode, we expect our leverage to naturally decline as EBITDA continues to increase, because our base plan has - you know, earnings continue to increase. And if we keep debt flat, then we'll have a natural leverage reduction over time. But it is something that we're going to make quarterly calls or real-time calls as time progresses. Our main emphasis was, and we said this for quite some time now was to get into a position where we would have free cash flow after distributions and after capital. We're achieving that as we come to the end of 2020 here. And our expectation was for that to occur in \u201821. So we're a little earlier than we expected. That's why we went out for the authorization with our Board, and then we're just going to continue to evaluate the program as time goes on, and continue to be thoughtful as to what's the best way to deploy it.\nJeremy Tonet: That's very helpful. Thank you. And I want to pivot over to Wink to Webster here and just trying to better understand the ramp there with the first leg online and how we should think about those cash flows, I guess, increasing this year and into next year?\nMike Hennigan: Jeremy on Wink to Webster one of the things that all the partners have done is looked at how can we optimize the capital spending. So portions of the project will come on in 2021. But as we said, in our early remarks, the main segment from Midland to Houston completed early, so we're going to start that up early. And then as \u201821 progresses, as we optimize the capital, we look at where the different segments are, you know, throughout 21, we\u2019ll give more of an update as to where that's going to play itself out. But it's part of the optimization process, instead of waiting for the whole time there was a piece of the project it could start up sooner.\nPam Beall: Jeremy, its Pam. I thought I would just add on to Mike's comment about the unit repurchase. And you asked whether asset optimization would have a factor, would play a role in that. And I just want to highlight, we're not a distressed seller. And so we'll be patient and prudent with asset monetization. But clearly to the extent that we are successful, and we hope with an improving price environment that we'll be successful in optimizing some of the basins, we would absolutely deploy proceeds first to debt reduction. And we certainly don't want to be in a, what we call, a dilutive deleveraging. So certainly would look at using some proceeds to the extent that they're available for unit to repurchase as well. So - and of course, that's all predicated on where we stand with respect to leverage in our investment grade credit profile that we want to prioritize, as we evaluate all these opportunities to allocate our capital to move forward.\nJeremy Tonet: That's very helpful. Thanks. If I could just sneak one more in, just wondering if you had any other thoughts you could share with regard to the trajectory of demand recovery across your systems?\nPam Beall: Yeah, Jeremy. So as it relates to the largest segment of our business, the Logistics and Storage segment, MPC each quarter does provide some guidance on what it expects in terms of its refining throughput. And certainly, the volumes in the Logistics and Storage side of the business will really move with MPCs guidance. Currently, their guidance for the fourth quarter is slightly lower than it was for the third. So keep that in mind. But that's certainly what we would expect as well. And then as it relates to the Gathering and Processing side of the business, it's been certainly very challenging for the producer customers really, across all of our geographies. We've been pleased to see some of the reports from producers have been coming out. So we'd encourage you to look at some of those - that guidance as well. But an improving price environment and backdrop we think will be very supportive for the Gathering and Processing segment. We are running at very high volumes in our Marcellus area. So we have some capacity that we could certainly fill up in the Utica. And we have a Smithburg 1 ready when the appropriate time to take gas, but that Sherwood complex is running quite full. So we're optimistic about how our producers will be able to benefit from an overall improving natural gas and NGL price environment.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you. I'll get back in the queue.\nMike Hennigan: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Your line is open.\nShneur Gershuni: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Maybe to start off and just go back to that buyback question a little bit. Just wondering if we can unpack it, given that you're at four times leverage already, and the balance sheet is where it's at. And then when we look at the fact that you expect to be free cash flow positive after distribution in \u201821. Just wondering if you could give us a sense around the - you know, does all that excess go towards buybacks? Is that kind of the instructions from the Board? Is there a percentage of it that goes towards buybacks? And as you execute on it, is it going to be in a pro rata format, public units versus MPC held units? Just wondering if you can give us a little bit more color around that.\nMike Hennigan: Shneur, its Mike. So yeah, like I was saying in my previous comments, we're going to evaluate it as business conditions dictate. What we're trying to disclose to everybody is right at this particular time, the way we see the market today is because we've been trading 15-plus yield, it's our desire to prioritize unit buybacks. There's not a set -to your question, there's not a set percentage or anything like that. It's us going to be making a determination as we go forward, what's the best use of those proceeds as we generate positive cash. In the environment that I'd say that we see today, I probably call it the base case today is we see buybacks as the preferred vehicle. And at the same time, we do see EBITDA growth in our business will naturally reduce our leverage. So as Pam has said many times, we're comfortable at four times. Over time, we think that will go down as our earnings grow. But if conditions dictate something different we\u2019ll adjust, but right now we see unit buybacks as the priority based on where the market is trading and the yield that we have on our units.\nShneur Gershuni: Okay, great. Maybe as a follow up question, I was just wondering if we can expand on the cost side a little bit, in terms of your cost efforts. How much of the reduction that's happening at MPC will translate across to MPLX above the original target that you set earlier this year? And has your CapEx outlook changed for 2021? I think it was a $1 billion last time we were updated.\nPam Beall: Yeah, Shneur. I'll take that. It's Pam. So as we mentioned earlier, we're on target to achieve the $200 million of operating expense reductions this year. And then we also announced the reduction in force that was across the enterprise MPC and MPLX. And so that portion of the cost reductions associated with the separation of part of our workforce will be reflected primarily as we move forward in 2021. So that's incremental to the 200 million that we identified earlier. And then the other questions that you asked about was CapEx. CapEx, we would \u2013 we\u2019ll provide an update when we report fourth quarter results. But as you know, we've worked hard to reduce our capital spend throughout the year. We're still targeting about $900 million, which is down about $750 million. And then we would expect for 2021, although we're not ready to provide some guidance, we would expect 2021 CapEx will be lower than 2020, as we've been wrapping up some larger projects here. So it'll be lower than this year. But we're just not ready quite yet to give you that guidance Shneur.\nShneur Gershuni: No, I really do appreciate it. And If I can sneak one last one, like Jeremy. You expect to be free cash flow positive after distributions next year, you've had really strong results this year. Is there any reason to think that it can't happen this year as well, too? Or is there some seasonality for Q2 [ph] we should be thinking about?\nPam Beall: Well, as I mentioned earlier, so there was a question about the outlook and on volumes across the system. And the Logistics and Storage side will follow, MPCs refining volume throughput. So \u2013 and MPC is forecasting slightly lower throughput for the fourth quarter, then the third. So keep that in mind. But to your point, we're turning the corner here on free cash flow, we were negative the first half, positive in the third. We would expect to be positive in the fourth. So we think we'll be right around a position to maybe be modestly positive for the fourth quarter of 2020 or for you know, for the full year.\nShneur Gershuni: Perfect.\nMike Hennigan: One of the things that I think we're trying to communicate is, we made a commitment to the market that we were going to drive ourselves towards free cash flow in \u201821. As you're pointing out, we're getting there a little bit early. I don't want to overplay this, though, from the standpoint as we - you know, we got authorization, we expect to continue to execute the plan. As you know, the size of the public float is not a very large number at this point. So I don't want to over-hype the discussion today. But just really reiterate that we're on track to do what we said we were going to do for a long period of time here. It's been multiple quarters in a row where we said, here's where we're headed. We're getting there, we're trying to show you that. As Pam just said, for the full year we\u2019ll be slightly positive, as we go into \u201821 it will get a little bit more in. And I think we're just trying to disclose that, we made a commitment we were executing on that. We're getting to a position where we will finally get to a point of that resulting in some buybacks. And that's why we got the authorization.\nShneur Gershuni: Perfect, really appreciate the color, guys. Take care and have a safe day.\nMike Hennigan: Thanks, Shneur. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Next we'll hear from John Mackay with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJohn Mackay: Hey, good morning. Thanks for the time. Just wanted to circle up again on CapEx for 2021. Appreciate the guidance that it should be lower year-over-year. But just wondering if you could talk a little bit about what might be the moving pieces there? How flexible is that number? And then really, how much does it depend on the pace of the overall recovery?\nMike Hennigan: So John, I'll start off and Pam can jump in. So we're not quite through our process internally or with the Board for \u201821. We're in the middle of that. So we're not ready to give any forward guidance in that area. I think what Pam was reiterating, is one of our, tenants of going forward is we're going to maintain very strict capital discipline. As we said, we set a goal that\u2019s become, you know, realized now, that we\u2019ll be free cash flow. We're committed to our distribution, as we've said many times, the market keeps asking us about that, but we're committed to that distribution. We're committed to managing capital in a way that we've raised our hurdle rate in such a way that we'll have strong discipline around it. We\u2019ll generate excess cash, as we generate that excess cash if the market continues to trade, where its been, then we think the right use of proceeds is to buy back units. That's kind of where we are at this point. As to your question on recovery. Again, my personal philosophy is, you know, worry about the things we can control. And not the ones that we don't control, but just to do scenario planning around that. I mean, I think there's a lot of good indications that the market is going back in a demand recovery mode, from where it was earlier. Hopefully, some of this rhetoric that we're all reading about, as far as vaccines coming online sooner rather than later is all good. And hopefully the overall US economy will rebound in \u201821. The way some people are projecting. So we're just going to have to watch, as I was saying, in the answers to the first question, business conditions will dictate how and which method and the pace at which we deploy things. But I think our main message here is, we're delivering on what we expected. We're reaching that point. We're staying disciplined on capital. We're staying committed to our distribution. And we've reached a point where we're starting to have excess funds.\nJohn Mackay: All right. That\u2019s helpful. I appreciate that. Just my quick follow up, and I'll keep it to two today. Just on CapEx in the quarter. So the year-to-date number looks like it's coming in a little tight on kind of what your full year 2020 CapEx guidance has been. So I was just wondering if you kind of frame up really spending for the rest of the year and kind of what's happening there. And, you know, maybe if you're expecting another return of capital from one of the JVs or something like that? Thank you,\nPam Beall: Yeah, John. So I think one of the things that is a little more difficult for us to forecast is change in accrual for capital expenditures, and capitalize interest. And so some of those, those items are adding to this a number that is a little higher than our targeted of $900 million. But if you back out, and we give the detail in the press release, so it's - I think it's the last schedule attached to the press release. If you back those things out, you'll see that we're still right on target for it, we will have considerably lower capital spending in the fourth quarter. And that is intentional. As I mentioned throughout the earlier part of the year, we were wrapping up some larger projects like the Mt. Airy terminal, the Utica butane expansion, and NGL pipeline in Appalachia. And we had some plants that were being wrapped up. So you know, we had \u2013 our capital spending was much greater in the first half of the year. That also that's part of the reason why we were negative cash flow in the first part of the year. But yeah, you'll see a very significant decline sequentially as we go into the fourth quarter and close out the year for growth CapEx.\nJohn Mackay: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Christine Cho with Barclays. Your line is open.\nChristine Cho: Thank you. If I could actually just maybe take your comments about how we should think about free cash flow generation through the remainder of the year. Can you give us an idea of how much of the quarter-over-quarter increase at L&S was due to cost savings and where you were relative to MVCs? And whether you expect to hit up against any MVC levels next quarter with the volume with the volume guidance that you're forecasting at MPC level?\nPam Beall: So MVCs can always be a part of the equation. We have a large number of our contracts and systems that are supported by MVCs. And even in periods of time, when we weren't in the kind of the demand shock that we've been experiencing, we've had some the benefit of protections from minimum volume commitments. And so certainly that's always in play, Christine. In terms of the cost reductions, we probably won't break that out separately for each segment. But certainly cost reductions did play an important part of third, second and third quarter. And we still have some cost reductions to deliver here in the fourth quarter as well, with respect to that $200 million for 2020, that expectation of operating cost reductions. So that's a significant portion of the benefit that we've been realizing. We probably have a little more flexibility on the Logistics and Storage side of the business than what we've had on Gathering and Processing. The plants that they have installed have, you know, that's a little bit like a mini refinery, and they have high fixed operating costs. And so we have probably experienced more of the cost savings on the Logistics and Storage side of the business than we did in Gathering and Processing.\nChristine Cho: Okay, got it. And then I guess just given the changing landscape for refineries, in a post-pandemic world, how should we think about the long-term cash flow generation of the existing assets against the contribution from growth projects, as we think about the natural [indiscernible] you mentioned from growing EBITDA? And should we take your preference to buy back stocks today, as confident that you either don't see deterioration in the near to medium term on your assets, or that any structural changes will be more than offset with lower CapEx and continued cost savings?\nPam Beall: Yeah. And thanks, Christine. That's a good question. And so it's kind of - I will give you a kind of a multi part answer and then maybe ask others if they want to chime in as well. But when we think about some of the significant changes that have taken place at MPCs operations with the idling of the Gallup refinery, the Martinez refinery, and the conversion of Dickinson to renewable diesel, when we think about some of those renewable products like renewable diesel, as you know, it's a drop in fuel. And we can move that fuel in our existing assets. So we'll certainly will look forward to as MPC transition some of its fuels, and its feedstocks will be equipped to handle those feedstocks in those fields. And then as it relates specifically to Gallup and Martinez, as we've talked about the fact that we contracts in place that protect cash flow for a period of time. And then at Gallup, we would expect actually there to be for the enterprise little or no change in the cash flow and EBITDA, because the pipelines that supported moving crude to the refinery, now that crude is being transported on a longer haul, a Tex New Mex pipeline to Midland. And so the earnings we believe will not be impacted by the shutdown of the Gallup refinery. And then at Martinez, combination of things there. So again, we're protected with agreements for the various assets that were dropped down over time by the legacy Andeavor, ANDX systems. We have minimum volume protection in place, and some contracts go out to December of 2026. And as MPC continues to move forward with its project there, we're continuing to evaluate the long-term opportunities for the logistics assets around that operation to be conformed to support NPCs objectives in that market. As far as the long term and energy transition, we believe that our assets will continue to serve an important role well into the future, in terms of delivering crude oil, feedstocks and finished products to markets that we believe will continue to require them, even as the space does a transition. And then when we talk about energy transition, we could talk about you know, some of the opportunities to convert some of our assets to help support new services and operations, like moving CO2 or/and sequestering CO2 in caverns and storage facilities, moving hydrogen on pipelines, renewable gas on pipelines and those kinds of things. So, certainly an opportunity for us. This industry has been very resilient. Over time, we've adapted to a lot of changes in standards and regulations over time. And we believe our assets will continue to be a vital part of delivering energy to those who need it.\nMike Hennigan: Christine, its Mike. I'll just add to Pam's comment to your question. At the end of the day, we're going to continue to see an evolving energy landscape. Obviously, it's very well known that there's different things occurring different parts of the world. In the short term, one of the priorities that I think was important for us at MPC and MPLX, was to spend a lot of time on our cost structure. And that effort continues. And we're going to continue to give updates quarter-to-quarter as to how that progresses. But I don't want to lose sight of the point that Pam was making at the end of the question, you know, the point that you made at the end of your is, we do believe in growth, it is an important part of the story at MPC and MPLX, getting the cost structure in line was a high priority, but then also growing the earnings at both entities over the long term is also a priority. But in A very short term with COVID hitting and the uncertainty around the market, at least in the last six months or so, the higher priority has been liquidity and getting ourselves in a position where we think we have a structure long term that's more cost competitive?\nChristine Cho: Thank you.\nMike Hennigan: You're welcome.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nMichael Blum: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. So in your prepared remarks, you just talked about M&A you're seeing in the Upstream space. My question is really, do you see that ultimately moving to the Midstream sector? And if so, what are your thoughts in terms of MPLX playing a role there, or do you think you're just going to be more internally focused?\nPam Beall: Yeah, Michael. I'll start, its Pam. So at the moment, we don't really have a currency that I think would be very effective in consolidation. I think consolidation will take place. And certainly we'll evaluate opportunities as we move forward. But again, our priority in the near term is to use our free cash and our balance sheet - to not use our balance sheet and keep our debt in check here, but use our free cash to buy back units. But we're not going to be blind to what's happening in the space. And we do think that there will be consolidation. So we'll certainly be monitoring that. What that might look like, it\u2019s difficult to predict. And I'm not saying that we are actively engaging in M&A at this point in time, but certainly we'll keep an eye on how that unfolds.\nMichael Blum: Great. Just a second question. Just want to ask if you had any updates on the proceedings on the High Plains pipeline? Thank you.\nPam Beall: Yeah, so on the High Plains pipeline, there was some recent development and the case was really remanded back. So by December 15, there will be an update from the court. See if I'm missing anything here. Yeah, so the trespass determination and the damages are vacated. And that's - so that's good. The matter has been sent back to a regional director. We do expect a new decision by December 15. But really, that's all there is. We don't have much to share beyond that. Now, just want to remind people, as we stated before, we have alternatives to generate a similar level of EBITDA, as we've generated in the past, if for some reason we're unable to use that one piece of line that was at issue with the tribes.\nMike Hennigan: Michael, its Mike. I\u2019d just add, obviously, it's a positive development for us, as the system secretary issued an order vacating the BIAs big trespass order. There is still more to come as Pam mentioned. But as we previously disclosed, is, you know, we believe that we have alternatives that are just as important in this whole process, and we'll continue to see how it plays out. But that's where we stand at this point.\nMichael Blum: Thank you very much.\nMike Hennigan: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next Question will come from Spiro Dounis with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nSpiro Dounis: Hey. Morning, everyone. First question is just on the Midstream assets still up at the NPC level, both Gray Oak and South Texas, they were cash flowing down [ph] So just wondering if you guys could update us on how you're thinking about migrating those assets down to MPLX? And if an asset swap is something that could facilitate a transaction there?\nPam Beall: Yeah. It\u2019s Pam. So I would say at the moment it's kind of a - it's not on the front burner. For us across the company, we really have our priorities focused on those items that that Mike has highlighted, optimizing our portfolio, reducing our costs, focusing on the commercial aspects of our business, really getting our house in order. And you know, for MPLX, in particular, getting to that excess free cash flow, that positive cash flow, after distributions and after capital investments, so that we can commence the program that was authorized by the Board to begin repurchasing our units.\nSpiro Dounis: Understood. Second question just on the ESG side of things, obviously, it is continued to make a pretty big push, they're encouraging to see that. But just wondering when it comes to governance, at some point does the evaluation of a C Corp governance vehicle become a weightier factor for you?\nMike Hennigan: Spiro, its Mike. So, one of the things that we continue to look at is the structure that we have here. We certainly understand the argument for C Corp, and the advantages that that would bring from widening the investor base. But as we found in our Midstream review, there is a lot of cases where there are pros and cons, I've used that term quite a bit. And there is knowns and unknowns. Obviously, in this particular case, the pro would be to a wider investor base, then in currently in the partnership structure. But one of the large cons would be the tax impacts that would occur both at MPC and to our long term holders. So that's one of the main reasons that we have not moved forward on that. The second main reason, obviously, is if you're in a C Corp mode, that you're going to start paying corporate taxes. And for us, we've looked at that for an entity that we have today, which is about $4 billion of distributable cash flow, rough numbers, even at 21% tax rate, that's a significant corporate tax that we would be paying. And if you believe that the tax rate could be going up in the future, it's just even that much more. So if you're looking at $800 to $1 billion to 2 billion or whatever number you want to pick, we haven't felt that it's been worthwhile to consider that in light of the, you know, the cons, which would be the upfront tax implications to our holders, as well as the ongoing loss of cash flow. That's pretty significant in this regard. So with that said, we're always constantly evaluating what's the best way for us to try and create value, up until now we keep saying the base case that we've been on is still the right path. We want to get into \u201821 and generate more cash flow and continue to emphasize that we think that's the best source of value for us, and try and get to a point where we start to buy units back and if they continue to trade at this kind of level, then we'll continue to prioritize that as a use of that excess cash.\nSpiro Dounis: Got it. Makes sense. Appreciate it the color. Thank you, Pam. Thank you, Mike.\nMike Hennigan: You're welcome.\nPam Beall: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from T J Schultz with RBC Capital. Your line is open.\nT J Schultz: Great, thanks. Just first a question on the MVCs. Do you have any major contract renewal renewals on the MVCs in 2021? And what's the average remaining term on the MVCs within L&S?\nPam Beall: So, within L&S, we have long-term contracts, most of them were put in place. Those that would be coming up for renewal would be coming up primarily in 2022. So our first drop down back in 2012 was Marathon Petroleum assets. And those are 10-year contracts. So the majority of those would start coming up for renewal and then in the Logistics and Storage segment of the business beginning in 2022. We do have one contract, our marine contract does come up for renewal in January of 2021, excuse me, and that is a little more unique among all of our other contracts. That contract will be extended and renewed. However, it does have a feature where we will reset the rates to market rates for the equipment that's under contract. So it's a contract, it's a fee for capacity. So to the extent that we have the equipment in service available and dedicated to MPC, we will be paid for that equipment. The rates are set to fluctuate every 5 years upon contract renewal. So we would expect that there will be contract renegotiations on the rates, the rates will be reset. And the rate reset is really based on what market rates are. So that's one that will be up in 2021.\nT J Schultz: Okay, thanks. And then just a follow up on your answer earlier about asset conversions that may be possible when considering energy transition and the theme there. Are any of those considerations, whether it has to do with CO2 or hydrogen or R&G [ph] happening right now? Or when do you expect those types of conversions to be possible or to be needed? Thanks.\nMike Hennigan: So one of the things that I would tell you T J is, you know, as we look at this evolution in the energy space, I think Pam said it well earlier is, we're going to continue to look for opportunities, where we can participate and make that part of our portfolio going forward. Probably the toughest thing from year end, it's an area where we probably won't give the most disclosures because of the competitive nature of these calls. And not put ourselves in a position where we're hurting our either negotiations or the projects that we have. But we'll try our best to give you some color in this area. But it's also an area that's probably going to frustrate you a little bit, as we kind of keep some of these projects closer to the best. But I don't know, Tim, if you want to comment at all.\nTimothy Griffith: So this is Tim. I would just add that, in short, we know we're an energy logistics company. And we're going to continue to look at all the opportunities. But I think Mike has summarized it well, it's pretty competitive environment, whether we look at conversion of assets, you know, we have things that move molecules. So we'll continue to look at what we can put those services to use in, whether it's trucks, trains, boats, pipes. It's all on the table.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nKeith Stanley: Hi, good morning. I wanted to follow up first on the comments on the Marine contract. Can you give you a sense of current rate versus market rates? And then my understanding it was a pretty small business, I think it was only maybe $100 million or 200 million EBITDA, if that's in the ballpark? And then related to that, do the pipeline contracts that you referenced for 2022 also reset to market at renewal, or was that something unique to Marine?\nPam Beall: No, that's unique to the marine business. And you have - you're in the right zip code in terms of the size of the business. So yeah, it's - and I would say, another thing to keep in mind is the fact that we have put more equipment to work also helps to offset the fact that we would expect the Marine rates to come down. I would say the current market is soft relative to when the contract was first put in place and the prices were first established. So it's clearly - it is - but you're in the right zip code for Marine.\nKeith Stanley: Okay, great. And second topic, on the buybacks, the $1 billion authorizations for the public units. Can just talk about the reasons for buying in the public units and not against buying in any units held by MPC. Obviously, it's more impactful for the stock technically. But any other thoughts or considerations, maybe MPC has no interest in selling back MPLX units, just how you came to do the authorization just for the public units? Thanks.\nPam Beall: Well, we think its important message for investors that MPC does want to hold its ownership interest in MPLX. And as we use positive free cash, again after we maintain the distribution, which is important to MPC, after we may you know invest in the business, the capitalist is available after investing in the business will be used to buy back public units and that will only serve to increase MPCs ownership interest in MPLx. So we think that's an important message for investors that MPC continues to value MPLX as an important part of its business long-term, not only for the distribution today, but for growth opportunities well into the future.\nKeith Stanley: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Tristan Richardson with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nTristan Richardson: Hey, good morning. Thanks for all the communication on capitol priorities. You've covered a lot of ground here. Just one more buyback question, if I may. Just curious, Mike, how much does consolidated leverage as the sponsor influence the pace of execution on a buyback versus continuing to just deliver the LP?\nMike Hennigan: So they're pretty much independent Tristan. One of the things that we've said at the sponsor level is, we look at the MPC, x-MPLX leverage, and we want to keep that at around 1 to 1.5 times. Obviously, we're in a little bit of a anomaly situation with what's happening with COVID. But we've continued to communicate that, we believe both entities should be and I use the word appropriately levered, we're not looking to have the entities under levered, we're not looking to have them over levered, we're looking for an appropriate amount of leverage, that is right for each entity. At the MPLX level, we think four times is a good spot to be. Over time, Pam has said, over time, you have a net drift down a little bit, as our earnings growth is good for us in our mind. So Midstream space was very consistent, stable earnings. And hopefully, you know, the market is seeing that, as far as the last couple quarters here. We think that's an appropriate leverage for the Midstream space. At the same time, on the refining space, that type of leverage would not be an appropriate level. So that's why we've communicated, 1 to 1.5 times is what we think is right there. In both entities is very important for us to maintain investment grade credit metrics. We continue to have dialogue with the rating agencies, we'll always continue to do that. The ratings that we have at this point, we believe are appropriate for our businesses. And we think the leverage that we have is important to maintain that investment grade profile. So that's the way we think about them. You know, some people ask that question, like you're asking now about consolidated, we kind of look at them as two independent businesses, and having them appropriately levered is the way we think about it.\nTristan Richardson: Appreciate it. Thank you guys very much.\nMike Hennigan: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question will come from Ujjwal Pradhan with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nUjjwal Pradhan: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two quick clarification ones for me. You mentioned earlier that the cost reduction from workforce reduction plan is incremental to the $200 million in OpEx reduction this year. Are you able to quantify the benefits from that going forward? And perhaps high level, how much of the aggregate cost reduction this year will be repeatable next year?\nPam Beall: Yeah, Ujjwal, all of the cost reductions that we're achieving in 2020, we expect to be ongoing into the future. And we're not providing information yet about the amount that the cost reduction equates to for the workforce reduction, but you'll be able to see it in our results as we move forward. And some of the cost reductions that we've been able to successfully execute here in 2020, you should be able to see that in our detailed financial statements as well. So I would say just continue to monitor our progress, and you should be able to follow it as we move through 2021.\nUjjwal Pradhan: Got it. Thanks for that Pam. And second clarification on the CapEx comments from earlier, appreciate the color you already share so far. But given the improving outlook for the Northeast, based on your customer conversations, perhaps could you share why we should think about run rate CapEx for Northeast G&P to maintain current production levels?\nPam Beall: Yeah, Ujjwal. I would - I'd say that's relatively modest, relative in comparison to the total capital that we've been spending historically there. Most of the capital that we've spent in 2020 even is related to the NGL pipeline that we completed, and we're close to completion there. And then bringing on - preparing to bring on some additional plants and building out that Smithburg 1 property. So we definitely have ongoing capital to support the producer customers in the way of well connects and so forth. But my guess is just within the Marcellus that that would be, you know, a couple $100 million or less.\nMike Hennigan: Ujjwal, its Mike. I'm just going to add that, one of the things that I think we've seen as a result of the activities in this year is, many of the E&P players are looking at their situation. And compared to where they were a couple of years ago, looking at a slower growth trajectory, whether it be in the Northeast, or in the Permian, or any other areas. So, our expectation is the growth pattern that we'll see will be at a slower pace consistent with that. At the same time, I think everybody has seen that, one of the things of the recent activities in 2020 is how natural gas has responded, as far as you know, price and the expectation going forward, that we think it's still going to be an important part of the energy landscape for the long-term. We're looking at $3 plus, natural gas pricing now compared to where we were six months ago. And I think there's a different outlook going forward that also blends into the evolving energy landscape.\nUjjwal Pradhan: Got it. Thank you, Pam and Mike. And congratulations on a great quarter.\nMike Hennigan: Yeah, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to Kristina Kazarian for closing remarks.\nKristina Kazarian: Thank you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in MPLX. Should you have any additional questions or would you like clarification on any of the topics discussed this morning, members of our team will be available to take your calls. Hope you have a great day.\nOperator: That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "Pam Beall",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Turning to slide seven MPLX delivered third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion and distributable cash flow of $1.1 billion, which provided continued strong distribution coverage of 1.44 times. Our results for the quarter once again, highlight the resiliency of our underlying business, as well as execution of our forecasted $200 million of operating cost reductions to help offset a challenging demand environment, allowing us to continue to generate strong cash flow and adjusted EBITDA. For the quarter, we generated positive cash flow, after investments in the business and distributions to unitholders. We use this cash to reduce total debt outstanding from the end of the second quarter to the end of the third quarter, and we ended the third quarter with leverage of four times. During the quarter, we refinanced our 2021 debt maturities, at very attractive rate, along with some of our notes due in 2022, and 2024, that carried coupons of 6.25% or higher. Slide eight shows the third quarter Logistics & Storage business segment highlight. Volumes across our pipeline and terminal systems were lower compared with the third quarter of 2019, primarily driven by lower refinery utilization at MPCs refineries. However, we did see sequential increase in both pipeline and terminal throughputs versus the second quarter of 2020. During the third quarter, the Wink to Webster Permian crude oil pipeline project achieved mechanical completion on the main segment connecting the Permian Basin to Houston, Texas. The main segment of the pipeline system was commissioned with Permian crude oil from Midland to Houston in October, and service is expected to be available to shippers in the fourth quarter. We have a 15% equity ownership interest of this joint venture. The pipeline system has 100% of its contractible capacity committed with minimum volume commitments. Additional segments offering shippers further service are expected to be placed in service throughout 2021. The Whistler natural gas pipeline project also continued to progress. The two bcf per day capacity project is more than 90% committed with minimum volume commitments. We continue to expect to start up of the project in the second half of 2021. As we noted last quarter, MPLX WhiteWater Midstream and West Texas gas formed a joint venture to provide NGL takeaway capacity from MPLX and WTG's gas processing plants in the Permian to Sweeney, Texas. This optimized approach will largely use existing infrastructure with limited initial construction. Commercial NGL transportation service to Sweeney, Texas is expected to commence in the second half of 2021. Slide nine provides third quarter Gathering and Processing business segment highlight. For the third quarter of 2020, Gathered and Processed volumes were lower than the same period last year across most of our footprints. With a few exceptions, including West Texas and the Marcellus where Gathered volumes increased 3% and Processed volumes increased 8% respectively. Processed volumes in the Marcellus reached a record 5.7 billion cubic feet per day. Total Fractionated volumes averaged 567,000 barrels per day, representing a 4% increase over the third quarter of 2019. Record Fractionated volumes were primarily driven by a 10% increase in the Marcellus where volumes increased with the Hopedale 5 fractionator, which came online during the third quarter. Despite the pressure on commodity prices, as global demand remains significantly below historical levels, we remain optimistic in the outlook for both natural gas and NGL demand and price recovery. The recent recovery in futures prices is beneficial for our natural gas and NGL producer customers, as they can take advantage of hedging opportunities and realize a positive impact on operating results, as well as their borrowing base redetermination. We expect producers will continue to apply the benefits of an improving price environment to their balance sheets to address near term debt maturities and improve their financial flexibility. We're also encouraged by the consolidation that's occurring among our producers, which should result in counterparties with a stronger financial profile. Moving to our financial highlights on slide 10, adjusted EBITDA was $1.3 billion for the third quarter of 2020. The Logistics and Storage segment adjusted EBITDA was $893 million, while the Gathering and Processing segment contributed $442 million in adjusted EBITDA. For the quarter, we generated approximately $1.1 billion of distributable cash flow and we'll return for the quarter $750 million to our unitholders. This provided distribution coverage of 1.44 times. The bridge on slide 11 shows the change in adjusted EBITDA from the third quarter of 2019 to the third quarter of 2020. The Logistics and Storage segment increased $44 million year-over-year, primarily driven by lower costs, lower operating expenses, minimum volume commitments, and the completion of the Mt. Airy terminal and Utica butane expansion projects, partially offset by decreased pipeline and terminalling volumes due to lower utilization at MPC's refineries. The Gathering and Processing segment increased $18 million, primarily driven by higher volumes due to additional plants coming online, partially offset by production curtailments and shut-ins. Slide 12 provides a summary of key financial highlights and select balance sheet information. We ended the quarter with a leverage ratio of four times and approximately $3.4 billion available on our bank revolver, and $1.5 billion available on our intercompany facility with MPC. During and shortly after the quarter, we undertook several financing activities to continue to strengthen our balance sheet, by lowering our interest costs and extending maturities. These steps were outlined in the earnings release. As I mentioned earlier, for the third quarter, we generated positive cash flow after investments and distributions. With progress made in 2020, our continued capital discipline and expected growth in EBITDA, we continue to target our goal of achieving positive free cash flow after capital investments and distributions for 2021. As we reach this inflection point, we believe that we will have the financial flexibility to repurchase units or reduce debt. We will continue to prioritize an investment grade credit profile and we expect our leverage to improve over time with modest growth in EBITDA. We will be looking to implement the board authorized unit repurchase program of up to $1 billion of our outstanding publicly traded common units. The timing, price and actual number of common units repurchased, if any, will depend on several factors, including our expected excess cash available, alternative investment opportunities in the market and business conditions. And now let me turn the call back over to Kristina. Good morning, Jeremy. Jeremy, its Pam. I thought I would just add on to Mike's comment about the unit repurchase. And you asked whether asset optimization would have a factor, would play a role in that. And I just want to highlight, we're not a distressed seller. And so we'll be patient and prudent with asset monetization. But clearly to the extent that we are successful, and we hope with an improving price environment that we'll be successful in optimizing some of the basins, we would absolutely deploy proceeds first to debt reduction. And we certainly don't want to be in a, what we call, a dilutive deleveraging. So certainly would look at using some proceeds to the extent that they're available for unit to repurchase as well. So - and of course, that's all predicated on where we stand with respect to leverage in our investment grade credit profile that we want to prioritize, as we evaluate all these opportunities to allocate our capital to move forward. Yeah, Jeremy. So as it relates to the largest segment of our business, the Logistics and Storage segment, MPC each quarter does provide some guidance on what it expects in terms of its refining throughput. And certainly, the volumes in the Logistics and Storage side of the business will really move with MPCs guidance. Currently, their guidance for the fourth quarter is slightly lower than it was for the third. So keep that in mind. But that's certainly what we would expect as well. And then as it relates to the Gathering and Processing side of the business, it's been certainly very challenging for the producer customers really, across all of our geographies. We've been pleased to see some of the reports from producers have been coming out. So we'd encourage you to look at some of those - that guidance as well. But an improving price environment and backdrop we think will be very supportive for the Gathering and Processing segment. We are running at very high volumes in our Marcellus area. So we have some capacity that we could certainly fill up in the Utica. And we have a Smithburg 1 ready when the appropriate time to take gas, but that Sherwood complex is running quite full. So we're optimistic about how our producers will be able to benefit from an overall improving natural gas and NGL price environment. Yeah, Shneur. I'll take that. It's Pam. So as we mentioned earlier, we're on target to achieve the $200 million of operating expense reductions this year. And then we also announced the reduction in force that was across the enterprise MPC and MPLX. And so that portion of the cost reductions associated with the separation of part of our workforce will be reflected primarily as we move forward in 2021. So that's incremental to the 200 million that we identified earlier. And then the other questions that you asked about was CapEx. CapEx, we would \u2013 we'll provide an update when we report fourth quarter results. But as you know, we've worked hard to reduce our capital spend throughout the year. We're still targeting about $900 million, which is down about $750 million. And then we would expect for 2021, although we're not ready to provide some guidance, we would expect 2021 CapEx will be lower than 2020, as we've been wrapping up some larger projects here. So it'll be lower than this year. But we're just not ready quite yet to give you that guidance Shneur. Well, as I mentioned earlier, so there was a question about the outlook and on volumes across the system. And the Logistics and Storage side will follow, MPCs refining volume throughput. So \u2013 and MPC is forecasting slightly lower throughput for the fourth quarter, then the third. So keep that in mind. But to your point, we're turning the corner here on free cash flow, we were negative the first half, positive in the third. We would expect to be positive in the fourth. So we think we'll be right around a position to maybe be modestly positive for the fourth quarter of 2020 or for you know, for the full year. Yeah, John. So I think one of the things that is a little more difficult for us to forecast is change in accrual for capital expenditures, and capitalize interest. And so some of those, those items are adding to this a number that is a little higher than our targeted of $900 million. But if you back out, and we give the detail in the press release, so it's - I think it's the last schedule attached to the press release. If you back those things out, you'll see that we're still right on target for it, we will have considerably lower capital spending in the fourth quarter. And that is intentional. As I mentioned throughout the earlier part of the year, we were wrapping up some larger projects like the Mt. Airy terminal, the Utica butane expansion, and NGL pipeline in Appalachia. And we had some plants that were being wrapped up. So you know, we had \u2013 our capital spending was much greater in the first half of the year. That also that's part of the reason why we were negative cash flow in the first part of the year. But yeah, you'll see a very significant decline sequentially as we go into the fourth quarter and close out the year for growth CapEx. So MVCs can always be a part of the equation. We have a large number of our contracts and systems that are supported by MVCs. And even in periods of time, when we weren't in the kind of the demand shock that we've been experiencing, we've had some the benefit of protections from minimum volume commitments. And so certainly that's always in play, Christine. In terms of the cost reductions, we probably won't break that out separately for each segment. But certainly cost reductions did play an important part of third, second and third quarter. And we still have some cost reductions to deliver here in the fourth quarter as well, with respect to that $200 million for 2020, that expectation of operating cost reductions. So that's a significant portion of the benefit that we've been realizing. We probably have a little more flexibility on the Logistics and Storage side of the business than what we've had on Gathering and Processing. The plants that they have installed have, you know, that's a little bit like a mini refinery, and they have high fixed operating costs. And so we have probably experienced more of the cost savings on the Logistics and Storage side of the business than we did in Gathering and Processing. Yeah. And thanks, Christine. That's a good question. And so it's kind of - I will give you a kind of a multi part answer and then maybe ask others if they want to chime in as well. But when we think about some of the significant changes that have taken place at MPCs operations with the idling of the Gallup refinery, the Martinez refinery, and the conversion of Dickinson to renewable diesel, when we think about some of those renewable products like renewable diesel, as you know, it's a drop in fuel. And we can move that fuel in our existing assets. So we'll certainly will look forward to as MPC transition some of its fuels, and its feedstocks will be equipped to handle those feedstocks in those fields. And then as it relates specifically to Gallup and Martinez, as we've talked about the fact that we contracts in place that protect cash flow for a period of time. And then at Gallup, we would expect actually there to be for the enterprise little or no change in the cash flow and EBITDA, because the pipelines that supported moving crude to the refinery, now that crude is being transported on a longer haul, a Tex New Mex pipeline to Midland. And so the earnings we believe will not be impacted by the shutdown of the Gallup refinery. And then at Martinez, combination of things there. So again, we're protected with agreements for the various assets that were dropped down over time by the legacy Andeavor, ANDX systems. We have minimum volume protection in place, and some contracts go out to December of 2026. And as MPC continues to move forward with its project there, we're continuing to evaluate the long-term opportunities for the logistics assets around that operation to be conformed to support NPCs objectives in that market. As far as the long term and energy transition, we believe that our assets will continue to serve an important role well into the future, in terms of delivering crude oil, feedstocks and finished products to markets that we believe will continue to require them, even as the space does a transition. And then when we talk about energy transition, we could talk about you know, some of the opportunities to convert some of our assets to help support new services and operations, like moving CO2 or/and sequestering CO2 in caverns and storage facilities, moving hydrogen on pipelines, renewable gas on pipelines and those kinds of things. So, certainly an opportunity for us. This industry has been very resilient. Over time, we've adapted to a lot of changes in standards and regulations over time. And we believe our assets will continue to be a vital part of delivering energy to those who need it. Yeah, Michael. I'll start, its Pam. So at the moment, we don't really have a currency that I think would be very effective in consolidation. I think consolidation will take place. And certainly we'll evaluate opportunities as we move forward. But again, our priority in the near term is to use our free cash and our balance sheet - to not use our balance sheet and keep our debt in check here, but use our free cash to buy back units. But we're not going to be blind to what's happening in the space. And we do think that there will be consolidation. So we'll certainly be monitoring that. What that might look like, it's difficult to predict. And I'm not saying that we are actively engaging in M&A at this point in time, but certainly we'll keep an eye on how that unfolds. Yeah, so on the High Plains pipeline, there was some recent development and the case was really remanded back. So by December 15, there will be an update from the court. See if I'm missing anything here. Yeah, so the trespass determination and the damages are vacated. And that's - so that's good. The matter has been sent back to a regional director. We do expect a new decision by December 15. But really, that's all there is. We don't have much to share beyond that. Now, just want to remind people, as we stated before, we have alternatives to generate a similar level of EBITDA, as we've generated in the past, if for some reason we're unable to use that one piece of line that was at issue with the tribes. Yeah. It's Pam. So I would say at the moment it's kind of a - it's not on the front burner. For us across the company, we really have our priorities focused on those items that that Mike has highlighted, optimizing our portfolio, reducing our costs, focusing on the commercial aspects of our business, really getting our house in order. And you know, for MPLX, in particular, getting to that excess free cash flow, that positive cash flow, after distributions and after capital investments, so that we can commence the program that was authorized by the Board to begin repurchasing our units. Thanks. So, within L&S, we have long-term contracts, most of them were put in place. Those that would be coming up for renewal would be coming up primarily in 2022. So our first drop down back in 2012 was Marathon Petroleum assets. And those are 10-year contracts. So the majority of those would start coming up for renewal and then in the Logistics and Storage segment of the business beginning in 2022. We do have one contract, our marine contract does come up for renewal in January of 2021, excuse me, and that is a little more unique among all of our other contracts. That contract will be extended and renewed. However, it does have a feature where we will reset the rates to market rates for the equipment that's under contract. So it's a contract, it's a fee for capacity. So to the extent that we have the equipment in service available and dedicated to MPC, we will be paid for that equipment. The rates are set to fluctuate every 5 years upon contract renewal. So we would expect that there will be contract renegotiations on the rates, the rates will be reset. And the rate reset is really based on what market rates are. So that's one that will be up in 2021. No, that's unique to the marine business. And you have - you're in the right zip code in terms of the size of the business. So yeah, it's - and I would say, another thing to keep in mind is the fact that we have put more equipment to work also helps to offset the fact that we would expect the Marine rates to come down. I would say the current market is soft relative to when the contract was first put in place and the prices were first established. So it's clearly - it is - but you're in the right zip code for Marine. Well, we think its important message for investors that MPC does want to hold its ownership interest in MPLX. And as we use positive free cash, again after we maintain the distribution, which is important to MPC, after we may you know invest in the business, the capitalist is available after investing in the business will be used to buy back public units and that will only serve to increase MPCs ownership interest in MPLx. So we think that's an important message for investors that MPC continues to value MPLX as an important part of its business long-term, not only for the distribution today, but for growth opportunities well into the future. Yeah, Ujjwal, all of the cost reductions that we're achieving in 2020, we expect to be ongoing into the future. And we're not providing information yet about the amount that the cost reduction equates to for the workforce reduction, but you'll be able to see it in our results as we move forward. And some of the cost reductions that we've been able to successfully execute here in 2020, you should be able to see that in our detailed financial statements as well. So I would say just continue to monitor our progress, and you should be able to follow it as we move through 2021. Yeah, Ujjwal. I would - I'd say that's relatively modest, relative in comparison to the total capital that we've been spending historically there. Most of the capital that we've spent in 2020 even is related to the NGL pipeline that we completed, and we're close to completion there. And then bringing on - preparing to bring on some additional plants and building out that Smithburg 1 property. So we definitely have ongoing capital to support the producer customers in the way of well connects and so forth. But my guess is just within the Marcellus that that would be, you know, a couple $100 million or less."

But I think Mike has summarized it well, it's pretty competitive environment, whether we look at conversion of assets, you know, we have things that move molecules. So we'll continue to look at what we can put those services to use in, whether it's trucks, trains, boats, pipes. It's all on the table."

            "name": "Mike Hennigan",
            "content": "Thanks Kristina. Good morning and thank you for joining our call. Earlier today we reported adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2020 of $1.3 billion, a slight increase versus our second quarter 2020 EBITDA. Our performance during the third quarter highlights the stability of our underlying business, the quality of our contracts and execution on our capital and operating expense reductions to help offset what we knew would be a challenging environment. With our EBITDA growing over time, and our continued emphasis on strict capital discipline, our leverage can naturally be reduced. To that end, we have obtained Board authorization for a unit repurchase program for the repurchase and retirement of up to $1 billion of the company's outstanding publicly traded limited partner common units. By getting Board approval, now this program will allow us to make repurchases of our common units at the appropriate time and provide us with an attractive opportunity to return value to our unit holders. Turning to slide four, a key part of our path to positive cash flows continued capital spending discipline. We continue to be on track to achieve our 2020 capital reduction of over $700 million, as we continue to focus on opportunities with the most attractive returns. Turning to slide five, I would take a moment to provide some comments on our responsibilities around sustainability and corporate leadership. As a result of our continued refinement of our ESG perspectives, I want to mention two additional and important initiatives the combined enterprise as established, incremental to the announcement earlier this year, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions intensity to 30% below 2014 levels by 2030. First, we've established a 2025 goal to reduce methane emissions intensity from our G&P business to 50% below 2016 levels. Second, we are focusing on conserving and managing use of water. To our efforts in this area, the combined enterprises reduced freshwater withdrawal intensity by over 10% since 2015, and expect to further reduce it by an additional 10% by 2030. Shifting to slide six, we recently published our 2020 perspectives on climate-related scenarios report. This is the fourth year the MPC enterprises published a TCFD compliant report, which highlights the opportunities and strategic planning work the company is engaged in related to climate scenarios. We also published our 2019 sustainability report in late July, which expands upon efforts in environmental, social and governance aspects of the business. With the publication of the 2019 sustainability report, we also published a Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, or SASB midstream supplement, highlighting the specific topics and metrics within our 2019 sustainability report as it pertains to SASBs industry-specific sustainability accounting standards. We look forward to continuing our ESG journey and our commitment to stakeholder engagement with our team of employees, business partners, customers and communities. We view sustainability as the fundamental process of shared value creation, and how we conduct our business enhances the performance we deliver. Now let me turn the call over to Pam to discuss our third quarter 2020 operational and financial results. Good morning, Jeremy. Jeremy, this is Mike, I'll start off by saying, first off, business conditions are going to continue to change and we're going to evaluate, it's going to be a dynamic program as time goes on. What we said in our prepared remarks is right at the moment with, you know, MPLX trading at a 15-plus yield, we see unit buybacks as the preferred option right at this point. Over the long term, with the base plan, if we stayed in that mode, we expect our leverage to naturally decline as EBITDA continues to increase, because our base plan has - you know, earnings continue to increase. And if we keep debt flat, then we'll have a natural leverage reduction over time. But it is something that we're going to make quarterly calls or real-time calls as time progresses. Our main emphasis was, and we said this for quite some time now was to get into a position where we would have free cash flow after distributions and after capital. We're achieving that as we come to the end of 2020 here. And our expectation was for that to occur in \u201821. So we're a little earlier than we expected. That's why we went out for the authorization with our Board, and then we're just going to continue to evaluate the program as time goes on, and continue to be thoughtful as to what's the best way to deploy it. Jeremy on Wink to Webster one of the things that all the partners have done is looked at how can we optimize the capital spending. So portions of the project will come on in 2021. But as we said, in our early remarks, the main segment from Midland to Houston completed early, so we're going to start that up early. And then as \u201821 progresses, as we optimize the capital, we look at where the different segments are, you know, throughout 21, we'll give more of an update as to where that's going to play itself out. But it's part of the optimization process, instead of waiting for the whole time there was a piece of the project it could start up sooner. You're welcome. Shneur, its Mike. So yeah, like I was saying in my previous comments, we're going to evaluate it as business conditions dictate. What we're trying to disclose to everybody is right at this particular time, the way we see the market today is because we've been trading 15-plus yield, it's our desire to prioritize unit buybacks. There's not a set -to your question, there's not a set percentage or anything like that. It's us going to be making a determination as we go forward, what's the best use of those proceeds as we generate positive cash. In the environment that I'd say that we see today, I probably call it the base case today is we see buybacks as the preferred vehicle. And at the same time, we do see EBITDA growth in our business will naturally reduce our leverage. So as Pam has said many times, we're comfortable at four times. Over time, we think that will go down as our earnings grow. But if conditions dictate something different we'll adjust, but right now we see unit buybacks as the priority based on where the market is trading and the yield that we have on our units. One of the things that I think we're trying to communicate is, we made a commitment to the market that we were going to drive ourselves towards free cash flow in \u201821. As you're pointing out, we're getting there a little bit early. I don't want to overplay this, though, from the standpoint as we - you know, we got authorization, we expect to continue to execute the plan. As you know, the size of the public float is not a very large number at this point. So I don't want to over-hype the discussion today. But just really reiterate that we're on track to do what we said we were going to do for a long period of time here. It's been multiple quarters in a row where we said, here's where we're headed. We're getting there, we're trying to show you that. As Pam just said, for the full year we'll be slightly positive, as we go into \u201821 it will get a little bit more in. And I think we're just trying to disclose that, we made a commitment we were executing on that. We're getting to a position where we will finally get to a point of that resulting in some buybacks. And that's why we got the authorization. Thanks, Shneur. Appreciate it. So John, I'll start off and Pam can jump in. So we're not quite through our process internally or with the Board for \u201821. We're in the middle of that. So we're not ready to give any forward guidance in that area. I think what Pam was reiterating, is one of our, tenants of going forward is we're going to maintain very strict capital discipline. As we said, we set a goal that's become, you know, realized now, that we'll be free cash flow. We're committed to our distribution, as we've said many times, the market keeps asking us about that, but we're committed to that distribution. We're committed to managing capital in a way that we've raised our hurdle rate in such a way that we'll have strong discipline around it. We'll generate excess cash, as we generate that excess cash if the market continues to trade, where its been, then we think the right use of proceeds is to buy back units. That's kind of where we are at this point. As to your question on recovery. Again, my personal philosophy is, you know, worry about the things we can control. And not the ones that we don't control, but just to do scenario planning around that. I mean, I think there's a lot of good indications that the market is going back in a demand recovery mode, from where it was earlier. Hopefully, some of this rhetoric that we're all reading about, as far as vaccines coming online sooner rather than later is all good. And hopefully the overall US economy will rebound in \u201821. The way some people are projecting. So we're just going to have to watch, as I was saying, in the answers to the first question, business conditions will dictate how and which method and the pace at which we deploy things. But I think our main message here is, we're delivering on what we expected. We're reaching that point. We're staying disciplined on capital. We're staying committed to our distribution. And we've reached a point where we're starting to have excess funds. Christine, its Mike. I'll just add to Pam's comment to your question. At the end of the day, we're going to continue to see an evolving energy landscape. Obviously, it's very well known that there's different things occurring different parts of the world. In the short term, one of the priorities that I think was important for us at MPC and MPLX, was to spend a lot of time on our cost structure. And that effort continues. And we're going to continue to give updates quarter-to-quarter as to how that progresses. But I don't want to lose sight of the point that Pam was making at the end of the question, you know, the point that you made at the end of your is, we do believe in growth, it is an important part of the story at MPC and MPLX, getting the cost structure in line was a high priority, but then also growing the earnings at both entities over the long term is also a priority. But in A very short term with COVID hitting and the uncertainty around the market, at least in the last six months or so, the higher priority has been liquidity and getting ourselves in a position where we think we have a structure long term that's more cost competitive? You're welcome. Michael, its Mike. I'd just add, obviously, it's a positive development for us, as the system secretary issued an order vacating the BIAs big trespass order. There is still more to come as Pam mentioned. But as we previously disclosed, is, you know, we believe that we have alternatives that are just as important in this whole process, and we'll continue to see how it plays out. But that's where we stand at this point. You're welcome. Spiro, its Mike. So, one of the things that we continue to look at is the structure that we have here. We certainly understand the argument for C Corp, and the advantages that that would bring from widening the investor base. But as we found in our Midstream review, there is a lot of cases where there are pros and cons, I've used that term quite a bit. And there is knowns and unknowns. Obviously, in this particular case, the pro would be to a wider investor base, then in currently in the partnership structure. But one of the large cons would be the tax impacts that would occur both at MPC and to our long term holders. So that's one of the main reasons that we have not moved forward on that. The second main reason, obviously, is if you're in a C Corp mode, that you're going to start paying corporate taxes. And for us, we've looked at that for an entity that we have today, which is about $4 billion of distributable cash flow, rough numbers, even at 21% tax rate, that's a significant corporate tax that we would be paying. And if you believe that the tax rate could be going up in the future, it's just even that much more. So if you're looking at $800 to $1 billion to 2 billion or whatever number you want to pick, we haven't felt that it's been worthwhile to consider that in light of the, you know, the cons, which would be the upfront tax implications to our holders, as well as the ongoing loss of cash flow. That's pretty significant in this regard. So with that said, we're always constantly evaluating what's the best way for us to try and create value, up until now we keep saying the base case that we've been on is still the right path. We want to get into \u201821 and generate more cash flow and continue to emphasize that we think that's the best source of value for us, and try and get to a point where we start to buy units back and if they continue to trade at this kind of level, then we'll continue to prioritize that as a use of that excess cash. You're welcome. So one of the things that I would tell you T J is, you know, as we look at this evolution in the energy space, I think Pam said it well earlier is, we're going to continue to look for opportunities, where we can participate and make that part of our portfolio going forward. Probably the toughest thing from year end, it's an area where we probably won't give the most disclosures because of the competitive nature of these calls. And not put ourselves in a position where we're hurting our either negotiations or the projects that we have. But we'll try our best to give you some color in this area. But it's also an area that's probably going to frustrate you a little bit, as we kind of keep some of these projects closer to the best. But I don't know, Tim, if you want to comment at all. So they're pretty much independent Tristan. One of the things that we've said at the sponsor level is, we look at the MPC, x-MPLX leverage, and we want to keep that at around 1 to 1.5 times. Obviously, we're in a little bit of a anomaly situation with what's happening with COVID. But we've continued to communicate that, we believe both entities should be and I use the word appropriately levered, we're not looking to have the entities under levered, we're not looking to have them over levered, we're looking for an appropriate amount of leverage, that is right for each entity. At the MPLX level, we think four times is a good spot to be. Over time, Pam has said, over time, you have a net drift down a little bit, as our earnings growth is good for us in our mind. So Midstream space was very consistent, stable earnings. And hopefully, you know, the market is seeing that, as far as the last couple quarters here. We think that's an appropriate leverage for the Midstream space. At the same time, on the refining space, that type of leverage would not be an appropriate level. So that's why we've communicated, 1 to 1.5 times is what we think is right there. In both entities is very important for us to maintain investment grade credit metrics. We continue to have dialogue with the rating agencies, we'll always continue to do that. The ratings that we have at this point, we believe are appropriate for our businesses. And we think the leverage that we have is important to maintain that investment grade profile. So that's the way we think about them. You know, some people ask that question, like you're asking now about consolidated, we kind of look at them as two independent businesses, and having them appropriately levered is the way we think about it. You're welcome. Ujjwal, its Mike. I'm just going to add that, one of the things that I think we've seen as a result of the activities in this year is, many of the E&P players are looking at their situation. And compared to where they were a couple of years ago, looking at a slower growth trajectory, whether it be in the Northeast, or in the Permian, or any other areas. So, our expectation is the growth pattern that we'll see will be at a slower pace consistent with that. At the same time, I think everybody has seen that, one of the things of the recent activities in 2020 is how natural gas has responded, as far as you know, price and the expectation going forward, that we think it's still going to be an important part of the energy landscape for the long-term. We're looking at $3 plus, natural gas pricing now compared to where we were six months ago. And I think there's a different outlook going forward that also blends into the evolving energy landscape. Yeah, thank you."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.\nKristina Kazarian: Good morning and welcome to the MPLX second quarter 2020 earnings webcast and conference call. The synchronized slides that accompany this call can be found on mplx.com under the Investors tab. On the call today are Mike Hennigan, President and CEO; Pam Beall, Chief Financial Officer; and other members of the management team. We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statements and non-GAAP disclaimer on Slide 2. It\u2019s a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the call and during the question-and-answer session that follows. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as our filings with the SEC. Now, I\u2019ll turn over this call over to Mike Hennigan for opening remarks.\nMike Hennigan: Thanks Kristina. Good morning and thank you for joining our call. As we expected, the impacts on COVID-19 pandemic continue to create challenges across our business during the second quarter specifically, significantly lower levels of demand for crude and refined products decreased the need for our Logistics and Storage's services, while production curtailments in response to lower prices, pressure the Gathering and Processing systems we operate. In response to this challenging business environment, on our last quarter call, we announced proactive steps to reduce our forecast to 2020 capital spending target by over $700 million and operating expenses by approximately $200 million. The progress we made on the proactive steps we announced in May helped to offset some of the challenges we faced during the quarter. We believe that the underlying business coupled with the steps we have taken have positioned us to continue to generate stable level of EBITDA to support our goal of achieving positive free cash flow after capital investments and distributions for 2021. Turning to Slide 4. Our performance during the second quarter highlights the stability of our underlying businesses, the quality of our contracts and the execution on our identified steps to help offset what we knew would be a challenging environment. Earlier today, we reported adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2020 of $1.2 billion, relatively flat versus our first quarter 2020 EBITDA. Our second quarter EBITDA exhibited less volatility than we estimated primarily due to operating expense reductions that we realized earlier than anticipated in the L&S business, whereas our G&P segment performed roughly as expected. Turning to Slide 5. The other key element of our path to positive free cash has continued capital spending discipline. The process of high grading our capital portfolio has been underway since the combination with ANDX last year, with a growth capital target progressively reduced from about $2.6 billion when the combination closed to our latest 2020 target of about $900 million announced last quarter. We are on track to achieve our 2020 reduction of over $700 million as we continue to focus on opportunities with the most attractive returns. Overall, we continue to target about 75% of our growth capital target towards the L&S side of the business and this growth capital spend target remains primarily related to L&S projects that were already underway including the Wink-to-Webster crude oil pipeline and the Whistler natural gas pipeline. Capital spend on the G&P side continues to be adjusted dynamically to ensure we are bringing infrastructure online just in time to meet our producer customer needs especially in the current environment. Turning to Slide 6. I want to take a moment to comment on sustainability and our role as an industry leader. We recently published our 2019 sustainability report highlights of which can be found on Slide 20 in the appendix. The report is greatly expanded this year in terms of content and disclosure, and outlines our commitment to provide information consistent with the many reporting frameworks that are influential in the investment community. As such, the report expands upon our recent efforts and environmental, social and governance aspects of our business. I want to take a moment to touch on recent events that have impacted many places where we live and work. We are committed to promoting diversity and inclusion in our workplace, and in the communities in which we operate. I firmly believe that we all have a role and a responsibility in creating shared value in our communities. Understanding each other starts with meaningful dialogue and ultimately that's how we'll make progress together. Now let me turn the call over to Pam to discuss our quarterly results.\nPam Beall: Thanks Mike. Turning to Slide 7. I'm pleased to report that MPLX delivered second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $1.2 billion, and distributable cash flow of $1 billion, which provided continued strong distribution coverage of 1.39 times and leverage of 4.1 times. As Mike previously mentioned, the progress we made on the proactive steps we announced in May helped to offset some of the headwinds we faced during the quarter, allowing us to continue to generate strong cash flow and adjusted EBITDA. Slide 8 shows the second quarter Logistics and Storage business segment highlights. A decrease in both pipeline and terminal throughput for the quarter versus the second quarter of 2019 was primarily driven by lower refinery utilization at MPC's refineries. During the second quarter, progress continued on the Permian long-haul pipeline projects in which we have equity interest. The Wink-to-Webster crude oil pipeline and the Whistler natural gas pipeline are expected to be placed in service in the first half and the second half of 2021 respectively. During the quarter MPLX, along with its partners secured project financing for the Whistler pipeline which was already factored into our reduced 2020 growth capital targets. And while we noted last quarter, we were no longer pursuing the construction of the BANGL pipeline, we did indicate that we continued to look for ways to support our producer customers. To that end, we formed a joint venture with WhiteWater Midstream and West Texas Gas to provide NGL takeaway capacity from MPLX and West Texas Gas processing plants in the Permian to Sweeny, Texas. This optimized approach largely utilizes existing infrastructure with limited initial construction. MPLX is contributing existing pipeline laterals and equipment to the joint venture which differs new capital to the out-years. As part of this solution, the joint venture has entered into capacity arrangements from Orla to Sweeny, including an agreement with EPIC Y-Grade Pipeline LP to own an undivided joint interest in EPIC's existing 24-inch NGL pipeline from West Texas to the Eagle Ford basin. Additionally, on July 31, we entered into a redemption agreement with MPC in which we agreed to transfer our Western wholesale distribution business that we acquired as a result of the ANDX acquisition to MPC in exchange for the redemption of $340 million MPLX common units held by MPC. The Western wholesale distribution business was quite different from the fuel distribution business dropped down to MPLX from MPC in 2018. And this transaction allows us to simplify MPLX the only one fuels distribution model. Finally, I wanted to share some comments around some of our Bakken assets including our roughly 9% indirect interest in the DAPL pipeline and our full ownership interest of Tesoro High Plains Pipeline System. Both of these systems are currently facing regulatory and legal challenges. As a small indirect owner of the DAPL pipeline, energy transfer, not MPLX is representing the combined interests of the owners in this situation. With regards to the High Plains Pipeline System, we have appealed the Bureau of Indian Affairs trespass determination, which triggers an automatic stay. During this stay, the pipeline would remain operational. In the event of both of these pipelines were to be impacted for any period of time, we estimate a maximum annual EBITDA impact to MPLX of less than $100 million. As we work through these processes, we are committed to respecting the rights of the indigenous groups. Now turning to Slide 9, we provide second quarter Gathering and Processing business segment highlights. Overall, Gathered and Processed volumes decreased versus the second quarter of 2019, primarily due to producer customer production curtailments and shut-ins, driven by low commodity prices. In the Marcellus and Utica, gathered volumes decreased 1% versus the same period last year, primarily due to weakness in wet gas gathering in the Utica as some producers shifted production to dry gas. In the Marcellus, gathered volumes increased 9%. Process volumes increased 1% versus the same quarter last year, primarily due to the Marcellus, which remained relatively strong where processed volumes increased 6% higher than the second quarter last year. Fractionated volumes increased over the second quarter of 2019, primarily driven by Sherwood fractionator that came online in the fourth quarter last year. Throughout the year, we have discussion with our producer customers about their processing needs, as well as their production expectations with a goal of bringing on new assets just in time to meet their needs. As a result, during the quarter, we shifted the completion of both Smithburg 1 and Preakness processing plants in the Marcellus and Delaware basins respectively from the second quarter of 2020 to 2021. The Hopedale 5 fractionator is still expected to be placed in service in the third quarter this year. Slide 10, moving to our financial highlights slide. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.2 billion for the second quarter of 2020. Total L&S segment adjusted EBITDA was $839 million, while the G&P segment contributed $388 million in adjusted EBITDA. For the quarter, we generated approximately $1 billion of distributable cash flow and will return for the quarter, $746 million to our MPLX unitholders. This provides distribution coverage of 1.39 times and resulted in $280 million of retained distributable cash flow. The bridge on slide 11 shows the change in adjusted EBITDA from the second quarter of 2019 to the second quarter of 2020. The Logistics and Storage segment increased $18 million year-over-year. While we experienced lower pipeline and terminal volumes, resulting from lower utilization at MPC refineries, this impact was more than offset by lower operating and project expenses, as well as an increase in earnings from additional marine equipment placed in service. The Gathering and Processing segment decreased $40 million, primarily driven by lower weighted average NGL prices and lower gathered and processed volumes, due to production curtailments and shut-ins. On a sequential basis, second quarter EBITDA for both Logistics and Storage, and Gathering and Processing segments was down due to lower demand caused by COVID pandemic and lower commodity prices resulting in producer curtailments, respectively. Slide 12 provides a summary of key financial highlights and select balance sheet information. We ended the quarter with leverage of 4.1 times and ample liquidity with approximately $2.7 billion available on our bank revolver and $1.5 billion available on our intercompany facility with MPC. As we look forward, we expect to continue to grow free cash flow by allocating capital investments to the highest return projects with a long-term strategic focus. This disciplined capital investment approach should allow us to increase our financial flexibility and distribution coverage, while maintaining an investment grade credit profile. Now, let me turn the call back over to Kristina.\nKristina Kazarian: Thanks, Pam. As we open the call for questions, we ask that you limit yourself to one question, plus a follow-up. We may re-prompt for additional questions as time permits. With that, we will now open the call to questions, operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]\nKristina Kazarian: Operator, we're ready for our first question.\nOperator: First question comes from Shneur Gershuni from UBS. Your line is open.\nShneur Gershuni: I was maybe wondering if we can start off with the distribution a little bit. Your second quarter was supposed to be a difficult quarter due to COVID, the results were clearly stronger than expected. At the MPC level, you've sold Speedway, which improved the credit profile of MPC as a counterparty. I was wondering, if you can talk about, how this all impacts your thoughts around the distribution on a go-forward basis. There has been two questions with investors recently. So I just wondering, if you could sort of give us your views, how you're thinking about it and so forth. Thank you.\nMike Hennigan: Thanks, Shneur. This is Mike and thanks for asking that question. Because one of the things I wanted to try and clear up a little bit. There was a little bit of confusion after the last quarter on some of my comments. So I appreciate you asking that. So first of all, let me state obviously, we've reaffirmed the distribution at the current level. And then just to remind people, part of my own style, for those who work with me in the past is, I'd like to ask and get a lot of feedback and perspectives from people. When we have our individual meetings or one-on-ones and then I try and feed that back to the market. So everybody gets to see the lens in which we're view things. So, I want to be more clear today that the distribution is an important part of MPLX's value proposition. So in a period when the refining business is facing significant demand challenges, it's also a very important source of capital that MPC relies on as well. So we have not had the external pressures that some of our peers have had - who have had - who have made changes to their distribution. So I think this quarter especially shows how MPLX has stability and its EBITDA profile. And so in that regard, we announced again our decision to support the return of capital to unitholders through the distribution. So we feel very strongly that a return of capital is the high priority for us and that distribution staying same despite some of the challenges that others have had. I think is hopefully showing you some of the stability that we think is in our business. So with that said, sorry, it was confusing to people last time. But we obviously, feel strongly about it and have reaffirmed our distribution at the current level.\nGreg Floerke: Now, Mike, really appreciate that confirmation there. Maybe I've a few quick follow-ups here. The environment is obviously uncertain, but I think things have definitely changed, where they were back in April and in early May. I was wondering like given where current refinery utilizations are today and where congestion is today, how close is MPLX to - from a pipeline perspective to be at or running above the minimum volume commitment levels?\nPam Beall: Yes, Shneur. It's Pam and I'll take that question. So obviously there were some systems during the second quarter that we were running below minimums. And candidly, since we formed MPLX, we have had a few pipelines, systems where we have had a deficiency payments and you can see that reflected in the deferred revenue that we report in our earnings and in our Qs and Ks. So we've always had a little bit of some systems haven't run as we originally expected they would. But overall, I would say that, we would expect that the volumes would be picking back up here in the third quarter, reflecting a rebound in demand from the trough that we all experienced probably around April. So we would expect there to be a fewer volumes running at a minimum volume commitments. I will say that, on the legacy terminal side of the MPLX business, we have protection at pretty high levels. So, if we did run - continue to run below MVCs, we have good protection there. But the majority of the pipelines, even in the second quarter did not hit the MVCs.\nShneur Gershuni: If I can just slide in one little clarification. With the asset level or asset swap to MPC that you announced today, do you have the trailing 12 months EBITDA or multiple. And is that kind of a strategy that you see kind of going forward, where you may see some asset swaps between two entities?\nPam Beall: Yes, Shneur, this is something that we really had contemplated as a kind of a cleanup matter once we close that combination with ANDX and we didn't pursue it, because of the pending midstream committee review. So, just to refresh for those who may not be as familiar with this business. It was a business that was dropped down from Western Refining into Western Logistics in 2014, it was about $40 million of annual EBITDA run rate. And so that, there wasn't much growth if any in that business. That was the run rate, so that's what you should use for your estimates about how that would impact MPLX.\nOperator: Next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJeremy Tonet: Just wondering to start of\u2026\nMike Hennigan: Good morning, Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: Good morning, with the Martinez and Gallup refinery closures here and should we think about any impacts to MPLX, is there a certain level of kind of MVCs here or are there opportunities to kind of to modernize the assets to handle future needs or any thoughts you could provide here would be helpful.\nPam Beall: Yes, Jeremy. This is Pam. So with respect to the Gallup refinery, we expect no impact to MPLX in terms of the EBITDA as we'll continue to operate the assets in and around the refinery. So a significant portion of the earnings related to Gallup for MPLX come from crude gathering and pipeline system that fed the refinery. But to the extent that crude is not going to Gallup refinery, it will go on the Tex New Mex logistics system down to Midland. So we really expect to see no impact to EBITDA as MPC could continue to supply that market with refined products with other means than running the refinery. And then as it relates to the Martinez refinery out - refinery, MPC will obviously be evaluating the assets that could continue to be used there in support of the renewable diesel conversion that it's valuating and we'll have a much better idea over the long term, how those logistics assets around that asset might be utilized. But in the meantime, there are agreements in place do call for continuation of minimum volume commitments that continue over an extended period of time. So assets were dropped in at different times, there are different length of times for these minimum volume commitment contracts. But some of them extend out to 2026. So we would expect in the near term, no impact again on the cash flows and earnings for MPLX.\nJeremy Tonet: Thanks for that and then pivoting over to Gathering and Processing. I was wondering, if you could provide a bit of color as far as what you guys are seeing in July. Just trying to get a feeling for what type of recovery you might be seeing, curtailments coming back online or any sense of trends heading into the third quarter here?\nMike Hennigan: Greg, do you want to handle that one?\nGreg Floerke: Yes. Thanks, Mike. Can you hear me?\nMike Hennigan: Yes.\nGreg Floerke: Okay. Yes, we have seen some of the curtailed shut-in wells come back online as we've moved out of second quarter, but we're actually through second quarter and into July. We were still close to 90% utilization in the Marcellus and not as much curtailment there, probably more in the West, in the crude producing areas and associated gas. But as crude prices improved, we did - we have seen some of those wells come back online and the gas along with it. So yes, generally the dip was in April on into May and it's gradually improved since then.\nJeremy Tonet: Maybe just clarification, July trends. How does that compare to first quarter? Is it possible to kind of frame it that way?\nGreg Floerke: Well, first quarter. I think it's generally getting back to levels that were there and probably not completely in all areas yet, but on a positive direction.\nOperator: Next question comes from Christine Cho from Barclays. Your line is open.\nChristine Cho: As the parent thinks about, how it wants to use the proceeds from the Speedway sale. How do you guys view a potential role in of MPLX, which would enable you guys to - which will enable MPC to retain the cash that's being paid out to the public unitholder, then what other factors could play into the decision? Whether it's corporate tax rates potentially going up, tax position at parent, a preference not to have G&P assets of the parent, et cetera. Just how you guys are thinking about all that?\nMike Hennigan: Christine, this is Mike. So on the previous MPC call, we told investors that we have two priorities for use of proceeds with the Speedway sale. One is balance sheet and our leverage metrics and the second is return of capital back to shareholders. So I got asked the same question there. And I'll just remind you and others that, we did a pretty exhaustive study on the midstream space with questions similar to what you're asking as far as roll up or bring in our LFT back or anything along those lines. And we really came that a conclusion that, because MPC receives a very robust distribution with its ownership percentage in MPLX at $1.8 billion, it didn't make a lot of sense to buy in a cash flow stream that we were already getting via the distribution. So our conclusion at the midstream study, knowing that it would be north of $10 billion transaction was, such that we didn't think that, that was a value creator for either entity and that Marathon at the parent level would be much better served by returning that capital to MPC shareholders. So that's our priority right now and we also disclosed that over the next 5, 6 months, whatever it takes to get the close. Once we get through it, we're going to be doing a pretty exhaustive study of as to what's the best efficient and effective means to deal with that use of proceeds. Hopefully that helps.\nChristine Cho: And then how does the 7.7 billion gallons of fuel per year pie agreement compared to what Speedway has done in past years. And if you can just add some more color on how this contract work. Meaning, what happens if they don't take the 7.7 billion gallons and what sort of upside opportunities do you contemplate?\nMike Hennigan: Yes, good question, Christine. So 7.7 is based on 95% of traditional Speedway volumes and that's for the entire 15 years. So we got a lot of security for MPLX on the volume commitment there, a slight flexibility, but 95% for sure. And then we also have a separate agreement, a separate supply agreement to provide 7-Eleven with their growth profile. So they have a stated position of 20,000 stores that they want to own. So we know there's a lot of growth potential with 7-Eleven. So we actually have two separate agreements. One is to maintain that base Speedway supply and two is to open up the potential for increased value for MPLX going forward. I also want to comment that, the integration value that MPC sees, translates directly to MPLX as we will be using MPLX assets, terminals, pipes, et cetera, et cetera. We're going to continue to be the supplier of transportation logistics, so trucking all of that comes together. So that was an important parameter in our commercial discussions that we wanted to maintain that relationship going forward and then hopefully there is upside to it as 7-Eleven grows.\nChristine Cho: And if I could just have one more clarification question. On the redemption, how many units were cancelled, type sort of selling that asset back to MPC?\nPam Beall: Yes, Kristina this is Pam. So the number of units redeemed was 18,582,088.\nChristine Cho: Thank you.\nMike Hennigan: How is that for an estimate to see?\nPam Beall: And just so you know how we arrived at that, it was based on the 10 trading days ending at market close on July 27.\nOperator: Next question comes from Spiro Dounis from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nSpiro Dounis: I'd like to follow up with Jeremy's question, but also just revisit some of the topics that came up on the MPC call. There was a lot of focus around cost reduction further optimizing the refinery portfolio beyond Martinez and Gallup. So I just wondering to what degree does MPLX contribute to that initiative going forward by way of its own asset closures, cost cuts, or even tariff cuts, just given that it's one of the main service providers for MPC. So just seems like there is a potential there for future actions at MPC to be disrupt with MPLX. So, any color on how you're weighing the various stakeholder interest there with - that would be helpful.\nMike Hennigan: Yes, sure. Spiro, so first off, the initiatives at MPC, some of them are directly apply at MPLX. We are trying to lower our cost structure in both entities, as a way to be more competitive going forward. And last quarter we had said about $200 million of expense reduction planned for MPLX in 2020. And at the time, I said, some of that is things that we know we can count on and some of it may be deferral. But since our last talk last quarter, we feel very confident now that that's more of a structural change. So we are committing that for 2020, we believe that's going to be a long-term impact. So in those areas, I think you're going to see us heavily concentrate similarly on trying to lower cost structure. As far as the discussion between the entities, I'm a big believer in win-wins for both MPLX and MPC and we try and achieve both entities coming out in a better position than going into it. So there is a strong integration value set that provides opportunities for both entities. And not only do we want to continue to capture on that, we want to take that to another level. So if anything that one of my takeaways from the last couple of months is, we have an ability to do a better job of integrating the relationship between the two such that it's a win-win for both. In areas where there is counter views. I mean, obviously, we're going to try and do what's best for each entity standalone. We were very respectful of the two separate entities. So as Pam said, MPC is making a decision on Martinez that could have an impact on MPLX, but we'll have to see how that plays out. We're still pretty confident that the terminaling and logistics assets is an asset for Martinez, so we know that, that's an important part of the go forward valuation for Martinez. But we constantly trying to evaluate both separately and together and try and come out with the win that achieves a good outcome for both.\nSpiro Dounis: I understood. That's helpful. And then with respect to the new NGL pipeline announcements. Can you give us a sense of, I guess what the returns are expected there to look like compared to your historical returns target. And sorry if I missed it, but just in terms of CapEx required to fund the UJI, is that already considered in your current guidance and I guess what's the timing for in-service here?\nMike Hennigan: Yes. So I'll give a few comments and then I'll let Tim, go into a little more detail. But the first couple of comments is, obviously we don't give individual capital or return. So it is in our data that we've given to date and it has been. So throughout all of this, we always are trying our best to disclose where we think our total capital is. And as I said last quarter and we had known for some time, but we finally got to the point last quarter where the market is kind of ahead of us. So we weren't going to do the big capital outlay that was originally contemplated for Bango. So, Tim, and his team have worked diligently to get us to a really good win-win solution for producers to have takeaway, solution for us that we can do that in a very capital efficient way. And ultimately, I hope you're going to continue to see this. Our return metrics, where we're going to be very strict on making sure that we get good returns on our projects. So then it's - why don't you give us a little bit more detail, so they can understand what's happened there.\nTimothy Griffith: As was stated, the - it's very capital efficient program that we're putting together here. I think your question first off was about the timing. Their construction of the pipeline laterals from the MPLX and WTG processing plants and other initial construction are expected to be complete by the fourth quarter of 2021. Now a little bit about the joint venture itself, the JV will initially own a 30% undivided joint interest in the portion of the Epic NGL pipeline. We do have the ability to grow that ownership over time, as the basin recovers. So specifically, the JV will own a share of the Epic 24-inch from Benedum to Gardendale, Texas. Beyond that we have the construction of the laterals that connect up to the various points on the Epic pipeline and then we follow that up with some other various capacity arrangements that get us to the Sweeny fractionation complex. So all in all, a win-win for the JV and our - and the other partners in the deal.\nMike Hennigan: I just want to add, Tim and the rest of the partners did a really good job of staying focused on providing the customer service that was needed for the producers and being very innovative and creative in the way that the project has evolved. So pretty proud of the outcome here, pretty capital efficient, at the same time providing pretty good service for growth in the Permian.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ujjwal Pradhan from Bank of America.\nUjjwal Pradhan: Thanks for taking my question. First one on the Tesoro High Plains situation, Pam. Thanks for the color earlier on the potential impact that you mentioned around 100 million for both DAPL and Tesoro, I believe, wanted to clarify that number and also to get to what the impact would be, with respect to high plains alone. Really in adverse scenario that the decision is upheld. Do you expect a system can run in some fashion with just the pipeline being shut and really what the impact would be overall?\nPam Beall: Yes, Ujjwal. The system itself, aside from the area in dispute, could continue to run and we could continue to maintain a very large share of the EBITDA that we enjoy from that system today. So we think it is potentially - there is a potential that we would have very minimal impact, just from that particular situation itself.\nUjjwal Pradhan: So to clarify the - sorry, go ahead.\nMike Hennigan: I just wanted to add to Pam's remarks, just so you're clear. So we did file an appeal, so which triggers and automatic stay. So the current situation stays exactly the way it is. What Pam was trying to state is, if for whatever reason and we think the likelihood is low, but it for whatever reason we were to shut down, we're still going to maintain about 75% of the EBITDA on that system. So - but the downside to it is, is pretty low and at the same time, we're confident that we can get a resolution that works for ourselves as well as the counterparties.\nUjjwal Pradhan: That helps, thanks both Pam and Mike on that. And follow-up on the NGL takeaway. The project here - thanks for the details on what you already provided. But can you also talk about your returns of your agreement with Epic? And there are a couple of loans at that entity. Would that be recourse to you under this agreement?\nMike Hennigan: So, Ujjwal. That type of detail we typically wouldn't go into. What I would say to you though is, I think we've ended up in a spot where Epic is a partner WhiteWater as a partner, we all think we've ended up in a pretty good spot. But that level of detail is something that we're not going to disclose.\nUjjwal Pradhan: And last one, if I may. Do you have two short-term floating-rate notes issued last year, a totaling to a $2 billion callable beginning in September of this year? Would you consider rolling them over to a longer maturity and given where the market is today, if that it makes sense?\nPam Beall: Yes, Ujjwal, its Pam. So we continuously evaluate opportunities in the market to refinance near term maturities and reloading our revolving credit facility. So we look closely at that all the time and look to take advantage of opportunities when they present themselves.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tristan Richardson from Truist Securities. Your line is open, sir.\nTristan Richardson: Really appreciate all the commentary on RLFT with all the moving parts. I guess just a quick clarification question on, maybe on a follow-up to a previous question on those 7-Eleven fuel supply agreement. Does that fuel supply agreement sit at MPLX and should we think that roughly $1.4 billion is not necessarily changed by the terms of that new supply agreement or just any thoughts there?\nPam Beall: Yes. Tristan, this is Pam. So all the agreements for fuel distribution exist between MPC and MPLX. MPLX has no agreements directly with Speedway. So all of the agreements that are in place today, we - will continue to be between MPC and MPLX. And as Mike highlighted earlier, to the extent that - there is an opportunity to expand volumes to supply additional locations for 7-Eleven. There could be a potential for the MPLX assets to be even more highly utilized. But again, that would be between MPC and MPLX.\nTristan Richardson: And then just a follow-up. Really just a question on G&P. I think on the parent call, you mentioned long-term initiatives around logistics and G&P with Mike. I think you made a reference to an emphasis on getting to a portfolio that protects downside. Can you talk about what kind of initiatives that could be specific to G&P as it relates to that comment? Is it adding volume protections? Are there existing volume protections in G&P that could be expanded or maybe just some context there?\nMike Hennigan: Hi Tristan. The context for G&P applies to all of our assets, whether it's L&S or refining, G&P, et cetera. It's just that, we want to go through a pretty deliberate evaluation of the portfolio and really stress test, where we think these assets will be for the long term and whether they can contribute free cash flow generation? I mean prior to COVID, I would tell you, every meeting we were at, we would get asked the question particularly about the Northeast G&P. And our position was that, we believe that area to be sustaining and/or slight growth. Now that we're post COVID and I think you've heard from a lot of the producers. We think something very similar that so pre and post in that area hasn't changed a lot of our outlook. But all of the other assets and I've said this probably a lot, we're in 8 basins at this point. And we just want to do a pretty thorough look at all those. At the same time, some people have asked us, so we're going to divest assets, et cetera. And our answer is typically been the current environment is not very conducive to divesting G&P assets with the pressure on gas prices where they are today. So the line that I've used many times is, we're not going to give the assets away, we're going to see it, if they have other values to other players. In the meantime, the portfolio will be kicking off free cash. I mean, we've tried to put ourselves in a position capital wise that all of our assets will be kicking off of free cash. So that we are not in a must do environment for any issues. So the balance sheet is strong, the earnings profile, I hope people got to see is stable, especially in this pretty tough quarter. And at the same time, we're going to continue to evaluate all the assets going forward and applies to G&P as well as L&S and all the other assets that we have.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Harry Mateer from Barclays. Your line is open.\nHarry Mateer: First one just on leverage, I know the partnership as long targeted debt to EBITDA of around 4 times. I'm just wondering with the broader midstream industry, generally pulling leverage target lower, has anything changed in your mind about that 4 times leverage number being the right one for the partnership? Or are you may be thinking about migrating that lower over time, perhaps even as a way to help maintain the investment grade profile at the parent company, when you look at consolidated metrics.\nPam Beall: Yes, Harry, this is Pam. And yes, we have been right around 4 times and we have also indicated that over the long-term, we think 3.5 times would be a target for us. And so, as we move into a free cash flow generation situation after funding both capital and distributions. One of the increased financial flexibility opportunities we would have, would be to reduce debt. So it's something that clearly we're seeing across the midstream space, directionally lowering debt to provide more financial flexibility and so that's what we would have in mind.\nMike Hennigan: And Harry, it's Mike. I'll just add, our priority is to get to the free cash flow, which gives us the optionality and flexibility, as Pam stated, to make a decision whether it's debt or whether it's unit buyback or other choices. But so - our priority is to make sure that we get ourselves in that position, where we're generating cash beyond the distribution and beyond the capital need.\nHarry Mateer: Thanks for that. And then just as my follow-up. So on the free cash flow. I mean, how should we think about the target to be free cash flow positive after distributions next year? Is that something that you envision as being more of a corporate objective, year-after-year or more just a short-term target and there could be some flexibility around that or is it going to be something it's more durable?\nMike Hennigan: Right now, I would say it's more durable. At the end of the day, the market has continue to evolve and in today's marketplace generating free cash flow, I think is what investors are looking for. And as I just mentioned, not to repeat myself that will put us in a nice flexibility position. So yes, so we're not thinking of it as a short-term entity, we're thinking of it is a, a longer-term structural change that's occurred in the midstream space.\nKristina Kazarian: Great. And with that, Mike, we have no more questions. So thank you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in MPLX. Should you have additional questions or would you like clarification on any of the topics discussed this morning, members of our team will be available to help out after this call. Thank you so much and operator, I'll turn it back to you.\nOperator: Yes, ma'am. Today's call has concluded. You may disconnect at this time and thank you for joining and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Pam Beall",
            "content": "Thanks Mike. Turning to Slide 7. I'm pleased to report that MPLX delivered second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $1.2 billion, and distributable cash flow of $1 billion, which provided continued strong distribution coverage of 1.39 times and leverage of 4.1 times. As Mike previously mentioned, the progress we made on the proactive steps we announced in May helped to offset some of the headwinds we faced during the quarter, allowing us to continue to generate strong cash flow and adjusted EBITDA. Slide 8 shows the second quarter Logistics and Storage business segment highlights. A decrease in both pipeline and terminal throughput for the quarter versus the second quarter of 2019 was primarily driven by lower refinery utilization at MPC's refineries. During the second quarter, progress continued on the Permian long-haul pipeline projects in which we have equity interest. The Wink-to-Webster crude oil pipeline and the Whistler natural gas pipeline are expected to be placed in service in the first half and the second half of 2021 respectively. During the quarter MPLX, along with its partners secured project financing for the Whistler pipeline which was already factored into our reduced 2020 growth capital targets. And while we noted last quarter, we were no longer pursuing the construction of the BANGL pipeline, we did indicate that we continued to look for ways to support our producer customers. To that end, we formed a joint venture with WhiteWater Midstream and West Texas Gas to provide NGL takeaway capacity from MPLX and West Texas Gas processing plants in the Permian to Sweeny, Texas. This optimized approach largely utilizes existing infrastructure with limited initial construction. MPLX is contributing existing pipeline laterals and equipment to the joint venture which differs new capital to the out-years. As part of this solution, the joint venture has entered into capacity arrangements from Orla to Sweeny, including an agreement with EPIC Y-Grade Pipeline LP to own an undivided joint interest in EPIC's existing 24-inch NGL pipeline from West Texas to the Eagle Ford basin. Additionally, on July 31, we entered into a redemption agreement with MPC in which we agreed to transfer our Western wholesale distribution business that we acquired as a result of the ANDX acquisition to MPC in exchange for the redemption of $340 million MPLX common units held by MPC. The Western wholesale distribution business was quite different from the fuel distribution business dropped down to MPLX from MPC in 2018. And this transaction allows us to simplify MPLX the only one fuels distribution model. Finally, I wanted to share some comments around some of our Bakken assets including our roughly 9% indirect interest in the DAPL pipeline and our full ownership interest of Tesoro High Plains Pipeline System. Both of these systems are currently facing regulatory and legal challenges. As a small indirect owner of the DAPL pipeline, energy transfer, not MPLX is representing the combined interests of the owners in this situation. With regards to the High Plains Pipeline System, we have appealed the Bureau of Indian Affairs trespass determination, which triggers an automatic stay. During this stay, the pipeline would remain operational. In the event of both of these pipelines were to be impacted for any period of time, we estimate a maximum annual EBITDA impact to MPLX of less than $100 million. As we work through these processes, we are committed to respecting the rights of the indigenous groups. Now turning to Slide 9, we provide second quarter Gathering and Processing business segment highlights. Overall, Gathered and Processed volumes decreased versus the second quarter of 2019, primarily due to producer customer production curtailments and shut-ins, driven by low commodity prices. In the Marcellus and Utica, gathered volumes decreased 1% versus the same period last year, primarily due to weakness in wet gas gathering in the Utica as some producers shifted production to dry gas. In the Marcellus, gathered volumes increased 9%. Process volumes increased 1% versus the same quarter last year, primarily due to the Marcellus, which remained relatively strong where processed volumes increased 6% higher than the second quarter last year. Fractionated volumes increased over the second quarter of 2019, primarily driven by Sherwood fractionator that came online in the fourth quarter last year. Throughout the year, we have discussion with our producer customers about their processing needs, as well as their production expectations with a goal of bringing on new assets just in time to meet their needs. As a result, during the quarter, we shifted the completion of both Smithburg 1 and Preakness processing plants in the Marcellus and Delaware basins respectively from the second quarter of 2020 to 2021. The Hopedale 5 fractionator is still expected to be placed in service in the third quarter this year. Slide 10, moving to our financial highlights slide. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.2 billion for the second quarter of 2020. Total L&S segment adjusted EBITDA was $839 million, while the G&P segment contributed $388 million in adjusted EBITDA. For the quarter, we generated approximately $1 billion of distributable cash flow and will return for the quarter, $746 million to our MPLX unitholders. This provides distribution coverage of 1.39 times and resulted in $280 million of retained distributable cash flow. The bridge on slide 11 shows the change in adjusted EBITDA from the second quarter of 2019 to the second quarter of 2020. The Logistics and Storage segment increased $18 million year-over-year. While we experienced lower pipeline and terminal volumes, resulting from lower utilization at MPC refineries, this impact was more than offset by lower operating and project expenses, as well as an increase in earnings from additional marine equipment placed in service. The Gathering and Processing segment decreased $40 million, primarily driven by lower weighted average NGL prices and lower gathered and processed volumes, due to production curtailments and shut-ins. On a sequential basis, second quarter EBITDA for both Logistics and Storage, and Gathering and Processing segments was down due to lower demand caused by COVID pandemic and lower commodity prices resulting in producer curtailments, respectively. Slide 12 provides a summary of key financial highlights and select balance sheet information. We ended the quarter with leverage of 4.1 times and ample liquidity with approximately $2.7 billion available on our bank revolver and $1.5 billion available on our intercompany facility with MPC. As we look forward, we expect to continue to grow free cash flow by allocating capital investments to the highest return projects with a long-term strategic focus. This disciplined capital investment approach should allow us to increase our financial flexibility and distribution coverage, while maintaining an investment grade credit profile. Now, let me turn the call back over to Kristina. Yes, Shneur. It's Pam and I'll take that question. So obviously there were some systems during the second quarter that we were running below minimums. And candidly, since we formed MPLX, we have had a few pipelines, systems where we have had a deficiency payments and you can see that reflected in the deferred revenue that we report in our earnings and in our Qs and Ks. So we've always had a little bit of some systems haven't run as we originally expected they would. But overall, I would say that, we would expect that the volumes would be picking back up here in the third quarter, reflecting a rebound in demand from the trough that we all experienced probably around April. So we would expect there to be a fewer volumes running at a minimum volume commitments. I will say that, on the legacy terminal side of the MPLX business, we have protection at pretty high levels. So, if we did run - continue to run below MVCs, we have good protection there. But the majority of the pipelines, even in the second quarter did not hit the MVCs. Yes, Shneur, this is something that we really had contemplated as a kind of a cleanup matter once we close that combination with ANDX and we didn't pursue it, because of the pending midstream committee review. So, just to refresh for those who may not be as familiar with this business. It was a business that was dropped down from Western Refining into Western Logistics in 2014, it was about $40 million of annual EBITDA run rate. And so that, there wasn't much growth if any in that business. That was the run rate, so that's what you should use for your estimates about how that would impact MPLX. Yes, Jeremy. This is Pam. So with respect to the Gallup refinery, we expect no impact to MPLX in terms of the EBITDA as we'll continue to operate the assets in and around the refinery. So a significant portion of the earnings related to Gallup for MPLX come from crude gathering and pipeline system that fed the refinery. But to the extent that crude is not going to Gallup refinery, it will go on the Tex New Mex logistics system down to Midland. So we really expect to see no impact to EBITDA as MPC could continue to supply that market with refined products with other means than running the refinery. And then as it relates to the Martinez refinery out - refinery, MPC will obviously be evaluating the assets that could continue to be used there in support of the renewable diesel conversion that it's valuating and we'll have a much better idea over the long term, how those logistics assets around that asset might be utilized. But in the meantime, there are agreements in place do call for continuation of minimum volume commitments that continue over an extended period of time. So assets were dropped in at different times, there are different length of times for these minimum volume commitment contracts. But some of them extend out to 2026. So we would expect in the near term, no impact again on the cash flows and earnings for MPLX. Yes, Kristina this is Pam. So the number of units redeemed was 18,582,088. And just so you know how we arrived at that, it was based on the 10 trading days ending at market close on July 27. Yes, Ujjwal. The system itself, aside from the area in dispute, could continue to run and we could continue to maintain a very large share of the EBITDA that we enjoy from that system today. So we think it is potentially - there is a potential that we would have very minimal impact, just from that particular situation itself. Yes, Ujjwal, its Pam. So we continuously evaluate opportunities in the market to refinance near term maturities and reloading our revolving credit facility. So we look closely at that all the time and look to take advantage of opportunities when they present themselves. Yes. Tristan, this is Pam. So all the agreements for fuel distribution exist between MPC and MPLX. MPLX has no agreements directly with Speedway. So all of the agreements that are in place today, we - will continue to be between MPC and MPLX. And as Mike highlighted earlier, to the extent that - there is an opportunity to expand volumes to supply additional locations for 7-Eleven. There could be a potential for the MPLX assets to be even more highly utilized. But again, that would be between MPC and MPLX. Yes, Harry, this is Pam. And yes, we have been right around 4 times and we have also indicated that over the long-term, we think 3.5 times would be a target for us. And so, as we move into a free cash flow generation situation after funding both capital and distributions. One of the increased financial flexibility opportunities we would have, would be to reduce debt. So it's something that clearly we're seeing across the midstream space, directionally lowering debt to provide more financial flexibility and so that's what we would have in mind."

            "name": "Greg Floerke",
            "content": "Now, Mike, really appreciate that confirmation there. Maybe I've a few quick follow-ups here. The environment is obviously uncertain, but I think things have definitely changed, where they were back in April and in early May. I was wondering like given where current refinery utilizations are today and where congestion is today, how close is MPLX to - from a pipeline perspective to be at or running above the minimum volume commitment levels? Yes. Thanks, Mike. Can you hear me? Okay. Yes, we have seen some of the curtailed shut-in wells come back online as we've moved out of second quarter, but we're actually through second quarter and into July. We were still close to 90% utilization in the Marcellus and not as much curtailment there, probably more in the West, in the crude producing areas and associated gas. But as crude prices improved, we did - we have seen some of those wells come back online and the gas along with it. So yes, generally the dip was in April on into May and it's gradually improved since then. Well, first quarter. I think it's generally getting back to levels that were there and probably not completely in all areas yet, but on a positive direction."
        },
        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Mike Hennigan",
            "content": "Thanks Kristina. Good morning and thank you for joining our call. As we expected, the impacts on COVID-19 pandemic continue to create challenges across our business during the second quarter specifically, significantly lower levels of demand for crude and refined products decreased the need for our Logistics and Storage's services, while production curtailments in response to lower prices, pressure the Gathering and Processing systems we operate. In response to this challenging business environment, on our last quarter call, we announced proactive steps to reduce our forecast to 2020 capital spending target by over $700 million and operating expenses by approximately $200 million. The progress we made on the proactive steps we announced in May helped to offset some of the challenges we faced during the quarter. We believe that the underlying business coupled with the steps we have taken have positioned us to continue to generate stable level of EBITDA to support our goal of achieving positive free cash flow after capital investments and distributions for 2021. Turning to Slide 4. Our performance during the second quarter highlights the stability of our underlying businesses, the quality of our contracts and the execution on our identified steps to help offset what we knew would be a challenging environment. Earlier today, we reported adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2020 of $1.2 billion, relatively flat versus our first quarter 2020 EBITDA. Our second quarter EBITDA exhibited less volatility than we estimated primarily due to operating expense reductions that we realized earlier than anticipated in the L&S business, whereas our G&P segment performed roughly as expected. Turning to Slide 5. The other key element of our path to positive free cash has continued capital spending discipline. The process of high grading our capital portfolio has been underway since the combination with ANDX last year, with a growth capital target progressively reduced from about $2.6 billion when the combination closed to our latest 2020 target of about $900 million announced last quarter. We are on track to achieve our 2020 reduction of over $700 million as we continue to focus on opportunities with the most attractive returns. Overall, we continue to target about 75% of our growth capital target towards the L&S side of the business and this growth capital spend target remains primarily related to L&S projects that were already underway including the Wink-to-Webster crude oil pipeline and the Whistler natural gas pipeline. Capital spend on the G&P side continues to be adjusted dynamically to ensure we are bringing infrastructure online just in time to meet our producer customer needs especially in the current environment. Turning to Slide 6. I want to take a moment to comment on sustainability and our role as an industry leader. We recently published our 2019 sustainability report highlights of which can be found on Slide 20 in the appendix. The report is greatly expanded this year in terms of content and disclosure, and outlines our commitment to provide information consistent with the many reporting frameworks that are influential in the investment community. As such, the report expands upon our recent efforts and environmental, social and governance aspects of our business. I want to take a moment to touch on recent events that have impacted many places where we live and work. We are committed to promoting diversity and inclusion in our workplace, and in the communities in which we operate. I firmly believe that we all have a role and a responsibility in creating shared value in our communities. Understanding each other starts with meaningful dialogue and ultimately that's how we'll make progress together. Now let me turn the call over to Pam to discuss our quarterly results. Thanks, Shneur. This is Mike and thanks for asking that question. Because one of the things I wanted to try and clear up a little bit. There was a little bit of confusion after the last quarter on some of my comments. So I appreciate you asking that. So first of all, let me state obviously, we've reaffirmed the distribution at the current level. And then just to remind people, part of my own style, for those who work with me in the past is, I'd like to ask and get a lot of feedback and perspectives from people. When we have our individual meetings or one-on-ones and then I try and feed that back to the market. So everybody gets to see the lens in which we're view things. So, I want to be more clear today that the distribution is an important part of MPLX's value proposition. So in a period when the refining business is facing significant demand challenges, it's also a very important source of capital that MPC relies on as well. So we have not had the external pressures that some of our peers have had - who have had - who have made changes to their distribution. So I think this quarter especially shows how MPLX has stability and its EBITDA profile. And so in that regard, we announced again our decision to support the return of capital to unitholders through the distribution. So we feel very strongly that a return of capital is the high priority for us and that distribution staying same despite some of the challenges that others have had. I think is hopefully showing you some of the stability that we think is in our business. So with that said, sorry, it was confusing to people last time. But we obviously, feel strongly about it and have reaffirmed our distribution at the current level. Good morning, Jeremy. Greg, do you want to handle that one? Yes. Christine, this is Mike. So on the previous MPC call, we told investors that we have two priorities for use of proceeds with the Speedway sale. One is balance sheet and our leverage metrics and the second is return of capital back to shareholders. So I got asked the same question there. And I'll just remind you and others that, we did a pretty exhaustive study on the midstream space with questions similar to what you're asking as far as roll up or bring in our LFT back or anything along those lines. And we really came that a conclusion that, because MPC receives a very robust distribution with its ownership percentage in MPLX at $1.8 billion, it didn't make a lot of sense to buy in a cash flow stream that we were already getting via the distribution. So our conclusion at the midstream study, knowing that it would be north of $10 billion transaction was, such that we didn't think that, that was a value creator for either entity and that Marathon at the parent level would be much better served by returning that capital to MPC shareholders. So that's our priority right now and we also disclosed that over the next 5, 6 months, whatever it takes to get the close. Once we get through it, we're going to be doing a pretty exhaustive study of as to what's the best efficient and effective means to deal with that use of proceeds. Hopefully that helps. Yes, good question, Christine. So 7.7 is based on 95% of traditional Speedway volumes and that's for the entire 15 years. So we got a lot of security for MPLX on the volume commitment there, a slight flexibility, but 95% for sure. And then we also have a separate agreement, a separate supply agreement to provide 7-Eleven with their growth profile. So they have a stated position of 20,000 stores that they want to own. So we know there's a lot of growth potential with 7-Eleven. So we actually have two separate agreements. One is to maintain that base Speedway supply and two is to open up the potential for increased value for MPLX going forward. I also want to comment that, the integration value that MPC sees, translates directly to MPLX as we will be using MPLX assets, terminals, pipes, et cetera, et cetera. We're going to continue to be the supplier of transportation logistics, so trucking all of that comes together. So that was an important parameter in our commercial discussions that we wanted to maintain that relationship going forward and then hopefully there is upside to it as 7-Eleven grows. How is that for an estimate to see? Yes, sure. Spiro, so first off, the initiatives at MPC, some of them are directly apply at MPLX. We are trying to lower our cost structure in both entities, as a way to be more competitive going forward. And last quarter we had said about $200 million of expense reduction planned for MPLX in 2020. And at the time, I said, some of that is things that we know we can count on and some of it may be deferral. But since our last talk last quarter, we feel very confident now that that's more of a structural change. So we are committing that for 2020, we believe that's going to be a long-term impact. So in those areas, I think you're going to see us heavily concentrate similarly on trying to lower cost structure. As far as the discussion between the entities, I'm a big believer in win-wins for both MPLX and MPC and we try and achieve both entities coming out in a better position than going into it. So there is a strong integration value set that provides opportunities for both entities. And not only do we want to continue to capture on that, we want to take that to another level. So if anything that one of my takeaways from the last couple of months is, we have an ability to do a better job of integrating the relationship between the two such that it's a win-win for both. In areas where there is counter views. I mean, obviously, we're going to try and do what's best for each entity standalone. We were very respectful of the two separate entities. So as Pam said, MPC is making a decision on Martinez that could have an impact on MPLX, but we'll have to see how that plays out. We're still pretty confident that the terminaling and logistics assets is an asset for Martinez, so we know that, that's an important part of the go forward valuation for Martinez. But we constantly trying to evaluate both separately and together and try and come out with the win that achieves a good outcome for both. Yes. So I'll give a few comments and then I'll let Tim, go into a little more detail. But the first couple of comments is, obviously we don't give individual capital or return. So it is in our data that we've given to date and it has been. So throughout all of this, we always are trying our best to disclose where we think our total capital is. And as I said last quarter and we had known for some time, but we finally got to the point last quarter where the market is kind of ahead of us. So we weren't going to do the big capital outlay that was originally contemplated for Bango. So, Tim, and his team have worked diligently to get us to a really good win-win solution for producers to have takeaway, solution for us that we can do that in a very capital efficient way. And ultimately, I hope you're going to continue to see this. Our return metrics, where we're going to be very strict on making sure that we get good returns on our projects. So then it's - why don't you give us a little bit more detail, so they can understand what's happened there. I just want to add, Tim and the rest of the partners did a really good job of staying focused on providing the customer service that was needed for the producers and being very innovative and creative in the way that the project has evolved. So pretty proud of the outcome here, pretty capital efficient, at the same time providing pretty good service for growth in the Permian. I just wanted to add to Pam's remarks, just so you're clear. So we did file an appeal, so which triggers and automatic stay. So the current situation stays exactly the way it is. What Pam was trying to state is, if for whatever reason and we think the likelihood is low, but it for whatever reason we were to shut down, we're still going to maintain about 75% of the EBITDA on that system. So - but the downside to it is, is pretty low and at the same time, we're confident that we can get a resolution that works for ourselves as well as the counterparties. So, Ujjwal. That type of detail we typically wouldn't go into. What I would say to you though is, I think we've ended up in a spot where Epic is a partner WhiteWater as a partner, we all think we've ended up in a pretty good spot. But that level of detail is something that we're not going to disclose. Hi Tristan. The context for G&P applies to all of our assets, whether it's L&S or refining, G&P, et cetera. It's just that, we want to go through a pretty deliberate evaluation of the portfolio and really stress test, where we think these assets will be for the long term and whether they can contribute free cash flow generation? I mean prior to COVID, I would tell you, every meeting we were at, we would get asked the question particularly about the Northeast G&P. And our position was that, we believe that area to be sustaining and/or slight growth. Now that we're post COVID and I think you've heard from a lot of the producers. We think something very similar that so pre and post in that area hasn't changed a lot of our outlook. But all of the other assets and I've said this probably a lot, we're in 8 basins at this point. And we just want to do a pretty thorough look at all those. At the same time, some people have asked us, so we're going to divest assets, et cetera. And our answer is typically been the current environment is not very conducive to divesting G&P assets with the pressure on gas prices where they are today. So the line that I've used many times is, we're not going to give the assets away, we're going to see it, if they have other values to other players. In the meantime, the portfolio will be kicking off free cash. I mean, we've tried to put ourselves in a position capital wise that all of our assets will be kicking off of free cash. So that we are not in a must do environment for any issues. So the balance sheet is strong, the earnings profile, I hope people got to see is stable, especially in this pretty tough quarter. And at the same time, we're going to continue to evaluate all the assets going forward and applies to G&P as well as L&S and all the other assets that we have. And Harry, it's Mike. I'll just add, our priority is to get to the free cash flow, which gives us the optionality and flexibility, as Pam stated, to make a decision whether it's debt or whether it's unit buyback or other choices. But so - our priority is to make sure that we get ourselves in that position, where we're generating cash beyond the distribution and beyond the capital need. Right now, I would say it's more durable. At the end of the day, the market has continue to evolve and in today's marketplace generating free cash flow, I think is what investors are looking for. And as I just mentioned, not to repeat myself that will put us in a nice flexibility position. So yes, so we're not thinking of it as a short-term entity, we're thinking of it is a, a longer-term structural change that's occurred in the midstream space."

            "content": "As was stated, the - it's very capital efficient program that we're putting together here. I think your question first off was about the timing. Their construction of the pipeline laterals from the MPLX and WTG processing plants and other initial construction are expected to be complete by the fourth quarter of 2021. Now a little bit about the joint venture itself, the JV will initially own a 30% undivided joint interest in the portion of the Epic NGL pipeline. We do have the ability to grow that ownership over time, as the basin recovers. So specifically, the JV will own a share of the Epic 24-inch from Benedum to Gardendale, Texas. Beyond that we have the construction of the laterals that connect up to the various points on the Epic pipeline and then we follow that up with some other various capacity arrangements that get us to the Sweeny fractionation complex. So all in all, a win-win for the JV and our - and the other partners in the deal."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.\nKristina Kazarian: Good morning and welcome to the MPLX first quarter 2020 earnings webcast and conference call. The synchronized slides that accompany this call can be found on mplx.com under the Investors tab. On the call today are Mike Hennigan, President and CEO; Pam Beall, Chief Financial Officer; and other members of the management team. We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statements and non-GAAP disclaimer on Slide 2. It\u2019s a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the call and during the question-and-answer session that follows. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as our filings with the SEC. Now, I\u2019ll turn over this call over to Mike Hennigan for opening remarks.\nMike Hennigan: Thanks, Kristina. Good morning and thank you for joining our call. Let me start by sharing with you some of the steps that we've taken in response to the current COVID-19 crisis, which has affected all of us and has impacted the demand for hydrocarbons for which we provide services. To better protect the health and safety of everyone, in mid-March, we asked many employees to start working from home, so that those employees who must be onsite to run our operations could have a space they need to properly social distance and implement other protective measures. I appreciate the professionalism and flexibility with which all our employees have approached this change to how we work and I especially want to thank those employees who continue to run our business every day. Thank you for the commitment you've shown to our company and those who rely on essential products and services we provide by continuing to ensure this important work is done safely and with excellence. Second, we are grateful for everyone working on the frontlines of this pandemic. This is quarter to support the efforts of our healthcare workers across the country, our sponsor MPC donated 575,000 N95 masks to 46 different hospitals across the country. We will share some of MPLX's global support efforts later in the call. As we progressed through the quarter, we worked to adapt to this very dynamic situation created by COVID-19 pandemic and oil price tensions. MPLX had a relatively strong quarter as the impact of demand destruction began to impact the business in late March. Earlier today, we reported adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2020 of $1.3 billion, which is consistent with the prior year first quarter. In this environment, we are taking proactive steps to reduce our 2020 capital target by over $700 million and forecasted annual operating expenses by approximately $200 million.  You may recall that the process of high grading our capital portfolio has been underway since the combination with ANDX last year. When the combination closed, our initial 2020 growth plan was $2.6 billion. On our third quarter 2019 earnings call, we announced to reduce target to approximately $2 billion. Last quarter, we announced that we had identified additional opportunities to further streamline our growth capital expenditures, focusing on the most attractive returns, reducing our growth target to $1.5 billion. Today, we announced that we are reducing our 2020 growth capital spending by over $600 million to approximately $900 million. Our 2020 growth capital spend target is now primarily related to projects that are already underway, including the Wink-to-Webster crude oil pipeline, the Whistler natural gas pipeline and the Mt. Airy Terminal expansion. Additionally, the original BANGL project scope is no longer being pursued. Instead, we are working with others to optimize existing pipeline capacity, while continuing to meet producers\u2019 needs for flow assurance and future growth. Also, the associated fractionation capacity and export facility have been deferred. We also announced that we are reducing our 2020 net maintenance capital target by about $100 million to approximately $150 million. Looking forward, we are maintaining our goal to achieve positive free cash flow, net of both capital investments and distributions in 2021 and highlight that plan on Slide 4. This inflection is expected to be achieved through a combination of continued annual earnings growth and the high grading of our growth capital plan. As a result, we believe that we will be positioned to broaden our value creation options and enhance our long-term financial flexibility. Turning to Slide 5: Given the current business environment, we've been getting many questions on the security and stability of our cash flows in both of our business segments. Our Logistics and Storage segment made up approximately two-thirds of our 2019 EBITDA. The largest part of our L&S business was MPC's Refining Logistics and Fuels Distribution or RLFD, which had a combined EBIT of approximately $1.4 billion. This combined RLFD the business has a combination of fee-for-capacity and highly stable service fees with minimum volume commitments.  Similar to RLFD, our terminals and marine businesses are primarily fee-for-capacity and highly stable service fees with minimum volume commitments. The remainder of our L&S business with MPC includes crude and refined product pipelines and certain equity method investments. Our crude and refined product pipelines are backed by substantial MVCs and MPC represents approximately 84% of our 2019 volumes. Turning to Slide 6: We provide a closer look at the characteristics of our Gathering and Processing or G&P segment. G&P represents the remaining one-third of MPLX's 2019 EBITDA. The Marcellus is our largest region within G&P, approximately 74% of the processing capacity in the Marcellus is backed by MVCs. Processing capacity in our Utica and Southern Appalachia regions is backed by 27% and 24% MVCs respectively, percentage of Southwest and Mid-Con region processing capabilities backed by MVCs vary. Our key producer customers have significant hedging programs in place in 2020 and 2021. In addition, last week, our largest public customers announced that their 2020 production plans are being maintained as well as additional measures to improve their balance sheets and liquidity in the current environment. The silver lining to the expected decline in Permian crude and associated gas production is the support it provides to the price of natural gas, especially for the Northeast on-purpose gas producers. The natural gas strip is also providing an opportunity for producers to further hedge their production into the future. Turning to Slide 7: MPLX has always been a responsible corporate leader. I wanted to take a moment to comment on how this will remain an ongoing focus and highlight some significant recent achievements. In 2019, we earned EPA's Energy STAR Challenge Award at several of our terminals. We also now have 32 sites that have been recognized under OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program or VPP. VPP recognizes employers and workers who have implemented effective safety and health management systems and maintained injury and illness rates below National Bureau of Labor Statistic averages for their respective industries.  As I mentioned earlier, the COVID-19 pandemic has created unprecedented challenges in the personal and professional lives of many. It also has created an opportunity for us to help our communities in unique ways. In El Paso, Texas, our transport fleet transported an emergency mobile clinic to the El Paso Airport to provide medical relief for the area. Marathon Pipe Line also donated meals to first responders and staff at local nursing homes throughout its operating regions. Again, we are grateful for everyone working on the frontlines of this pandemic and are proud to do our part by contributing supplies to organizations that are supporting those in crisis. Now, let me turn the call over to Pam to discuss our first quarter 2020 operational and financial results.\nPam Beall : Thanks, Mike. I'm pleased to report that MPLX delivered strong results for the first quarter with adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion and distributable cash flow of $1 billion, which provided continued strong distribution coverage of 1.44 times and leverage of 4.1 times. As Mike mentioned previously, we announced proactive steps to reduce our capital spend and forecasted operating expenses to offset the expected impact of lower volumes through our assets caused by the COVID-19 business environment. Slide 9 provides first quarter Logistics and Storage business segment highlights. Total pipeline throughputs averaged 5.1 million barrels per day, an increase of approximately 2% versus the first quarter of 2019. Terminal throughput averaged 3 million barrels per day for the quarter, a decrease of 8% versus the first quarter of 2019. This decrease was primarily attributable to planned and unplanned downtime at some of MPC's refineries. During the first quarter, the Wink-to-Webster Permian crude oil pipeline project, in which we have a 15% equity ownership interest of the joint venture continues to progress. We continue to expect that the pipeline system, of which 100% of the contractable capacity is committed with MVCs, will be placed in service in the first half of 2021. The Whistler natural gas pipeline project also continued to progress. The 2 Bcf per day capacity project, which is more than 90% committed with MVCs, is expected to start up in the second half of 2021. Slide 10 provides first quarter Gathering and Processing business segment highlights. Gathered volumes averaged 5.8 billion cubic feet per day, representing a 3% decrease versus the first quarter of 2019. This decrease was primarily driven by unplanned downtime related to a producer customer in our Utica dry gas region. Marcellus and Utica gathered volumes averaged 3.2 billion cubic feet per day, a 5% increase versus the same period last year. Quarterly processed volumes increased 3% versus the same quarter last year to 8.8 billion cubic feet per day, primarily driven by volume growth at our Sherwood complex, which had two new plants placed in service in the fourth quarter of 2019. Marcellus and Utica processed volumes averaged 6.2 billion cubic feet per day a 3% increase over the first quarter of 2019. Fractionated volumes averaged 553,000 barrels per day, representing an 8% increase over the first quarter of 2019, primarily driven by the Sherwood fractionator that came online in the fourth quarter last year. Marcellus and Utica fractionated volumes increased 6% over the first quarter of 2019 to an average of 490,000 barrels per day.  Turning to our financial highlights on Slide 11: Adjusted EBITDA was $1.3 billion for the first quarter of 2020. The Logistics and Storage segment adjusted EBITDA was $872 million, while the Gathering and Processing segment contributed $422 million in adjusted EBITDA. For the quarter, we generated approximately $1.1 billion of distributable cash flow, and we'll return for the quarter approximately $760 million to our MPLX unitholders. This provides distribution coverage of 1.44 times and resulted in $319 million of retained DCF. The bridge on Slide 12 shows the change in adjusted EBITDA from the first quarter of 2019 to the first quarter of 2020. The Logistics and Storage segment increased $44 million year-over-year, primarily driven by increased pipeline volumes as well as growth in the marine business. The Gathering and Processing segment decreased $13 million, primarily driven by lower weighted average NGL prices, partially offset by growth in processed and fractionated volumes from new assets placed into service over the past year. Slide 13 provides a summary of key financial highlights and select balance sheet information. We ended the quarter with a leverage ratio of 4.1 times and approximately $2.8 billion available on our resolving bank facility, and $1.5 billion available on the intercompany loan facility with MPC. As we look forward, we expect to continue to grow free cash flow by allocating capital investments to the highest return projects with a long-term strategic focus. This disciplined capital investment approach should allow us to increase our financial flexibility and distribution coverage while maintaining an investment grade credit profile. Now, let me turn the call back over to Kristina. \nKristina Kazarian: Thanks, Pam. As we open the call for questions, we ask that you limit yourself to one question plus a follow-up. We may re-prompt for additional questions as time permits. With that, we will now open the call to questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Your may go ahead.\nShneur Gershuni: Mike, first off, congratulations on your new role. I'm not sure you may want it in this environment. But nonetheless, congratulations. Maybe to start off, I was wondering if we can talk about the L&S segment kind of on a broad basis. And I do appreciate the color around the MVCs that were put in the presentation today on Slide 5. But when I sort of think about -- maybe it\u2019s hard to look at 1Q performance as we kind of think ahead given the environment. It\u2019s widely reported that refined product demand has fallen significant during the last two months. And we have seen some green shoots, week-over-week improvements, UBS Evidence Lab study kind of confirms that. But I was wondering if you can talk about how much of the Q1 EBITDA in that segment is repeatable in Q2 or said differently is protected by MVCs with both MPC and some of the third-party capacity owners?\nMike Hennigan: Hey, Shneur, good question. So, one of the things that we tried to do was give a little bit more color on the MVCs in general, since everybody has been asking around that question. Let me give you the high-level macro view on the L&S and then Pam can give even a little bit more color on the numbers. So first off, at a high level, I mean everybody is aware that demand for gasoline and diesel and jet fuels had a dramatic change as a result of the pandemic. We nominally said gasoline kind of hit a floor of around 50% reduction overall, that kind of puts it in a general average position, a little bit more on the West Coast, a little bit less in the Gulf but call it overall about 50%. We're cautiously optimistic that we're seeing a little bit of recovery, maybe 5% to 15% depending on the area, but we still have a long way to go. So, we have cautious optimism that recovery is starting to occur. At the same time, we still have 30 million barrels of light product inventory over the 5 year average and 50 million barrels of crude over the 5 year average. So, there's still a long ways to go. MPC is guiding at minimum rates continuing in the second quarter. So, the MPC system has basically cut back to about two-thirds of its capacity. So that has an impact on the L&S business, which is -- which you are asking. So, let me let Pam give you a couple more numbers that'll add to our prepared remarks, that'll give you a little bit more insight into that -- what that cost would look like in the quarter.\nPam Beall: Yes. Hi, Shneur. As Mike said, we've tried to take a stab at looking at what would be the EBITDA impact if we were at minimum volume commitments for the full quarter to give you a sense for what that might be. Now, we also tried to highlight in the slides that not all the services that are provided to MPC are subject to volume risk and MVCs. A lot of them do have fee-for-capacity and are not subject to that volume swing. But we took a stab at that and we think it'd be about $150 million hit to EBITDA for the quarter if we were at minimum volume commitments for the entire quarter. The other thing I just want to highlight, we have other sensitivities. One sensitivity that we've provided in the past consistently is the NGL price sensitivity. And that remains at about for every $0.05 change in the NGL price basket, it's about 23 million a year. And so, if you think about our first quarter, the average that we experienced was about $0.40 a gallon, and right now we're about $0.30 a gallon. So, if we held flat here in the second quarter for the full second quarter, that $0.10 change for the quarter would probably be somewhere around $11 million to $12 million for the quarter. One other thing I just wanted to highlight while we're talking about sensitivity Shneur is that curtailments. We've had questions about that from a number of investors. So, just based on the curtailments that we see at the moment, we think that could be as much as $40 million to $50 million in the quarter. So just trying to put -- we're not giving guidance for the year, we're not giving official guidance for the second quarter, but those are some sensitivities that you could use if you want to make assumptions about, if these conditions remain for the full quarter or for only part of the quarter, we thought it might be helpful to give you that data.\nShneur Gershuni: That was super helpful and really do appreciate the transparency there. Maybe as a follow-up question. You announced pretty steep CapEx reductions for 2020, far steeper than we were thinking. And you also had some comments about how you expect to be free cash flow positive after distribution in 2021, but you didn't say that about 2020. Should we just assume that you're probably cash flow neutral or close to that this year? Is there any color around how we should be thinking about that for 2020?\nMike Hennigan: Yes, Shneur, it's Mike. So, yes, it'll be obviously pretty close to your point is, on paper it could be a little bit one way or the other. We had originally said that we thought we would get there by 2021 and that was predicated on the higher capital number. So, your point is well taken. With the lower capital number, we're just going to have to see how the rest of the year plays out. Obviously as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, the situation on natural gas has improved considerably as a result of the shut-in of associated gas in the Permian, et cetera. So, one of the major changes in the capital program -- and I want to be really clear about this is the original BANGL project we are no longer pursuing. Just reminding everybody that we had FIDed Whistler and we had FIDed Wink-to-Webster, but we had not FIDed the BANGL project. But I don't want people to take away from that, that we're not committed to still servicing our producers with flow assurance. We've just changed the view of that to use some existing pipe that we're working with some other parties. So, the original scope is now what we are not pursuing, which changes the capital quite considerably. I know the market has been wondering about that for a couple quarters in a row. And we said many times that we want to make sure we have a solution for producers, at the same time, there's still a lot of interest in going to an area that's outside of Bellevue. So that's still all holds. The situation is such that the volume expectation is such that the capital requirement for the project needed to change, and that's where we're headed right at this point. So overall, we're still committed to NGL solution. However, the original scope is what we're deferring or putting to the side at this point, and we have a new scope that's included in our guidance here on the capital reduction. So, you can see a pretty significant reduction as a result of that. Hopefully that all makes sense to you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next we'll hear from Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan. You may go ahead.\nCharles Barber: This is Charlie on for Jeremy. Just following up on some of the last comments there. I understand that you're still targeting free cash flow generation in '21. Just curious if the recent down cycle, how that\u2019s kind of impacted your view on what the right level of leverage is as it relates to the 4 times that you've talked about in the past? And then kind of following on that, as you look at capital allocation next year, how that might influence how you view leverage versus buybacks?\nPam Beall: Yes, so let me just highlight one additional thought that I should have shared when Shneur asked the question about the potential impact to EBITDA. So obviously, the ability to get to free cash flow positive starts with EBITDA, and the strength of that. And so as we mentioned today, as Mike mentioned, we also have a sound $200 million of operating expense reduction, so that's going to help offset a significant portion of what we think is going to be the impact to EBITDA here in the second quarter of lower volumes across the system. So, I just wanted to get that out there too as we talk about some free cash flow. That's going to be an important element of our strategy to offset that volume impact.  But then when we think about free cash flow, there are just a few levers that we have, and certainly managing capital is one of them. And maintaining an investment grade credit profile and maintaining our distribution to our sponsor are important. So when we think about leverage, we're very comfortable where we are at 4.1 times, we would feel comfortable seeing leverage go up to a higher level, recognizing that it would not be there, permanently, we'd be bringing it back down. Over the longer term, we feel comfortable with leverage. And I think everyone in the space has been moving their leverage down, not up. And so 3.5 times to 4 times is an area that we will feel comfortable operating-in in the future.  And then when we get to that place where we have excess cash flow, which will be a nice luxury to have, we'll determine if we'll use that for additional debt reduction or if we'll return it to shareholders in the form of unit buyback. So getting a little less leverage in the whole financial system will give us that flexibility to determine how to best create value for the unitholders.\nCharles Barber: Just a second question on your CapEx program. You kind of talked through 2020. Just curious on any thoughts, high level, on 2021. I think that number was $1 billion that you put in last quarter's slide deck. Just curious if there's any thoughts there on potential deferrals?\nMike Hennigan: Yes. We haven't given a lot of color yet on where 2021 will play out as we have -- see how this pandemic continues to play itself out. Like I said, earlier, I think we have cautious optimism that we're starting to recover. But as I mentioned, there's still a long way to go here. So, right now, we're just concentrating on the 2020 plan. And then as the year progresses and we get to see how this plays out and we\u2019re -- we'll give a little bit more disclosure on where 2021 will be.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Spiro Dounis with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nSpiro Dounis: Just want to go to the Northeast, if we could. Look like you\u2019ve tabled some Northeast processing expansions. At the same time it seemed like Northeast actually has a tangible growth potential again. So I guess how are you thinking about Northeast capital allocation going forward? Have you made a decision to diversify within the basin? Or could we actually see you pivot back at some point?\nMike Hennigan: Spiro, I think the situation on gas is obviously changing quite a bit with the current reduction in associated gas. I mean we stated on many calls previously that our view was that the Northeast was still a stable amount of cash flow for us and we expect that the producer community to be stable even in the previous environment. So, obviously that hasn't changed. And if anything, it looks like it\u2019s stronger opportunity for the Northeast to maintain or slightly grow. And that's kind of been our position all along. There has been some concern about the absolute level of natural gas price and what that does to the producing community. But as everybody can see, the 2021 strip is now north of $2.75 or so. And even in the current situation, we're above $2 in the near-term. So -- but I think the situation has changed quite a bit as far as the dynamic on absolute gas price, hasn't changed our view as to what we think is occurring there. And you've heard a lot of disclosure from the producer community up there. But -- so, I think we stated all along we thought the Northeast would be a good source of cash flow for us. We thought it was going to be maintained. We have never been a believer there was going to be a large reduction in the volumes up there even prior to this situation. But obviously now that this situation has played itself out a little bit more, there is more security in gas prices and gas volumes for the Northeast.\nSpiro Dounis: Switching to Permian now just a little bit. I guess can you just update us on the broader strategy there. I know at one point the goal was to build out that super system and look everything has sort of changed now. Just curious maybe where that stands and you\u2019ve augmented that strategy? And then in that context and just thinking around the BANGL and the related fracs, it sounds like you\u2019re still moving forward with the frac side of that equation. Just curious, can you walk us through the commercial interest that was really driving those two projects to stay to some degree on the board. And can you just clarify on BANGL on the new plan there to provide a flow assurance. Are you planning to offload onto someone else's NGL pipe, are you actually talking about partnering on an existing NGL pipeline?\nMike Hennigan: Yes. So on the first part of the question, we're still committed to the Permian growth that's going to occur, albeit now slower. So one of the things that we've been trying to do in that business as you\u2019ve heard is, have discipline around the investment and where we're putting our capital and the Permian still in our view is still a good long-term area. Obviously in the short-term with crude price in the low 20s, the expectation for producers to adapt to that is not unexpected. We hesitated as you know, for several quarters we\u2019ve talked about because the capital commitment for the original scope was a much larger commitment and we wanted to have a surety of the volumes. Well, the current situation obviously has changed that. So, we're still committed to the area. But we are working with existing assets that are out there and we are still committed to an NGL solution. It just won't be the original scope that we had envisioned early on. So, I can't give you a whole lot more color there as Tim and his team is working on the commercial situation as far as putting our NGL solution together. But I do believe, like I said, all along the industrial logic for the project still holds. Now the pace of volume is such that it'll be a little slower as producers adapt to the current environment, which we certainly understand. And I would tell you that I think this is part of what we've had in our mind all along as we wanted to not commit to that full scope until we were really sure that the volume commitments would be there. What's happening in the market, obviously, and we understand it, is the volume commitments are slower and therefore the capital requirement needed to adjust. And that's kind of what we've done with the project. So still believe in the industrial logic, still believe in the projects. Overall goal, still believe in producer outlets for NGLs that also holds just the scope of how we attack it, is what's changing.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nMichael Blum: I was wondering if you could discuss the write-down you took this quarter and a little more detail -- especially since it seems like especially for your commentary that gas fundamentals are actually improving, but it seems like most of the write-down came into gas related segments. I'm wondering if you could just talk a little more about what drove the impairment?\nPam Beall: Yes, it's really, we had a triggering event, which caused us to look at the longer term forecasts. And I'll just note that in the Marcellus, primarily due to write-down of goodwill, it was not an impairment of the assets themselves. And I think that's an important thing to recognize. And so it's just with a rapid change in our stock price, the rapid change in the NGL prices, the commodity prices and the concern over the outlook for demand is what caused an examination of the value that we had, the goodwill on the balance sheet as well as in more limited cases the assets themselves.\nMichael Blum: Okay. And then I guess my second question is the $200 million of operating expense reduction. Is that -- where's that going to come from, I guess? Give me a little more detail on that and...? \nPam Beall: Yes, it's all out of the Logistics and Storage segment of the business. And it really -- we capitalized projects and we expensed some projects. And I'll just say that was one of the things that was different between ANDX and MPLX. Certain things that they would have capitalized, we expensed. So, we have certainly a large population of opportunity to spend money on projects that are expensed as opposed to capitalize. And so there's a healthy opportunity there for us to reduce the spending. And so that's what -- that relates to large number of small projects is the way to describe it. All of it was on the Logistics and Storage side of the business. \nOperator: Next we'll hear from Christine Cho with Barclays. You may go ahead.\nChristine Cho: I'm not sure if it's too early to thinking about this, but does the pandemic change how you guys are thinking about the MVCs on the legacy products and crude pipes that expire in the 2022 timeframe? What I understand those MVCs were put into place at IPO and were probably more necessary at that time to provide a stable income for the MLP. But MPLX was a lot smaller back then, whereas now it's a lot bigger, more diversified. Should we think that there's always going to be some level of MVCs or is it an option that you just let them roll off because what we're going through is a once in a 100 year event?\nPam Beall: Yes, we would expect the contracts to be -- there's an automatic extension provision in the majority of those contracts. So we would expect those to just extend in the ordinary course, the way they're structured today. \nChristine Cho: Okay. And the automatic renewals are on an annual basis?\nPam Beall : No. Five year extensions for the pipeline.\nChristine Cho: And then, I appreciate your commentary on the Northeast. But can you expand on what sort of conversations you're having with the producers in the Northeast? And how should we think about your exposure given it is a bit more wet gas focused. And while gas prices are seeing a boost, the NGL realizations are still a little bit of a question mark?\nMike Hennigan: Yes, Christine, this is Mike. So, I'll comment first off. Obviously, where crude price and NGL price is, the wet gas is under a little more pressure than is normal. The unknown question is, how quickly does crude price return to a normal place and then how much does the NGL price change as a result of the U.S. refining system running at minimum. So, our expectation is propane prices will be coming up as the situation evolves. I don't know that any of us know really at this point how long the demand recovery will be as a result of the pandemic, shelter-in-place and reopening of the economy is going to play itself out. So, I think that's an unknown. Obviously the boost of natural gas pricing is helping that. And at least in our view, in general, over the longer-term, we still believe overall that, that wet gas economics are better than dry gas economics for the long-term. You get that extra boost. Obviously to your point, in the very short-term, crude prices have gotten pretty low, propane prices have gotten pretty low. Pam has commented on what that sensitivity is for us. But assuming cautious optimism to get the economy going back in the right direction, assuming all the health situation works out fine for everybody and a recovery in the economy and a recovery in GDP, we should see a recovery in NGL prices as well. So, if anything, kind of in a weird way, the pandemic is actually more bullish for the gas/NGL recovery coming out of it once we can see to the point that we actually get out of it. I just think the real unknown is how long does that take and how long do refineries run at minimum. We've stated for MPC that we went to minimum in the back half of March and into April and we've given guidance at MPC for the second quarter that basically says we still expect the U.S. refining system to run at minimum for quite some time to draw down the inventories that were built as a loss in demand. And while that continues to occur, there's less butanes, there's propanes et cetera being produced. So, I guess we\u2019ll all have to watch to see how long it plays itself out. But I think directionally it's good for the gas business in general.\nPam Beall : Yes. Christine, I'll just add that, everybody talks about associated gas and how that's helpful for the Northeast on-purpose gas producers. But as associated gas comes down, so does associated NGLs and probably less has been written about that, but there is an expectation that there\u2019ll just be lower NGLs as a result of lower associated gas coming out of the Southwest in particular. So, that could set itself up well for a benefit for NGLs going forward, even though we're not seeing it in the price today.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ujjwal Pradhan with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nUjjwal Pradhan: Just wanted to follow-up on the -- your positive free cash flow target in 2021. Does that assume flat distributions from here on and a full recovery of L&S to 2019 levels, and assuming full recovery of refined products demand there, really trying to get at what sort of confidence level in meeting that target with the variables here?\nMike Hennigan: So it's a great question. So obviously, our distribution philosophy is a Board decision. And it's something that we debated very heavily this time because a lot of our competitors have taken advantage, if you want to call it that, to lower that distribution. We, as a Board, talked about it and we felt the right thing for us to do was to keep the distribution but hold off on the growth and leave it in a flat mode. So that's what we decided to do this time. Very much like Christine's question, this is going to be a really interesting year to see how it plays itself out. We don't have a crystal ball, nor does anybody else to know how the pandemic will play itself out, whether there'll be an extended time here. Obviously, the most important thing is, the health and safety of everybody who is involved in this. And as a result, the economy is having a reaction to that. So, it's kind of like the question that was asked earlier, we don't have a strong conviction around that 2021 capital number right at this point, just because we think there's possibilities for it to change, depending on how this plays itself out.  So -- but as a general rule, as we looked at the business, assuming full payout of distribution, and assuming getting our capital to the level that we want it to be, that's why we stated we thought that would be achieved in 2021. As you heard from Shneur\u2019s comments, depending on how this plays itself out, and what recovery you have and how the gas production occurs, we could be close to it in 2020. We'll see. So all those dynamics come into play. I'll just leave you with, our view has been that it\u2019s a goal to get there. There's a couple levers that can be pulled. And right now, our position has been we wanted to get our capital down to a level that we think develops, very strong return projects.  So hydrating the capital portfolio has been our focus and having a distribution remain flat to where it was before we thought was the right answer for now. \nPam Beall: Ujjwal, I\u2019d just like to add that, as we've looked at the market for some time now, there really hasn't been a reward for growing distributions. And at one time, there was a very high correlation between distribution growth and yield. And that relationship is fundamentally broken and a lot of people are choosing to value the midstream in a different way, EV to EBITDA instead of yield oriented measurements. But also just point out that in terms of our payout ratio, I would say that we're at the high end. So 2019, we\u2019ve about 74% of our operating cash flow paid out in the form of distribution. So if you look across the space, whether it's MLPs or C corps, we're right there at the high end.  So we don't think that investors in this environment are rewarding or really are looking for distribution growth. They're really more interested in midstream companies that have that fortressed balance sheet, that have the ability to sustain their distributions over a long period of time.\nMike Hennigan: The one thing I would add -- and we've said this many times, investor feedback is very diverse in this area. There are a lot of investors who feel strongly about maintaining the current distribution levels. There are also many who feel it's an opportune time to reduce it. As Pam stated, we are at the high end. We believe it's the right thing for us to be doing at this point. But it's an area that gets discussed with the Board constantly throughout the year.\nUjjwal Pradhan: Got it. Thanks for that, Mike. And maybe a quick follow-up to your comment earlier on the competition that we have seen between associated gas versus dry gas in the Northeast and how it could benefit in the current environment, and especially also your comment about the NGL pricing from here on. What would you expect to be the driver from here to see potential uptick in production growth in the Northeast and increase in G&P volumes in your system in the Northeast in 2020, 2021?\nMike Hennigan: Yes. Again, I think a lot of it is, depends on how the demand side of this pandemic plays itself out across the whole economy. Obviously the situation, prior to it occurring was, people questioning whether the Northeast was going to continue to maintain or grow. Our view was, it was going to at least maintain and grow a little bit. Obviously, that's bolstered now. But I think, the unknown that's still out there and we don't have this crystal ball either is, how does the U.S. economy respond to this. When does it recover back to I'll say normal levels and have the demand side of the equation. Right now is the thing that I think is still the most unknown. Our focus always is, worry about the things we can control, be conscious of the things that we don't control, but at the same time realize that we don't control some of those. So, part of it is for us to be thoughtful and watch as the demand side of this plays itself out.\nPam Beall : And let me just add that, another consideration is that the producers themselves have been and remain under a lot of pressure themselves to generate free cash flow and be a returner of capital to investors, and that's been a big focus for the Northeast producers. Those are among the largest that are our customers. And so, I think they're going to continue to live within their cash flow means and maintain or grow their production within their ability to do that. So, that's another factor. Certainly that gets supported with both higher natural gas and NGL prices, gives them the more financial flexibility, but they're also very mindful of their maturities that come up and their financial position as well. So they're taking proactive steps to make sure that they have strong balance sheets. But that's just another consideration to keep in mind as you think about portfolio growth as we go into the future.\nOperator: And our last question will come from Tristan Richardson with SunTrust. Your line is open.\nTristan Richardson: Appreciate all the commentary, particularly around the sensitivity in L&S. Just a clarifying question there. Pam, the dollar impact you talked about in L&S, is that across all of the sub segments of L&S, assuming MPC were to flow at minimums or is that just the pipeline sub segment where there's the most volumetric exposure?\nPam Beall : That is where we have the most volumetric exposure, but we have feathered in the other pieces where we think there is some volume exposure as well. Wherever we have MVCs, that's what we tried to focus on.\nTristan Richardson: Very helpful. Thank you. And then just one follow up to...\nMike Hennigan: This is Mike. I just wanted to add is, what Pam and the team has tried to do is, we generically lump the term MVC across the business and she has given some color on those numbers. But as you can imagine, every individual asset or pipeline is a lot different. It's a whole scorecard of variations. And then you go into Marine, and then you go into terminals, as well as pipeline. So we're trying our best to give as much color as we can. And then Pam and the team have kind of accumulated that all up and rolled it into one number that hopefully will give you the banks of the river as the refining systems at minimum, here's what to expect. As NGL prices move, we've given that guidance, here's what to expect. We've also given some sensitivity around gas, shut-in, et cetera. So, hopefully that answers the question that I know a lot of people have been wondering and we're trying to give you as much color on it as we can.\nTristan Richardson: Really appreciate the complexity involved there. And then I guess just the last follow-up, just around structure. I think the LP is disclosed in the past that the sponsor can reduce or adjust MVCs in certain conditions. I mean I guess just in this current environment, thinking, have any of those conditions been met where the sponsor could sort of unilaterally make adjustments to MVC agreements with the LP. Clearly, the LP and the sponsor are highly aligned, but just in this environment curious about that?\nMike Hennigan: Yes, no, I don't think so. I think that's a little bit of a misnomer in people's minds. I mean I use the football analogy that obviously we're trying to hit the 50 yard line as far as a market price. The MPC people will have one view that says it's skewed to MPLX, the MPLX people have a view that\u2019s skewed to MPC. So I feel very comfortable that we're between the 40 yard lines, hoping our best to hit the 50. So I know that's a risk that some people have questions, but I really don't think that it should get to the discussion that it does get.  And then Pam, kind of talked about, the contractual obligation and automatic renewals, et cetera, et cetera. So, MPC, obviously is integrated to MPLX via the distribution coming back. So there's a synergy relationship between MPC and MPLX. But I think sometimes people don't understand as much as it is.\nKristina Kazarian: And with that, thank you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in MPLX. Should you have additional questions or would you like clarification on topics discussed this morning, members of our team will be available to take your call. Thank you again. Operator?\nOperator: That does conclude today's conference. Thank you again for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "content": "Thanks, Mike. I'm pleased to report that MPLX delivered strong results for the first quarter with adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion and distributable cash flow of $1 billion, which provided continued strong distribution coverage of 1.44 times and leverage of 4.1 times. As Mike mentioned previously, we announced proactive steps to reduce our capital spend and forecasted operating expenses to offset the expected impact of lower volumes through our assets caused by the COVID-19 business environment. Slide 9 provides first quarter Logistics and Storage business segment highlights. Total pipeline throughputs averaged 5.1 million barrels per day, an increase of approximately 2% versus the first quarter of 2019. Terminal throughput averaged 3 million barrels per day for the quarter, a decrease of 8% versus the first quarter of 2019. This decrease was primarily attributable to planned and unplanned downtime at some of MPC's refineries. During the first quarter, the Wink-to-Webster Permian crude oil pipeline project, in which we have a 15% equity ownership interest of the joint venture continues to progress. We continue to expect that the pipeline system, of which 100% of the contractable capacity is committed with MVCs, will be placed in service in the first half of 2021. The Whistler natural gas pipeline project also continued to progress. The 2 Bcf per day capacity project, which is more than 90% committed with MVCs, is expected to start up in the second half of 2021. Slide 10 provides first quarter Gathering and Processing business segment highlights. Gathered volumes averaged 5.8 billion cubic feet per day, representing a 3% decrease versus the first quarter of 2019. This decrease was primarily driven by unplanned downtime related to a producer customer in our Utica dry gas region. Marcellus and Utica gathered volumes averaged 3.2 billion cubic feet per day, a 5% increase versus the same period last year. Quarterly processed volumes increased 3% versus the same quarter last year to 8.8 billion cubic feet per day, primarily driven by volume growth at our Sherwood complex, which had two new plants placed in service in the fourth quarter of 2019. Marcellus and Utica processed volumes averaged 6.2 billion cubic feet per day a 3% increase over the first quarter of 2019. Fractionated volumes averaged 553,000 barrels per day, representing an 8% increase over the first quarter of 2019, primarily driven by the Sherwood fractionator that came online in the fourth quarter last year. Marcellus and Utica fractionated volumes increased 6% over the first quarter of 2019 to an average of 490,000 barrels per day.  Turning to our financial highlights on Slide 11: Adjusted EBITDA was $1.3 billion for the first quarter of 2020. The Logistics and Storage segment adjusted EBITDA was $872 million, while the Gathering and Processing segment contributed $422 million in adjusted EBITDA. For the quarter, we generated approximately $1.1 billion of distributable cash flow, and we'll return for the quarter approximately $760 million to our MPLX unitholders. This provides distribution coverage of 1.44 times and resulted in $319 million of retained DCF. The bridge on Slide 12 shows the change in adjusted EBITDA from the first quarter of 2019 to the first quarter of 2020. The Logistics and Storage segment increased $44 million year-over-year, primarily driven by increased pipeline volumes as well as growth in the marine business. The Gathering and Processing segment decreased $13 million, primarily driven by lower weighted average NGL prices, partially offset by growth in processed and fractionated volumes from new assets placed into service over the past year. Slide 13 provides a summary of key financial highlights and select balance sheet information. We ended the quarter with a leverage ratio of 4.1 times and approximately $2.8 billion available on our resolving bank facility, and $1.5 billion available on the intercompany loan facility with MPC. As we look forward, we expect to continue to grow free cash flow by allocating capital investments to the highest return projects with a long-term strategic focus. This disciplined capital investment approach should allow us to increase our financial flexibility and distribution coverage while maintaining an investment grade credit profile. Now, let me turn the call back over to Kristina. Yes. Hi, Shneur. As Mike said, we've tried to take a stab at looking at what would be the EBITDA impact if we were at minimum volume commitments for the full quarter to give you a sense for what that might be. Now, we also tried to highlight in the slides that not all the services that are provided to MPC are subject to volume risk and MVCs. A lot of them do have fee-for-capacity and are not subject to that volume swing. But we took a stab at that and we think it'd be about $150 million hit to EBITDA for the quarter if we were at minimum volume commitments for the entire quarter. The other thing I just want to highlight, we have other sensitivities. One sensitivity that we've provided in the past consistently is the NGL price sensitivity. And that remains at about for every $0.05 change in the NGL price basket, it's about 23 million a year. And so, if you think about our first quarter, the average that we experienced was about $0.40 a gallon, and right now we're about $0.30 a gallon. So, if we held flat here in the second quarter for the full second quarter, that $0.10 change for the quarter would probably be somewhere around $11 million to $12 million for the quarter. One other thing I just wanted to highlight while we're talking about sensitivity Shneur is that curtailments. We've had questions about that from a number of investors. So, just based on the curtailments that we see at the moment, we think that could be as much as $40 million to $50 million in the quarter. So just trying to put -- we're not giving guidance for the year, we're not giving official guidance for the second quarter, but those are some sensitivities that you could use if you want to make assumptions about, if these conditions remain for the full quarter or for only part of the quarter, we thought it might be helpful to give you that data. Yes, so let me just highlight one additional thought that I should have shared when Shneur asked the question about the potential impact to EBITDA. So obviously, the ability to get to free cash flow positive starts with EBITDA, and the strength of that. And so as we mentioned today, as Mike mentioned, we also have a sound $200 million of operating expense reduction, so that's going to help offset a significant portion of what we think is going to be the impact to EBITDA here in the second quarter of lower volumes across the system. So, I just wanted to get that out there too as we talk about some free cash flow. That's going to be an important element of our strategy to offset that volume impact.  But then when we think about free cash flow, there are just a few levers that we have, and certainly managing capital is one of them. And maintaining an investment grade credit profile and maintaining our distribution to our sponsor are important. So when we think about leverage, we're very comfortable where we are at 4.1 times, we would feel comfortable seeing leverage go up to a higher level, recognizing that it would not be there, permanently, we'd be bringing it back down. Over the longer term, we feel comfortable with leverage. And I think everyone in the space has been moving their leverage down, not up. And so 3.5 times to 4 times is an area that we will feel comfortable operating-in in the future.  And then when we get to that place where we have excess cash flow, which will be a nice luxury to have, we'll determine if we'll use that for additional debt reduction or if we'll return it to shareholders in the form of unit buyback. So getting a little less leverage in the whole financial system will give us that flexibility to determine how to best create value for the unitholders. Yes, it's really, we had a triggering event, which caused us to look at the longer term forecasts. And I'll just note that in the Marcellus, primarily due to write-down of goodwill, it was not an impairment of the assets themselves. And I think that's an important thing to recognize. And so it's just with a rapid change in our stock price, the rapid change in the NGL prices, the commodity prices and the concern over the outlook for demand is what caused an examination of the value that we had, the goodwill on the balance sheet as well as in more limited cases the assets themselves. Yes, it's all out of the Logistics and Storage segment of the business. And it really -- we capitalized projects and we expensed some projects. And I'll just say that was one of the things that was different between ANDX and MPLX. Certain things that they would have capitalized, we expensed. So, we have certainly a large population of opportunity to spend money on projects that are expensed as opposed to capitalize. And so there's a healthy opportunity there for us to reduce the spending. And so that's what -- that relates to large number of small projects is the way to describe it. All of it was on the Logistics and Storage side of the business. Yes, we would expect the contracts to be -- there's an automatic extension provision in the majority of those contracts. So we would expect those to just extend in the ordinary course, the way they're structured today. No. Five year extensions for the pipeline. Yes. Christine, I'll just add that, everybody talks about associated gas and how that's helpful for the Northeast on-purpose gas producers. But as associated gas comes down, so does associated NGLs and probably less has been written about that, but there is an expectation that there'll just be lower NGLs as a result of lower associated gas coming out of the Southwest in particular. So, that could set itself up well for a benefit for NGLs going forward, even though we're not seeing it in the price today. Ujjwal, I'd just like to add that, as we've looked at the market for some time now, there really hasn't been a reward for growing distributions. And at one time, there was a very high correlation between distribution growth and yield. And that relationship is fundamentally broken and a lot of people are choosing to value the midstream in a different way, EV to EBITDA instead of yield oriented measurements. But also just point out that in terms of our payout ratio, I would say that we're at the high end. So 2019, we've about 74% of our operating cash flow paid out in the form of distribution.

            "name": "Mike Hennigan",
            "content": "Thanks, Kristina. Good morning and thank you for joining our call. Let me start by sharing with you some of the steps that we've taken in response to the current COVID-19 crisis, which has affected all of us and has impacted the demand for hydrocarbons for which we provide services. To better protect the health and safety of everyone, in mid-March, we asked many employees to start working from home, so that those employees who must be onsite to run our operations could have a space they need to properly social distance and implement other protective measures. I appreciate the professionalism and flexibility with which all our employees have approached this change to how we work and I especially want to thank those employees who continue to run our business every day. Thank you for the commitment you've shown to our company and those who rely on essential products and services we provide by continuing to ensure this important work is done safely and with excellence. Second, we are grateful for everyone working on the frontlines of this pandemic. This is quarter to support the efforts of our healthcare workers across the country, our sponsor MPC donated 575,000 N95 masks to 46 different hospitals across the country. We will share some of MPLX's global support efforts later in the call. As we progressed through the quarter, we worked to adapt to this very dynamic situation created by COVID-19 pandemic and oil price tensions. MPLX had a relatively strong quarter as the impact of demand destruction began to impact the business in late March. Earlier today, we reported adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2020 of $1.3 billion, which is consistent with the prior year first quarter. In this environment, we are taking proactive steps to reduce our 2020 capital target by over $700 million and forecasted annual operating expenses by approximately $200 million.  You may recall that the process of high grading our capital portfolio has been underway since the combination with ANDX last year. When the combination closed, our initial 2020 growth plan was $2.6 billion. On our third quarter 2019 earnings call, we announced to reduce target to approximately $2 billion. Last quarter, we announced that we had identified additional opportunities to further streamline our growth capital expenditures, focusing on the most attractive returns, reducing our growth target to $1.5 billion. Today, we announced that we are reducing our 2020 growth capital spending by over $600 million to approximately $900 million. Our 2020 growth capital spend target is now primarily related to projects that are already underway, including the Wink-to-Webster crude oil pipeline, the Whistler natural gas pipeline and the Mt. Airy Terminal expansion. Additionally, the original BANGL project scope is no longer being pursued. Instead, we are working with others to optimize existing pipeline capacity, while continuing to meet producers' needs for flow assurance and future growth. Also, the associated fractionation capacity and export facility have been deferred. We also announced that we are reducing our 2020 net maintenance capital target by about $100 million to approximately $150 million. Looking forward, we are maintaining our goal to achieve positive free cash flow, net of both capital investments and distributions in 2021 and highlight that plan on Slide 4. This inflection is expected to be achieved through a combination of continued annual earnings growth and the high grading of our growth capital plan. As a result, we believe that we will be positioned to broaden our value creation options and enhance our long-term financial flexibility. Turning to Slide 5: Given the current business environment, we've been getting many questions on the security and stability of our cash flows in both of our business segments. Our Logistics and Storage segment made up approximately two-thirds of our 2019 EBITDA. The largest part of our L&S business was MPC's Refining Logistics and Fuels Distribution or RLFD, which had a combined EBIT of approximately $1.4 billion. This combined RLFD the business has a combination of fee-for-capacity and highly stable service fees with minimum volume commitments.  Similar to RLFD, our terminals and marine businesses are primarily fee-for-capacity and highly stable service fees with minimum volume commitments. The remainder of our L&S business with MPC includes crude and refined product pipelines and certain equity method investments. Our crude and refined product pipelines are backed by substantial MVCs and MPC represents approximately 84% of our 2019 volumes. Turning to Slide 6: We provide a closer look at the characteristics of our Gathering and Processing or G&P segment. G&P represents the remaining one-third of MPLX's 2019 EBITDA. The Marcellus is our largest region within G&P, approximately 74% of the processing capacity in the Marcellus is backed by MVCs. Processing capacity in our Utica and Southern Appalachia regions is backed by 27% and 24% MVCs respectively, percentage of Southwest and Mid-Con region processing capabilities backed by MVCs vary. Our key producer customers have significant hedging programs in place in 2020 and 2021. In addition, last week, our largest public customers announced that their 2020 production plans are being maintained as well as additional measures to improve their balance sheets and liquidity in the current environment. The silver lining to the expected decline in Permian crude and associated gas production is the support it provides to the price of natural gas, especially for the Northeast on-purpose gas producers. The natural gas strip is also providing an opportunity for producers to further hedge their production into the future. Turning to Slide 7: MPLX has always been a responsible corporate leader. I wanted to take a moment to comment on how this will remain an ongoing focus and highlight some significant recent achievements. In 2019, we earned EPA's Energy STAR Challenge Award at several of our terminals. We also now have 32 sites that have been recognized under OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program or VPP. VPP recognizes employers and workers who have implemented effective safety and health management systems and maintained injury and illness rates below National Bureau of Labor Statistic averages for their respective industries.  As I mentioned earlier, the COVID-19 pandemic has created unprecedented challenges in the personal and professional lives of many. It also has created an opportunity for us to help our communities in unique ways. In El Paso, Texas, our transport fleet transported an emergency mobile clinic to the El Paso Airport to provide medical relief for the area. Marathon Pipe Line also donated meals to first responders and staff at local nursing homes throughout its operating regions. Again, we are grateful for everyone working on the frontlines of this pandemic and are proud to do our part by contributing supplies to organizations that are supporting those in crisis. Now, let me turn the call over to Pam to discuss our first quarter 2020 operational and financial results. Hey, Shneur, good question. So, one of the things that we tried to do was give a little bit more color on the MVCs in general, since everybody has been asking around that question. Let me give you the high-level macro view on the L&S and then Pam can give even a little bit more color on the numbers. So first off, at a high level, I mean everybody is aware that demand for gasoline and diesel and jet fuels had a dramatic change as a result of the pandemic. We nominally said gasoline kind of hit a floor of around 50% reduction overall, that kind of puts it in a general average position, a little bit more on the West Coast, a little bit less in the Gulf but call it overall about 50%. We're cautiously optimistic that we're seeing a little bit of recovery, maybe 5% to 15% depending on the area, but we still have a long way to go. So, we have cautious optimism that recovery is starting to occur. At the same time, we still have 30 million barrels of light product inventory over the 5 year average and 50 million barrels of crude over the 5 year average. So, there's still a long ways to go. MPC is guiding at minimum rates continuing in the second quarter. So, the MPC system has basically cut back to about two-thirds of its capacity. So that has an impact on the L&S business, which is -- which you are asking. So, let me let Pam give you a couple more numbers that'll add to our prepared remarks, that'll give you a little bit more insight into that -- what that cost would look like in the quarter. Yes, Shneur, it's Mike. So, yes, it'll be obviously pretty close to your point is, on paper it could be a little bit one way or the other. We had originally said that we thought we would get there by 2021 and that was predicated on the higher capital number. So, your point is well taken. With the lower capital number, we're just going to have to see how the rest of the year plays out. Obviously as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, the situation on natural gas has improved considerably as a result of the shut-in of associated gas in the Permian, et cetera. So, one of the major changes in the capital program -- and I want to be really clear about this is the original BANGL project we are no longer pursuing. Just reminding everybody that we had FIDed Whistler and we had FIDed Wink-to-Webster, but we had not FIDed the BANGL project. But I don't want people to take away from that, that we're not committed to still servicing our producers with flow assurance. We've just changed the view of that to use some existing pipe that we're working with some other parties. So, the original scope is now what we are not pursuing, which changes the capital quite considerably. I know the market has been wondering about that for a couple quarters in a row. And we said many times that we want to make sure we have a solution for producers, at the same time, there's still a lot of interest in going to an area that's outside of Bellevue. So that's still all holds. The situation is such that the volume expectation is such that the capital requirement for the project needed to change, and that's where we're headed right at this point. So overall, we're still committed to NGL solution. However, the original scope is what we're deferring or putting to the side at this point, and we have a new scope that's included in our guidance here on the capital reduction. So, you can see a pretty significant reduction as a result of that. Hopefully that all makes sense to you. Yes. We haven't given a lot of color yet on where 2021 will play out as we have -- see how this pandemic continues to play itself out. Like I said, earlier, I think we have cautious optimism that we're starting to recover. But as I mentioned, there's still a long way to go here. So, right now, we're just concentrating on the 2020 plan. And then as the year progresses and we get to see how this plays out and we're -- we'll give a little bit more disclosure on where 2021 will be. Spiro, I think the situation on gas is obviously changing quite a bit with the current reduction in associated gas. I mean we stated on many calls previously that our view was that the Northeast was still a stable amount of cash flow for us and we expect that the producer community to be stable even in the previous environment. So, obviously that hasn't changed. And if anything, it looks like it's stronger opportunity for the Northeast to maintain or slightly grow. And that's kind of been our position all along. There has been some concern about the absolute level of natural gas price and what that does to the producing community. But as everybody can see, the 2021 strip is now north of $2.75 or so. And even in the current situation, we're above $2 in the near-term. So -- but I think the situation has changed quite a bit as far as the dynamic on absolute gas price, hasn't changed our view as to what we think is occurring there. And you've heard a lot of disclosure from the producer community up there. But -- so, I think we stated all along we thought the Northeast would be a good source of cash flow for us. We thought it was going to be maintained. We have never been a believer there was going to be a large reduction in the volumes up there even prior to this situation. But obviously now that this situation has played itself out a little bit more, there is more security in gas prices and gas volumes for the Northeast. Yes. So on the first part of the question, we're still committed to the Permian growth that's going to occur, albeit now slower. So one of the things that we've been trying to do in that business as you've heard is, have discipline around the investment and where we're putting our capital and the Permian still in our view is still a good long-term area. Obviously in the short-term with crude price in the low 20s, the expectation for producers to adapt to that is not unexpected. We hesitated as you know, for several quarters we've talked about because the capital commitment for the original scope was a much larger commitment and we wanted to have a surety of the volumes. Well, the current situation obviously has changed that. So, we're still committed to the area. But we are working with existing assets that are out there and we are still committed to an NGL solution. It just won't be the original scope that we had envisioned early on. So, I can't give you a whole lot more color there as Tim and his team is working on the commercial situation as far as putting our NGL solution together. But I do believe, like I said, all along the industrial logic for the project still holds. Now the pace of volume is such that it'll be a little slower as producers adapt to the current environment, which we certainly understand. And I would tell you that I think this is part of what we've had in our mind all along as we wanted to not commit to that full scope until we were really sure that the volume commitments would be there. What's happening in the market, obviously, and we understand it, is the volume commitments are slower and therefore the capital requirement needed to adjust. And that's kind of what we've done with the project. So still believe in the industrial logic, still believe in the projects. Overall goal, still believe in producer outlets for NGLs that also holds just the scope of how we attack it, is what's changing. Yes, Christine, this is Mike. So, I'll comment first off. Obviously, where crude price and NGL price is, the wet gas is under a little more pressure than is normal. The unknown question is, how quickly does crude price return to a normal place and then how much does the NGL price change as a result of the U.S. refining system running at minimum. So, our expectation is propane prices will be coming up as the situation evolves. I don't know that any of us know really at this point how long the demand recovery will be as a result of the pandemic, shelter-in-place and reopening of the economy is going to play itself out. So, I think that's an unknown. Obviously the boost of natural gas pricing is helping that. And at least in our view, in general, over the longer-term, we still believe overall that, that wet gas economics are better than dry gas economics for the long-term. You get that extra boost. Obviously to your point, in the very short-term, crude prices have gotten pretty low, propane prices have gotten pretty low. Pam has commented on what that sensitivity is for us. But assuming cautious optimism to get the economy going back in the right direction, assuming all the health situation works out fine for everybody and a recovery in the economy and a recovery in GDP, we should see a recovery in NGL prices as well. So, if anything, kind of in a weird way, the pandemic is actually more bullish for the gas/NGL recovery coming out of it once we can see to the point that we actually get out of it. I just think the real unknown is how long does that take and how long do refineries run at minimum. We've stated for MPC that we went to minimum in the back half of March and into April and we've given guidance at MPC for the second quarter that basically says we still expect the U.S. refining system to run at minimum for quite some time to draw down the inventories that were built as a loss in demand. And while that continues to occur, there's less butanes, there's propanes et cetera being produced. So, I guess we'll all have to watch to see how long it plays itself out. But I think directionally it's good for the gas business in general. So it's a great question. So obviously, our distribution philosophy is a Board decision. And it's something that we debated very heavily this time because a lot of our competitors have taken advantage, if you want to call it that, to lower that distribution. We, as a Board, talked about it and we felt the right thing for us to do was to keep the distribution but hold off on the growth and leave it in a flat mode. So that's what we decided to do this time. Very much like Christine's question, this is going to be a really interesting year to see how it plays itself out. We don't have a crystal ball, nor does anybody else to know how the pandemic will play itself out, whether there'll be an extended time here. Obviously, the most important thing is, the health and safety of everybody who is involved in this. And as a result, the economy is having a reaction to that. So, it's kind of like the question that was asked earlier, we don't have a strong conviction around that 2021 capital number right at this point, just because we think there's possibilities for it to change, depending on how this plays itself out.  So -- but as a general rule, as we looked at the business, assuming full payout of distribution, and assuming getting our capital to the level that we want it to be, that's why we stated we thought that would be achieved in 2021. As you heard from Shneur's comments, depending on how this plays itself out, and what recovery you have and how the gas production occurs, we could be close to it in 2020. We'll see. So all those dynamics come into play. I'll just leave you with, our view has been that it's a goal to get there. There's a couple levers that can be pulled. And right now, our position has been we wanted to get our capital down to a level that we think develops, very strong return projects.  So hydrating the capital portfolio has been our focus and having a distribution remain flat to where it was before we thought was the right answer for now. The one thing I would add -- and we've said this many times, investor feedback is very diverse in this area. There are a lot of investors who feel strongly about maintaining the current distribution levels. There are also many who feel it's an opportune time to reduce it. As Pam stated, we are at the high end. We believe it's the right thing for us to be doing at this point. But it's an area that gets discussed with the Board constantly throughout the year. Yes. Again, I think a lot of it is, depends on how the demand side of this pandemic plays itself out across the whole economy. Obviously the situation, prior to it occurring was, people questioning whether the Northeast was going to continue to maintain or grow. Our view was, it was going to at least maintain and grow a little bit. Obviously, that's bolstered now. But I think, the unknown that's still out there and we don't have this crystal ball either is, how does the U.S. economy respond to this. When does it recover back to I'll say normal levels and have the demand side of the equation. Right now is the thing that I think is still the most unknown. Our focus always is, worry about the things we can control, be conscious of the things that we don't control, but at the same time realize that we don't control some of those. So, part of it is for us to be thoughtful and watch as the demand side of this plays itself out. This is Mike. I just wanted to add is, what Pam and the team has tried to do is, we generically lump the term MVC across the business and she has given some color on those numbers. But as you can imagine, every individual asset or pipeline is a lot different. It's a whole scorecard of variations. And then you go into Marine, and then you go into terminals, as well as pipeline. So we're trying our best to give as much color as we can. And then Pam and the team have kind of accumulated that all up and rolled it into one number that hopefully will give you the banks of the river as the refining systems at minimum, here's what to expect. As NGL prices move, we've given that guidance, here's what to expect. We've also given some sensitivity around gas, shut-in, et cetera. So, hopefully that answers the question that I know a lot of people have been wondering and we're trying to give you as much color on it as we can. Yes, no, I don't think so. I think that's a little bit of a misnomer in people's minds. I mean I use the football analogy that obviously we're trying to hit the 50 yard line as far as a market price. The MPC people will have one view that says it's skewed to MPLX, the MPLX people have a view that's skewed to MPC. So I feel very comfortable that we're between the 40 yard lines, hoping our best to hit the 50. So I know that's a risk that some people have questions, but I really don't think that it should get to the discussion that it does get.  And then Pam, kind of talked about, the contractual obligation and automatic renewals, et cetera, et cetera. So, MPC, obviously is integrated to MPLX via the distribution coming back. So there's a synergy relationship between MPC and MPLX. But I think sometimes people don't understand as much as it is."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note, that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.\nKristina Kazarian: Good morning and welcome to the MPLX fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. The slides that accompany this call may be found on our website at mplx.com under the Investor tab. Joining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan, Chairman and CEO; John Quaid, CFO; and other members of the executive team. We invite you to read the safe harbor statements and non-GAAP disclaimer on Slide 2. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the call and during the question-and-answer session that follows. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC. Now with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Hennigan: Thanks, Kristina. Good morning and thank you for joining our call. Earlier today, we reported adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 2021 and $5.6 billion for the full year. Over the past year, we've executed on each of our three priorities. We exceeded our initial cost reduction target, reducing our annual operating expenses by approximately $400 million as compared to 2019 levels. We've made significant progress in this area over the last two years. And so what began as a cost reduction initiative is being embraced by the organization now a low-cost culture is being embedded in how we conduct our business. We brought multiple projects into service over the last year while maintaining strict capital discipline. Within the L&S segment, our three Permian takeaway projects, Whistler for natural gas, Wink-to-Webster for crude oil and our NGL project, were all placed into service and we expect volumes across these systems to ramp over time. Within the G&P segment, both the Smithburg one processing plant in the Marcellus and the Preakness processing plant in the Permian have started operation. We also continued our portfolio optimization efforts and completed the sale of the Javelina processing plant in Texas and some minor gathering assets in Southern Wyoming for proceeds of approximately $110 million. In addition to our cost reduction and portfolio optimization efforts, 2021 also benefited from the tailwinds of strong NGL prices and the recovery in U.S. refined product demand. All these items resulted in exceptionally strong cash flow and enabled us to return over $4.2 billion to unitholders through distributions and unit repurchases. On our Alaskan logistics and storage assets, we've been working sales process since we last communicated. We'll be back to you when we have more details that we can share. Turning to Slide 4 in your deck. Today, we announced our capital outlook for 2022 of $900 million. That plan includes approximately $700 million of growth capital, $140 million of maintenance capital and $60 million for the repayment of our share of the DAPL pipeline joint venture debt due in 2022. Our 2022 capital plan is directed towards investments expected to deliver high capital returns such as expansions and debottlenecking of our existing assets and projects related to the expected increased producer activity. While our capital outlook is primarily focused on our current L&S and G&P footprint, we also continue to evaluate low carbon opportunities where we can leverage our competitive advantage through technologies that are complementary with our expertise and our asset footprint. Near term, these opportunities are likely to be supported - or to be in support of MPC's renewable efforts such as investment in our logistics assets supporting MPC's Martinez renewable fuels project. Moving to Slide 5. I'd like to provide some comments on our capital allocation framework, as I mentioned on last quarter's call. The foundation of executing this strategy is a strong balance sheet. We continue to target a leverage ratio of around 4x and remain committed to an investment-grade credit profile, while maintenance capital remains steadfast and our commitment to safely operating our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees and support the communities in which we operate. We continue to have a distribution with very strong coverage and most recently declared a 2.5% increase to the base quarterly distribution on November 2. After these commitments are met, our plan focuses on investing to grow the business. In 2022, the majority of capital is expected to be directed at opportunities in the Marcellus, Permian and Bakken, where we are focused on high capital return projects that expand and debottleneck our existing assets. As I've stated in the past, we believe this is both a return on and a return of capital business. Each quarter, we will evaluate our free cash flow after distributions and determine the optimal use for those dollars, be it growth capital, buybacks or additional distributions. As a reminder, 2021 had many one-off tailwinds which drove our return of capital, including strong NGL prices and asset sales. We're optimistic about our opportunity to achieve solid operational performance in 2022 and we'll evaluate the needs of the business as we make decisions on incremental return of capital. Shifting to Slide 6. We remain focused on leading and sustainable energy by lowering the carbon intensity of our operations and products, improving energy efficiency and conserving natural resources, all while using innovative technologies to do it. And we believe the targets we are setting and our transparent disclosures on how we plan to achieve these targets position us well for the future. Through the end of '20, MPLX was nearly halfway to reaching both our methane and freshwater intensity reduction targets. And later this quarter, we plan to report the progress we made on these initiatives in 2021. Now, let me turn the call over to John to discuss our operational and financial results for the quarter.\nJohn Quaid: Thanks, Mike. Slide 7 outlines the fourth quarter operational and financial performance highlights for our Logistics and Storage segment. L&S segment adjusted EBITDA increased $50 million when comparing fourth quarter 2021 to 2020. Pipeline volumes were up 18% and terminal volumes were up 11% year-over-year as the industry rebounded from the pandemic. The benefits of these higher throughputs and higher distributions from our pipeline joint ventures were partially offset by lower contracted marine transportation rates with MPC. Turning to our capital outlook. More than half of our planned 2022 growth capital is directed to the L&S segment, including a number of smaller expansions and debottlenecking projects such as expanding our Permian natural gas and NGL takeaway systems. Moving on to our Gathering and Processing segment. Slide 8 provides the segment's fourth quarter operational and financial performance highlights. G&P segment adjusted EBITDA increased $40 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, largely due to higher NGL prices. For the quarter, NGL prices averaged $1.05 per gallon, more than double the $0.52 per gallon average in the fourth quarter of 2020. These higher NGL prices and this quarter's asset sale gain of $19 million more than offset the effects of lower volumes. Overall, gathered volumes were up 3%, while processing and fractionation volumes were down 2% and 6%, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Our lower processing and fractionation volumes were partially due to the divestiture of our Javelina processing plant in early 2021. Focusing on our largest region, in the Marcellus, gathered volumes were up 7%, while processing volumes decreased 2% and fractionation volumes decreased 1% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. During the fourth quarter, as Mike mentioned, we completed commissioning of the 200 million cubic feet per day Preakness processing plant in the Delaware Basin. The facility began to ramp up operations in December and is expected to continue to ramp up volumes through the first half of the year. Turning to capital; planned 2022 growth capital for the Gathering and Processing segment is largely directed to projects in the Permian, Marcellus and Bakken basins such as the 68,000 barrel per day Smithburg de-ethanizer in the Marcellus and the 200,000 cubic feet per day Tornado 2 processing plant in the Delaware Basin, both of which are expected to come online in the second half of 2022. Moving to our fourth quarter financial highlights on Slide 9. Total adjusted EBITDA was $1.4 billion, up 7% from the prior year and distributable cash flow was $1.2 billion, an increase of almost 5% from the prior year. In the fourth quarter, MPLX returned $1.5 billion to unitholders through $1.3 billion of distributions and $165 million in repurchases of common units held by the public. As of December 31, MPLX had over $300 million remaining available under the current $1 billion unit repurchase authorization. We declared a fourth quarter distribution of $0.705 per unit, resulting in distribution coverage of 1.64x for the fourth quarter. We ended the year with total debt of around $20 billion and a leverage ratio of 3.7x. As you recall, during 2021, we repaid about $1.75 billion of maturing long-term debt with cash and availability under our intercompany loan with MPC. As of year-end, we had about $1.5 billion drawn on our intercompany loan agreement with MPC which, subject to market conditions, we expect to opportunistically refinance into long-term debt. In closing, given current business conditions, our commitment to strict capital discipline and our ongoing adoption of a low-cost culture, we expect to continue to generate strong cash flow, enhancing our financial flexibility to invest and grow the business while also supporting the incremental return of capital to unitholders. Now, let me turn the call back over to Kristina.\nKristina Kazarian: Thanks, John. [Operator Instructions] With that, operator, can you open the call for questions? Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Mackay. Your line is now open. Goldman Sachs.\nJohn Mackay: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for the time. Appreciated the context and some of the color on growth CapEx looking into '22. Just wondering if you could give us a little bit more in terms of - we saw '21 way below where you'd initially guided, so maybe if any of that is kind of '21 spending shifting into '22. And then also just on the energy transition side, is there anything in that bucket related to Martinez? Would that be incremental to this number? Just any context on that, too.\nMike Hennigan: John, on your first point, yes, there is a little bit of '21 spending that makes its way into '22. So there's a little bit of that. So that was a good observation. In general, I would tell you - I'm going to let Tim and Greg give some comments here, too. But in general, I would tell you, we don't have any big headline projects this year that we would talk about as large capital. But at the same time, we're pretty excited about we have a lot of smaller bolt-on debottlenecking expansion projects which tend to be a little better in return. Obviously, you don't have the headline, so it's a little tougher for you guys to think about it in general. But I actually like to set that we have now. And let me - Tim, Greg, why don't you guys give some examples of what we're talking about.\nTim Aydt: Okay. Well, this is Tim Aydt. I'll just give maybe a couple and then turn it over to Greg. You are right, we are spending money at Martinez. And really, that's spending capital to modify the assets in support of MPC's conversion of the refinery to renewable fuels. So that's a chunk of money there. And then, I think maybe another example I'll point to is, recently, we announced the expansion of the Whistler Midland Basin, 36-inch up further into the Midland Basin. I think that basically - those volumes will essentially fill the capacity on Whistler. And given the tightening gas takeaway situation it's being faced, we're starting to see a lot of producer customer input. And as a result, we're starting to consider the potential expansion of Whistler to 2.5 Bcf. So those are just a couple of examples. But as Mike said, there's a lot of other opportunities for bolt-ons and so forth and that's a focus.\nGreg Floerke: Yes, this is Greg Floerke. With regard to Gathering and Processing capital, the two largest projects that we have underway now are Smithburg de-ethanizer and that project scheduled to come online midyear. And then the other large plant capital is for our Tornado 2 plant which will increase our West Texas processing capacity to one Bcf per day when it comes online late next year. The other capital is around growth on gathering lines in the Bakken and some in the Utica dry and Marcellus area.\nMike Hennigan: So John, I think it's a really good question and I know people are going to try to understand that. So what Greg was saying is, hey, we're adding to our Smithburg Complex. What Tim was saying is we're adding to the Whistler project, as an example. So we have a long list of those. That's what really is in our program for this year, a lot of assets that are already existing that we're going to tweak and debottleneck and expand a little bit. And they're really nice projects because it's relatively small on the capital side but it can enhance the revenue side pretty good.\nJohn Quaid: John, this is John Quaid. One other - just while we're talking about capital, one other item just to be thinking about, maybe a little bit abnormal from prior years, I would say, as we look at the plan right now, it's probably more front-end loaded towards the beginning of the year than what you might have seen from us in prior years. And again, we've got this nuance as well where there's some maturing debt at the JV. We've got to fund our equity partner there to make that payment and we know that's going to happen in the first quarter just based on when the debt matures. So another little context, too. It's probably a little bit more front-end loaded this year than what you've seen in the past.\nJohn Mackay: That was great. Super thorough and clear across the board. Definitely appreciate that. Maybe just my follow-up here. Overall quarter looked pretty good. Some kind of puts and takes, products. Volumes look good. G&P looks good. Utica was processing a little weak again. Just curious if you could give us some context on - you're looking out into 2022, just some of the general upside, downside drivers for EBITDA that we should be watching.\nJohn Quaid: Yes. John, maybe one way to think about that is to think about the tailwinds or, as Mike has called them in the past, the red bars that may be affected 2021. I mean, certainly, while we're largely a fee-based business on the G&P side, we do have some sensitivity to NGL prices which moved up significantly throughout the year, right? And we roughly say $0.05 on NGLs is roughly $20 million a year of an annual impact. So we start to see that when, for the year, we go from $0.43 to $0.87. The fourth quarter was $1.05. What's it going to be for all of '22? That's something we don't know. So that's certainly something we'll be watching. That, I think, drove '21 results but it's early in '22 to understand how that might drive '22. We also would have had some asset sales, as Mike referred to, over $110 million of proceeds. So we're going to have those again. Again, we continue to review our portfolio and look for opportunities but those may come, those may not. We also had reduced capital spending. Again, some of that was certainly our kind of continuing focus on strict capital discipline but some of that maybe to just producer activity and their uncertainty around COVID that maybe we're seeing, knock on wood, maybe start to look a little less concerning as the cases come down on Omicron. And we had some favorable working capital last year, too, that we wouldn't necessarily count on that repeating as well. So Mike, I don't know if there's something you want to add to that.\nMike Hennigan: Yes, John, I just want to add - John used one of the terms that I use internally and it's one that I used in my prior life. I should probably explain a little bit more is I call our code cash flows and I use the term blue bar to refer to cash flows that I think are there in all markets, very stable that they are in all markets. And then I put red on cash flows. They could be onetime or not necessarily going to repeat themselves, etcetera, things that we don't count on as much. And as John just referred to that, I thought I would explain that a little bit. So, I think about blue bar and red bars, our cash flows. And as we think about the year, we're hopeful there are going to be some other red bar cash flows but we try not to count on that. John mentioned NGL prices. Maybe it'll stay strong through the full year, or who knows, right? That's the way the market goes on commodity pricing. So that's got a little bit of red element to it. Like John said, sales are clearly red. We'll evaluate those as those come along. So it's kind of the way we think about our capital allocation in general as we get to the back part of the capital allocation which are blue which are red and helps us make determinations on distributions versus buybacks, etcetera. So hopefully, that helps.\nJohn Mackay: No, that's great. Appreciate the time. Thank you.\nMike Hennigan: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Blum, Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nMichael Blum: Thanks. Good morning, everybody.\nMike Hennigan: Good morning, Michael.\nMichael Blum: I just wanted to follow up on the Whistler comment about expansion to 2.5 Bcf a day. I just want to clarify, is that something that's actually in the budget and plan for 2022? Or is that still something that you're considering? And if it is in the budget, any details on timing or cost would be really helpful.\nTim Aydt: So this is Tim. I'll take that one. Currently, that expansion is being contemplated by the JV partners and so forth. It is not a budget item that is currently in there. What I was trying to draw attention to is that as we continue to extend up into the Midland Basin and so forth, we've essentially tapped out some of the existing capacity and we'll be looking to grow that capacity on Whistler overall. So as far as timing, that remains to be seen. So more to come later.\nMike Hennigan: And Michael, it's Mike. I'll just add to Tim's. What he was referring to is at the end of January, the partners made this announcement of this extension lateral. That - we have a little bit of capacity beyond the MVC commitments. So that extension kind of gives us another little geographic area to us to put into the project. And then the next step as the Permian continues to grow is can we add some more additional assets to take the capacity up some more. So what Tim was describing, kind of a two-pronged thing with - what we just announced in January is near in, committed. We're doing that. The second part of it is we expect this to happen. We have a good asset and it'll be tough to beat the expansion economics that we'll be able to provide, if that makes sense.\nMichael Blum: Yes. Absolutely. Appreciate that. The second question I had was really, I guess, a capital allocation question. In light of all the inflationary pressures we're seeing in the market, just wanted to know if that impacts your thinking on the mix of distribution growth versus buybacks and all the other options in 2022, meaning do you see the need to raise the distribution faster to offset inflation for investors? Or do you just sort of continue your ratable distribution increases you've been doing year after year?\nJohn Quaid: Michael, it's John Quaid. I think as we think about where we are and go back to Mike's comments, right, we look at the balance sheet. We want to be around 4x. We're very comfortable at around 3.7x now, right? We'll focus on maintaining our assets, securing the distribution, looking at growth opportunities and then looking at kind of where we're left. And that growth capital opportunity is that buybacks or is that more distributions. Again, we've got a pretty strong payout ratio and distribution, as you know. So it's certainly one of the avenues we look at as we think about return of capital.\nMichael Blum: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet, JPMorgan Chase. Your line is now open.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.\nMike Hennigan: Good morning, Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: Just wanted to pick up with some of your comments at the beginning of the call there with regard to the asset sales. I just wanted to catch that, that was a bit over $100 million of sales there in Wyoming. And just wondering if this was a process that you're continuing to evaluate your assets and check out kind of what the value is on the market there, or did someone else approach you? And just in general, I guess, how are you seeing the appetite for G&P assets out there? Are they starting to close in on the valuation that you see that maybe there could be more rotation?\nJohn Quaid: Jeremy, it's John Quaid. I'll start with the first part of that. So just to clarify, the $110 million is the proceeds for the year from two sales. So that includes the about $70 million from the sale of Javelina earlier in 2021 and then $40 million from the sale of those gathering assets in Southern Wyoming. So there's actually two pieces to that. Again, in the quarter, it was just the sale of the gathering assets in Wyoming for proceeds of about $40 million and a gain of about $19 million, just to kind of rack those numbers. And I'd say both of those just resulted from our continuing kind of portfolio review to look at our assets and optimize them what makes sense in our portfolio versus what might make sense in someone else's. I think - and maybe I'll start on kind of our - the basin question we talk about every quarter. I'll let some others chime in as well. Again, I think we're still in the same spot where, while in some of these basins, we're continuing to generate cash flow. So we're not in the rush to sell those. And we'll see as the market moves, if that bid ask starts to compress a little bit but - and certainly, something we'll actively review but I don't think we have any significant updates here on that right now.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it, that's helpful there. And unless anyone else is going to jump in there.\nJohn Quaid: I'm getting thumbs up around the room. So I think that was the - I think everybody is good with that, Jeremy, if you got another question.\nJeremy Tonet: Yes, great. I just wanted to touch on the Northeast a bit more in producer activity there. You have Mariner East looking like it's getting completed here which would add needed NGL egress. And then you have the Shell cracker in the middle of this year and this could really help NGL price realizations in the basin and incentivized drilling. At the same time, the basin has been challenged for takeaway over time, although there's been incremental capacity additions coming in here. Just wondering how you think the basin production progresses at this point. Do you see shifting activity, dry to wet, that benefits you? How are producer activity conversations going at this point?\nGreg Floerke: Jeremy, this is Greg Floerke again. I think as we've talked before and most of our producers in the Northeast are - they're focused on free cash flow generation and on making sure that even with good NGL prices and gas that they match the takeaway capacity, as you mentioned, both residue and natural gas liquids. Mariner East capacity has incrementally expanded over the last few years as Mariner East two and 2X have worked towards completion And so I think that's more of an incremental gain and it does free up room for more ethane production, along with the Monaca plant coming online midyear. We mentioned our Smithburg two de-ethanizer plant down in West Virginia, along with our existing fleet of de-ethanizers. This is going to open up even more capacity to help fill that Monaca plant. We expect upwards of 80% of the supply could come off our system. And otherwise, some producers will continue to kind of slowly bring on new pads, some are in decline and some have maybe single-digit growth. So overall, we're looking at continued flat - I think flat production in the Northeast that's going to be a series of some producers up, some down but overall in balance.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you.\nMike Hennigan: You're welcome, Jeremy.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Spiro Dounis, Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nSpiro Dounis: Thanks, operator. Good morning, team. I wanted to go back to growth CapEx quickly. Just given that a lot of these projects are smaller in scale and brownfield in nature, just curious if it's fair to assume that the majority of that $700 million in CapEx could actually be cash flowing by year-end, or is that a little too aggressive?\nJohn Quaid: Yes. It's - Spiro, it's John here. I think maybe a little aggressive. I mean, some of these - as Greg talked about, some of those plants coming up midyear, some of those will be ramping throughout the year. Timing-wise, we're spending some capital on the Martinez renewables project, right? But MPC is not finishing that project this year. So that's not going to cash flow. So I think that might be a little bit strong. Some of them - and some of them, right, kind of come on in pieces, too, throughout the year. So I think I'd be a little hesitant to say they're all going to be cash flow at the end of the year.\nMike Hennigan: Spiro, it's Mike. I'll just add, in general, the capital you spend in one year has a lag for the cash flow, especially if it's going to be ramping volumes as well. So yes, it's kind of aggressive to think of this capital to hit the cash flow. It's really capital that we spent the year before and the year before that. That really starts to play itself into this year's cash flows.\nSpiro Dounis: Understood. That makes sense. I just like setting a high bar for you, Mike. So apologies on that one. Next one is just on processing capacity.\nMike Hennigan: No worries. Thanks for the help, Spiro.\nSpiro Dounis: You got it. Next one just on processing capacity. I noticed that some of the capacity, I guess, in three of your basins fell quarter-over-quarter from 3Q. And just curious, what exactly drove that? Sorry if I missed it in the prepared remarks.\nMike Hennigan: Yes. So if you look year-over-year, there's some slight decreases there. I think I'll let Greg chime in as well. I think some of that is just going to be timing in the basin as producers move through activity. The other thing, don't forget, because the volumes year-over-year on the quarters, they're slightly down. Remember, we had the Javelina facility that we sold. So like fourth quarter year-over-year, if we're down 2%, like it's a small decrease and half of that is probably the fact that we had Javelina in one period and not the other. So I think it's both the sale of Javelina and then maybe just timing on the producer side. But Greg, I don't know if you wanted to...\nSpiro Dounis: And sorry to cut you off. It was more around - not so much the volumes that went through but just the capacity specifically at...\nMike Hennigan: I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Spiro. My apologies. My apologies. So as we look at our regions, we do kind of an annual review of our capacities. And as you noted, in Southern Appalachia and the Rockies, in those particular regions, we, frankly - and really, it's part of our cost reduction efforts to some degree. We had some units that really were not needed based on demand in the region and we don't see them to be needed. So we've kind of permanently idled or disconnected those units from our capacities in those regions, save some cost for us. So those are adjustments we made, again, primarily in those two regions to the processing numbers, just an annual process we do. Instead of changing that every quarter, we kind of flow those through here at the end of the year. My apologies for answering the wrong question.\nSpiro Dounis: No, no worries. That was really helpful. So that's all I had today, guys. Thank you very much.\nMike Hennigan: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Theresa Chen, Barclays. Your line is now open.\nTheresa Chen: Good morning. I'd love to ask a little bit more about MPLX's overall decarbonization plans and potential participation in MPC's decarbonization efforts. So first, in addition to the logistics assets serving Martinez, is there any appetite to take up some bigger capital projects maybe with the processing units?\nTim Aydt: So this is Tim. I'll take that one. I think maybe it'd be helpful to kind of give you a little bit of an overview of our strategy. It really involves a two-pronged approach. First, MPLX is going to support MPC and its renewable fuels build out. Now that's primarily through the associated logistics opportunities. We talked a lot about Martinez already this morning. So that's the prompt example. I think second is just as important, though and that's we're going to look to be part of developing and executing industry solutions for decarbonization. As we've announced previously, we're participating in the Houston area CCS consortium and - or discuss another similar efforts as well. But I think beyond that, we continue to evaluate really a wide array of low-carbon opportunities. Unfortunately, there's none that I can publicly discuss at this time but stay tuned. I think as a general rule, when you look at the time line that we're working off of, we see RD and SAF as being really the prompt and shorter-term opportunities. CCS and maybe RNG would come in the midterm. And then certainly, hydrogen and distributed power is something we're looking at. That's probably more capital deployed in the longer term. And of course, as we've noted before, we're bullish natural gas. And so we really see natural gas as an important transitional energy source and that's going to play a key role in the energy mix well into the future. So we have a lot of opportunities in that regard as well that's tied to energy evolution. So hopefully, that answers your question.\nTheresa Chen: That does very comprehensively. Speaking of natural gas, maybe pivoting towards some of the earlier comments related to the Whistler potential expansion. Granted that you're still going through the process and imagine having discussions with the partners and producers and such but in terms of getting to that 2.5 Bcf per day, how do you view the economics with the expansion relative to other possibilities for expanding different assets within the basin of competitors? Like how does your project stack up versus competitors? Certainly, imagining it's more competitive than any sort of greenfield project. And what are the gating factors in getting producers to sign on? And are there any initial thoughts about how much this would cost?\nMike Hennigan: So I'll answer a few parts of that. I think when you look at the forecast, they contend to indicate a need for increased takeaway out of the Permian Basin. Some of this could be served by Whistler expansion. But I think even beyond that, another pipeline is viewed as being necessary in the next two to three years. But certainly, I think the goal of the industry and certainly the goal of our JV would be to fill up existing assets first. Obviously, that's the most capital-efficient path forward. We like our project as it exists today with Whistler and we see that as a very capital-efficient way to move forward. But again, that would get you about half of the basin is looking to grow, we think, a lot more than that. So as far as project capital and so forth, I'm not able to get into any of that. So I would just tell you that as is customary for gas, we would require MVCs to expand existing systems or to participate in any new pipeline as is customary.\nTheresa Chen: Thank you.\nMike Hennigan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Keith Stanley, Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nKeithStanley: Hi, good morning. I wanted to ask first on your pipeline volumes, oil and products. They continue to run solidly ahead of where they even were before COVID in 2019. So are you still - is it still the dynamics of just lower exports and higher volumes through MPLX pipes? And do you expect this to be sustained into the future?\nJohn Quaid: Keith, it's John. That's a great question and maybe another tailwind that benefited us last year that we've got to watch this year that I maybe failed to mention before because, certainly, there's a portion of that as we saw less exports. But recovering U.S. demand, we were able to utilize those assets more. Certainly, we're looking to go after market share, etcetera. But if exports kind of pick back up, that might be a headwind then on those volumes. As you know, they're pretty strong.\nKeith Stanley: Great. And one on operating costs. So I think last quarter, you talked to a $40 million increase for Q4. Did that materialize in the quarter? And I guess more importantly, how should we think about operating costs in 2022 relative to fourth quarter levels?\nJohn Quaid: Yes. Thanks, Keith. Great question. And yes, I think I talked about perhaps up to $40 million. I think I might have to stop losing my bet with Tim and Greg because they continue to find other ways and their teams to offset those increases. So while we did see it in certain areas, the team was able to find other areas to reduce costs and offset a good bit of what we were maybe seeing in our forecast. So great job by the team and we'll be fighting to maintain that as we go through next year. But certainly, no major swings, pluses or minuses to kind of say going into next year on project expense.\nKeith Stanley: Okay. So we should - for now, we should assume 2022 is pretty similar to kind of where you were in Q4 on cost?\nJohn Quaid: Yes. Yes. I mean we're - again, the teams - as Mike talked about, going back to 2019, we've - we feel we've taken about $400 million of cost out of our cost structure. And the teams are really focused on maintaining that, looking for other opportunities, managing costs with some of our growth capital as we bring new operations on. So we're going to be fighting to embed that and look for more opportunities as we continue to work to really move from this low-cost initiative into a low-cost culture.\nKeith Stanley: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next up, we have Brian Reynolds, UBS. Your line is now open.\nBrian Reynolds: Hi, good morning, everyone. I'll follow-up on some of the earlier return of capital questions. When we look ahead into '22, we appear to be seeing some similar trends as '21 in terms of sub-4 leverage and free cash flow in addition to some growth. Just given that there's roughly $300 million left on the buyback authorization, I was curious if you could talk about interest expanding and extending the buyback program and how we should ultimately think about an additional special distribution in '22?\nJohn Quaid: Yes. Thanks. I think on the buyback, obviously, that's a discussion with the Board that we'll take up with them at the appropriate time. So I wouldn't want to get ahead of that discussion. And then the overall return of capital, again, we've kind of walked through a number of times kind of how we think about the framework and the priorities there and that's something we're going to evaluate each quarter end, looking at where we are and thinking about our avenues for return of capital, whether it be distribution increase, unit repurchases or special, again, driven by where we are and what we're seeing. So I think that's an ongoing, maybe somewhat more dynamic kind of assessment than maybe, to some degree, what was dynamic but looked a little programmatic last year.\nMike Hennigan: Brian, it's Mike. I'm going to add to John's point there. The way we think about it is we want to put the portfolio in a position that we're generating this excess cash beyond distribution, beyond capital. Now to what level that turns out to be, some of these other factors that we talked about blue and red bar cash flows kind of come into play. So his point about being dynamic is the way we think about it. We look at the year. We try and assess things. We're committed to returning capital. It's something I feel strongly about. And at the end of the day, whether it comes in the form of distribution, whether it comes in the form of buybacks, we discuss that throughout the year. And I've said this on many calls, we also ask the owners, the unitholders. And there is a bifurcation. There are those who really support buybacks and there are those who really support distributions. So part of what you saw last year was some balancing in our view of people that want buybacks. We think we did a good portion of that with the capital that we had for people that want distributions. We were a little cautious because of some red bar. So we put it in the form of special as opposed to permanent. But we also did a little bump up on permanent as we continue to feel good about our blue bar cash flows. So dynamic is a good word. John said it well. I think people think of it more programmatic because it's been around the same level but that's mainly because as we sat down and looked at it, we were forecasting about the same level for a while. And then things came our way a little bit and we ended up with a little bit more and then we made an adjustment. So we'll proceed into '22 very similarly. We have a base plan that obviously we're going to execute on and we'll see how the market plays itself out. We'll see where the equity trades. We'll see how the capital projects kind of progress throughout the year and we'll just continue to evaluate it and then each quarter, try and give you guys an update on how things have played out.\nBrian Reynolds: Great. Really appreciate all that color. Maybe to pivot, I know - appreciate all the color on the gas takeaway from the Permian. But maybe to talk about the NGL side of things and new BANGL solution and bringing in the new JV partner. Just curious if you could provide some color about how you see that project in JV evolving over time. While the gas pipes needs - appear to be first, how do you see the NGL takeaway in the future? And how do you see BANGL being a part of that solution over the long term?\nTim Aydt: Okay. This is Tim. I'll take a stab at that. You're right, we did recently announce the addition of another partner. That was Rattler Midstream to the BANGL JV. So that program or that project rather kicked off operations early fourth quarter last year with deliveries to Sweeny. So that project continues. As the basin continues to recover, we're seeing increases in NGL demand for takeaway. And so as a result, I see that platform, much like the Whistler on the natural gas side being a good platform for growth for the JV. I think there's certainly an appetite for more volumes to head towards Sweeny. And we have capital-efficient expansions that we can do on a just-in-time basis and that's what we're looking to accomplish.\nBrian Reynolds: Great. And as a quick follow-up, is there any CapEx related to BANGL in this year's budget in terms of expansions? Or would that be more a '23 event?\nTim Aydt: There is - there is some. I can't speak to the quantity on individual projects but yes.\nMike Hennigan: Yes. Brian, let me just add a little bit to what Tim just said. And I was hoping that we were clear but maybe we haven't been. So if you look at our asset base across all of our portfolio, as Greg mentioned and Tim mentioned in the beginning, think about - we're doing little projects across our whole asset portfolio. That's kind of the way this is shaping up this year. So there's not that - I use the term, there's not a headline project but there's a little bit of opportunity throughout our asset base. I hope that's a little bit clearer, maybe not but trying to give you guys as much color on that as I can.\nOperator: Thank you. Next up is Chase Mulvehill, Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nChase Mulvehill: Hey, good morning, everybody. So I guess I want to come back to Whistler. A lot of questions around Whistler. You kind of talked about the potential for half of B a day of additions. But if demand was actually there, could you do more than half of B? Or is it half of B to be kind of the limit of what your brownfield expansion could be on that pipeline?\nTim Aydt: Okay. This is Tim Aydt. Relative to Whistler expansion, half of B would be the max. You could get through the 42-inch pipe with the compression. So what I was pointing out earlier is that the basin is expected to continue to grow obviously beyond that. And most projections again suggest two to three years, another pipe would be necessary. So as is the case, the industry is looking to potentially solve that problem. We're also looking to solve that problem as well but that's kind of the outlook. A Whistler expansion in and of itself would not be deemed enough to meet the basin's needs.\nChase Mulvehill: Right. And what would be the timing if you sanction that today, the incremental half of B? What would be the timing to kind of bring that incremental capacity online?\nTim Aydt: It's really going to come down to the lead times on compression. With the supply chain issues, I would say, a good time line is probably a minimum 18 but probably closer to 24 months.\nChase Mulvehill: Okay, right. And a quick follow-up here on kind of Permian takeaway capacity. The issue is probably getting contracts for - 10-year contracts for some of these, whether it be brownfield expansion or greenfield expansion. Obviously, the demographics of the Permian production growth are changing. More profits. Profits have less drilling inventory. They certainly don't - most of them don't have 10 years of drilling inventory to sign a 10-year take-or-pay contract. So somebody is going to have to absorb more risk to get more pipe built. So how do you think this ultimately plays out?\nTim Aydt: Well, I think the LNG market is continuing to grow and is forecasted to grow in a pretty big way over the course of time. So I think the producers are looking to make sure that they have adequate takeaway capacity. And as a result, I think it's going to come down to making those commitments. I do believe that several producer customers have north of 10 years of drilling capacity. There's also a reduced amount of flaring and so forth. So I believe the gas is out there and will continue to be with the outlook on LNG exports being what it is.\nChase Mulvehill: Yes, makes sense. If you allow me to kind of squeeze one more in. Obviously, MVP is very topical these days, having kind of continued permitting issues and just political issues there. How would - can you kind of just walk through the puts and takes of MVP delays and how this will impact your Marcellus business?\nGreg Floerke: Greg Floerke. In terms of the delays, there have been a number of hurdles there but the pipe is, as we understand it, is over 90% complete. So it's down to - the distance is probably less important remaining than what kind of crossings and permits are required. I can't speculate not being involved in that project on what the delays mean or what the timing would be. I can say that in terms of takeaway capacity for our producer customers, most of them were early players that took out capacity and have firm capacity on the existing lines. And with the flat to very limited amount of growth near term to medium term, they've got sufficient capacity and we're depending on - I think most were not depending on that expansion. Obviously, longer term, the basin needs more takeaway to experience more growth and we're hopeful that eventually the pipeline is completed.\nChase Mulvehill: Okay, perfect. I'll turn it back over. Thanks.\nMike Hennigan: Thanks.\nOperator: Next up, we have Tristan Richardson, Truist Securities. Your line is now open.\nTristan Richardson: Hey, good morning guys. I love all the red bar, blue bar references. It's a great throwback. You've covered a lot of ground already, so just one for me. But can you talk about just capital and activity levels you're seeing in the Bakken? Obviously, small asset but you noted some debottlenecking spend there. And just curious on the capital that's going in and then also activity levels and if, over time, you see any need for additional potential processing on your footprint there.\nMike Hennigan: I'll start off and I'll let Greg. First of all, thanks for the throwback. Sometimes it can't change my strides from the past. But yes, like I was saying earlier, I'll let Greg comment a little bit more. But yes, all of our areas is - what I was trying to say is we're doing a little bit in each of these areas. So we're doing some Marcellus. We're doing some Permian. We're doing some Bakken, etcetera. As the market is recovering and as the commodity cycle is what it is, we have assets that can participate. And we're putting little bolt-ons and little expansions to incrementally increase our asset base. Do you want to add, Greg, or...\nGreg Floerke: Yes. Thanks, Mike. I'll add. Obviously, crude - high crude prices and crude rig activities driving not only expansion opportunities for us on the crude gathering side for MPLX but also the associated gas. There is a large amount of gas even with the existing production that was being flared. Obviously, the flaring is not something that's sustainable, whether it's in the Permian or the Bakken. So there's opportunity to pick up more rich associated gas. There's gathering opportunities and processing opportunities. In terms of future expansion, yes, I would say there's definitely opportunities for - there's going to be opportunities in the current pricing regime for additional processing. We have high utilization there. We don't have the amount of processing capacity buildout that we do in some other areas but we do have some capacity we continue to fill and also look at other potential joint venture opportunities as well if there's existing capacity that can be utilized and that we can gather and work with.\nJohn Quaid: Yes. And Tristan, it's John. Just to be clear, as Greg was saying, we - so I think a lot of the capital now in the Bakken is probably more on the gathering side and filling up systems we have. We're looking at opportunities to fill up another system that's there. So while we look at processing, there's no processing in the Bakken in our plans right now.\nTristan Richardson: That's great, super helpful. Thank you guys very much.\nMike Hennigan: You're welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from James Carreker, U.S. Capital Advisors. Your line is now open.\nJames Carreker: Hi, thanks for the question. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about Q4 results. A pretty nice step-up in adjusted EBITDA relative to the prior three quarters in 2021. And then just thinking about - is there anything that happened in Q4 that maybe shouldn't carryover into 2022 as we look to what EBITDA could be then and kind of thinking about what a run rate EBITDA could be? I'll just leave it there, I guess.\nJohn Quaid: James, it's John. Thanks for the question. I think I might circle back to our tailwinds and talk a little bit about some of those that were in the fourth quarter, right? So we talked about nearly a $20 million asset sale gain in the quarter, right? That's not going to repeat every quarter. We talked about NGL prices which were the highest quarter of last year. It was the fourth quarter at $1.05. Again, would we love to see $1.05 all this year? Yes. But is that going to happen? That's an open question. I think we, too, we probably - you would have noticed on the L&S side of the business, we had some higher distributions from our pipeline joint ventures. Some of that would have been with - remember, Hurricane Ida in Q3. So some of the Q3 distributions might have pushed into Q4. And again, too, I think there's some timing there on when distributions are made from those ventures that may be kind of piled into Q4 that's not going to maybe be a normal run rate looking into next year. So there are certainly some things I'd be careful just taking Q4 and times it by four given kind of the drivers of those results.\nJames Carreker: Yes, that's helpful. That's exactly what I was looking for. But then I guess that should be offset. I assume you're going to continue to have growth on a number of your JV pipes. DAPL, Wink-to-Webster, Whistler, BANGL, those should all contribute meaningfully more in '22 than '21?\nJohn Quaid: Yes. I mean as we look at the volumes on those, again, Whistler will keep ramping up, as Tim has commented. Certainly, I'd say this year was probably less about the Permian joint ventures and more about our other kind of crude line joint ventures. So we'll - it was probably more on that side, right, where we're not really changing those pipes. And Whistler will come on. Again, we've financed some of that as well. So that will affect how that comes through cash flow.\nJames Carreker: Got you. And then I guess maybe a final question. Can you talk how much maybe impacts the FERC tariff adder could have on your business? I know it's not until July 1. But potentially, a 9%. Can you remind us how much that impacts your L&S segment?\nTim Aydt: So this is Tim. I'll take that one. I guess as kind of a reminder, the escalators are meant to cover the cost increases that come with inflationary pressures. So while we do expect to see an increase in the FERC index rate and, therefore, the revenue, we don't really expect to see a material change to our EBITDA. Again, those are meant to offset. We do plan to manage any inflationary pressures that might come up through either increased efficiencies or these index adjustments. I guess relative to the amount, I can't give you specifics on that but I'll just kind of remind you that less than 1/3 of the L&S revenue comes from FERC-regulated assets. So most but not all revenue streams do have some form of inflation escalator attached to them. One exception to that is the storage revenues. They're generally not indexed. But all the other revenue sources would have either a fixed inflation adjustment or maybe a PPI or CPI adjustment or some other formulaic path. So hopefully, you find that helpful.\nJames Carreker: I do. Thank you.\nMike Hennigan: You're welcome.\nOperator: Next up, we have Timm Schneider for our last question with Citi. Your line is now open.\nTimm Schneider: Hey, thanks and good morning. Actually, here your deck [ph] colors actually matched the red bar, blue bar as well. So there you go. First question real quick on Whistler and apologies if I missed it. So the - on the potential expansion, has that already - is there already interest from shippers on that? Or are you just talking hypothetically about that?\nTim Aydt: If I heard the question right, you were asking about the expansion and whether there's interest already. Yes, I would say we're in constant communication with producer customers and there is interest. So I can't get into specifics on shippers and potential shippers, etcetera but it's not really hypothetical. It's - there's interest out there.\nTimm Schneider: Okay, got it. And as a follow-up to this and this is maybe a little bit more longer-dated impact here. But let's assume Permian gas egress gets jammed again like we saw a couple of quarters ago, do you think there's a big kind of marketing opportunity on Whistler to realize some of those basis differentials between Waha and Agua Dulce? And then how much of that capacity - or potential capacity is actually available for kind of marketing activities versus what's committed?\nMike Hennigan: Yes. Timm, it's Mike. It's a great question. It's a good hypothetical. I don't want to speculate on it. But I think what Tim was trying to say and it kind of got a little bit of runaway here, was he was trying to say, look, we have some good bolt-on projects. We announced one just last week and that's why we were trying to explain this lateral into Midland. And then it sets up an expansion at Whistler and he said conversations are occurring. But I think he said it also very well earlier is this is going to continue to evolve. This is in this week or this month issue. Over time, we expect producers to continue to spend money in the Permian to increase their production there. So you have a fair point. Could it eventually bottle up the way it was before? It's possible. I - personally, I think the market is aware of that and probably going to look to avoid that and talk to us and other players to make sure that it doesn't happen the way it happened in the past. That's just my own personal guess. So as I said, it's speculation. It's not a bad thought. But my own personal view is people are going to be conscious of that and get out in front of it and talk to midstream players like ourselves and see if they can put a plan together.\nTimm Schneider: All right, great. My last question is just on the debt. I mean, look, you're at, call it, 3.7x now. You said you're comfortable with 4x. You don't have a ton of debt maturities due in 2022, a couple of things in '23. Last time I checked, I think your 10 years where yield to worst was sub-3%. How do you think about retiring that debt versus just rolling it and just using that cash flow for other things?\nJohn Quaid: Tim, it's John. I mean, certainly, it's something we take a look at all the time, right, looking at optimizing that debt portfolio. And frankly, when you look at where rates are both short and long term, the cost of trying to go after that debt really doesn't work for us to do that. So I think if the numbers change, we'll take a look at it. But right now, looking over that portfolio, it's just - it's not cost-effective to go after that longer-term debt.\nTimm Schneider: All right, that's it for me. And go BANGLs [ph]. There we go.\nMike Hennigan: Love the Ohio connection, Tim. Thanks.\nKristina Kazarian: All right. Operator, with that, thanks, everyone, for joining us today and thank you for your interest in MPLX. Should you have additional questions or would like clarification on any of the topics discussed this morning, members of the IR team are here to help you. Please just reach out. Thank you, everybody.",

            "name": "Tim Aydt",
            "content": "Okay. Well, this is Tim Aydt. I'll just give maybe a couple and then turn it over to Greg. You are right, we are spending money at Martinez. And really, that's spending capital to modify the assets in support of MPC's conversion of the refinery to renewable fuels. So that's a chunk of money there. And then, I think maybe another example I'll point to is, recently, we announced the expansion of the Whistler Midland Basin, 36-inch up further into the Midland Basin. I think that basically - those volumes will essentially fill the capacity on Whistler. And given the tightening gas takeaway situation it's being faced, we're starting to see a lot of producer customer input. And as a result, we're starting to consider the potential expansion of Whistler to 2.5 Bcf. So those are just a couple of examples. But as Mike said, there's a lot of other opportunities for bolt-ons and so forth and that's a focus. So this is Tim. I'll take that one. Currently, that expansion is being contemplated by the JV partners and so forth. It is not a budget item that is currently in there. What I was trying to draw attention to is that as we continue to extend up into the Midland Basin and so forth, we've essentially tapped out some of the existing capacity and we'll be looking to grow that capacity on Whistler overall. So as far as timing, that remains to be seen. So more to come later. So this is Tim. I'll take that one. I think maybe it'd be helpful to kind of give you a little bit of an overview of our strategy. It really involves a two-pronged approach. First, MPLX is going to support MPC and its renewable fuels build out. Now that's primarily through the associated logistics opportunities. We talked a lot about Martinez already this morning. So that's the prompt example. I think second is just as important, though and that's we're going to look to be part of developing and executing industry solutions for decarbonization. As we've announced previously, we're participating in the Houston area CCS consortium and - or discuss another similar efforts as well. But I think beyond that, we continue to evaluate really a wide array of low-carbon opportunities. Unfortunately, there's none that I can publicly discuss at this time but stay tuned. I think as a general rule, when you look at the time line that we're working off of, we see RD and SAF as being really the prompt and shorter-term opportunities. CCS and maybe RNG would come in the midterm. And then certainly, hydrogen and distributed power is something we're looking at. That's probably more capital deployed in the longer term. And of course, as we've noted before, we're bullish natural gas. And so we really see natural gas as an important transitional energy source and that's going to play a key role in the energy mix well into the future. So we have a lot of opportunities in that regard as well that's tied to energy evolution. So hopefully, that answers your question. Okay. This is Tim. I'll take a stab at that. You're right, we did recently announce the addition of another partner. That was Rattler Midstream to the BANGL JV. So that program or that project rather kicked off operations early fourth quarter last year with deliveries to Sweeny. So that project continues. As the basin continues to recover, we're seeing increases in NGL demand for takeaway. And so as a result, I see that platform, much like the Whistler on the natural gas side being a good platform for growth for the JV. I think there's certainly an appetite for more volumes to head towards Sweeny. And we have capital-efficient expansions that we can do on a just-in-time basis and that's what we're looking to accomplish. There is - there is some. I can't speak to the quantity on individual projects but yes. Okay. This is Tim Aydt. Relative to Whistler expansion, half of B would be the max. You could get through the 42-inch pipe with the compression. So what I was pointing out earlier is that the basin is expected to continue to grow obviously beyond that. And most projections again suggest two to three years, another pipe would be necessary. So as is the case, the industry is looking to potentially solve that problem. We're also looking to solve that problem as well but that's kind of the outlook. A Whistler expansion in and of itself would not be deemed enough to meet the basin's needs. It's really going to come down to the lead times on compression. With the supply chain issues, I would say, a good time line is probably a minimum 18 but probably closer to 24 months. Well, I think the LNG market is continuing to grow and is forecasted to grow in a pretty big way over the course of time. So I think the producers are looking to make sure that they have adequate takeaway capacity. And as a result, I think it's going to come down to making those commitments. I do believe that several producer customers have north of 10 years of drilling capacity. There's also a reduced amount of flaring and so forth. So I believe the gas is out there and will continue to be with the outlook on LNG exports being what it is. So this is Tim. I'll take that one. I guess as kind of a reminder, the escalators are meant to cover the cost increases that come with inflationary pressures. So while we do expect to see an increase in the FERC index rate and, therefore, the revenue, we don't really expect to see a material change to our EBITDA. Again, those are meant to offset. We do plan to manage any inflationary pressures that might come up through either increased efficiencies or these index adjustments. I guess relative to the amount, I can't give you specifics on that but I'll just kind of remind you that less than 1/3 of the L&S revenue comes from FERC-regulated assets. So most but not all revenue streams do have some form of inflation escalator attached to them. One exception to that is the storage revenues. They're generally not indexed. But all the other revenue sources would have either a fixed inflation adjustment or maybe a PPI or CPI adjustment or some other formulaic path. So hopefully, you find that helpful. If I heard the question right, you were asking about the expansion and whether there's interest already. Yes, I would say we're in constant communication with producer customers and there is interest. So I can't get into specifics on shippers and potential shippers, etcetera but it's not really hypothetical. It's - there's interest out there."

            "name": "John Quaid",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Slide 7 outlines the fourth quarter operational and financial performance highlights for our Logistics and Storage segment. L&S segment adjusted EBITDA increased $50 million when comparing fourth quarter 2021 to 2020. Pipeline volumes were up 18% and terminal volumes were up 11% year-over-year as the industry rebounded from the pandemic. The benefits of these higher throughputs and higher distributions from our pipeline joint ventures were partially offset by lower contracted marine transportation rates with MPC. Turning to our capital outlook. More than half of our planned 2022 growth capital is directed to the L&S segment, including a number of smaller expansions and debottlenecking projects such as expanding our Permian natural gas and NGL takeaway systems. Moving on to our Gathering and Processing segment. Slide 8 provides the segment's fourth quarter operational and financial performance highlights. G&P segment adjusted EBITDA increased $40 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, largely due to higher NGL prices. For the quarter, NGL prices averaged $1.05 per gallon, more than double the $0.52 per gallon average in the fourth quarter of 2020. These higher NGL prices and this quarter's asset sale gain of $19 million more than offset the effects of lower volumes. Overall, gathered volumes were up 3%, while processing and fractionation volumes were down 2% and 6%, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Our lower processing and fractionation volumes were partially due to the divestiture of our Javelina processing plant in early 2021. Focusing on our largest region, in the Marcellus, gathered volumes were up 7%, while processing volumes decreased 2% and fractionation volumes decreased 1% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. During the fourth quarter, as Mike mentioned, we completed commissioning of the 200 million cubic feet per day Preakness processing plant in the Delaware Basin. The facility began to ramp up operations in December and is expected to continue to ramp up volumes through the first half of the year. Turning to capital; planned 2022 growth capital for the Gathering and Processing segment is largely directed to projects in the Permian, Marcellus and Bakken basins such as the 68,000 barrel per day Smithburg de-ethanizer in the Marcellus and the 200,000 cubic feet per day Tornado 2 processing plant in the Delaware Basin, both of which are expected to come online in the second half of 2022. Moving to our fourth quarter financial highlights on Slide 9. Total adjusted EBITDA was $1.4 billion, up 7% from the prior year and distributable cash flow was $1.2 billion, an increase of almost 5% from the prior year. In the fourth quarter, MPLX returned $1.5 billion to unitholders through $1.3 billion of distributions and $165 million in repurchases of common units held by the public. As of December 31, MPLX had over $300 million remaining available under the current $1 billion unit repurchase authorization. We declared a fourth quarter distribution of $0.705 per unit, resulting in distribution coverage of 1.64x for the fourth quarter. We ended the year with total debt of around $20 billion and a leverage ratio of 3.7x. As you recall, during 2021, we repaid about $1.75 billion of maturing long-term debt with cash and availability under our intercompany loan with MPC. As of year-end, we had about $1.5 billion drawn on our intercompany loan agreement with MPC which, subject to market conditions, we expect to opportunistically refinance into long-term debt. In closing, given current business conditions, our commitment to strict capital discipline and our ongoing adoption of a low-cost culture, we expect to continue to generate strong cash flow, enhancing our financial flexibility to invest and grow the business while also supporting the incremental return of capital to unitholders. Now, let me turn the call back over to Kristina. John, this is John Quaid. One other - just while we're talking about capital, one other item just to be thinking about, maybe a little bit abnormal from prior years, I would say, as we look at the plan right now, it's probably more front-end loaded towards the beginning of the year than what you might have seen from us in prior years. And again, we've got this nuance as well where there's some maturing debt at the JV. We've got to fund our equity partner there to make that payment and we know that's going to happen in the first quarter just based on when the debt matures. So another little context, too. It's probably a little bit more front-end loaded this year than what you've seen in the past. Yes. John, maybe one way to think about that is to think about the tailwinds or, as Mike has called them in the past, the red bars that may be affected 2021. I mean, certainly, while we're largely a fee-based business on the G&P side, we do have some sensitivity to NGL prices which moved up significantly throughout the year, right? And we roughly say $0.05 on NGLs is roughly $20 million a year of an annual impact. So we start to see that when, for the year, we go from $0.43 to $0.87. The fourth quarter was $1.05. What's it going to be for all of '22? That's something we don't know. So that's certainly something we'll be watching. That, I think, drove '21 results but it's early in '22 to understand how that might drive '22. We also would have had some asset sales, as Mike referred to, over $110 million of proceeds. So we're going to have those again. Again, we continue to review our portfolio and look for opportunities but those may come, those may not. We also had reduced capital spending. Again, some of that was certainly our kind of continuing focus on strict capital discipline but some of that maybe to just producer activity and their uncertainty around COVID that maybe we're seeing, knock on wood, maybe start to look a little less concerning as the cases come down on Omicron. And we had some favorable working capital last year, too, that we wouldn't necessarily count on that repeating as well. So Mike, I don't know if there's something you want to add to that. Michael, it's John Quaid. I think as we think about where we are and go back to Mike's comments, right, we look at the balance sheet. We want to be around 4x. We're very comfortable at around 3.7x now, right? We'll focus on maintaining our assets, securing the distribution, looking at growth opportunities and then looking at kind of where we're left. And that growth capital opportunity is that buybacks or is that more distributions. Again, we've got a pretty strong payout ratio and distribution, as you know. So it's certainly one of the avenues we look at as we think about return of capital. Jeremy, it's John Quaid. I'll start with the first part of that. So just to clarify, the $110 million is the proceeds for the year from two sales. So that includes the about $70 million from the sale of Javelina earlier in 2021 and then $40 million from the sale of those gathering assets in Southern Wyoming. So there's actually two pieces to that. Again, in the quarter, it was just the sale of the gathering assets in Wyoming for proceeds of about $40 million and a gain of about $19 million, just to kind of rack those numbers. And I'd say both of those just resulted from our continuing kind of portfolio review to look at our assets and optimize them what makes sense in our portfolio versus what might make sense in someone else's. I think - and maybe I'll start on kind of our - the basin question we talk about every quarter. I'll let some others chime in as well. Again, I think we're still in the same spot where, while in some of these basins, we're continuing to generate cash flow. So we're not in the rush to sell those. And we'll see as the market moves, if that bid ask starts to compress a little bit but - and certainly, something we'll actively review but I don't think we have any significant updates here on that right now. I'm getting thumbs up around the room. So I think that was the - I think everybody is good with that, Jeremy, if you got another question. Yes. It's - Spiro, it's John here. I think maybe a little aggressive. I mean, some of these - as Greg talked about, some of those plants coming up midyear, some of those will be ramping throughout the year. Timing-wise, we're spending some capital on the Martinez renewables project, right? But MPC is not finishing that project this year. So that's not going to cash flow. So I think that might be a little bit strong. Some of them - and some of them, right, kind of come on in pieces, too, throughout the year. So I think I'd be a little hesitant to say they're all going to be cash flow at the end of the year. Keith, it's John. That's a great question and maybe another tailwind that benefited us last year that we've got to watch this year that I maybe failed to mention before because, certainly, there's a portion of that as we saw less exports. But recovering U.S. demand, we were able to utilize those assets more. Certainly, we're looking to go after market share, etcetera. But if exports kind of pick back up, that might be a headwind then on those volumes. As you know, they're pretty strong. Yes. Thanks, Keith. Great question. And yes, I think I talked about perhaps up to $40 million. I think I might have to stop losing my bet with Tim and Greg because they continue to find other ways and their teams to offset those increases. So while we did see it in certain areas, the team was able to find other areas to reduce costs and offset a good bit of what we were maybe seeing in our forecast. So great job by the team and we'll be fighting to maintain that as we go through next year. But certainly, no major swings, pluses or minuses to kind of say going into next year on project expense. Yes. Yes. I mean we're - again, the teams - as Mike talked about, going back to 2019, we've - we feel we've taken about $400 million of cost out of our cost structure. And the teams are really focused on maintaining that, looking for other opportunities, managing costs with some of our growth capital as we bring new operations on. So we're going to be fighting to embed that and look for more opportunities as we continue to work to really move from this low-cost initiative into a low-cost culture. Yes. Thanks. I think on the buyback, obviously, that's a discussion with the Board that we'll take up with them at the appropriate time. So I wouldn't want to get ahead of that discussion. And then the overall return of capital, again, we've kind of walked through a number of times kind of how we think about the framework and the priorities there and that's something we're going to evaluate each quarter end, looking at where we are and thinking about our avenues for return of capital, whether it be distribution increase, unit repurchases or special, again, driven by where we are and what we're seeing. So I think that's an ongoing, maybe somewhat more dynamic kind of assessment than maybe, to some degree, what was dynamic but looked a little programmatic last year. Yes. And Tristan, it's John. Just to be clear, as Greg was saying, we - so I think a lot of the capital now in the Bakken is probably more on the gathering side and filling up systems we have. We're looking at opportunities to fill up another system that's there. So while we look at processing, there's no processing in the Bakken in our plans right now. James, it's John. Thanks for the question. I think I might circle back to our tailwinds and talk a little bit about some of those that were in the fourth quarter, right? So we talked about nearly a $20 million asset sale gain in the quarter, right? That's not going to repeat every quarter. We talked about NGL prices which were the highest quarter of last year. It was the fourth quarter at $1.05. Again, would we love to see $1.05 all this year? Yes. But is that going to happen? That's an open question. I think we, too, we probably - you would have noticed on the L&S side of the business, we had some higher distributions from our pipeline joint ventures. Some of that would have been with - remember, Hurricane Ida in Q3. So some of the Q3 distributions might have pushed into Q4. And again, too, I think there's some timing there on when distributions are made from those ventures that may be kind of piled into Q4 that's not going to maybe be a normal run rate looking into next year. So there are certainly some things I'd be careful just taking Q4 and times it by four given kind of the drivers of those results. Yes. I mean as we look at the volumes on those, again, Whistler will keep ramping up, as Tim has commented. Certainly, I'd say this year was probably less about the Permian joint ventures and more about our other kind of crude line joint ventures. So we'll - it was probably more on that side, right, where we're not really changing those pipes. And Whistler will come on. Again, we've financed some of that as well. So that will affect how that comes through cash flow. Tim, it's John. I mean, certainly, it's something we take a look at all the time, right, looking at optimizing that debt portfolio. And frankly, when you look at where rates are both short and long term, the cost of trying to go after that debt really doesn't work for us to do that. So I think if the numbers change, we'll take a look at it. But right now, looking over that portfolio, it's just - it's not cost-effective to go after that longer-term debt."

            "name": "Mike Hennigan",
            "content": "Thanks, Kristina. Good morning and thank you for joining our call. Earlier today, we reported adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 2021 and $5.6 billion for the full year. Over the past year, we've executed on each of our three priorities. We exceeded our initial cost reduction target, reducing our annual operating expenses by approximately $400 million as compared to 2019 levels. We've made significant progress in this area over the last two years. And so what began as a cost reduction initiative is being embraced by the organization now a low-cost culture is being embedded in how we conduct our business. We brought multiple projects into service over the last year while maintaining strict capital discipline. Within the L&S segment, our three Permian takeaway projects, Whistler for natural gas, Wink-to-Webster for crude oil and our NGL project, were all placed into service and we expect volumes across these systems to ramp over time. Within the G&P segment, both the Smithburg one processing plant in the Marcellus and the Preakness processing plant in the Permian have started operation. We also continued our portfolio optimization efforts and completed the sale of the Javelina processing plant in Texas and some minor gathering assets in Southern Wyoming for proceeds of approximately $110 million. In addition to our cost reduction and portfolio optimization efforts, 2021 also benefited from the tailwinds of strong NGL prices and the recovery in U.S. refined product demand. All these items resulted in exceptionally strong cash flow and enabled us to return over $4.2 billion to unitholders through distributions and unit repurchases. On our Alaskan logistics and storage assets, we've been working sales process since we last communicated. We'll be back to you when we have more details that we can share. Turning to Slide 4 in your deck. Today, we announced our capital outlook for 2022 of $900 million. That plan includes approximately $700 million of growth capital, $140 million of maintenance capital and $60 million for the repayment of our share of the DAPL pipeline joint venture debt due in 2022. Our 2022 capital plan is directed towards investments expected to deliver high capital returns such as expansions and debottlenecking of our existing assets and projects related to the expected increased producer activity. While our capital outlook is primarily focused on our current L&S and G&P footprint, we also continue to evaluate low carbon opportunities where we can leverage our competitive advantage through technologies that are complementary with our expertise and our asset footprint. Near term, these opportunities are likely to be supported - or to be in support of MPC's renewable efforts such as investment in our logistics assets supporting MPC's Martinez renewable fuels project. Moving to Slide 5. I'd like to provide some comments on our capital allocation framework, as I mentioned on last quarter's call. The foundation of executing this strategy is a strong balance sheet. We continue to target a leverage ratio of around 4x and remain committed to an investment-grade credit profile, while maintenance capital remains steadfast and our commitment to safely operating our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees and support the communities in which we operate. We continue to have a distribution with very strong coverage and most recently declared a 2.5% increase to the base quarterly distribution on November 2. After these commitments are met, our plan focuses on investing to grow the business. In 2022, the majority of capital is expected to be directed at opportunities in the Marcellus, Permian and Bakken, where we are focused on high capital return projects that expand and debottleneck our existing assets. As I've stated in the past, we believe this is both a return on and a return of capital business. Each quarter, we will evaluate our free cash flow after distributions and determine the optimal use for those dollars, be it growth capital, buybacks or additional distributions. As a reminder, 2021 had many one-off tailwinds which drove our return of capital, including strong NGL prices and asset sales. We're optimistic about our opportunity to achieve solid operational performance in 2022 and we'll evaluate the needs of the business as we make decisions on incremental return of capital. Shifting to Slide 6. We remain focused on leading and sustainable energy by lowering the carbon intensity of our operations and products, improving energy efficiency and conserving natural resources, all while using innovative technologies to do it. And we believe the targets we are setting and our transparent disclosures on how we plan to achieve these targets position us well for the future. Through the end of '20, MPLX was nearly halfway to reaching both our methane and freshwater intensity reduction targets. And later this quarter, we plan to report the progress we made on these initiatives in 2021. Now, let me turn the call over to John to discuss our operational and financial results for the quarter. John, on your first point, yes, there is a little bit of '21 spending that makes its way into '22. So there's a little bit of that. So that was a good observation. In general, I would tell you - I'm going to let Tim and Greg give some comments here, too. But in general, I would tell you, we don't have any big headline projects this year that we would talk about as large capital. But at the same time, we're pretty excited about we have a lot of smaller bolt-on debottlenecking expansion projects which tend to be a little better in return. Obviously, you don't have the headline, so it's a little tougher for you guys to think about it in general. But I actually like to set that we have now. And let me - Tim, Greg, why don't you guys give some examples of what we're talking about. So John, I think it's a really good question and I know people are going to try to understand that. So what Greg was saying is, hey, we're adding to our Smithburg Complex. What Tim was saying is we're adding to the Whistler project, as an example. So we have a long list of those. That's what really is in our program for this year, a lot of assets that are already existing that we're going to tweak and debottleneck and expand a little bit. And they're really nice projects because it's relatively small on the capital side but it can enhance the revenue side pretty good. Yes, John, I just want to add - John used one of the terms that I use internally and it's one that I used in my prior life. I should probably explain a little bit more is I call our code cash flows and I use the term blue bar to refer to cash flows that I think are there in all markets, very stable that they are in all markets. And then I put red on cash flows. They could be onetime or not necessarily going to repeat themselves, etcetera, things that we don't count on as much. And as John just referred to that, I thought I would explain that a little bit. So, I think about blue bar and red bars, our cash flows. And as we think about the year, we're hopeful there are going to be some other red bar cash flows but we try not to count on that. John mentioned NGL prices. Maybe it'll stay strong through the full year, or who knows, right? That's the way the market goes on commodity pricing. So that's got a little bit of red element to it. Like John said, sales are clearly red. We'll evaluate those as those come along. So it's kind of the way we think about our capital allocation in general as we get to the back part of the capital allocation which are blue which are red and helps us make determinations on distributions versus buybacks, etcetera. So hopefully, that helps. You're welcome. Good morning, Michael. And Michael, it's Mike. I'll just add to Tim's. What he was referring to is at the end of January, the partners made this announcement of this extension lateral. That - we have a little bit of capacity beyond the MVC commitments. So that extension kind of gives us another little geographic area to us to put into the project. And then the next step as the Permian continues to grow is can we add some more additional assets to take the capacity up some more. So what Tim was describing, kind of a two-pronged thing with - what we just announced in January is near in, committed. We're doing that. The second part of it is we expect this to happen. We have a good asset and it'll be tough to beat the expansion economics that we'll be able to provide, if that makes sense. Good morning, Jeremy. You're welcome, Jeremy. Spiro, it's Mike. I'll just add, in general, the capital you spend in one year has a lag for the cash flow, especially if it's going to be ramping volumes as well. So yes, it's kind of aggressive to think of this capital to hit the cash flow. It's really capital that we spent the year before and the year before that. That really starts to play itself into this year's cash flows. No worries. Thanks for the help, Spiro. Yes. So if you look year-over-year, there's some slight decreases there. I think I'll let Greg chime in as well. I think some of that is just going to be timing in the basin as producers move through activity. The other thing, don't forget, because the volumes year-over-year on the quarters, they're slightly down. Remember, we had the Javelina facility that we sold. So like fourth quarter year-over-year, if we're down 2%, like it's a small decrease and half of that is probably the fact that we had Javelina in one period and not the other. So I think it's both the sale of Javelina and then maybe just timing on the producer side. But Greg, I don't know if you wanted to... I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Spiro. My apologies. My apologies. So as we look at our regions, we do kind of an annual review of our capacities. And as you noted, in Southern Appalachia and the Rockies, in those particular regions, we, frankly - and really, it's part of our cost reduction efforts to some degree. We had some units that really were not needed based on demand in the region and we don't see them to be needed. So we've kind of permanently idled or disconnected those units from our capacities in those regions, save some cost for us. So those are adjustments we made, again, primarily in those two regions to the processing numbers, just an annual process we do. Instead of changing that every quarter, we kind of flow those through here at the end of the year. My apologies for answering the wrong question. You're welcome. So I'll answer a few parts of that. I think when you look at the forecast, they contend to indicate a need for increased takeaway out of the Permian Basin. Some of this could be served by Whistler expansion. But I think even beyond that, another pipeline is viewed as being necessary in the next two to three years. But certainly, I think the goal of the industry and certainly the goal of our JV would be to fill up existing assets first. Obviously, that's the most capital-efficient path forward. We like our project as it exists today with Whistler and we see that as a very capital-efficient way to move forward. But again, that would get you about half of the basin is looking to grow, we think, a lot more than that. So as far as project capital and so forth, I'm not able to get into any of that. So I would just tell you that as is customary for gas, we would require MVCs to expand existing systems or to participate in any new pipeline as is customary. Thank you. Brian, it's Mike. I'm going to add to John's point there. The way we think about it is we want to put the portfolio in a position that we're generating this excess cash beyond distribution, beyond capital. Now to what level that turns out to be, some of these other factors that we talked about blue and red bar cash flows kind of come into play. So his point about being dynamic is the way we think about it. We look at the year. We try and assess things. We're committed to returning capital. It's something I feel strongly about. And at the end of the day, whether it comes in the form of distribution, whether it comes in the form of buybacks, we discuss that throughout the year. And I've said this on many calls, we also ask the owners, the unitholders. And there is a bifurcation. There are those who really support buybacks and there are those who really support distributions. So part of what you saw last year was some balancing in our view of people that want buybacks. We think we did a good portion of that with the capital that we had for people that want distributions. We were a little cautious because of some red bar. So we put it in the form of special as opposed to permanent. But we also did a little bump up on permanent as we continue to feel good about our blue bar cash flows. So dynamic is a good word. John said it well. I think people think of it more programmatic because it's been around the same level but that's mainly because as we sat down and looked at it, we were forecasting about the same level for a while. And then things came our way a little bit and we ended up with a little bit more and then we made an adjustment. So we'll proceed into '22 very similarly. We have a base plan that obviously we're going to execute on and we'll see how the market plays itself out. We'll see where the equity trades. We'll see how the capital projects kind of progress throughout the year and we'll just continue to evaluate it and then each quarter, try and give you guys an update on how things have played out. Yes. Brian, let me just add a little bit to what Tim just said. And I was hoping that we were clear but maybe we haven't been. So if you look at our asset base across all of our portfolio, as Greg mentioned and Tim mentioned in the beginning, think about - we're doing little projects across our whole asset portfolio. That's kind of the way this is shaping up this year. So there's not that - I use the term, there's not a headline project but there's a little bit of opportunity throughout our asset base. I hope that's a little bit clearer, maybe not but trying to give you guys as much color on that as I can. Thanks. I'll start off and I'll let Greg. First of all, thanks for the throwback. Sometimes it can't change my strides from the past. But yes, like I was saying earlier, I'll let Greg comment a little bit more. But yes, all of our areas is - what I was trying to say is we're doing a little bit in each of these areas. So we're doing some Marcellus. We're doing some Permian. We're doing some Bakken, etcetera. As the market is recovering and as the commodity cycle is what it is, we have assets that can participate. And we're putting little bolt-ons and little expansions to incrementally increase our asset base. Do you want to add, Greg, or... You're welcome. You're welcome. Yes. Timm, it's Mike. It's a great question. It's a good hypothetical. I don't want to speculate on it. But I think what Tim was trying to say and it kind of got a little bit of runaway here, was he was trying to say, look, we have some good bolt-on projects. We announced one just last week and that's why we were trying to explain this lateral into Midland. And then it sets up an expansion at Whistler and he said conversations are occurring. But I think he said it also very well earlier is this is going to continue to evolve. This is in this week or this month issue. Over time, we expect producers to continue to spend money in the Permian to increase their production there. So you have a fair point. Could it eventually bottle up the way it was before? It's possible. I - personally, I think the market is aware of that and probably going to look to avoid that and talk to us and other players to make sure that it doesn't happen the way it happened in the past. That's just my own personal guess. So as I said, it's speculation. It's not a bad thought. But my own personal view is people are going to be conscious of that and get out in front of it and talk to midstream players like ourselves and see if they can put a plan together. Love the Ohio connection, Tim. Thanks."

First question real quick on Whistler and apologies if I missed it. So the - on the potential expansion, has that already - is there already interest from shippers on that? Or are you just talking hypothetically about that? Okay, got it. And as a follow-up to this and this is maybe a little bit more longer-dated impact here. But let's assume Permian gas egress gets jammed again like we saw a couple of quarters ago, do you think there's a big kind of marketing opportunity on Whistler to realize some of those basis differentials between Waha and Agua Dulce? And then how much of that capacity - or potential capacity is actually available for kind of marketing activities versus what's committed? All right, great. My last question is just on the debt. I mean, look, you're at, call it, 3.7x now. You said you're comfortable with 4x. You don't have a ton of debt maturities due in 2022, a couple of things in '23. Last time I checked, I think your 10 years where yield to worst was sub-3%. How do you think about retiring that debt versus just rolling it and just using that cash flow for other things? All right, that's it for me. And go BANGLs [ph]. There we go."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.\nKristina Kazarian: Good morning and welcome to the MPLX third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at mplx.com, under the Investor tab. Joining me today on the call today are Mike Hennigan, Chairman and CEO; John Quaid, CFO; and other members of the executive team. We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statements and the non-GAAP disclaimer on Slide 2. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the call and during the question-and-answer session that follows. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Hennigan: Thanks, Kristina. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our call. Earlier today we reported adjusted EBITDA for the quarter of $1.4 billion and total return of capital of $900 million through 745 million in distributions, and 155 million of unit repurchases. Looking at our year-to-date results, a number of factors have a line to allow us to generate very strong cash flow. We have benefited from lower capital spending, strong NGL prices and proceeds from asset optimization efforts. These tailwinds along with solid business performance, and cost reduction efforts have combined to result in just over $1 billion of cash flow available for deployment above our current capital spending and distribution requirements. We've returned $465 million on this capital to unitholders through year-to-date unit repurchases. We believe some investors prefer unit repurchases while others prefer cash return and after several quarters of employing unit repurchases for incremental return of capital, today, we announced an increased third quarter distribution of $1.34 billion. The increased distribution include the special distribution amount of about 600 million and a 2.5% increase in the partnerships based distribution amount, reflecting our confidence in the business. Special distribution amount is one way to allow all unitholders to immediately recognize the benefit of our strong cash flow this year. We also believe that distributions can be a more tax efficient way to return capital unitholders versus unit repurchases. For 2021, we have now announced a total of $2.8 billion of distributions to unitholders on top of 465 million of unit repurchases. Moving to business updates, we're making progress in our portfolio optimization efforts with our announcement this morning that we are pursuing strategic alternatives for our Alaskan logistics and storage operations, which could include a sale. We also advanced our key growth projects in the Permian related to crude, natural gas and NGL transportation to other basin. The Wink to Webster crude pipeline in which MPLX has a 15% ownership interest continues to play segments in the service and we expect this activity to continue through the remainder of the year. Consistent with our focus on projects with lower return risk, pipeline system as 100% of its contractual capacity committed with long-term minimum volume commitments. Last quarter, we announced the Whistler Natural Gas pipeline in which we have a 38% ownership interest was placed in service and it will continue to ramp up through 2022. This pipeline will provide approximately 2 billion cubic feet per day of incremental natural gas transport capacity to the Gulf Coast markets from the Permian Basin. The Whistler pipeline is also backed by long-term minimum volume commitments and we expect volumes to increase throughout 2022. Finally, the NGL takeaway solution, which will provide 125,000 barrels per day of long-haul NGL service from the Permian to Sweeney, Texas, was placed in service in October. We continue to pursue opportunities to grow our base business, including expansion of our integrated natural gas and NGL value chains in certain strategic regions and opportunities and support of MPCs expansion in liquid renewable fuels. We also continue to evaluate a number of other low carbon energy growth opportunities and are especially focused on those where we can leverage our competitive advantage through technologies that are complementary with our expertise and our asset footprint. For example, in MPLX along with MPC is among the company supporting large scale deployment of carbon capture and storage to help decarbonize industrial facilities in the Houston area. These collective efforts could safely capture and store approximately 50 million metric tons of CO2 per year by 2030 and about 100 million metric tons by 2040. Working with our industrial companies and regulators in this energy rich region is a critical component of assuring long-term reliable fuel supplies for a Sustainable Energy diverse future. Overall, we continue to focus on identifying and efficiently executing high return projects to drive further growth for MPLX and we expect our growth capital spending to be higher in '22 than '21. Shifting to Slide 4, last quarter, we discussed the publication of our sustainability and climate reports that highlight the environmental, social and governance aspects of our business. Our focus on leading and sustainable energy positions us to deliver strong results in this space from lowering the carbon intensity of our operations and products to improving energy efficiency and conserving natural resources, while using innovative technologies to do it. We believe the targets we are setting and our transparency disclosure on how we plan to achieve these targets, position as well for the future. On our website, we have recently published our 2020 sustainability highlights and MPLX is focused on our methane reduction targets through tangible pathways, such as implementing robust outdoor monitoring programs, replacing guest driven pneumatic control valves, replacing compressor rod packing, minimizing emissions from pipeline launchers and receivers and optimizing maintenance vending. In short, we continue to challenge ourselves to lead in sustainable energy by meeting the needs of today while investing in an energy diverse future that creates shared value for all of our stakeholders. Now, let me turn the call over to John to discuss our operational and financial results for the quarter.\nJohn Quaid: Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Slide 5 outlines the third quarter operational and financial performance highlights for our logistics and storage segment. L&S segment adjusted EBITDA increased by $11 million, comparing third quarter 2021 to 2020. Pipeline volumes are up 17% and terminal volumes were up 13% year-over-year, as the industry rebounded from the pandemic. The benefits of these higher throughputs were somewhat offset by the effects of lower marine transportation rates. Moving on to our gathering and processing segment, Slide 6 provides its third quarter operational and financial performance highlights. G&P segment adjusted EBITDA increased by $43 million, comparing third quarter 2021 to 2020, largely driven by higher NGL prices. For the third quarter, NGL prices averaged $0.96 per gallon, more than double the $0.45 per gallon average for the third quarter of last year. As a reminder, every $0.05 change in the NGL basket is worth roughly $20 million to our annual results. Overall, gathered volumes are roughly consistent year-over-year, while processing and fractionated volumes were each down 2%. In the Marcellus, gathering volumes were up 5%, process volumes decreased 1% and fractionated volumes increased 2% relative to the third quarter of last year. Across the basins where we operate, we are seeing different levels of activity in response to current market conditions. In the northeast, despite higher natural gas and NGL prices, producers continue to focus on strengthening their balance sheets and prioritizing free cash flow over volume growth. Additionally, takeaway capacity constraints have continued to limit production. However, we are seeing increased activity and volume growth in the Permian and in the Bakken. Moving to our third quarter financial highlights on Slide 7, total adjusted EBITDA was 1.4 billion up 4% from the prior year for the reasons Mike discussed earlier, or I discussed earlier. And distributed cashflow was 1.2 billion, an increase of almost 12% from the prior year. We returned 900 million to unitholders with 745 million of distributions paid and 155 million in repurchases of common units held by the public. As of September 30, we had about 500 million remaining available under the current $1 billion repurchase authorization. As Mike discussed today, we declared a quarterly cash distribution of $1.28 per common unit for the third quarter, including a base distribution amount of $0.705 per common unit, and a special distribution amount of $0.575 per common unit. Based on our confidence in the business, we increased the base distribution amount by 2.5% over the second quarter 2021 distribution. The distribution will be paid on November 19, to common unitholders of record as of November 12. The adjusted distribution coverage ratio for the third quarter, excluding the effects of the special distribution amount was 1.61x. As we stated on our last call, our commitment to lowering our cost structure has resulted in a $300 million structural reduction in our annual operating costs when compared to 2019. Looking forward, we do expect higher project related expenses in the fourth quarter. Last quarter, we estimated an increase in project related expenses in the second half of the year of approximately 75 million as compared to our quarterly run rate in the first half of the year. We experienced some of these higher expenses in our L&S segment results in the third quarter and based on the expected timing for completion of certain project and maintenance work. We currently expect increased costs of up to 40 million to affect fourth quarter results as compared to the third quarter. Lastly, as we approach the end of the year, we are lowering our growth capital spending guidance for 2021 by an additional 150 million, down to 550 million and with expected maintenance capital of about 100 million for the year. Our total capital spending and investments for 2021 is expected to be about $650 million. With our reduced 2021 capital spending forecast, we do anticipate a higher run rate for capital spending in the fourth quarter as compared to the first three quarters of the year. Looking forward, we continue to pursue growth opportunities in our core business, as well as opportunities in energy evolution, which is likely to require greater capital spending and investments in 2022 than 2021. We will not be commenting on next year's plan capital spending on today's call, we will share guidance for 2022 on next quarter's call. Slide 8 provides a summary of key financial and balance sheet information. We ended the quarter with total debt of just under $20 billion and a leverage ratio of 3.7x. During the quarter we redeemed the 1 billion floating rate senior notes due September 22 with cash and available liquidity including our intercompany loan with MPC. We currently have 1.4 billion outstanding on our intercompany loan agreement. Our intent is to refinance these borrowings sometime in the future with timing depending on market and other conditions. In closing, given current business conditions and our commitment to strict capital discipline and a low-cost structure, we expect to continue to generate strong cash flow, enhancing our financial flexibility to invest and grow the business while also providing the opportunity for incremental return of capital to unitholders. Now let me turn the call back over to Kristina.\nKristina Kazarian: Thanks, John. As we open the call for questions, we ask that you limit yourself to one question plus a follow up. We may reprompt for additional questions as time permits. With that, we will now open the call to questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is going to come from Brian Reynolds with UBS.\nBrian Reynolds: My first question is around the capital allocation thought process. Should we view the special distribution as a faster method of return of capital versus buybacks given ADB limitations and kind of curious where leverage is headed? Given where leverage is headed in 2022, can we see all the above return of capital situation similar to what we have seen in 2021? Thanks.\nMike Hennigan: Thanks, Brian. This is Mike. Let me give you the long winded answer. Hopefully this will give everybody a little bit more color stack why we came out with the return of capital that we did this quarter. So, first of all, at a high level, we still believe that our balance sheet and our commitment to an investment grade rating is paramount. The way we think of capital allocation is, we're going to take care of our assets. So we're going to have sustaining capital as a high priority. We've had a base distribution amount for quite some time here. And I just want to point out that that base distribution is a pretty high payout ratio and we'd never cut, despite some of the troubles that others have run into. But once we get through that, then we have capital available for deployment. It can be in growth capital. And John talked a little bit about that buybacks, an additional distribution amount, which we called a special distribution. We could increase the base, which we've also done this quarter. We'll talk about that in a second and debt reduction. I'll start first stack with debt, we're very comfortable. We said for many, many, many quarters that we're comfortable that we have stable cash flows, and then a leverage ratio of around four times works for us. Currently, we're a little below that. We're running around 3.7x. So do we think the balance sheet is in terrific shape and we generated a lot of cash. And the way that I'd like you guys have the takeaway is that capital, it's available for deployment is a dynamic decision that we're going to make quarter-to-quarter. And it's depending on market conditions, our business needs and what we see in the current environment. Obviously, we've been through a lot over the last year and a half, with the pandemic and coming out of it. But hopefully, the market has seen something that we've been trying to say for a while that we have stable cash flows, in the sense business, we're generating cash beyond our distribution and sustaining capital needs and now beyond our growth capital needs, and we just have an amount that was available for deployment. And our view that all unitholders to your point, Brian, all unitholders would immediately benefit from this special distribution amount, as well as us continuing to buy back units as well. We've continued that pace now for several quarters in a row. So we're doing a little bit of both. And we've also bumped up our base distribution by 2.5% as well. So all of those factors come into play but I guess the biggest takeaway that I'd like you to think about is, we want to be in a position of financial flexibility which we've achieved. And going forward, it'll be a dynamic decision based on market conditions, business needs, and what we're feeling at the time is the best deployment, for all of our unitholders.\nBrian Reynolds: Great, thanks for all that color really helpful. For my follow up, was wondering if you could just give some additional color around, potential impacts from PPI across the organization from like a revenue generation perspective. How can the business see an uplift and it doesn't spread across those segments with L&S and GMP? Thanks.\nMike Hennigan: Yes, Brian, I'm going to let Tim give you some background on that whole PPI situation.\nTim Aydt: This is Tim Aydt and thanks for the question. Take my mask off here. While it's true that there is an increase in the index that would increase revenue on the FERC regulated assets, I think it's really important to understand that this is not a direct flow through to the bottom line. The whole purpose of the index is to offset higher costs that we incur during these inflationary periods. So for FERC pipelines, we've historically adjusted rates that are in line with what is allowed by FERC as a means to cover these higher costs. Now, most of our non-FERC regulated pipelines and storage assets, they also have built in escalators to help offset some of these inflationary costs. Now, these are not always based on CPI and PPI. Sometimes they're flat rate adjustments. So that's a little bit of the background on those but I would say for reference, only about a third of our logistics and storage. EBITDA is generated from FERC regulated assets. So it's really a mix of a lot of different things, PPI flat rate adjustments, et cetera.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Mackay from Goldman Sachs.\nJohn Mackay: I know you're going to get a couple of these follow ups but I do need to ask one on the special. Just curious, if you can think about kind of the size of the special this quarter. And just to clarify your comments earlier that this is something that we -- it might move around, but we could still see kind of ratably in the future. So this isn't necessarily a one-off. Thanks.\nMike Hennigan: John, thanks for that question. So, additional follow up, what I was trying to say to the previous question is, it is going to be a dynamic situation, I don't think you should take this as a one-off. That's an important point that you're bringing up. We plan to continue to have that financial flexibility. And will ebb and flow a little bit on buybacks, distribution amounts, whether we call in special or whatever term you want to use. We're also going to be very conscious of what's happening in the business. As we mentioned, in our prepared remarks, the capital this year is a little lighter than we would normally think, for this business. So we'll give a little bit more guidance next quarter on where our capital expectation is, but at least for this quarter, we're trying to tell you, it's going to be a little higher than where we are this quarter, for a lot of reasons. Some of its timing, some of its capital discipline that we've been employed. So I guess the important point that I'm trying to emphasize and hopefully everybody gets this is that, we're going to continue in a commodity business that has a lot of ups and downs and variabilities, we're going to continue, each and every quarter to evaluate the situation examine where the business needs are, look at the market conditions and try and make a determination as to what is the best return of capital. I should add that, you've heard me say this in the past, I'm a huge believer that there's two parts to this business, there's a return on capital and we very much believe in growing our earnings, and this is a growth vehicle for us. So that's an area of emphasis that I don't want to get lost in this whole return of capital. But both return on and return of capital are very important to us. And we're trying to maximize, the impacts of both of those. So, when it comes to return of, we're going to look at our base, we're going to look at whether that should get an incremental adjustment, which we did this quarter. We'll continue to evaluate that. We'll continue to evaluate how much cash flows that we're generating. As John mentioned, in his prepared remarks, it's been a strong year, from a lot of perspectives. So from that standpoint, we've generated over $1 billion of cash flow through three quarters. Obviously, without guidance to the fourth, we expect to have a little more on top of that, as we progress. So it's been a very strong cash flow year. We've returned 455 of unit repurchases. We're going to continue to engage in that program as well. But we thought it was appropriate to have an immediate return to the unitholders as well.\nJohn Quaid: I just wanted to emphasize some of Mike's comments there as well, right. There were some number of items that kind of aligned for us this year that, again, are things we're going to have to take a look and understand what those look like in the future. So certainly a broader approach to kind of incremental return of capital when it's available. But again, that'll be dependent on, what the market conditions are at the time, what kind of cash flow we're generating, et cetera. So, certainly something we'll continue to look at look at. But there may be some quarters where, we're not talking about having the same conversation in other quarters where we are.\nJohn Mackay: Okay. That's great. Thank you, Mike. My follow up is, kind of makes sense with '22, CapEx essentially being higher than '21, just given how far '21 has come down? Would it be a fair assumption to say that, given you're not taking this cash to kind of start prefunding 2022 CapEx that while it might be higher, it's not going to be a dramatically larger number. I know, you're not giving specific guidance here, but just trying to think relative basis and how to think about funding for it?\nJohn Quaid: Yes. No, John, you might have answered it with your last comment. Right. We'll have guidance for next year on next quarters call. But certainly, trying to make sure you guys understand the number is going to be higher next year. If you kind of take the guidance we gave for this year, 550 million on growth and 100 for maintenance, right, that applies about 200 to 210 of growth in the fourth quarter and about 50 of maintenance. Again, some of that's driven by the timing of projects, as we roll into next year. So, certainly higher, but not -- we'll share those numbers on next quarter's call because part of what happened to us this year, in addition to really taking a much stricter look around capital discipline. We would have had some projects that were just deferred as we were coming out of COVID that kind of pushed things later in the year and into next year. So again, looking for higher capital next year and we'll talk about that on next quarter's call.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Blum from Wells Fargo.\nMichael Blum: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I want to talk a little about the GMP business. Wondering if you're hearing anything in the northeast, from your producers? I know you mentioned capital being constrained from a pipeline takeaway perspective, do you think that the dynamic will change at all when Mountain Valley comes into service? And there's a little more take away in the region with that change? The drilling activity or do you think get the producers are just going to continue to return cash to shareholders?\nGreg Floerke: Michael, this is Greg Floerke. Yes, I think that the producers have been in free cash flow positive mode and maintenance drilling mode. And there's been constraints as we operated high levels of utilization, both in processing and in terms of takeaway pipe. Certainly as more residue gas pipeline takeaway capacity becomes available, there is that opportunity to increase drilling and volume. The processing capacity is fairly tight, but there is still potential there for growth. The other thing that I would mention is that the [shale] [ph] cracker in North of Pennsylvania is scheduled to come online mid next year, we will drive increased recovery of ethane from gas that also will free up capacity and the residue lines. And we will increase utilization of our deethanizer plant as well. So those things clearly could drive production, gas prices and NGL prices are obviously supportive of more rich gas production. But we're -- that's so open to what the producers decide to do.\nMichael Blum: Thanks. Appreciate that. Second question. Staying on GMC, I know you've had sort of an ongoing desire to divest some of your -- maybe non-core GMP assets, I'm wondering in light of commodities moving much higher in the last few months, if you're seeing any change in interest there. Thanks.\nMike Hennigan: Michael, we still have an overall strategic plan to consider where we think core assets are versus not. I've said many calls that the bid ask has been too wide for us to consider. I would tell you that that bid ask is narrowing. But at the same time, we are very comfortable still with the assets that we have in place, we don't have anything, I use the term on the front burner. But if we maintain this type of activity and the commodity prices stay where they are and there's a little bit of a renewed interest, then maybe there's a transaction that could occur at some point. Nothing right now on the horizon, we're interested, but we're also very happy with where our assets are. And my philosophy has been, all of our assets need to generate free cash. We're in that mode, we continue to be in that mode throughout all the eight of the basins that we're in. So I think overall, we're still happy with the situation we have, but we'd like to optimize the portfolio for the long-term if the situation arises. But it's not something that we have to do.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Theresa Chen. Please go ahead.\nTheresa Chen: I wanted to ask about the cost cadence actually understanding that fourth quarter, we're going to see another quarter-over-quarter bump and expenses. Just going to the quarterly run rate in 2022, should we expect some of that to normalize? Or how should we think about that?\nJohn Quaid: Good morning, Theresa. It\u2019s John. Yes, that's definitely similar to some of our maintenance capital, it can be a little bit lumpy, right, and how that kind of happens over the year, which is why we were trying to flag that earlier in the year as well. So definitely a higher level in Q4, but that wouldn't imply that we'd be on that run rate going forward.\nTheresa Chen: Understood. And related to the announcement of seeking strategic alternatives for Kenai, both in the primary and the logistics assets at the partnership. Can you remind us how much EBITDA contribution that logistics assets actually generate for MPLS, currently?\nJohn Quaid: Actually, Theresa, it's not a number we've disclosed.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Stanley from Wolfe Research.\nKeith Stanley: Hi, good morning. First, just on the Permian strategy, are there next steps that you're looking at now that Whistler Wink to Webster, and the NGL project are complete. I guess are there other capabilities that are important for the company to add at this point? Or do you feel like you're in a pretty good place in the Permian?\nTim Aydt: So, this is Tim Aydt. I'll take that one. We continue to be really bullish on natural gas and the NGL growth. I do believe that we're well positioned in the Permian in particular, to take advantage of the investments we've made thus far. When you look at our Agua Blanca system, when you look at the Waha gas storage, and when you look at Whistler, and of course, the NGL solution. I think these are all really solid platforms for growth and really to expand off of. I think you can kind of look further down the value chain, it could be as far as exports and other stuff that may provide some additional opportunities. So again, pretty bullish on natural gas and NGLs in particular. But then there's also energy evolution ideas as well, that could provide growth opportunities.\nKeith Stanley: Okay, thanks. And then, different maybe a little bit of a silly question. But the buyback pace has been just almost exceptionally programmatic with the 155 million a quarter for three quarters in a row now. Is it fair to think that that's sort of your target, I would think at this point, with the stock at these levels? And if the business is steady? And is there any technical reason you've been kind of shooting for around that level for three quarters?\nMike Hennigan: Keith, it's Mike. Now it's a more coincidence. And to be honest with you, we were on that pace, and we were going to change the number just so it wouldn't be the exact same number. But pretty much we had said to ourselves, we're going to deploy about this much in that arena. We obviously did not do distribution for a couple quarters. And now we decided to pull that trigger. But, overall, like I said, it's dynamic, we're thinking about it, quarter-to-quarter, we're obviously also looking a little bit into the future. So that, the fact that it turned out to be the exact same number is more coincidence than and I'll say, designed to be exactly that.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And I am actually showing no more questions. Thank you.\nKristina Kazarian: Great. Well, thank you for joining us. And thank you for your interest in MPLX. Should you have additional questions, or would you like clarification on any of the topics discussed this morning, members of our Investor Relations team will be available to take your calls. Thank you, everybody.\nOperator: Thank you all for participating in today's conference. You may disconnect your line and enjoy the rest of your day.",

            "name": "Tim Aydt",
            "content": "This is Tim Aydt and thanks for the question. Take my mask off here. While it's true that there is an increase in the index that would increase revenue on the FERC regulated assets, I think it's really important to understand that this is not a direct flow through to the bottom line. The whole purpose of the index is to offset higher costs that we incur during these inflationary periods. So for FERC pipelines, we've historically adjusted rates that are in line with what is allowed by FERC as a means to cover these higher costs. Now, most of our non-FERC regulated pipelines and storage assets, they also have built in escalators to help offset some of these inflationary costs. Now, these are not always based on CPI and PPI. Sometimes they're flat rate adjustments. So that's a little bit of the background on those but I would say for reference, only about a third of our logistics and storage. EBITDA is generated from FERC regulated assets. So it's really a mix of a lot of different things, PPI flat rate adjustments, et cetera. So, this is Tim Aydt. I'll take that one. We continue to be really bullish on natural gas and the NGL growth. I do believe that we're well positioned in the Permian in particular, to take advantage of the investments we've made thus far.

            "name": "John Quaid",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Slide 5 outlines the third quarter operational and financial performance highlights for our logistics and storage segment. L&S segment adjusted EBITDA increased by $11 million, comparing third quarter 2021 to 2020. Pipeline volumes are up 17% and terminal volumes were up 13% year-over-year, as the industry rebounded from the pandemic. The benefits of these higher throughputs were somewhat offset by the effects of lower marine transportation rates. Moving on to our gathering and processing segment, Slide 6 provides its third quarter operational and financial performance highlights. G&P segment adjusted EBITDA increased by $43 million, comparing third quarter 2021 to 2020, largely driven by higher NGL prices. For the third quarter, NGL prices averaged $0.96 per gallon, more than double the $0.45 per gallon average for the third quarter of last year. As a reminder, every $0.05 change in the NGL basket is worth roughly $20 million to our annual results. Overall, gathered volumes are roughly consistent year-over-year, while processing and fractionated volumes were each down 2%. In the Marcellus, gathering volumes were up 5%, process volumes decreased 1% and fractionated volumes increased 2% relative to the third quarter of last year. Across the basins where we operate, we are seeing different levels of activity in response to current market conditions. In the northeast, despite higher natural gas and NGL prices, producers continue to focus on strengthening their balance sheets and prioritizing free cash flow over volume growth. Additionally, takeaway capacity constraints have continued to limit production. However, we are seeing increased activity and volume growth in the Permian and in the Bakken. Moving to our third quarter financial highlights on Slide 7, total adjusted EBITDA was 1.4 billion up 4% from the prior year for the reasons Mike discussed earlier, or I discussed earlier. And distributed cashflow was 1.2 billion, an increase of almost 12% from the prior year. We returned 900 million to unitholders with 745 million of distributions paid and 155 million in repurchases of common units held by the public. As of September 30, we had about 500 million remaining available under the current $1 billion repurchase authorization. As Mike discussed today, we declared a quarterly cash distribution of $1.28 per common unit for the third quarter, including a base distribution amount of $0.705 per common unit, and a special distribution amount of $0.575 per common unit. Based on our confidence in the business, we increased the base distribution amount by 2.5% over the second quarter 2021 distribution. The distribution will be paid on November 19, to common unitholders of record as of November 12. The adjusted distribution coverage ratio for the third quarter, excluding the effects of the special distribution amount was 1.61x. As we stated on our last call, our commitment to lowering our cost structure has resulted in a $300 million structural reduction in our annual operating costs when compared to 2019. Looking forward, we do expect higher project related expenses in the fourth quarter. Last quarter, we estimated an increase in project related expenses in the second half of the year of approximately 75 million as compared to our quarterly run rate in the first half of the year. We experienced some of these higher expenses in our L&S segment results in the third quarter and based on the expected timing for completion of certain project and maintenance work. We currently expect increased costs of up to 40 million to affect fourth quarter results as compared to the third quarter. Lastly, as we approach the end of the year, we are lowering our growth capital spending guidance for 2021 by an additional 150 million, down to 550 million and with expected maintenance capital of about 100 million for the year. Our total capital spending and investments for 2021 is expected to be about $650 million. With our reduced 2021 capital spending forecast, we do anticipate a higher run rate for capital spending in the fourth quarter as compared to the first three quarters of the year. Looking forward, we continue to pursue growth opportunities in our core business, as well as opportunities in energy evolution, which is likely to require greater capital spending and investments in 2022 than 2021. We will not be commenting on next year's plan capital spending on today's call, we will share guidance for 2022 on next quarter's call. Slide 8 provides a summary of key financial and balance sheet information. We ended the quarter with total debt of just under $20 billion and a leverage ratio of 3.7x. During the quarter we redeemed the 1 billion floating rate senior notes due September 22 with cash and available liquidity including our intercompany loan with MPC. We currently have 1.4 billion outstanding on our intercompany loan agreement. Our intent is to refinance these borrowings sometime in the future with timing depending on market and other conditions. In closing, given current business conditions and our commitment to strict capital discipline and a low-cost structure, we expect to continue to generate strong cash flow, enhancing our financial flexibility to invest and grow the business while also providing the opportunity for incremental return of capital to unitholders. Now let me turn the call back over to Kristina. I just wanted to emphasize some of Mike's comments there as well, right. There were some number of items that kind of aligned for us this year that, again, are things we're going to have to take a look and understand what those look like in the future. So certainly a broader approach to kind of incremental return of capital when it's available. But again, that'll be dependent on, what the market conditions are at the time, what kind of cash flow we're generating, et cetera. So, certainly something we'll continue to look at look at. But there may be some quarters where, we're not talking about having the same conversation in other quarters where we are. Yes. No, John, you might have answered it with your last comment. Right. We'll have guidance for next year on next quarters call. But certainly, trying to make sure you guys understand the number is going to be higher next year. If you kind of take the guidance we gave for this year, 550 million on growth and 100 for maintenance, right, that applies about 200 to 210 of growth in the fourth quarter and about 50 of maintenance. Again, some of that's driven by the timing of projects, as we roll into next year. So, certainly higher, but not -- we'll share those numbers on next quarter's call because part of what happened to us this year, in addition to really taking a much stricter look around capital discipline. We would have had some projects that were just deferred as we were coming out of COVID that kind of pushed things later in the year and into next year. So again, looking for higher capital next year and we'll talk about that on next quarter's call. Good morning, Theresa. It's John. Yes, that's definitely similar to some of our maintenance capital, it can be a little bit lumpy, right, and how that kind of happens over the year, which is why we were trying to flag that earlier in the year as well. So definitely a higher level in Q4, but that wouldn't imply that we'd be on that run rate going forward. Actually, Theresa, it's not a number we've disclosed."

            "content": "Michael, this is Greg Floerke. Yes, I think that the producers have been in free cash flow positive mode and maintenance drilling mode. And there's been constraints as we operated high levels of utilization, both in processing and in terms of takeaway pipe. Certainly as more residue gas pipeline takeaway capacity becomes available, there is that opportunity to increase drilling and volume. The processing capacity is fairly tight, but there is still potential there for growth. The other thing that I would mention is that the [shale] [ph] cracker in North of Pennsylvania is scheduled to come online mid next year, we will drive increased recovery of ethane from gas that also will free up capacity and the residue lines. And we will increase utilization of our deethanizer plant as well. So those things clearly could drive production, gas prices and NGL prices are obviously supportive of more rich gas production. But we're -- that's so open to what the producers decide to do."

            "name": "Mike Hennigan",
            "content": "Thanks, Kristina. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our call. Earlier today we reported adjusted EBITDA for the quarter of $1.4 billion and total return of capital of $900 million through 745 million in distributions, and 155 million of unit repurchases. Looking at our year-to-date results, a number of factors have a line to allow us to generate very strong cash flow. We have benefited from lower capital spending, strong NGL prices and proceeds from asset optimization efforts. These tailwinds along with solid business performance, and cost reduction efforts have combined to result in just over $1 billion of cash flow available for deployment above our current capital spending and distribution requirements. We've returned $465 million on this capital to unitholders through year-to-date unit repurchases. We believe some investors prefer unit repurchases while others prefer cash return and after several quarters of employing unit repurchases for incremental return of capital, today, we announced an increased third quarter distribution of $1.34 billion. The increased distribution include the special distribution amount of about 600 million and a 2.5% increase in the partnerships based distribution amount, reflecting our confidence in the business. Special distribution amount is one way to allow all unitholders to immediately recognize the benefit of our strong cash flow this year. We also believe that distributions can be a more tax efficient way to return capital unitholders versus unit repurchases. For 2021, we have now announced a total of $2.8 billion of distributions to unitholders on top of 465 million of unit repurchases. Moving to business updates, we're making progress in our portfolio optimization efforts with our announcement this morning that we are pursuing strategic alternatives for our Alaskan logistics and storage operations, which could include a sale. We also advanced our key growth projects in the Permian related to crude, natural gas and NGL transportation to other basin. The Wink to Webster crude pipeline in which MPLX has a 15% ownership interest continues to play segments in the service and we expect this activity to continue through the remainder of the year. Consistent with our focus on projects with lower return risk, pipeline system as 100% of its contractual capacity committed with long-term minimum volume commitments. Last quarter, we announced the Whistler Natural Gas pipeline in which we have a 38% ownership interest was placed in service and it will continue to ramp up through 2022. This pipeline will provide approximately 2 billion cubic feet per day of incremental natural gas transport capacity to the Gulf Coast markets from the Permian Basin. The Whistler pipeline is also backed by long-term minimum volume commitments and we expect volumes to increase throughout 2022. Finally, the NGL takeaway solution, which will provide 125,000 barrels per day of long-haul NGL service from the Permian to Sweeney, Texas, was placed in service in October. We continue to pursue opportunities to grow our base business, including expansion of our integrated natural gas and NGL value chains in certain strategic regions and opportunities and support of MPCs expansion in liquid renewable fuels. We also continue to evaluate a number of other low carbon energy growth opportunities and are especially focused on those where we can leverage our competitive advantage through technologies that are complementary with our expertise and our asset footprint. For example, in MPLX along with MPC is among the company supporting large scale deployment of carbon capture and storage to help decarbonize industrial facilities in the Houston area. These collective efforts could safely capture and store approximately 50 million metric tons of CO2 per year by 2030 and about 100 million metric tons by 2040. Working with our industrial companies and regulators in this energy rich region is a critical component of assuring long-term reliable fuel supplies for a Sustainable Energy diverse future. Overall, we continue to focus on identifying and efficiently executing high return projects to drive further growth for MPLX and we expect our growth capital spending to be higher in '22 than '21. Shifting to Slide 4, last quarter, we discussed the publication of our sustainability and climate reports that highlight the environmental, social and governance aspects of our business. Our focus on leading and sustainable energy positions us to deliver strong results in this space from lowering the carbon intensity of our operations and products to improving energy efficiency and conserving natural resources, while using innovative technologies to do it. We believe the targets we are setting and our transparency disclosure on how we plan to achieve these targets, position as well for the future. On our website, we have recently published our 2020 sustainability highlights and MPLX is focused on our methane reduction targets through tangible pathways, such as implementing robust outdoor monitoring programs, replacing guest driven pneumatic control valves, replacing compressor rod packing, minimizing emissions from pipeline launchers and receivers and optimizing maintenance vending. In short, we continue to challenge ourselves to lead in sustainable energy by meeting the needs of today while investing in an energy diverse future that creates shared value for all of our stakeholders. Now, let me turn the call over to John to discuss our operational and financial results for the quarter. Thanks, Brian. This is Mike. Let me give you the long winded answer. Hopefully this will give everybody a little bit more color stack why we came out with the return of capital that we did this quarter. So, first of all, at a high level, we still believe that our balance sheet and our commitment to an investment grade rating is paramount. The way we think of capital allocation is, we're going to take care of our assets. So we're going to have sustaining capital as a high priority. We've had a base distribution amount for quite some time here. And I just want to point out that that base distribution is a pretty high payout ratio and we'd never cut, despite some of the troubles that others have run into. But once we get through that, then we have capital available for deployment. It can be in growth capital. And John talked a little bit about that buybacks, an additional distribution amount, which we called a special distribution. We could increase the base, which we've also done this quarter. We'll talk about that in a second and debt reduction. I'll start first stack with debt, we're very comfortable. We said for many, many, many quarters that we're comfortable that we have stable cash flows, and then a leverage ratio of around four times works for us. Currently, we're a little below that. We're running around 3.7x. So do we think the balance sheet is in terrific shape and we generated a lot of cash. And the way that I'd like you guys have the takeaway is that capital, it's available for deployment is a dynamic decision that we're going to make quarter-to-quarter. And it's depending on market conditions, our business needs and what we see in the current environment. Obviously, we've been through a lot over the last year and a half, with the pandemic and coming out of it. But hopefully, the market has seen something that we've been trying to say for a while that we have stable cash flows, in the sense business, we're generating cash beyond our distribution and sustaining capital needs and now beyond our growth capital needs, and we just have an amount that was available for deployment. And our view that all unitholders to your point, Brian, all unitholders would immediately benefit from this special distribution amount, as well as us continuing to buy back units as well. We've continued that pace now for several quarters in a row. So we're doing a little bit of both. And we've also bumped up our base distribution by 2.5% as well. So all of those factors come into play but I guess the biggest takeaway that I'd like you to think about is, we want to be in a position of financial flexibility which we've achieved. And going forward, it'll be a dynamic decision based on market conditions, business needs, and what we're feeling at the time is the best deployment, for all of our unitholders. Yes, Brian, I'm going to let Tim give you some background on that whole PPI situation. John, thanks for that question. So, additional follow up, what I was trying to say to the previous question is, it is going to be a dynamic situation, I don't think you should take this as a one-off. That's an important point that you're bringing up. We plan to continue to have that financial flexibility. And will ebb and flow a little bit on buybacks, distribution amounts, whether we call in special or whatever term you want to use. We're also going to be very conscious of what's happening in the business. As we mentioned, in our prepared remarks, the capital this year is a little lighter than we would normally think, for this business. So we'll give a little bit more guidance next quarter on where our capital expectation is, but at least for this quarter, we're trying to tell you, it's going to be a little higher than where we are this quarter, for a lot of reasons. Some of its timing, some of its capital discipline that we've been employed. So I guess the important point that I'm trying to emphasize and hopefully everybody gets this is that, we're going to continue in a commodity business that has a lot of ups and downs and variabilities, we're going to continue, each and every quarter to evaluate the situation examine where the business needs are, look at the market conditions and try and make a determination as to what is the best return of capital. I should add that, you've heard me say this in the past, I'm a huge believer that there's two parts to this business, there's a return on capital and we very much believe in growing our earnings, and this is a growth vehicle for us. So that's an area of emphasis that I don't want to get lost in this whole return of capital. But both return on and return of capital are very important to us. And we're trying to maximize, the impacts of both of those. So, when it comes to return of, we're going to look at our base, we're going to look at whether that should get an incremental adjustment, which we did this quarter. We'll continue to evaluate that. We'll continue to evaluate how much cash flows that we're generating. As John mentioned, in his prepared remarks, it's been a strong year, from a lot of perspectives. So from that standpoint, we've generated over $1 billion of cash flow through three quarters. Obviously, without guidance to the fourth, we expect to have a little more on top of that, as we progress. So it's been a very strong cash flow year. We've returned 455 of unit repurchases. We're going to continue to engage in that program as well. But we thought it was appropriate to have an immediate return to the unitholders as well. Michael, we still have an overall strategic plan to consider where we think core assets are versus not. I've said many calls that the bid ask has been too wide for us to consider. I would tell you that that bid ask is narrowing. But at the same time, we are very comfortable still with the assets that we have in place, we don't have anything, I use the term on the front burner. But if we maintain this type of activity and the commodity prices stay where they are and there's a little bit of a renewed interest, then maybe there's a transaction that could occur at some point. Nothing right now on the horizon, we're interested, but we're also very happy with where our assets are. And my philosophy has been, all of our assets need to generate free cash. We're in that mode, we continue to be in that mode throughout all the eight of the basins that we're in. So I think overall, we're still happy with the situation we have, but we'd like to optimize the portfolio for the long-term if the situation arises. But it's not something that we have to do. Keith, it's Mike. Now it's a more coincidence. And to be honest with you, we were on that pace, and we were going to change the number just so it wouldn't be the exact same number. But pretty much we had said to ourselves, we're going to deploy about this much in that arena. We obviously did not do distribution for a couple quarters. And now we decided to pull that trigger. But, overall, like I said, it's dynamic, we're thinking about it, quarter-to-quarter, we're obviously also looking a little bit into the future. So that, the fact that it turned out to be the exact same number is more coincidence than and I'll say, designed to be exactly that."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.\nKristina Kazarian: Thanks, Amber. Good morning and welcome to the MPLX second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. The slides that accompany this call may be found on our website at mplx.com, under the Investor tab. Joining me today on the call today are; Mike Hennigan, Chairman and CEO; Pam Beall, CFO; and other members of the executive team. We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statements and the non-GAAP disclaimer on Slide 2. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the call and during the question-and-answer session that follows. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Hennigan: Thanks, Kristina. Good morning and thank you for joining our call. This morning, we announced that Pam Beall will be retiring after more than 25 year of service. Pam has played a critical role in many of our milestones and has been an excellent CFO, as we transitioned to partnership and to generating free cash after distributions and capital. Her financial guidance, strategic input and solid counsel have been understated and she will be missed. The Board of Directors and I wish her well in her much deserved retirement.  I would also like to congratulate John Quaid on his appointment. We look forward to continued strategic growth and value creation under his financial leadership. John will hit the ground running as he's been part of the Marathon team for many years, and very deserving of this opportunity.  With that, let me start by saying that, earlier today we reported adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2021 of $1.4 billion. Our operating results this quarter represented 12% increase in EBITDA from the second quarter of last year and a 10% increase in EBITDA from the second quarter of 2019. This performance highlights the resiliency of the business irrespective of the challenging macroeconomic environment. Furthermore, the company generated excess cash flow beyond our capital and distribution requirements for the third consecutive quarter, enabling the continued return of capital to our unitholders through unit repurchases.  In our L&S segment, throughput volumes continued to rebound with higher product demand and increased utilization at MPC's refineries. In our G&P segment we continue to see high processing and fractionation utilization in the Marcellus. We are maintaining strict capital discipline and efficiently executing our growth plans on high return portfolio of investments. Both the Whistler natural gas pipeline in the Permian and the Smithburg 1 processing plant in the Marcellus began service in July.  Looking forward to the remainder half of the year, we continue to expect completion of the Wink to Webster crude pipeline and the NGL takeaway system, which are both part of our integrated crude and natural gas logistics systems from the Permian to the U.S. Gulf Coast.  In the G&P segment, the Preakness processing plant in the Delaware Basin remains on track to support anticipated incremental volume from producer customers in 2022. Our continued focus on identifying and efficiently executing high return projects will support further growth for MPLX.  As part of our work to advance low carbon opportunities, we are actively engaged in evaluating new opportunities for the business, especially where we see technologies complementary with our expertise and asset footprint. The MPLX footprint spans a large portfolio of assets creating a robust list of opportunities we continue to evaluate. We also continue to identify opportunities to structurally lower our costs and drive efficiencies in the business. When we look at our operating expenses, our 2020 controllable costs were more than $200 million lower compared to 2019. We continue to improve on this performance with controllable costs in 2021 expected to be incrementally a $100 million lower than 2020 for a total of $300 million lower compared to in 2019.  Our focus on strict capital discipline combined with growing EBITDA continues to enable the business to generate excess cash after self-funding our distribution and capital program. We remain committed to prioritizing the return of capital with nearly $900 million returned to the unitholders this quarter through distributions and unit repurchases.  As we look into the second half of '21, we expect to continue to generate excess cash after all capital investments and distributions. And as we stated previously, we plan to execute repurchases based on free cash flow, the current as well as anticipated needs of the business and the market environment.  Finally, this quarter, we continued to enhance our ESG commitments and disclosures with the recent publication of both our annual Sustainability and Perspectives on Climate-Related Scenarios reports. Looking at Slide 4, I want to take a moment to discuss these reports in more detail. Our Sustainability and Climate Report highlights that our approach to sustainability spans the environmental, social, and governance aspects of our business. Within this year's Sustainability Report, we've included a midstream specific supplement, highlighting the specific topics and metrics that are most relevant and impactful to our industry. In our Climate Report, you will see we adjust our climate scenarios annually to maintain consistency with the latest IEA projections, including the sustainable development scenario and the IEA's new net-zero emissions by 2050 case.  We continue to make progress on our targets to reduce midstream methane emissions intensity 50% by 2025 from 2016 levels. Through 2020, we've achieved 44% of this target, a move that further enhances the low-carbon profile of our growing natural gas business. In addition, we've achieved 45% of our target to reduce freshwater withdrawal intensity 20% by 2030 from 2016 levels. In short, we are challenging ourselves to lead in sustainable energy by meeting the needs of today while investing in an energy diverse future that creates shared value for all of our stakeholders.  Now, let me turn the call over to Pam to discuss our operational and financial results for the quarter. \nPam Beall: Thanks, Mike. Slide 5 outlines the second quarter operational and financial performance highlights for the Logistics and Storage segment. Our Logistics and Storage segment EBITDA increased $108 million for the second quarter year-over-year, despite headwinds from decreases in marine transportation fees and decreases on certain equity method investments. The quarter benefited from increased pipeline and terminal throughputs, as well as the team\u2019s focus on operating expense reductions and business efficiencies.  Our pipeline volumes returned to pre-pandemic levels and were higher than the second quarter of 2019. We continue to make good progress on our integrated crude oil and natural gas logistics systems from the Permian to the U.S. Gulf Coast. The Wink to Webster crude oil pipeline in which MPLX has a 15% ownership interest continues to play segments into service, and we expect this activity to continue throughout the remainder of the year. Consistent with our focus on projects with lower return risk, the pipeline system has 100% of its contractable capacity committed with long-term minimum volume commitments.  On July 1st, the Wink -- the Whistler natural gas pipeline was placed into service providing approximately 2 billion cubic feet per day of incremental natural gas transport capacity to the Texas Gulf Coast markets from the Permian Basin. Similar to the Wink to Webster project, the Whistler Pipeline in which we have a 38% ownership interest is backed by long-term minimum volume commitments. And we expect volumes and EBITDA contributions to ramp up throughout 2022.  And finally, we continue to work towards an in-service date in the fourth quarter this year for the NGL takeaway solution, which will provide long haul NGL service from the Permian to Sweeney, Texas. On Slide 6, moving to our Gathering and Processing business, we provide second quarter operational and financial highlights for the segment. For the second quarter of 2021 Gathering and Processing EBITDA increased $39 million from the second quarter of 2020. Overall gathered and processed volumes were lower than the same period last year, while in the Marcellus process volumes increased 2% and fractionated volumes increased 3% relative to the second quarter of 2020. The impact of lower volumes was more than offset by higher NGL prices that were $0.41 per gallon higher than the second quarter of 2020. This segment also benefited from continued focus on lowering operating expenses. With inventories low and global demand driving exports of NGLs, we expect strong NGL prices could continue.  During the second quarter, we completed commissioning of the 200 million cubic feet per day Smithburg 1 processing plant in the Marcellus, and the facility was placed into service on July 1. We continue to expect the Preakness processing plant in the Delaware Basin to be placed into service next year.  Our outlook for the rest of 2021 remains cautiously optimistic with differing impacts across our footprint. For example, we experienced increased activity in the Bakken in the second quarter, which we expect to continue in the second half of the year. We also expect increased activity with volume growth in the Permian.  In the Marcellus, our assets are highly utilized and producers\u2019 drilling plans continue to focus on strengthening their balance sheets and prioritize generating free cash flow over volume growth. This allows us to generate free cash flow to be deployed in other basins and add to our financial flexibility.  Moving to our second quarter financial highlights on Slide 7. Total adjusted EBITDA was $1.4 billion and distributable cash flow was $1.3 billion for the quarter. MPLX grew both EBITDA and distributable cash flow compared to the second quarter of 2020. The second quarter of 2021 results include non-cash impairment charges of approximately $42 million within our G&P segment related to minor changes in the portfolio. This is part of our ongoing evaluation and optimization of our assets in non-core basins.  We will continue to evaluate opportunities to sell or joint venture such operations, where there's a value creation opportunity. And while macro trends have improved for Gathering and Processing, valuations for assets in non-core basins really have not been compelling.  Our distributable cash flow generated provided strong distribution coverage of 1.73 times for the quarter, and we paid $729 million in distributions to preferred and common unitholders. During the second quarter, we returned an additional $155 million of capital through the repurchase of common units held by the public. This brings the total to $343 million since the unit repurchase program was launched in the fourth quarter of 2020. We now have $657 million remaining under our current Board authorization for the repurchase of common units.  Last quarter, we estimated an increase in expenses related to project work ramping up through December month of up to 75 million in each of the second and third quarters. While there are many factors that influenced the timing of project and maintenance spend, we do still anticipate higher project expenses of approximately $75 million in both the third and fourth quarters compared to the first quarter.  We remain committed to our strategic initiatives of lowering our cost structure. As we stated on the last call, we're confident we delivered $200 million of lower costs in 2020 compared to 2019. Those lower costs continue in 2021, and we expect our total controllable operating costs for 2021 will reflect an additional $100 million of reductions from 2020, increasing to approximately $300 million in total structural cost reductions made in the business since 2019. And lastly, as we look into the second half of the year, we still anticipate a higher run rate for capital spending compared to the first half of the year. But total growth capital spending is now expected to be at least $100 million lower than originally guided at $800 million for 2021. This is dependent on the timing of some of our core business capital spending, as well as some renewable and low-carbon investment opportunities we are evaluating. Slide 8 provides a summary of key financial and balance sheet information. We ended the quarter with a leverage ratio of 3.7 times. Today, we also announced the redemption of the 1 billion callable floating rate senior notes due September 2022. It is our intention to refinance these notes sometime in the future with timing dependent on market and other conditions. And with our ongoing focus on lowering our costs, our strict capital discipline, we expect to continue to generate excess free cash flow that will enhance our financial flexibility, including the ability to return incremental capital to our unitholders.  And before I turn the call over to Kristina for Q&A, I want to add a few comments about my retirement from Marathon, which I prefer to call the next chapter of my professional career. Because those who know me know that retirement in the traditional sense does not fit me. Since 1978 when my career began, I've enjoyed a number of roles across multiple industries. However, my 26 years in energy with Marathon have been the most rewarding. We've all seen amazing results under Mike's leadership as CEO. And as a unitholder of MPLX and a shareholder of MPC, I look forward to seeing the results of Mike's vision for the company unfold. No doubt, the company will remain a leader as the industry embraces an energy-diverse future.  I know you'll all enjoy working with John Quaid, who will assume the MPLX Chief Financial Officer role effective September 1st. I will continue in an advisory capacity through November 30th this year to assist with the transition.  And with that, I'd also like to give my thanks to Kristina and her team for the way they support our investors and our executives. And Kristina, we can begin the Q&A.\nKristina Kazarian : Sounds great. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from John Mackay with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead. \nJohn Mackay: Hey, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for the time and congrats to you, Pam, on your next chapter, and John on the new role. Just wanted to start on the buyback, so it\u2019s better than we expected but actually consumed a kind of lower share of retained cash flow than we'd expect it kind of on a relative basis. Just curious, if that represents any kind of shift in the capital allocation priorities for you guys, and I don't know, whether it was a coincidence that it was the same dollar amount as the first quarter? Thanks. \nMike Hennigan : Hey, John. This is Mike. You probably shouldn't read much into it other than what we've said in the past, which is we're happy to be in an excess cash flow situation. Right now, we still believe where we're trading that buybacks make a lot of sense to us. At the same time to your point about being a little bit lower than the retained cash is, I've mentioned this for a couple of quarters, we've had a couple of things out there, some vulnerabilities that we wanted to make sure that we protect. That's what was one that seems to have played itself out a little bit, Tesoro High Plains Pipeline was another. So keeping some dry powder was part of our goal here. So again, it's a good position to be in. We have a lot of flexibility. I want to believe that we're going to continue to evaluate it constantly in real time. So I like to use the word dynamic. I know we ended up with about the same momentum, mainly because we kind of put a base plan together and then we have a little bit of excess dry powder that we'll decide as time goes by. So we're in a good position. For us going forward, we think all avenues are open to us. Debt reduction, additional buybacks, distribution, anything along those lines is all open to us with the main point being is that we're at a point of financial flexibility, generating dry powder and having the ability to see what's the best value creation for our unitholders.\nJohn Mackay: All right. That's helpful. Thanks. Maybe I'll ask one of the operating side. G&P a little bit weaker than we expected. Can you maybe just talk a little bit more about the potential impact from the Sherwood and Mobley outages? And then also maybe more broadly about the Utica outlook overall? Because that's a little weaker as well. \nMike Hennigan: John, I'll let Greg take that one. \nGreg Floerke : All right. John, Greg Floerke here. With regard to the Sherwood, Mobley outage, I believe that referring to the outage that we had on June 30, we did have -- early afternoon on June 30, we detected a minor release of product at our -- just upstream of our Majorsville, West Virginia plant. And that turned out to be on the 20-inch y-grade pipeline, which serves our Mobley and Sherwood facilities upstream. We did isolate that release to a leak around a valve on the 20-inch line. It took several days to de-inventory the line and reduce pressure and to make sure we had a safe environment to repair the leak. That repair was made and completed on July 3. So the period from about half of the day on the 30 through July 3 was the impact period. Both of those upstream plants were shut down. The Majorsville plant itself was returned to service fairly quickly after we determined the site was safe.  The impact we estimate of the repair and then the opportunity cost was approximately in the $6 million range. So probably a little bit more of that split over to falling over into the next quarter for a few days. So that really addresses I think the Sherwood, Mobley outage.  More broadly regarding Utica, we look at Utica and Marcellus as they're interconnected. We have an interconnected purely ethane pipeline as well as our fractionation and our C3 plus y-grade pipelines. And we have -- one time we're at high utilization in the Utica on our rich gas gathering and processing side. That's continued to decline over the past few years as the focus has shifted to more dry or lean gas drilling in the Utica, but also continued focus on accelerated drilling in the Marcellus ridge.  And as you've seen, we've just had our third straight quarter of 90% -- higher than 90% utilization in the Marcellus, a little bit of that is at the expense of probably drilling and focus in the Utica ridge. The Utica is a little bit deeper. Wells are a little bit expensive and more complex. We think long-term, there still will be plenty of opportunity and -- for drilling in that area and the producers are still -- the economics are there, they're positive, particularly at current NGL prices. It's just really a matter of prioritization I think at this point. We also need to look at the fact that the Northeast overall is in really good balance. Not only are we at high utilization, but the outgoing residue gas and NGL pipelines are nearly full. And any growth in the Utica would sort of offset growth in the Marcella. So it really, is in a pretty good balanced situation.  But we think long-term, we did see some decline also year-over-year in gathering, particularly in Utica and part of that's driven by the dry gas area, which is still a strong area. That really is a matter of timing and in some of the cash flow preservation and focus related to the COVID demand destruction and pricing last year. Even one quarter of delay in the drilling program results in one more quarter of decline. And as we know, all of these shale wells decline fairly rapidly and need to be replaced with maintenance drilling. So we look at that as a timing issue, which hopefully -- and we think will recover. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Go ahead please. \nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning. I just wanted to kind of follow up, I guess on the low-carbon opportunity that you mentioned in the slides and some of your commentary today. I was just wondering, if we might be able to kind of peel back the onion a little bit, as far as what specific initiatives there could be more kind of near term in nature. Just trying to think of what's real now versus later in your mind? \nMike Hennigan : Jeremy, I'll let Tim give some color on that. \nTimothy Aydt: So good morning, Jeremy, this is Tim. I think in addition to what Mike indicated in the opening there, we certainly are actively engaged in many new opportunities and they may range from CCUS to RNG, CNG, LNG. Obviously, we're looking to support renewable diesel and SAF over the course of time. I think really when you look at our nationwide footprint, it really spans a large portfolio of assets. And I think this in turn does indeed create that robust list of opportunities that Mike mentioned.  We certainly have a lot of flexibility. But at the same time we believe this is a multi-decade energy evolution that's taking place. And I think it's important for us to take a longer term strategic view. We understand that many of the energy evolution projects may not yet be economical, but we believe over time, these projects will be developed that evolve the energy space without sacrificing our returns. As you know, we're very capital disciplined here and we're going to remain so. I think when you look at shorter term, certainly the renewable diesel support of the two refineries that MPC has converted, will provide opportunities. Our assets are well-positioned to run these drop in fuels. So I think that's the shorter term.  I think the medium to longer term is probably going to revolve around things like carbon capture and sequestration. We're bullish on the fact that there'll be a CCS project at some point in the future along the Gulf Coast, given the emitters that exist down there. So I think maybe that addresses some of the longer-term stuff. So I'll leave it at that. \nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks. And Whistler come online. Good to see that entering service here. Just wondering, if you could provide your thoughts as far as Permian Basin supply demand, takeaway on the natural gas side. I guess, even with Mexico, possibly taking a couple of these over the next couple of years still seems like the possibility of a new gas pipe maybe being needed late '23 into '24 could be there. And just wondering what your thoughts are on the supply demand balance for takeaway there?\nTimothy Aydt: Okay. I'll take that as well. Certainly, the return of the energy commodity prices has certainly driven, I would consider, an improved outlook for the U.S. shale production. I think that's resulted in the fact that some of the existing capacity is starting to fill within the existing midstream space. But I think at the same time we witnessed many of our producer customers remaining very focused on capital discipline, especially over the past year, which I think suggest bringing additional production to the market really will require a thoughtful strategy around whether or not they're also willing to support and back additional long haul pipes. I think at the end of the day, it's a balancing act for the producers and the midstreamers. And I think the market will dictate the outcome as it always does. But I think relative to the timing that you've mentioned, I think there's a lot of industry chatter out there that suggests maybe in the '24- '25 timeframe that takeaway capacity will once again be constrained. \nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful. And Pam, best of luck in retirement there. Thanks. \nOperator: Next we'll go to Shneur Gershuni with UBS.\nShneur Gershuni: First off, Pam, it\u2019s been a pleasure working with you all these years and you will be definitely be missed but excited to hear that you are opening up a new chapter. Please -- looking forward to you enjoying that and please stay in touch. Maybe just to pivot to a few questions here. With the -- with your refined product system over the last year and a half as we've worked through COVID, the MVC has kind of protected you on the downside but there's also has been I guess an uneven recovery just in terms of -- volumes coming back but not through the MVCs. Are we at a stage now where we\u2019re fully through the MVCs across your system, and that as we see volumes get added -- as we have a recovery that we can see a 100% of the volume translation at the EBITDA from this stage going forward? \nPam Beall: Shneur, first of all, thanks for the kind comments. But I would say that we are -- we've returned to a pretty robust volumes and they have somewhat correlated with the Marathon\u2019s refining utilization now. The one thing that happens on the pipeline systems is that with the minimum volume commitments, there are some provisions that some of those volumes can be recaptured. And so you'll see some changes quarter-to-quarter on deferred revenue as we recognize revenue. If there's a period of time when the minimum volume commitments there cannot be reached to, then we'll recognize it in the quarter. But -- so there's some lumpy -- sometimes lumpiness that you'll see. But you'll be able to see that kind of work through the system. But yes, overall, I would say that we're pretty much back to the pre-COVID levels that refined products side has not been quite as robust returning as the crude side. But -- and we've also seen a nice uptick in the terminals. \nShneur Gershuni: Definitely appreciate that. And maybe, as we sort of think about '22, realize we've been out of the stages of getting guidance. But you've been fairly active on your buyback program, which I think has been much appreciated by investors. Just kind of thinking about how you're thinking about it with respect to '22, sort of toggling between how you're thinking about CapEx for '22. Are there any projects that you're in a permitting stage that you haven't quite talked about yet, that could FID, that can sort of change that balance? Or as we sit here in August of '21, it's kind of getting late to FID something that could materially impact '22 CapEx. Just kind of wondering about your thoughts on that and what you're kind of noodling at this stage right now?\nMike Hennigan : Shneur, it's Mike, I'm going answer that in a second. But let me make one other comment to what you just asked previously on pipeline volumes. One of the things that we are benefiting from at the moment that\u2019s probably not sustainable long-term is, the virus is still a major impact in the system and it's more outside the U.S. than it is inside the U.S. So export volumes in the Marathon system were down as a result and MPLX benefits from that as pipeline used inside the domestic system gets used more. So that'll probably change itself a little bit once we continue to battle through this pandemic. But that\u2019s just one comment that I wanted to give you on the pipelines on that. To your second question is, yes. I mean, Tim said it pretty well to Jeremy's question. We have a bunch of projects that we're watching and looking at. As everybody gets to know my DNA more is I'm really strict on capital. I want to make sure that we get very, very high returns. So we're going to be, I'll say, cautious to deploy capital unless we really feel very comfortable with the projects. We have a bunch that we're watching. Tim mentioned a couple in the alternative energy space. We are going to evolve our portfolio as that evolves, but some of those projects today, just they're not reaching a hurdle of return that we would like. So I think they'll get there over time. I think some of these things will play itself out over time.  In the meantime, we're going to stay cautious. And that's why, as we set out for the year, we figured about $800 million of capital, we've been trending lower than that. And Pam in her prepared remarks kind of said, we're probably at least $100 million under that. And I don't view that as a bad thing because if it delays into next year and the opportunity becomes more mature, we become more comfortable with the returns, then we'll deploy the capital. But as a general rule, Shneur, I think the business is largely a return of capital business. We're doing a large return of capital via distribution. We've added to that return of capital via buybacks. So that's an important part.  At the same time, though, I am a big believer that you need return on capital as well, I mean, that continues to fund the growth, but we just want to do it in a very disciplined way. So we have stuff that we're thinking about. We haven't disclosed anything to your point. We haven't FIDed or disclosed anything because we're going to wait till it's really at a point that we think is a good return. And then that way we're checking off return on capital as strongly as we're checking off return of capital. Hope that helps?\nShneur Gershuni: No, it does. Really very much appreciate it. Thank you again for the update today. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Spiro Dounis with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Go ahead please.\nSpiro Dounis: First question maybe over to you, Pam, just on the CapEx for the remainder of the year. Just curious, what's going to make up that capital spending in the back half as you noted kind of trending sort of lower than that $800 million. But I think even with that, still struggling with kind of build up to it with a lot of these projects entering service now. So just curious, like what comprises that build up? \nPam Beall : Yes. Well, certainly on the Gathering and Processing side of the business, we're going to see some -- and we would expect a little higher spend in the second half of the year. We have been very constrained across the entire system on our capital spending. And as we entered the first quarter, we were extremely strict. Second quarter, we had expected a little bit higher ramp up and really didn't see that material. I think it's just taking not only the producers, but our own teams a little bit longer, now having put a lot of things on hold through 2020, seeing them start to ramp back up a little bit.  But we have some -- a variety of different projects that -- as you know, we do have some that are coming into service. There might be a little delay in spending. But the other thing is we have some pipeline projects like some debottlenecking, certainly in the Bakken and the Permian, we have some growth. Those are some of the core basins that we've talked about. Definitely in the second quarter Bakken was up nicely in terms of operating activities. The producers there have been putting more drilling to work. And so pipeline and compression, well connects, certainly in the Bakken and the Permian are going to be part of that spend, and then just some debottlenecking and work that we have ongoing in some of our core assets in the Logistics and Storage side of the business.  So we have -- we also have some tank projects at the Toca. So it's kind of a -- I can't say that there's one particular project or two that really stand out, they are very substantial. As you noted, we have completed some. And then just as we tried to highlight, given the nature of all the different opportunities that we're evaluating, we could see one or two of these lower carbon projects come to fruition that could require a little bit of capital here in the third or fourth quarter. \nSpiro Dounis: And then -- sorry, hopefully it doesn't count as my second question. But does that sort of skew the $100 million back up to $800 million, or is that contemplated already in that a $100 million? \nPam Beall: No, that's contemplated in the $100 million reduced... \nSpiro Dounis: Okay. That makes sense. Thanks, Pam. The second one maybe also for you, Pam. You mentioned that asset sales maybe not the right time here for some of your underutilized or non-core assets valuation. It sounds like they're not quite where you want them to be. So I'm curious in terms of optimization efforts and joint ventures, which is something you guys are not new to, curious what's being evaluated on that front to maybe uplift the value to you of those assets. And if incentive rates at some point could make sense to sort of utilize those assets better? \nPam Beall: Yes. And so we do have a number of different discussions ongoing, but it's premature for us to put some daylight on that. And I don't know, Greg, if you want to discuss that a little bit more? But typically, we don't talk about those kinds of activities until we're complete with negotiations and ready to announce. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. \nKeith Stanley: I just had some clarification questions on the operating expenses and volumes for the quarter. So Pam, you noted Q3 and Q4, you expect OpEx to be, I think $75 million higher than Q1. So was second quarter operating expense then still very low and similar to Q1? And so basically, just got pushed out to the second half of the year, or is that not the case? \nPam Beall: Yes, Keith, I will say, what's driving this is, when we do projects, a lot of it's capitalized, but there's also projects and related expenses that go along with that capital spend profile. So as I mentioned earlier, we probably thought we were going to spend more in the second half -- second quarter than what we did. And what tends to happen is that, third and fourth quarter, just given some of the geography of where our assets are located, sometimes it's more favorable to push that spending to the back half of the year. Certainly, third quarter is typically one of our highest spend CapEx quarters. And so it's really more about timing, Keith.  We did see a little bit of an increase in that kind of expense from the first quarter to the second quarter, but not as much as we expected. And then, we also saw the benefit of lower costs related to some of the headcount reductions that took place in the fourth quarter last year. And so that continues here into the first -- into 2021. So that tended to mute some of the increases that we saw.  Now, when you look at the different line items in costs for the partnership, you're definitely going to see some of the line items increasing related to variable operating costs. And then certainly purchased product costs that are related to some of the contracts in Gathering and Processing where we have percent of proceeds contracts. So you are going to see some operating expenses move around. But now when we talk about reducing by $300 million, our operating expenses, we're talking about those expenses over which we have control, that don't flex with operating volumes, changes in operating volumes. Is that helpful, Keith? \nKeith Stanley: That is, thank you. And sorry to have sort of detailed questions here. I wanted to circle back as well on the pipeline volumes. So the commentary that you're back to pre-pandemic levels. When I look at Q2 pipeline volumes, they're almost 10% above even second quarter of '19 pipeline volumes from before the pandemic. Is that correct? And is that what you were referring to Mike, that some of the export dynamics with demand recovering better in the U.S. is actually causing some sort of outsized volumes versus pre-pandemic levels on the MPLX pipeline assets? \nMike Hennigan: Yes, Keith, that's exactly what I think is happening right now. So, I mean, we're still obviously in transition with the pandemic and the good news for U.S. is we're in a better position than the rest of the globe. But over time, I think that'll even itself out. In the short term that is benefiting MPLX to some extent, as we're getting to run our assets a little harder, MPC is keeping more volumes, domestic as opposed to export. So I think that is a little bit of a tailwind for us overall.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Christine Cho with Barclays. Your line is open. Go ahead. \nChristine Cho: Tim or someone on the team provided some color on the Utica outlook. But the Marcellus processed volumes are down sequentially, again, and is this just sort of a timing thing, Pam? I think you were the one who mentioned that there was some -- like some of the team\u2019s held work. But is there anything else driving this decline, any sort of color on how we should think about the cadence through year end would be helpful?\nPam Beall: Yes, I think Greg Floerke wants to take that one. \nGreg Floerke : Yes. Christine, I would say, no, there's not -- we do have on quarter-to-quarter there's variation. Again, the wells, the producer volume, if they don't add wells in a certain steady cadence, or even in one location or another, you\u2019re always having a decline until that gets made up and then you'll get a new pad comes on and you'll get an increase in volume. So overall, I mean, you see our -- if you look at our year-over-year processing volume in the Marcellus, we had growth depending on the quarters and weather events or other things that happen, we will have variation there. But we don't see any long term issue. In fact, we're maintaining that 90 plus percent utilization and over 5 -- around 5.6 Bcf a day or so that we're processing. So this continues to be a strong area and pricing is clearly favorable, both in terms of gas and NGLs. Marcus Hook differential, some of our producers are reporting over -- seen better than Bellevue pricing there. So really good spot in the Marcellus and don't see any issue there. \nChristine Cho: But I guess as we think about cadence through year end, should we think it's kind of flattens out from here or are there going to be additional well pads connected that, that would bring it higher?\nGreg Floerke: Yes, I think it -- again, it will depend quarter-to-quarter. We're at such a high utilization level on gas outflow and NGL pipeline capacity as well as our own utilization, that there isn't a lot of headroom for growth. The good news is there's a lot of producers are drilling off of existing pads and using existing infrastructure and reporting out a maintenance type drilling schedule, maybe some low growth depending on the producer. But there really is not a lot of headroom there. So yes, we would expect it to see maintenance level with maybe a little bit of moderate growth if prices stay good. \nChristine Cho: Okay. Got it. And then moving over to the L&S side, would it make sense for MPLX to have a role in the Martinez conversion and participate on the logistics side? And if so, how much CapEx could that translate to? And then in addition to logistics, would you guys be willing to pay any pretreatment or processing units in the MLP? \nMike Hennigan: Christine, it\u2019s Mike. First off, on Martinez, the logistics assets are already in the MLP, so there's not really capital required there. So that'll be part of that project. So MPC is obviously doing the processing for [RD], but MPLX will enjoy the logistics opportunity. So that's already in the base case.  As far as your second question, yes, we have optionality, that's a nice thing about our structure. As we move forward, like you said, whether it's pretreatment or something else, we'll have discussion about what's the best opportunities to create value for both MPC and/or MPLX. Obviously, we'd like to do both at the same time, that's always been our goal.  So as those come up, we'll debate that. And then obviously, come out with what we think is the best solution at the time. But it is definitely on the table, to your question. \nOperator: And our last question comes from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. \nMichael Blum: Thank you. Pam, I just want to add my congratulations and wish you the best of luck in your next chapter. Just a couple of questions. One, I mean, you guys are obviously one of the largest NGL marketers up in the Northeast. And my question is that the Mariner system looks like it's going to get fully up and running by the end of this year. And I'm just curious how to think about that as it relates to your business? Is there any puts and takes, either positive or negative that will impact your ability to market your NGLs? \nGreg Floerke: Michael, Greg Floerke here again. We have seen incremental Mariner East capacity come on over the past few years and whether it's Mariner East 1, 2 or 2X, there's been incremental growth that we've -- we and our producer customers and others have taken advantage of. I think that in terms of -- it's one piece that dictates how much capacity there is to go -- that goes out. Obviously, NGL is one controlling factor, but also residue gas pipelines, as well as processing capacity.  So we're operating in that high utilization range. And so it's really hard to say whether there's any overall uplift from additional Mariner capacity coming online. Clearly, it's a good thing because anytime you have pipes that are running at high capacity, but you\u2019re adding additional capacity, takes away potentially one bottleneck. But not sort of a stepwise expectation because of the high utilization on all of those interconnected systems from our perspective. \nMichael Blum: Got it. Thanks for that. And then my second question is on the NGL takeaways system to JV with WhiteWater and West Texas Gas. I guess the question is, is the 125,000 a day of capacity, is that fully contracted by the JV? And are there any costs associated with this project. So I just want to make sure I understand how to think about this?\nTimothy Aydt: So, Michael, this is Tim. I'll take that and others can chime in. I think the -- when you look at the capacity, that's the initial phase 1 capacity of the system. It's expected to start up in the fourth quarter of this year, and then of course it would ramp over the course of time. And so there are -- we have some commitments on the system, obviously that back that. But I think the important part is, is that it is the initial phase. And as you recall, we scaled back the project significantly from its original scope in order to meet just the current demands. So this approach I think really allows the partners to leg into any capital efficient solutions, or expansions as the basin continues to recover. I think it's another example of our strict capital discipline. And so we're happy with our 25% ownership. As far as the CapEx, it'll continue to evolve over the course of time, but we don't give specific guidance on a project by project basis on the capital required. So hopefully that's helpful?\nMichael Blum: Great. Thank you so much. \nKristina Kazarian: All right. Well, operator, if we have no further questions, we'd like to thank everyone for joining us today and thank you for your interest in MPLX. Should you have additional questions or would like clarification on any of the topics discussed today, please reach out and members of our team will be available to help. Have a great day.",

            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Slide 5 outlines the second quarter operational and financial performance highlights for the Logistics and Storage segment. Our Logistics and Storage segment EBITDA increased $108 million for the second quarter year-over-year, despite headwinds from decreases in marine transportation fees and decreases on certain equity method investments. The quarter benefited from increased pipeline and terminal throughputs, as well as the team's focus on operating expense reductions and business efficiencies.  Our pipeline volumes returned to pre-pandemic levels and were higher than the second quarter of 2019. We continue to make good progress on our integrated crude oil and natural gas logistics systems from the Permian to the U.S. Gulf Coast. The Wink to Webster crude oil pipeline in which MPLX has a 15% ownership interest continues to play segments into service, and we expect this activity to continue throughout the remainder of the year. Consistent with our focus on projects with lower return risk, the pipeline system has 100% of its contractable capacity committed with long-term minimum volume commitments.  On July 1st, the Wink -- the Whistler natural gas pipeline was placed into service providing approximately 2 billion cubic feet per day of incremental natural gas transport capacity to the Texas Gulf Coast markets from the Permian Basin. Similar to the Wink to Webster project, the Whistler Pipeline in which we have a 38% ownership interest is backed by long-term minimum volume commitments. And we expect volumes and EBITDA contributions to ramp up throughout 2022.  And finally, we continue to work towards an in-service date in the fourth quarter this year for the NGL takeaway solution, which will provide long haul NGL service from the Permian to Sweeney, Texas. On Slide 6, moving to our Gathering and Processing business, we provide second quarter operational and financial highlights for the segment. For the second quarter of 2021 Gathering and Processing EBITDA increased $39 million from the second quarter of 2020. Overall gathered and processed volumes were lower than the same period last year, while in the Marcellus process volumes increased 2% and fractionated volumes increased 3% relative to the second quarter of 2020. The impact of lower volumes was more than offset by higher NGL prices that were $0.41 per gallon higher than the second quarter of 2020. This segment also benefited from continued focus on lowering operating expenses. With inventories low and global demand driving exports of NGLs, we expect strong NGL prices could continue.  During the second quarter, we completed commissioning of the 200 million cubic feet per day Smithburg 1 processing plant in the Marcellus, and the facility was placed into service on July 1. We continue to expect the Preakness processing plant in the Delaware Basin to be placed into service next year.  Our outlook for the rest of 2021 remains cautiously optimistic with differing impacts across our footprint. For example, we experienced increased activity in the Bakken in the second quarter, which we expect to continue in the second half of the year. We also expect increased activity with volume growth in the Permian.  In the Marcellus, our assets are highly utilized and producers' drilling plans continue to focus on strengthening their balance sheets and prioritize generating free cash flow over volume growth. This allows us to generate free cash flow to be deployed in other basins and add to our financial flexibility.  Moving to our second quarter financial highlights on Slide 7. Total adjusted EBITDA was $1.4 billion and distributable cash flow was $1.3 billion for the quarter. MPLX grew both EBITDA and distributable cash flow compared to the second quarter of 2020. The second quarter of 2021 results include non-cash impairment charges of approximately $42 million within our G&P segment related to minor changes in the portfolio. This is part of our ongoing evaluation and optimization of our assets in non-core basins.  We will continue to evaluate opportunities to sell or joint venture such operations, where there's a value creation opportunity. And while macro trends have improved for Gathering and Processing, valuations for assets in non-core basins really have not been compelling.  Our distributable cash flow generated provided strong distribution coverage of 1.73 times for the quarter, and we paid $729 million in distributions to preferred and common unitholders. During the second quarter, we returned an additional $155 million of capital through the repurchase of common units held by the public. This brings the total to $343 million since the unit repurchase program was launched in the fourth quarter of 2020. We now have $657 million remaining under our current Board authorization for the repurchase of common units.  Last quarter, we estimated an increase in expenses related to project work ramping up through December month of up to 75 million in each of the second and third quarters. While there are many factors that influenced the timing of project and maintenance spend, we do still anticipate higher project expenses of approximately $75 million in both the third and fourth quarters compared to the first quarter.  We remain committed to our strategic initiatives of lowering our cost structure. As we stated on the last call, we're confident we delivered $200 million of lower costs in 2020 compared to 2019. Those lower costs continue in 2021, and we expect our total controllable operating costs for 2021 will reflect an additional $100 million of reductions from 2020, increasing to approximately $300 million in total structural cost reductions made in the business since 2019. And lastly, as we look into the second half of the year, we still anticipate a higher run rate for capital spending compared to the first half of the year. But total growth capital spending is now expected to be at least $100 million lower than originally guided at $800 million for 2021. This is dependent on the timing of some of our core business capital spending, as well as some renewable and low-carbon investment opportunities we are evaluating. Slide 8 provides a summary of key financial and balance sheet information. We ended the quarter with a leverage ratio of 3.7 times. Today, we also announced the redemption of the 1 billion callable floating rate senior notes due September 2022. It is our intention to refinance these notes sometime in the future with timing dependent on market and other conditions. And with our ongoing focus on lowering our costs, our strict capital discipline, we expect to continue to generate excess free cash flow that will enhance our financial flexibility, including the ability to return incremental capital to our unitholders.  And before I turn the call over to Kristina for Q&A, I want to add a few comments about my retirement from Marathon, which I prefer to call the next chapter of my professional career. Because those who know me know that retirement in the traditional sense does not fit me. Since 1978 when my career began, I've enjoyed a number of roles across multiple industries. However, my 26 years in energy with Marathon have been the most rewarding. We've all seen amazing results under Mike's leadership as CEO. And as a unitholder of MPLX and a shareholder of MPC, I look forward to seeing the results of Mike's vision for the company unfold. No doubt, the company will remain a leader as the industry embraces an energy-diverse future.  I know you'll all enjoy working with John Quaid, who will assume the MPLX Chief Financial Officer role effective September 1st. I will continue in an advisory capacity through November 30th this year to assist with the transition.  And with that, I'd also like to give my thanks to Kristina and her team for the way they support our investors and our executives. And Kristina, we can begin the Q&A. Shneur, first of all, thanks for the kind comments. But I would say that we are -- we've returned to a pretty robust volumes and they have somewhat correlated with the Marathon's refining utilization now. The one thing that happens on the pipeline systems is that with the minimum volume commitments, there are some provisions that some of those volumes can be recaptured. And so you'll see some changes quarter-to-quarter on deferred revenue as we recognize revenue. If there's a period of time when the minimum volume commitments there cannot be reached to, then we'll recognize it in the quarter. But -- so there's some lumpy -- sometimes lumpiness that you'll see. But you'll be able to see that kind of work through the system. But yes, overall, I would say that we're pretty much back to the pre-COVID levels that refined products side has not been quite as robust returning as the crude side. But -- and we've also seen a nice uptick in the terminals. Yes. Well, certainly on the Gathering and Processing side of the business, we're going to see some -- and we would expect a little higher spend in the second half of the year. We have been very constrained across the entire system on our capital spending. And as we entered the first quarter, we were extremely strict. Second quarter, we had expected a little bit higher ramp up and really didn't see that material. I think it's just taking not only the producers, but our own teams a little bit longer, now having put a lot of things on hold through 2020, seeing them start to ramp back up a little bit.  But we have some -- a variety of different projects that -- as you know, we do have some that are coming into service. There might be a little delay in spending. But the other thing is we have some pipeline projects like some debottlenecking, certainly in the Bakken and the Permian, we have some growth. Those are some of the core basins that we've talked about. Definitely in the second quarter Bakken was up nicely in terms of operating activities. The producers there have been putting more drilling to work. And so pipeline and compression, well connects, certainly in the Bakken and the Permian are going to be part of that spend, and then just some debottlenecking and work that we have ongoing in some of our core assets in the Logistics and Storage side of the business.  So we have -- we also have some tank projects at the Toca. So it's kind of a -- I can't say that there's one particular project or two that really stand out, they are very substantial. As you noted, we have completed some. And then just as we tried to highlight, given the nature of all the different opportunities that we're evaluating, we could see one or two of these lower carbon projects come to fruition that could require a little bit of capital here in the third or fourth quarter. No, that's contemplated in the $100 million reduced... Yes. And so we do have a number of different discussions ongoing, but it's premature for us to put some daylight on that. And I don't know, Greg, if you want to discuss that a little bit more? But typically, we don't talk about those kinds of activities until we're complete with negotiations and ready to announce. Yes, Keith, I will say, what's driving this is, when we do projects, a lot of it's capitalized, but there's also projects and related expenses that go along with that capital spend profile. So as I mentioned earlier, we probably thought we were going to spend more in the second half -- second quarter than what we did. And what tends to happen is that, third and fourth quarter, just given some of the geography of where our assets are located, sometimes it's more favorable to push that spending to the back half of the year. Certainly, third quarter is typically one of our highest spend CapEx quarters. And so it's really more about timing, Keith.  We did see a little bit of an increase in that kind of expense from the first quarter to the second quarter, but not as much as we expected. And then, we also saw the benefit of lower costs related to some of the headcount reductions that took place in the fourth quarter last year. And so that continues here into the first -- into 2021. So that tended to mute some of the increases that we saw.  Now, when you look at the different line items in costs for the partnership, you're definitely going to see some of the line items increasing related to variable operating costs. And then certainly purchased product costs that are related to some of the contracts in Gathering and Processing where we have percent of proceeds contracts. So you are going to see some operating expenses move around. But now when we talk about reducing by $300 million, our operating expenses, we're talking about those expenses over which we have control, that don't flex with operating volumes, changes in operating volumes. Is that helpful, Keith? Yes, I think Greg Floerke wants to take that one."

            "name": "Greg Floerke",
            "content": "All right. John, Greg Floerke here. With regard to the Sherwood, Mobley outage, I believe that referring to the outage that we had on June 30, we did have -- early afternoon on June 30, we detected a minor release of product at our -- just upstream of our Majorsville, West Virginia plant. And that turned out to be on the 20-inch y-grade pipeline, which serves our Mobley and Sherwood facilities upstream. We did isolate that release to a leak around a valve on the 20-inch line. It took several days to de-inventory the line and reduce pressure and to make sure we had a safe environment to repair the leak. That repair was made and completed on July 3. So the period from about half of the day on the 30 through July 3 was the impact period. Both of those upstream plants were shut down. The Majorsville plant itself was returned to service fairly quickly after we determined the site was safe.  The impact we estimate of the repair and then the opportunity cost was approximately in the $6 million range. So probably a little bit more of that split over to falling over into the next quarter for a few days. So that really addresses I think the Sherwood, Mobley outage.  More broadly regarding Utica, we look at Utica and Marcellus as they're interconnected. We have an interconnected purely ethane pipeline as well as our fractionation and our C3 plus y-grade pipelines. And we have -- one time we're at high utilization in the Utica on our rich gas gathering and processing side. That's continued to decline over the past few years as the focus has shifted to more dry or lean gas drilling in the Utica, but also continued focus on accelerated drilling in the Marcellus ridge.  And as you've seen, we've just had our third straight quarter of 90% -- higher than 90% utilization in the Marcellus, a little bit of that is at the expense of probably drilling and focus in the Utica ridge. The Utica is a little bit deeper. Wells are a little bit expensive and more complex. We think long-term, there still will be plenty of opportunity and -- for drilling in that area and the producers are still -- the economics are there, they're positive, particularly at current NGL prices. It's just really a matter of prioritization I think at this point. We also need to look at the fact that the Northeast overall is in really good balance. Not only are we at high utilization, but the outgoing residue gas and NGL pipelines are nearly full. And any growth in the Utica would sort of offset growth in the Marcella. So it really, is in a pretty good balanced situation.  But we think long-term, we did see some decline also year-over-year in gathering, particularly in Utica and part of that's driven by the dry gas area, which is still a strong area. That really is a matter of timing and in some of the cash flow preservation and focus related to the COVID demand destruction and pricing last year. Even one quarter of delay in the drilling program results in one more quarter of decline. And as we know, all of these shale wells decline fairly rapidly and need to be replaced with maintenance drilling. So we look at that as a timing issue, which hopefully -- and we think will recover. Yes. Christine, I would say, no, there's not -- we do have on quarter-to-quarter there's variation. Again, the wells, the producer volume, if they don't add wells in a certain steady cadence, or even in one location or another, you're always having a decline until that gets made up and then you'll get a new pad comes on and you'll get an increase in volume. So overall, I mean, you see our -- if you look at our year-over-year processing volume in the Marcellus, we had growth depending on the quarters and weather events or other things that happen, we will have variation there. But we don't see any long term issue. In fact, we're maintaining that 90 plus percent utilization and over 5 -- around 5.6 Bcf a day or so that we're processing. So this continues to be a strong area and pricing is clearly favorable, both in terms of gas and NGLs. Marcus Hook differential, some of our producers are reporting over -- seen better than Bellevue pricing there. So really good spot in the Marcellus and don't see any issue there. Yes, I think it -- again, it will depend quarter-to-quarter. We're at such a high utilization level on gas outflow and NGL pipeline capacity as well as our own utilization, that there isn't a lot of headroom for growth. The good news is there's a lot of producers are drilling off of existing pads and using existing infrastructure and reporting out a maintenance type drilling schedule, maybe some low growth depending on the producer. But there really is not a lot of headroom there. So yes, we would expect it to see maintenance level with maybe a little bit of moderate growth if prices stay good. Michael, Greg Floerke here again. We have seen incremental Mariner East capacity come on over the past few years and whether it's Mariner East 1, 2 or 2X, there's been incremental growth that we've -- we and our producer customers and others have taken advantage of. I think that in terms of -- it's one piece that dictates how much capacity there is to go -- that goes out. Obviously, NGL is one controlling factor, but also residue gas pipelines, as well as processing capacity.  So we're operating in that high utilization range. And so it's really hard to say whether there's any overall uplift from additional Mariner capacity coming online. Clearly, it's a good thing because anytime you have pipes that are running at high capacity, but you're adding additional capacity, takes away potentially one bottleneck. But not sort of a stepwise expectation because of the high utilization on all of those interconnected systems from our perspective."

            "name": "Timothy Aydt",
            "content": "So good morning, Jeremy, this is Tim. I think in addition to what Mike indicated in the opening there, we certainly are actively engaged in many new opportunities and they may range from CCUS to RNG, CNG, LNG. Obviously, we're looking to support renewable diesel and SAF over the course of time. I think really when you look at our nationwide footprint, it really spans a large portfolio of assets. And I think this in turn does indeed create that robust list of opportunities that Mike mentioned.  We certainly have a lot of flexibility. But at the same time we believe this is a multi-decade energy evolution that's taking place. And I think it's important for us to take a longer term strategic view. We understand that many of the energy evolution projects may not yet be economical, but we believe over time, these projects will be developed that evolve the energy space without sacrificing our returns. As you know, we're very capital disciplined here and we're going to remain so. I think when you look at shorter term, certainly the renewable diesel support of the two refineries that MPC has converted, will provide opportunities. Our assets are well-positioned to run these drop in fuels. So I think that's the shorter term.  I think the medium to longer term is probably going to revolve around things like carbon capture and sequestration. We're bullish on the fact that there'll be a CCS project at some point in the future along the Gulf Coast, given the emitters that exist down there. So I think maybe that addresses some of the longer-term stuff. So I'll leave it at that. Okay. I'll take that as well. Certainly, the return of the energy commodity prices has certainly driven, I would consider, an improved outlook for the U.S. shale production. I think that's resulted in the fact that some of the existing capacity is starting to fill within the existing midstream space. But I think at the same time we witnessed many of our producer customers remaining very focused on capital discipline, especially over the past year, which I think suggest bringing additional production to the market really will require a thoughtful strategy around whether or not they're also willing to support and back additional long haul pipes. I think at the end of the day, it's a balancing act for the producers and the midstreamers. And I think the market will dictate the outcome as it always does. But I think relative to the timing that you've mentioned, I think there's a lot of industry chatter out there that suggests maybe in the '24- '25 timeframe that takeaway capacity will once again be constrained. So, Michael, this is Tim. I'll take that and others can chime in. I think the -- when you look at the capacity, that's the initial phase 1 capacity of the system. It's expected to start up in the fourth quarter of this year, and then of course it would ramp over the course of time.

            "name": "Mike Hennigan",
            "content": "Thanks, Kristina. Good morning and thank you for joining our call. This morning, we announced that Pam Beall will be retiring after more than 25 year of service. Pam has played a critical role in many of our milestones and has been an excellent CFO, as we transitioned to partnership and to generating free cash after distributions and capital. Her financial guidance, strategic input and solid counsel have been understated and she will be missed. The Board of Directors and I wish her well in her much deserved retirement.  I would also like to congratulate John Quaid on his appointment. We look forward to continued strategic growth and value creation under his financial leadership. John will hit the ground running as he's been part of the Marathon team for many years, and very deserving of this opportunity.  With that, let me start by saying that, earlier today we reported adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2021 of $1.4 billion. Our operating results this quarter represented 12% increase in EBITDA from the second quarter of last year and a 10% increase in EBITDA from the second quarter of 2019. This performance highlights the resiliency of the business irrespective of the challenging macroeconomic environment. Furthermore, the company generated excess cash flow beyond our capital and distribution requirements for the third consecutive quarter, enabling the continued return of capital to our unitholders through unit repurchases.  In our L&S segment, throughput volumes continued to rebound with higher product demand and increased utilization at MPC's refineries. In our G&P segment we continue to see high processing and fractionation utilization in the Marcellus. We are maintaining strict capital discipline and efficiently executing our growth plans on high return portfolio of investments. Both the Whistler natural gas pipeline in the Permian and the Smithburg 1 processing plant in the Marcellus began service in July.  Looking forward to the remainder half of the year, we continue to expect completion of the Wink to Webster crude pipeline and the NGL takeaway system, which are both part of our integrated crude and natural gas logistics systems from the Permian to the U.S. Gulf Coast.  In the G&P segment, the Preakness processing plant in the Delaware Basin remains on track to support anticipated incremental volume from producer customers in 2022. Our continued focus on identifying and efficiently executing high return projects will support further growth for MPLX.  As part of our work to advance low carbon opportunities, we are actively engaged in evaluating new opportunities for the business, especially where we see technologies complementary with our expertise and asset footprint. The MPLX footprint spans a large portfolio of assets creating a robust list of opportunities we continue to evaluate. We also continue to identify opportunities to structurally lower our costs and drive efficiencies in the business. When we look at our operating expenses, our 2020 controllable costs were more than $200 million lower compared to 2019. We continue to improve on this performance with controllable costs in 2021 expected to be incrementally a $100 million lower than 2020 for a total of $300 million lower compared to in 2019.  Our focus on strict capital discipline combined with growing EBITDA continues to enable the business to generate excess cash after self-funding our distribution and capital program. We remain committed to prioritizing the return of capital with nearly $900 million returned to the unitholders this quarter through distributions and unit repurchases.  As we look into the second half of '21, we expect to continue to generate excess cash after all capital investments and distributions. And as we stated previously, we plan to execute repurchases based on free cash flow, the current as well as anticipated needs of the business and the market environment.  Finally, this quarter, we continued to enhance our ESG commitments and disclosures with the recent publication of both our annual Sustainability and Perspectives on Climate-Related Scenarios reports. Looking at Slide 4, I want to take a moment to discuss these reports in more detail. Our Sustainability and Climate Report highlights that our approach to sustainability spans the environmental, social, and governance aspects of our business. Within this year's Sustainability Report, we've included a midstream specific supplement, highlighting the specific topics and metrics that are most relevant and impactful to our industry. In our Climate Report, you will see we adjust our climate scenarios annually to maintain consistency with the latest IEA projections, including the sustainable development scenario and the IEA's new net-zero emissions by 2050 case.  We continue to make progress on our targets to reduce midstream methane emissions intensity 50% by 2025 from 2016 levels. Through 2020, we've achieved 44% of this target, a move that further enhances the low-carbon profile of our growing natural gas business. In addition, we've achieved 45% of our target to reduce freshwater withdrawal intensity 20% by 2030 from 2016 levels. In short, we are challenging ourselves to lead in sustainable energy by meeting the needs of today while investing in an energy diverse future that creates shared value for all of our stakeholders.  Now, let me turn the call over to Pam to discuss our operational and financial results for the quarter. Hey, John. This is Mike. You probably shouldn't read much into it other than what we've said in the past, which is we're happy to be in an excess cash flow situation. Right now, we still believe where we're trading that buybacks make a lot of sense to us. At the same time to your point about being a little bit lower than the retained cash is, I've mentioned this for a couple of quarters, we've had a couple of things out there, some vulnerabilities that we wanted to make sure that we protect. That's what was one that seems to have played itself out a little bit, Tesoro High Plains Pipeline was another. So keeping some dry powder was part of our goal here. So again, it's a good position to be in. We have a lot of flexibility. I want to believe that we're going to continue to evaluate it constantly in real time. So I like to use the word dynamic. I know we ended up with about the same momentum, mainly because we kind of put a base plan together and then we have a little bit of excess dry powder that we'll decide as time goes by. So we're in a good position. For us going forward, we think all avenues are open to us. Debt reduction, additional buybacks, distribution, anything along those lines is all open to us with the main point being is that we're at a point of financial flexibility, generating dry powder and having the ability to see what's the best value creation for our unitholders. John, I'll let Greg take that one. Jeremy, I'll let Tim give some color on that. Shneur, it's Mike, I'm going answer that in a second. But let me make one other comment to what you just asked previously on pipeline volumes. One of the things that we are benefiting from at the moment that's probably not sustainable long-term is, the virus is still a major impact in the system and it's more outside the U.S. than it is inside the U.S. So export volumes in the Marathon system were down as a result and MPLX benefits from that as pipeline used inside the domestic system gets used more. So that'll probably change itself a little bit once we continue to battle through this pandemic. But that's just one comment that I wanted to give you on the pipelines on that. To your second question is, yes. I mean, Tim said it pretty well to Jeremy's question. We have a bunch of projects that we're watching and looking at. As everybody gets to know my DNA more is I'm really strict on capital. I want to make sure that we get very, very high returns. So we're going to be, I'll say, cautious to deploy capital unless we really feel very comfortable with the projects. We have a bunch that we're watching. Tim mentioned a couple in the alternative energy space. We are going to evolve our portfolio as that evolves, but some of those projects today, just they're not reaching a hurdle of return that we would like. So I think they'll get there over time. I think some of these things will play itself out over time.  In the meantime, we're going to stay cautious. And that's why, as we set out for the year, we figured about $800 million of capital, we've been trending lower than that. And Pam in her prepared remarks kind of said, we're probably at least $100 million under that. And I don't view that as a bad thing because if it delays into next year and the opportunity becomes more mature, we become more comfortable with the returns, then we'll deploy the capital. But as a general rule, Shneur, I think the business is largely a return of capital business. We're doing a large return of capital via distribution. We've added to that return of capital via buybacks. So that's an important part.  At the same time, though, I am a big believer that you need return on capital as well, I mean, that continues to fund the growth, but we just want to do it in a very disciplined way. So we have stuff that we're thinking about. We haven't disclosed anything to your point. We haven't FIDed or disclosed anything because we're going to wait till it's really at a point that we think is a good return. And then that way we're checking off return on capital as strongly as we're checking off return of capital. Hope that helps? Yes, Keith, that's exactly what I think is happening right now. So, I mean, we're still obviously in transition with the pandemic and the good news for U.S. is we're in a better position than the rest of the globe. But over time, I think that'll even itself out. In the short term that is benefiting MPLX to some extent, as we're getting to run our assets a little harder, MPC is keeping more volumes, domestic as opposed to export. So I think that is a little bit of a tailwind for us overall. Christine, it's Mike. First off, on Martinez, the logistics assets are already in the MLP, so there's not really capital required there. So that'll be part of that project. So MPC is obviously doing the processing for [RD], but MPLX will enjoy the logistics opportunity. So that's already in the base case.  As far as your second question, yes, we have optionality, that's a nice thing about our structure. As we move forward, like you said, whether it's pretreatment or something else, we'll have discussion about what's the best opportunities to create value for both MPC and/or MPLX. Obviously, we'd like to do both at the same time, that's always been our goal.  So as those come up, we'll debate that. And then obviously, come out with what we think is the best solution at the time. But it is definitely on the table, to your question."

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.\nKristina Kazarian: Thanks so much. Good morning and welcome to the MPLX first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at mplx.com, under the Investor tab. Joining me on the call today are; Mike Hennigan, Chairman, President and CEO; Pam Beall, CFO, and other members of the executive team. We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statements and the non-GAAP disclaimer on slide 2. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the call and during the question-and-answer session that follows. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Hennigan: Thanks, Kristina. Good morning and thank you for joining our call. Earlier today, we reported adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2021 of $1.4 billion. Despite lingering challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic and headwinds in the business environment, we were able to grow earnings on a year-on-year basis. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect an impact to our L&S business from the renewal of the marine contracts and equipment rate adjustments. Additionally, our G&P results also reflect some impacts from the severe winter weather, including higher energy costs and lower volumes. We continue to identify opportunities to structurally lower our costs and drive efficiencies in the business. And our reported operating expenses for the quarter continue to trend down. We're also maintaining strict capital discipline to efficiently execute our growth plans on a high return portfolio of investments. Our focus on strict capital discipline combined with growing EBITDA has allowed the business to generate excess cash after self-funding our distribution and capital program. We remain committed to prioritizing return of capital with over $900 million returned to unit holders this quarter through distributions in unit purchases. Furthermore, we believe our earnings growth, combined with the desire to hold debt flat will result in a reduction in leverage over time. As we look ahead through 2021, we expect to generate excess cash after capital investments and distributions as we had planned to do. The availability of COVID-19 vaccine provides hope for the return of global transportation fuel demand and economic recovery. Even though many uncertainties still exist, the world's need for reliable, affordable and responsibly produce energy remains important. We believe we can continue to meet this need through our strategies that will allow us to successfully adapt to the evolving energy landscape by shaping our asset portfolio to meet the challenges and opportunities created by the energy evolution. If you look at slide 4, I'd like to provide some comments on our commitment to ESG. Last quarter, we discussed the importance of setting objectives for the organization to drive continuous improvement on ESG. Our commitment to sustainability positions us to deliver strong results in this space, including lowering the carbon intensity of our operations and products, improving energy efficiency and conserving natural resources, while using innovative technology to do it. We've established a program to lower methane emissions at our natural gas gathering and processing business includes a goal of reducing our methane emissions intensity to 50% below 2016 levels by the year 2025. A broader vision of sustainability emphasizes delivering essential energy products and services to the world in ways that create share value for all our stakeholders. Now let me turn the call over to Pam to discuss our operational and financial results.\nPam Beall: Thanks, Mike. Slide 5 outlines the first quarter operational and financial highlights for our logistics and storage segments. Segment EBITDA increased $24 million year-over-year, despite headwinds from a reduction in our marine transportation fees and lower throughput on some of our pipeline equity method investments, the team's focus on operating expense reductions and business efficiencies provided support for the segment. Additionally, all terminal throughputs were lower compared with the first quarter of 2020, pipeline volumes were in line with the same period last year. We continue to make good progress on our strategies to create an integrated crude oil and natural gas logistics system from the Permian to the Gulf Coast. The Wink to Webster crude oil pipeline, in which MPLX has an equity interest, continues to play segments in the service. And we expect this activity to continue throughout the remainder of the year. As segments are placed in service, we expect EBITDA contributions from this project to ramp up throughout 2022. Consistent with our focus on projects with minimal return risk, the pipeline system has 100% of its contractual capacity committed with long-term minimum volume commitments. On the Whistler natural gas pipeline, commissioning activities on certain segments are underway in preparation for the project to startup in the third quarter of this year. Similar to the Wink to Webster project, Whistler is backed by long-term minimum volume commitments and we expect EBITDA contributions also ramped up through 2022. Finally, we continue to work towards an in-service date in the fourth quarter for the natural gas liquids takeaway solution, which provides long haul NGL service from the Permian to Sweeny, Texas. The project will have an initial capacity of 125,000 barrels per day with the potential to expand up to 350,000 barrels per day. Before we leave the discussions on our L&S segment, I'd like to provide an update on certain contracts between MPC and MPLX. MPLX continues to work alongside MPC as it progresses its portfolio of renewable projects, including potential opportunities to expand our logistics capability to deliver renewable diesel feedstocks. Since renewing the marine contract with MPC in January, we continued to receive questions around contracts for pipelines that were dropped into the partnership in 2012 and are coming up for renewal. But we continue to emphasize many of the assets MPLX operates are fit for purpose for MPC\u2019s business and are integral to the MPC refining system. Furthermore, we believe our crude and product pipeline contracts are at market rates. As in the past, we fully expect MPC to renew its contract with MPLX, as they mature over time, and for our revenue from these contracts to continue to reflect the strong integrated nature of the underlying business. Now moving on to our gathering and processing business on Slide 6, we provide first quarter operational financial highlights for this segments. For the first quarter of 2021, gathered volumes were lower than the same period last year across our footprint. Furthermore, process volumes were down in all regions, except the Marcellus. In the Marcellus, process volumes increased 3% and fractionated volumes increased 7% relative to the first quarter of 2020. The overall operating statistics include the impacts of severe weather during the quarter in the southwest. We estimate an approximate $16 million impact to our business from the winter storms, with the majority of that impact reflected in our gathering and processing segment results. This impact included reduced volumes at some of our facilities as well as higher energy costs. Gathering and processing segment, EBITDA increased $34 million from the first quarter of 2020. This was supported by higher natural gas liquids price and lower operating expenses, helping offset the impact of lower volumes, as well as the costs incurred due to the severe weather. In line with previously announced efforts around portfolio optimizations, we did close on the sale of our heavily to plant in Corpus Christi, Texas in mid-February. In the Marcellus, we've begun commissioning activities for our Smithburg 1 processing facility, with a targeted in-service date in the third quarter. Now moving to our first quarter financial highlights on slide seven, total adjusted EBITDA was $1.4 billion and distributable cash flow was $1.1 billion. MPLX grew both EBITDA and distributable cash flow compared to the first quarter of 2020. Our distributable cash flow generation provided strong coverage of 1.5 times for the quarter. And we paid $754 million in distributions. Furthermore, MPLX continued to self-fund all capital investments in distributions to unitholders with $277 million of excess cash will remain, after these activities for the quarter. In addition, we returned $155 million to unitholders, through the repurchase of over $6 million publicly traded common units under our unit repurchase program. As of March 31st, total repurchases of $180 million have been made since the program's inception was launched in the fourth quarter of 2020. Even continued uncertainty facing the economic recovery, we were extremely disciplined in our expense and capital spend for the first quarter. This caution helps to drive the significant amount of excess free cash flow, generated during the quarter. Looking forward, we've not changed our guidance on growth capital investment of $800 million for 2021. This implies a higher run-rate of capital spend for the remaining quarters. As we increase our growth capital project related work that tends to ramp-up through summer months. We also expect to see a meaningful increase in the projects that are expensed. Subject to many factors that influence timing of project and maintenance spend. This amount could be sequentially higher by as much as $75 million in the second quarter, relative to the first quarter spend. With our continued capital and expense, discipline and rose in EBITDA, we expect to continue generating excess cash flow for 2021, providing financial flexibility to pursue value creating opportunities for our unitholders, including unit repurchases. We intend to remain flexible with our unit repurchase program and expect the pace of unit repurchases to be informed by market conditions, the business environment, the amount of excess cash generated in prior quarters, among other factors. On slide six, we provide a summary of key financial and balance sheet information. And I want to highlight that the inflection to generating excess cash and returning capital to unitholders has not compromised our focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a leverage ratio of 3.9 times, approximately $2.7 billion available under a $3.5 billion bank revolving credit facility, and $1.5 billion available on our intercompany facility with MPC. We intend to maintain our investment grade credit profile. And as Mike mentioned earlier, hold our debt flat, restrict capital discipline, growing EBITDA and stable debt we believe leverage will decline overtime. So now let me turn the call back over to Kristina. Thanks.\nKristina Kazarian: Thanks, Pam. As we open the call for questions, we ask that you limit yourself to one question plus the follow-up. We may re-prompt for additional questions as time permits. With that, we will now open the call to questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning, guys. It's James [ph] on for Jeremy. Just want to start on the buybacks. It seem like, the strong progress is made through the first quarter. I\u2019m just wondering any color you can share on the cadence for the rest of the year, or if there's any bogeys or what factors you look at to allocate capital to buybacks going forward?\nMike Hennigan: Good morning, James, this is Mike. On buybacks, the best guidance we can give you, I tried to say this a couple times is, it's going to be a dynamic process for us, not a program that we just set and walk away from. So, we've tried to be transparent that we were driving to excess free cash flow, we achieve that, and we've set back in the latter part of 2020 and into 2021. So the way we're going to look at it is each quarter as the market moves, and we have more intelligence about the market, the unit price, the outlook, et cetera, et cetera, we're going to look at what's the best way to deploy that excess cash. Buybacks is, obviously, something that we prioritize in the recent terms, especially since we're trading at the yields that we're trading at, but we have all the levers available to us, buybacks, distributions, debt, capital, all of those avenues are available to us. And as a management team, we're going to continue to talk about things through the quarter, and continue to make what I call real-time decisions or a dynamic process that's trying to be receptive to the market conditions at the time and trying to provide the best unit-holder value. I hope that gives you a better feeling as to how we're thinking about the process.\nUnidentified Analyst: No, it does, and I appreciate the color there. Maybe just for my follow-up, shifting over to the renewable side. You mentioned the renewable diesel opportunities in prepared remarks. Just wonder if you can elaborate on how far out on that if there's any capital allocate to that this year? And then maybe just a second part of the question, looking at carbon capture. If you foresee the 45Q tax credits as being sufficient to incentivize capital allocation there?\nMike Hennigan: Yeah, James, I'm now going to let Tim [ph] jump in with some more detail. But I'm just saying in general, we're obviously aware of the energy evolution that's occurring. There's a lot of opportunities that people are exploring, Tim and his team are looking at a lot of different things. So I'll let him give some color here.\nUnidentified Representative: Well, Jeremy [ph] on the 45Q credits, I guess, it kind of depends. In general, the 45Q, it is the primary incentive for carbon catch, and sequestration. And if you got the right environment, it may drive a competitive project. But if you look at most of those out there, it requires stacking of incentives. And sometimes variable cost depending on the capture, transportation and sequester costs come into play. So if you have projects with low capture costs, and minimal transportation and some favorable geology, well, then that might cover it. But other projects would require things like LCFS uplift for certain products, in order to hurdle those higher costs. So again, it kind of depends. We do expect the government policies a little further define the regulatory framework. And it's possible that there could be additional incentives that come down the pike.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. That's very helpful. I'll stop there. Appreciate the questions.\nMike Hennigan: You're welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from [Indiscernible] with UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning and thank you for taking my question. So I would like to follow-up on that question, on renewable investments. Could you maybe provide more color on the scope and potential returns from the investment that you are looking at? The renewable investments? Thank you.\nMike Hennigan: Yes. So we haven't guidance to a detailed point of disclosures on the things that we're looking at. I think the takeaway that you should think about is there's a pretty myriad opportunity set in front of us now. Tim, just mentioned, carbon capture is one thing that we're looking at. Pam mentioned renewable diesels obviously, being advanced by MPC. Lowering the carbon intensity of products is going to continue to be a theme that plays itself out there. So, we haven't given any detailed disclosures, other than to say that we're cognizant of the environment that we're in. I like to say, people were talking a lot about hydrogen at one end of the spectrum. I think that's a little further out in time. But it is something that we're evaluating as we go forward. Now MPC is in the business of hydrogen. So that's something that we're very close to. At the same time, on the near-end, as Pam mentioned, renewable diesel is on the front-end. As Tim just mentioned, carbon, any types of activities around there, are all front and centre for us. However, we're going to make sure that when we advance the ball in there that we have a really strong return. So we are going to maintain capital discipline, not jump at something that just appears to be good. We're going to make sure that, at the end of the day it gives us a good return, and provides value to the unit holders.\nPam Beall: Hey, [Indiscernible] it's Pam. I just wanted to jump in and add to Mike's comments there. The other thing that that we should talk about is the fact that we're very bullish on the role that natural gas is going to play, even as we go through an energy transition. So, we continue to look for opportunities to participate in the natural gas value chain downstream of the operations that we have today. And as Tim talked about, the some of our pipe pipeline activities, and I don't know, Tim, if you wanted to add anything on mentioned like the natural gas storage investment through our joint venture. So, we're looking for those kinds of opportunities as well, because we think that natural gas is going to be an important part of energy solution well into the future.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you. And what has been the latest rich turnaround your puts in the northeast that crosses bowling towards down a little bit in 1Q versus 4Q. Do you expect the recovery throughout 2021?\nMike Hennigan: I\u2019ll let Greg take that one.\nGreg Floerke: It\u2019s Greg Floerke. With regard to the northeast outlook, NGL prices, and more currently, gas prices are supportive of additional development in the northeast. Rich gas drilling remains focused primarily in the Marcellus and more of the dry or lean gas drilling in the Utica. We do see seasonal -- depending on the season, and particularly the winter time and maintenance schedules, we do see fluctuation in volume quarter-over-quarter but in general, the Northeast is a key basin for us. And we think NGL prices including the strip price and current inventory levels are supportive of potentially more rich gas drilling in the region.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you and have a great day.\nMike Hennigan: You're welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Mackay with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJohn Mackay: Hey, good morning. Thanks for the time. Just wanted to circle up on the buyback, understand it's a variable number that will move around quarter to quarter, depending on how much cash you have or leftover. Just curious, as to how Javelina proceeds were kind of rolled into that number over if you see the 150-ish you did this quarter as being kind of a healthy numbers of the base business can generate?\nPam Beall: Yeah, John thanks. This is Pam. I'll take that question. So, we talked about the fact that we actually generated $277 million of excess cash after funding the distributions in our capital program. That surplus cash did include proceeds from the Javelina sale. We did deploy $155 million of that into unit repurchases. But we also highlighted that, the first quarter, we were extremely conservative on all forms of cash that we spent, just given some of the economic uncertainty as we move through the beginning of 2021, not knowing how the pandemic would play out. So we do expect to see higher capital in subsequent quarters, and also some increase in expenses related to projects that we do that are expensed. And as I've highlighted, in some prior calls, some of our maintenance activities as well highlight API 653 tank work, we expense that work, other companies capitalize it, so as we move through the year and maintain our assets, we'll have some increasing in costs related to those activities. So didn't want people to get so focused on the high amount of excess cash that we generated during the first quarter.\nJohn Mackay: All right, thanks. That\u2019s helpful. Maybe to follow up on that Pam, just a last comment you made. I guess that's -- that's the $75 million of incremental costs you are referencing earlier. And I guess, it sounds like that's not part of necessarily the overall CapEx budget. That's the way to think about it.\nPam Beall: Yeah, that's correct John. Those would be -- that would show up in our operating expenses.\nJohn Mackay: Okay. Great. And maybe if I can just squeeze in one more. Look, Utica has been kind of a lot weaker than we've hoped for, for the last couple of quarters. Just curious, if you can give us give us any more specific thoughts and what's going on with those assets. Maybe if there's been a -- I don't know anyone off that could return there. And then any of your efforts on optimizing that footprint whether you've talked about a little bit in the last call?\nGreg Floerke: This is Greg. With regard to Utica, as I mentioned, most of the focus there over the last few years has been on in drilling the dry Utica areas. And we did see a quick ramp up in that. And we saw peak levels probably about a year ago. The rich Utica has been on a path where new drilling and new wells have not been sufficient to offset the normal decline of existing wells. So, we're hopeful that the Utica, the current NGL prices will actually insert more drilling in the rich area of the Utica. But the larger impact that you've seen is, where we see the largest swings is in the dry gas area. Its largest volume and if there's a timing issue on drilling, that shows up in a larger volume and larger percentage way, we're still bullish on Utica dry gas drilling. And you're hopeful that we'll see. You continue to see good progress in terms of growth in the future there.\nJohn Mackay: Okay. Thank you for the time.\nMike Hennigan: You're welcome, John.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now go to Spiro Dounis of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nSpiro Dounis: Hey, good morning, team. Mike, last quarter you frame 2021 EBITDA with one of your banks in the river analogies. And I think \u2013 you kind of put in a range of 4.9 billion to 5.3 billion, just annualizing some relevant 2020 quarters? I know, you don't give official guidance, but curious a few months in now, you still feel like that's a relevant range and if you're leaning kind of heavily in a direction there?\nMike Hennigan: Yes, Spiro, it's Mike. So the main reason that we don't try to guide to that is, we don't have control the volumes that come out of the system in general. We make our best guess at it. I think you're referencing, last quarter, Pam gave a little bit of a \u2013 of the banks of the river, and that is how we think about it. So, we're obviously happy when you know, we're seeing the markets the same way that the upstream side of the business does. But for our biggest challenges, we just don't control it. So I'll tell you, we keep a look at those things. We think about scenarios. And then we step back, and we concentrate on the things that we do control. So, we've had a lot of emphasis recently on cost reductions. And I think you're seeing that in our \u2013 in our earnings year-on-year. At the same time, we're very cognizant of, what are the scenarios that can play out for cash? And like, a couple of the questions that were asked earlier is, we're evaluating how the capital is going to play itself out through the year. As Pam said, we're still committed to that guidance, Tim and his team are evaluating whether there's economic support for us to enable some of the projects. At the same time, we're going to keep the \u2013 the discipline pretty high on that, if it stays high, and we don't want to execute on those, we'll give that a little bit of time to percolate some more, and then use the cash for the other levers that we have. So \u2013 so you're right, in that, we think about scenarios, and we think about, what if everything goes our way? And then, we also think about, what if things don't go our way? I mean our goal Spiro is to try and be as transparent, to the market as we can. We try and talk about not just the good things, but the risks that are out there. We've said, we have two risks that, people are very aware of, example, and what's going to play out in that regard. Again, we don't control it, but we try and scenario plan around it to sort of high plains pipeline is another risk that we have out there that, again, we have our opinion of the way it's going to play itself out. But we don't control it. So that's kind of the process going back to the very first question of how do we think about this \u2013 this excess cash, I think we're in a good position, it's the place we want it to be, where we have these choices and levers. And then we try and take our best inputs as to all the information we have, at the time, we see how the market plays itself out. Obviously, everybody's pretty excited about, the rollout of vaccines and the impact that that's starting to have on the economy. And, you we are too, at the same time, we're still, gasoline demand in the US is still less than it was pre-pandemic, roughly 5%, somewhere in that range. And then it varies regionally, it's still lower in the West Coast that was, impacted more by the pandemics and say, some of the other regions. So, we're just like everybody, have tempered optimism towards recovery. But at the same time, we just got to be careful about the data. We don't want to get in front of ourselves. And I think you hit it on the head, I've been trying to explain this concept of scenario planning and some probabilities and then we're just trying to make the best decision as we can, on a real-time basis. So I hope that gives you a little more flavors to how we're thinking about it. We don't control that exact up, that upstream number. We watch it. We trend. We talked to our customers, et cetera, et cetera. And then \u2013 and then the reality just like everybody, those companies are doing the best they can on a quarter-to-quarter basis just like we are. Does that help you at all?\nSpiro Dounis: No. I guess, Mike appreciate the all the color there. So understood. Second one, just on renewables again, sorry, keeping an eye on this, but just curious how you're, you know, I know it's early days, but curious how you're going to approach capital allocation, I guess. And I think about the blueprint there, I guess what I'm wondering is to the extent you've got competing conventional projects versus renewable projects, and they more or less have the same return profile, this tie goes to the renewables. Are you looking at those projects through a different risk lens? And curious if this is an area where we could see you do more sort of JV opportunities with established players out there?\nMike Hennigan: Yeah, I think you hit it on the head, ties would go their way, we are conscious that over time renewables are going to be a bigger part of the energy landscape. So there's no doubt that we're conscious of that. The pace that that's going to occur and the economics behind how that occurs is still up in the air. Tim mentioned, once the specific project that people are spending a lot of time with, but there's many on the horizon right now. I would say that, the list of things that we're looking at is pretty long, but ready to execute today we're still evaluating some of these things. So, I think you hit it on the head though, as far as where would we invest, we want to try and put our capital into an area that is going to grow over time. We do believe that the energy evolution will continue to occur over time. Some of the areas I think are a little bit ahead of its time as far as the rhetoric. Some of the areas I think, are very current. So, all those types of things, the way you described it, I think, is exactly the way we think about it. And then, like I said, just what we were saying earlier, is even an individual project, we'll start to talk about some scenarios around it. You hit a really important point as well, what are the risks around it? And what's the term of it? And how much support do we have for? And how many customers? And what's the credit capabilities behind it? All those things come into play. So I like to think that our job is to have a very robust process, and be very cognizant of capital that we could return the unitholders if we chose to deploy it in a capital spending that we got to feel really confident that it's going to deliver a lot of value. So that's why -- if anything we're trying to leave you with, we raised the bar on capital discipline. We're trying to be as cognizant as we can of the market as it evolves. And at the same time, we're in a nice position to have some levers to deploy cash in a lot of different ways.\nSpiro Dounis: Great. That's all I have. Thanks Mike. Thanks, Pam.\nMike Hennigan: You're welcome, Spiro.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMichael Blum: Thanks. Good morning everyone. Maybe just to stay on this topic a little longer, so just to understand it a little better. So you've got your sort of big three mission projects that you outline. Beyond those, it sounds like there's not going to be a whole lot necessarily in terms of larger size projects on the midstream side. And then on the renewable side, it's TBD, but it sounds like all being equal, those will take more time to develop. And so therefore, the CapEx should probably trend lower at least in the near term looking at 2022 and beyond. Just want to know if that's the right way to kind of think about it?\nMike Hennigan: Yes, Michael. I'd say, you're in the right church, whether you turn out to be in the right view or not, time will tell. I think, we are describing it just very much the way you did is. There's a lot of projects that the team are looking at, maybe more bold on lower capital, higher return, as opposed to, like you said, The Big Bang, that gets a lot of press. But we're very happy with the big projects that we've done, the team -- we have MVC protection behind the higher capital deployment ones, and the NGL project turned out to be a real good project for us, Tim, and the team put together a nice lower capital solution for our customers. So that's worked out well. So yeah, right now we're looking at what's the best return projects, they may be smaller bits of capital. As Pam said, right, at the moment, we're still feeling that that capital guidance that we've given is good. As we progress through the year, it looks like things are going to take a little longer than, we'll be a little bit under that. And that's kind of what we said, last quarter as well. So we're trying to give our best transparency, but I think you've described it well. It's not that we're opposed to doing something of a larger nature, if it comes to fruition, we're not opposed to that, we're not opposed to looking at anything that creates a lot of value. But in the short term, having capital discipline is a higher priority, lowering costs is a higher priority, generating increases in the amount of earnings that we establish is kind of where we're putting a lot of our focus.\nMichael Blum: Thanks. And then I know that another part of the plan has always been portfolio optimization, particularly on the GMP side of things. And I know that that market has been pretty slow, in the last bit of time, wonder if there's any change that you're seeing?\nMike Hennigan: There hasn't been any change to date, Michael. But as you can see gas prices are now close to $3 on the benchmark. So things are looking up, Pam said it earlier, probably one of the biggest things that we've debated with the sell side in the buy side for a while, is our natural gas business. Pam mentioned it earlier, we think natural gas will be an important part of this energy evolution over time. We've kind of defended our natural gas position. When people have questions a lot of, why are we in this business, I think people are starting to see a little bit more of the stability that we talked about and some of the resiliency in our cash flows. So I hope people are seeing a little bit of what we've been thinking for a while. And then it's going to take a little bit of time. As mentioned earlier, and Greg commented on it, rigs are starting back a little bit more on the oil side, now that we're at $60 oil, so you're seeing rigs start to come back in that area. Natural gas will expect that to occur over time as well, albeit in a new dynamic, where producers are going to be a little bit more stringent about managing their cash flows. But I think in the long-term, we still like the position we're in and we like the business that we have. We're hoping the market has seen the resiliency that we've kind of talked about, and haven't had as much of a chance to display it. But the pandemic has given us that opportunity to show, year-on-year earnings growth in in 2020. And we continue to show that so. So hopefully that gives you a picture of what we're trying to do. In the meantime, I've tried to explain, quarter-to-quarter we can continue to evaluate the market, evaluate the projects. I think you said it well, we don't have a major one that we're ready to announce at this point, but we're looking at everything. So we spend a lot of time looking at the portfolio. Right at the moment, there's nothing on the front burner, as far as the question that people been asking us about divestments. So we don't have anything on the front burner. And the main reason I say that is, we'll like our assets, they're generating free cash, I'm a big believer in our assets have to generate free cash and the assets that we think are challenged, we'll put a little bit more attention there. But in the meantime, while they generate free cash, they're contributing to the partnership. So I think that's a big key, we're not forced to do anything. I use the term we're not giving any assets away. So, if we got a value that we thought was appropriate to create value for the unit-holders, and we would execute on it. But we haven't seen that today. We've been very open about that. We've run a few processes. And at the end of the day, we have not seen things that that we think would be of the value of us holding the assets ourselves. I hope that helps.\nMichael Blum: Yes. Thank you very much.\nMike Hennigan: You're welcome, Michael.\nOperator: The last question comes from Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. Your line is open, please go ahead.\nKeith Stanley: Thanks. Good morning. I just want to first clarify the operating cost commentary again. So, was it a $75 million increase quarter-over-quarter in Q2? And that's kind of a good run rate from there or our costs just a little inflated in Q2, and then relatedly talking to release again, to being committed to lowering the cost structure? You've already done a lot. Should we read that as there's potential for another sort of meaningful round of cost reductions, or is most of the low hanging fruit already done at this point?\nPam Beall: Yeah, Keith its Pam, I'll take that. So, just to clarify that $75 million increase that was a sequential increase from first quarter to second and especially around some of the projects that we do that are expensed instead of capitalized. Now, we did make a meaningful reduction in the total costs, operating costs from 2019 to 2020 and those continue in 2021. In fact, we mentioned on one of our previous calls that some of our workforce reduction activities didn't take place until the fourth quarter. So, we had talked about $200 million commitment that we knew we could deliver on $200 million of operating cost reductions. And then we said the, the benefit of the lower workforce would be reflected in 2021. So, we're definitely seeing some of that, as you know, here in the first quarter, and we'll see that throughout 2021. And as you look at 2021, compared to 2020, our operating expenses will be lower. It's just that sequentially in because we had generated so much cash in the first quarter and our spending was so low. In fact, I haven't seen our capital investment this low on a quarterly basis since 2014, before we acquired the natural gas business, so I just didn't want people to think that it was going to remain every quarter that long. So, just trying to provide a little more color there. I hope that's helpful Keith?\nKeith Stanley: It is. And the second part just on -- if there's more to come, that's meaningful on cost reductions, just given you, you guys already done a lot on that front?\nPam Beall: Yes, I would just say on the margin we're going to continue to focus on managing the business with as Mike likes to call it. It's our mantra, strict capital discipline and strict expense management.\nMike Hennigan: Yes, Keith, I'll just add a little bit to that. One of the things your question is very similar to a lot we get -- we have the sports analogy would inning game or what quarter of the football game, et cetera. I like to think about it is every game, if I use the football analogy, every game that we approach, we're going to ask ourselves is there areas that we can still challenge ourselves more in? But we're clearly -- we played the first half if you want to use that term and we're evaluating is there other opportunities, as everybody knows, there's diminishing returns ultimately, there's only so much you can challenge yourself, but I'm hoping that we're leaving the market with every game plan, every time that we think about this, we're going to be asking ourselves that question because the market continues to evolve. And our cost structure is something that we should not put the playbook down on and say that's behind this now, it's something we're going to continue to watch, continue to challenge.  I do give the team a lot of credit, when I asked everybody to look at this concept of changing the cost structure, and I think the team's done a really nice job of looking at it. And there's some areas that we're still questioning and to be perfectly frank, some areas you go in, you think you can do X, and it has turned out to be y, plus or minus. And then the same thing in some other areas, you might do a little better than you're originally thinking, you might do a little worse.  But the point being is you keep challenging, to keep looking at it, keep asking yourself the question, is there an opportunity there? I personally, I'm a cost talk in a lot of ways. It's -- to talk about revenues, but dollar revenue and $1 of expense, get the same dollar to the bottom line. So, it's something that is top of mind for me all the time. So hopefully, it'll stay in focus for you guys to see how we progress on that.\nKeith Stanley: Great. That's helpful. Second question, just you guys have talked and you always do about growing EBITDA in the business. And then you also address just the 2012 pipeline assets and contracts pretty clearly. So when you look out over the next, I don't know, call it two, three year, what are the main levers you think that grow EBITDA of the company, or are there any notable headwinds or things to be mindful of beyond the marine contract this year? That could be headwinds over the next call it, two to three years.\nMike Hennigan: Yeah. Keith, I guess one of the things that we hope the market likes about us is we try and be as transparent as we can, especially on headwind. So, the two that we said, are very much out there that are material, it\u2019s the dapple situation and it's a sort of high plains pipeline. To serve high plains, we thought was resolved, it's kind of gotten bounced back now, again, so it's back out on the table. So those two issues are material in nature. So those are potential out there. Now, again, people ask us, what do we think is going to happen on? Again, we don't control that, we watch the court proceedings etcetera just like you guys do. But those are out there. I think Pam was very transparent when we said, the marine contracts was going to be a significant change to us, roughly $100 million. And I think, we gave everybody advance notice on that. So we will continue to be transparent on contracts. I liken it to very much to the questions we used to get on the G&P business all the time, people are really worried about that.  On the contract side, we don't have anything on the horizon that we need to make people aware of. In fact, if anything we're trying to make the relationship between MPC and MPLX, more of a win-win over time. And the way that we can integrate and try and drive value for both entities is really the main goal. So if we see something that we think is an issue that we need to make aware of, then we'll certainly disclose that. And like I said, Pam, I think it's done a nice job of that in the past. And that'll continue to be our mantra. So we don't want to surprise the market with anything out the Apple goes. I think everybody's watching to see how that plays itself out as an example. And if there's something else that we think is a headwind, we're certainly going to make you aware of it.\nKeith Stanley: Thanks very much.\nMike Hennigan: You're welcome.\nOperator: That was our last question. \nKristina Kazarian : Perfect. Thank you. So, thank you everyone for joining us today. And thank you for your interest in MPLX. Should you have additional questions or would like clarification on any of the topics discussed this morning, members of our team will be available to take your calls. Have a great day.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Slide 5 outlines the first quarter operational and financial highlights for our logistics and storage segments. Segment EBITDA increased $24 million year-over-year, despite headwinds from a reduction in our marine transportation fees and lower throughput on some of our pipeline equity method investments, the team's focus on operating expense reductions and business efficiencies provided support for the segment. Additionally, all terminal throughputs were lower compared with the first quarter of 2020, pipeline volumes were in line with the same period last year. We continue to make good progress on our strategies to create an integrated crude oil and natural gas logistics system from the Permian to the Gulf Coast. The Wink to Webster crude oil pipeline, in which MPLX has an equity interest, continues to play segments in the service. And we expect this activity to continue throughout the remainder of the year. As segments are placed in service, we expect EBITDA contributions from this project to ramp up throughout 2022. Consistent with our focus on projects with minimal return risk, the pipeline system has 100% of its contractual capacity committed with long-term minimum volume commitments. On the Whistler natural gas pipeline, commissioning activities on certain segments are underway in preparation for the project to startup in the third quarter of this year. Similar to the Wink to Webster project, Whistler is backed by long-term minimum volume commitments and we expect EBITDA contributions also ramped up through 2022. Finally, we continue to work towards an in-service date in the fourth quarter for the natural gas liquids takeaway solution, which provides long haul NGL service from the Permian to Sweeny, Texas. The project will have an initial capacity of 125,000 barrels per day with the potential to expand up to 350,000 barrels per day. Before we leave the discussions on our L&S segment, I'd like to provide an update on certain contracts between MPC and MPLX. MPLX continues to work alongside MPC as it progresses its portfolio of renewable projects, including potential opportunities to expand our logistics capability to deliver renewable diesel feedstocks. Since renewing the marine contract with MPC in January, we continued to receive questions around contracts for pipelines that were dropped into the partnership in 2012 and are coming up for renewal. But we continue to emphasize many of the assets MPLX operates are fit for purpose for MPC's business and are integral to the MPC refining system. Furthermore, we believe our crude and product pipeline contracts are at market rates. As in the past, we fully expect MPC to renew its contract with MPLX, as they mature over time, and for our revenue from these contracts to continue to reflect the strong integrated nature of the underlying business. Now moving on to our gathering and processing business on Slide 6, we provide first quarter operational financial highlights for this segments. For the first quarter of 2021, gathered volumes were lower than the same period last year across our footprint. Furthermore, process volumes were down in all regions, except the Marcellus. In the Marcellus, process volumes increased 3% and fractionated volumes increased 7% relative to the first quarter of 2020. The overall operating statistics include the impacts of severe weather during the quarter in the southwest. We estimate an approximate $16 million impact to our business from the winter storms, with the majority of that impact reflected in our gathering and processing segment results. This impact included reduced volumes at some of our facilities as well as higher energy costs. Gathering and processing segment, EBITDA increased $34 million from the first quarter of 2020. This was supported by higher natural gas liquids price and lower operating expenses, helping offset the impact of lower volumes, as well as the costs incurred due to the severe weather. In line with previously announced efforts around portfolio optimizations, we did close on the sale of our heavily to plant in Corpus Christi, Texas in mid-February. In the Marcellus, we've begun commissioning activities for our Smithburg 1 processing facility, with a targeted in-service date in the third quarter. Now moving to our first quarter financial highlights on slide seven, total adjusted EBITDA was $1.4 billion and distributable cash flow was $1.1 billion. MPLX grew both EBITDA and distributable cash flow compared to the first quarter of 2020. Our distributable cash flow generation provided strong coverage of 1.5 times for the quarter. And we paid $754 million in distributions. Furthermore, MPLX continued to self-fund all capital investments in distributions to unitholders with $277 million of excess cash will remain, after these activities for the quarter. In addition, we returned $155 million to unitholders, through the repurchase of over $6 million publicly traded common units under our unit repurchase program. As of March 31st, total repurchases of $180 million have been made since the program's inception was launched in the fourth quarter of 2020. Even continued uncertainty facing the economic recovery, we were extremely disciplined in our expense and capital spend for the first quarter. This caution helps to drive the significant amount of excess free cash flow, generated during the quarter. Looking forward, we've not changed our guidance on growth capital investment of $800 million for 2021. This implies a higher run-rate of capital spend for the remaining quarters. As we increase our growth capital project related work that tends to ramp-up through summer months. We also expect to see a meaningful increase in the projects that are expensed. Subject to many factors that influence timing of project and maintenance spend. This amount could be sequentially higher by as much as $75 million in the second quarter, relative to the first quarter spend. With our continued capital and expense, discipline and rose in EBITDA, we expect to continue generating excess cash flow for 2021, providing financial flexibility to pursue value creating opportunities for our unitholders, including unit repurchases. We intend to remain flexible with our unit repurchase program and expect the pace of unit repurchases to be informed by market conditions, the business environment, the amount of excess cash generated in prior quarters, among other factors. On slide six, we provide a summary of key financial and balance sheet information. And I want to highlight that the inflection to generating excess cash and returning capital to unitholders has not compromised our focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a leverage ratio of 3.9 times, approximately $2.7 billion available under a $3.5 billion bank revolving credit facility, and $1.5 billion available on our intercompany facility with MPC. We intend to maintain our investment grade credit profile. And as Mike mentioned earlier, hold our debt flat, restrict capital discipline, growing EBITDA and stable debt we believe leverage will decline overtime. So now let me turn the call back over to Kristina. Thanks. Hey, [Indiscernible] it's Pam. I just wanted to jump in and add to Mike's comments there. The other thing that that we should talk about is the fact that we're very bullish on the role that natural gas is going to play, even as we go through an energy transition. So, we continue to look for opportunities to participate in the natural gas value chain downstream of the operations that we have today. And as Tim talked about, the some of our pipe pipeline activities, and I don't know, Tim, if you wanted to add anything on mentioned like the natural gas storage investment through our joint venture. So, we're looking for those kinds of opportunities as well, because we think that natural gas is going to be an important part of energy solution well into the future. Yeah, John thanks. This is Pam. I'll take that question. So, we talked about the fact that we actually generated $277 million of excess cash after funding the distributions in our capital program. That surplus cash did include proceeds from the Javelina sale. We did deploy $155 million of that into unit repurchases. But we also highlighted that, the first quarter, we were extremely conservative on all forms of cash that we spent, just given some of the economic uncertainty as we move through the beginning of 2021, not knowing how the pandemic would play out. So we do expect to see higher capital in subsequent quarters, and also some increase in expenses related to projects that we do that are expensed. And as I've highlighted, in some prior calls, some of our maintenance activities as well highlight API 653 tank work, we expense that work, other companies capitalize it, so as we move through the year and maintain our assets, we'll have some increasing in costs related to those activities. So didn't want people to get so focused on the high amount of excess cash that we generated during the first quarter. Yeah, that's correct John. Those would be -- that would show up in our operating expenses. Yeah, Keith its Pam, I'll take that. So, just to clarify that $75 million increase that was a sequential increase from first quarter to second and especially around some of the projects that we do that are expensed instead of capitalized. Now, we did make a meaningful reduction in the total costs, operating costs from 2019 to 2020 and those continue in 2021. In fact, we mentioned on one of our previous calls that some of our workforce reduction activities didn't take place until the fourth quarter. So, we had talked about $200 million commitment that we knew we could deliver on $200 million of operating cost reductions. And then we said the, the benefit of the lower workforce would be reflected in 2021. So, we're definitely seeing some of that, as you know, here in the first quarter, and we'll see that throughout 2021. And as you look at 2021, compared to 2020, our operating expenses will be lower. It's just that sequentially in because we had generated so much cash in the first quarter and our spending was so low. In fact, I haven't seen our capital investment this low on a quarterly basis since 2014, before we acquired the natural gas business, so I just didn't want people to think that it was going to remain every quarter that long. So, just trying to provide a little more color there. I hope that's helpful Keith? Yes, I would just say on the margin we're going to continue to focus on managing the business with as Mike likes to call it. It's our mantra, strict capital discipline and strict expense management."

            "name": "Greg Floerke",
            "content": "It's Greg Floerke. With regard to the northeast outlook, NGL prices, and more currently, gas prices are supportive of additional development in the northeast. Rich gas drilling remains focused primarily in the Marcellus and more of the dry or lean gas drilling in the Utica. We do see seasonal -- depending on the season, and particularly the winter time and maintenance schedules, we do see fluctuation in volume quarter-over-quarter but in general, the Northeast is a key basin for us. And we think NGL prices including the strip price and current inventory levels are supportive of potentially more rich gas drilling in the region. This is Greg. With regard to Utica, as I mentioned, most of the focus there over the last few years has been on in drilling the dry Utica areas. And we did see a quick ramp up in that. And we saw peak levels probably about a year ago. The rich Utica has been on a path where new drilling and new wells have not been sufficient to offset the normal decline of existing wells. So, we're hopeful that the Utica, the current NGL prices will actually insert more drilling in the rich area of the Utica. But the larger impact that you've seen is, where we see the largest swings is in the dry gas area. Its largest volume and if there's a timing issue on drilling, that shows up in a larger volume and larger percentage way, we're still bullish on Utica dry gas drilling. And you're hopeful that we'll see. You continue to see good progress in terms of growth in the future there."

            "name": "Mike Hennigan",
            "content": "Thanks, Kristina. Good morning and thank you for joining our call. Earlier today, we reported adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2021 of $1.4 billion. Despite lingering challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic and headwinds in the business environment, we were able to grow earnings on a year-on-year basis. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect an impact to our L&S business from the renewal of the marine contracts and equipment rate adjustments. Additionally, our G&P results also reflect some impacts from the severe winter weather, including higher energy costs and lower volumes. We continue to identify opportunities to structurally lower our costs and drive efficiencies in the business. And our reported operating expenses for the quarter continue to trend down. We're also maintaining strict capital discipline to efficiently execute our growth plans on a high return portfolio of investments. Our focus on strict capital discipline combined with growing EBITDA has allowed the business to generate excess cash after self-funding our distribution and capital program. We remain committed to prioritizing return of capital with over $900 million returned to unit holders this quarter through distributions in unit purchases. Furthermore, we believe our earnings growth, combined with the desire to hold debt flat will result in a reduction in leverage over time. As we look ahead through 2021, we expect to generate excess cash after capital investments and distributions as we had planned to do. The availability of COVID-19 vaccine provides hope for the return of global transportation fuel demand and economic recovery. Even though many uncertainties still exist, the world's need for reliable, affordable and responsibly produce energy remains important. We believe we can continue to meet this need through our strategies that will allow us to successfully adapt to the evolving energy landscape by shaping our asset portfolio to meet the challenges and opportunities created by the energy evolution. If you look at slide 4, I'd like to provide some comments on our commitment to ESG. Last quarter, we discussed the importance of setting objectives for the organization to drive continuous improvement on ESG. Our commitment to sustainability positions us to deliver strong results in this space, including lowering the carbon intensity of our operations and products, improving energy efficiency and conserving natural resources, while using innovative technology to do it. We've established a program to lower methane emissions at our natural gas gathering and processing business includes a goal of reducing our methane emissions intensity to 50% below 2016 levels by the year 2025. A broader vision of sustainability emphasizes delivering essential energy products and services to the world in ways that create share value for all our stakeholders. Now let me turn the call over to Pam to discuss our operational and financial results. Good morning, James, this is Mike. On buybacks, the best guidance we can give you, I tried to say this a couple times is, it's going to be a dynamic process for us, not a program that we just set and walk away from. So, we've tried to be transparent that we were driving to excess free cash flow, we achieve that, and we've set back in the latter part of 2020 and into 2021. So the way we're going to look at it is each quarter as the market moves, and we have more intelligence about the market, the unit price, the outlook, et cetera, et cetera, we're going to look at what's the best way to deploy that excess cash. Buybacks is, obviously, something that we prioritize in the recent terms, especially since we're trading at the yields that we're trading at, but we have all the levers available to us, buybacks, distributions, debt, capital, all of those avenues are available to us. And as a management team, we're going to continue to talk about things through the quarter, and continue to make what I call real-time decisions or a dynamic process that's trying to be receptive to the market conditions at the time and trying to provide the best unit-holder value. I hope that gives you a better feeling as to how we're thinking about the process. Yeah, James, I'm now going to let Tim [ph] jump in with some more detail. But I'm just saying in general, we're obviously aware of the energy evolution that's occurring. There's a lot of opportunities that people are exploring, Tim and his team are looking at a lot of different things. So I'll let him give some color here. You're welcome. Yes. So we haven't guidance to a detailed point of disclosures on the things that we're looking at. I think the takeaway that you should think about is there's a pretty myriad opportunity set in front of us now. Tim, just mentioned, carbon capture is one thing that we're looking at. Pam mentioned renewable diesels obviously, being advanced by MPC. Lowering the carbon intensity of products is going to continue to be a theme that plays itself out there. So, we haven't given any detailed disclosures, other than to say that we're cognizant of the environment that we're in. I like to say, people were talking a lot about hydrogen at one end of the spectrum. I think that's a little further out in time. But it is something that we're evaluating as we go forward. Now MPC is in the business of hydrogen. So that's something that we're very close to. At the same time, on the near-end, as Pam mentioned, renewable diesel is on the front-end. As Tim just mentioned, carbon, any types of activities around there, are all front and centre for us. However, we're going to make sure that when we advance the ball in there that we have a really strong return. So we are going to maintain capital discipline, not jump at something that just appears to be good. We're going to make sure that, at the end of the day it gives us a good return, and provides value to the unit holders. I'll let Greg take that one. You're welcome. You're welcome, John. Yes, Spiro, it's Mike. So the main reason that we don't try to guide to that is, we don't have control the volumes that come out of the system in general. We make our best guess at it. I think you're referencing, last quarter, Pam gave a little bit of a \u2013 of the banks of the river, and that is how we think about it. So, we're obviously happy when you know, we're seeing the markets the same way that the upstream side of the business does. But for our biggest challenges, we just don't control it. So I'll tell you, we keep a look at those things. We think about scenarios. And then we step back, and we concentrate on the things that we do control. So, we've had a lot of emphasis recently on cost reductions. And I think you're seeing that in our \u2013 in our earnings year-on-year. At the same time, we're very cognizant of, what are the scenarios that can play out for cash? And like, a couple of the questions that were asked earlier is, we're evaluating how the capital is going to play itself out through the year. As Pam said, we're still committed to that guidance, Tim and his team are evaluating whether there's economic support for us to enable some of the projects. At the same time, we're going to keep the \u2013 the discipline pretty high on that, if it stays high, and we don't want to execute on those, we'll give that a little bit of time to percolate some more, and then use the cash for the other levers that we have. So \u2013 so you're right, in that, we think about scenarios, and we think about, what if everything goes our way? And then, we also think about, what if things don't go our way? I mean our goal Spiro is to try and be as transparent, to the market as we can. We try and talk about not just the good things, but the risks that are out there. We've said, we have two risks that, people are very aware of, example, and what's going to play out in that regard. Again, we don't control it, but we try and scenario plan around it to sort of high plains pipeline is another risk that we have out there that, again, we have our opinion of the way it's going to play itself out. But we don't control it. So that's kind of the process going back to the very first question of how do we think about this \u2013 this excess cash, I think we're in a good position, it's the place we want it to be, where we have these choices and levers. And then we try and take our best inputs as to all the information we have, at the time, we see how the market plays itself out. Obviously, everybody's pretty excited about, the rollout of vaccines and the impact that that's starting to have on the economy. And, you we are too, at the same time, we're still, gasoline demand in the US is still less than it was pre-pandemic, roughly 5%, somewhere in that range. And then it varies regionally, it's still lower in the West Coast that was, impacted more by the pandemics and say, some of the other regions. So, we're just like everybody, have tempered optimism towards recovery. But at the same time, we just got to be careful about the data. We don't want to get in front of ourselves. And I think you hit it on the head, I've been trying to explain this concept of scenario planning and some probabilities and then we're just trying to make the best decision as we can, on a real-time basis. So I hope that gives you a little more flavors to how we're thinking about it. We don't control that exact up, that upstream number. We watch it. We trend. We talked to our customers, et cetera, et cetera. And then \u2013 and then the reality just like everybody, those companies are doing the best they can on a quarter-to-quarter basis just like we are. Does that help you at all? Yeah, I think you hit it on the head, ties would go their way, we are conscious that over time renewables are going to be a bigger part of the energy landscape. So there's no doubt that we're conscious of that. The pace that that's going to occur and the economics behind how that occurs is still up in the air. Tim mentioned, once the specific project that people are spending a lot of time with, but there's many on the horizon right now. I would say that, the list of things that we're looking at is pretty long, but ready to execute today we're still evaluating some of these things. So, I think you hit it on the head though, as far as where would we invest, we want to try and put our capital into an area that is going to grow over time. We do believe that the energy evolution will continue to occur over time. Some of the areas I think are a little bit ahead of its time as far as the rhetoric. Some of the areas I think, are very current. So, all those types of things, the way you described it, I think, is exactly the way we think about it. And then, like I said, just what we were saying earlier, is even an individual project, we'll start to talk about some scenarios around it. You hit a really important point as well, what are the risks around it? And what's the term of it? And how much support do we have for? And how many customers? And what's the credit capabilities behind it? All those things come into play. So I like to think that our job is to have a very robust process, and be very cognizant of capital that we could return the unitholders if we chose to deploy it in a capital spending that we got to feel really confident that it's going to deliver a lot of value. So that's why -- if anything we're trying to leave you with, we raised the bar on capital discipline. We're trying to be as cognizant as we can of the market as it evolves. And at the same time, we're in a nice position to have some levers to deploy cash in a lot of different ways. You're welcome, Spiro. Yes, Michael. I'd say, you're in the right church, whether you turn out to be in the right view or not, time will tell. I think, we are describing it just very much the way you did is. There's a lot of projects that the team are looking at, maybe more bold on lower capital, higher return, as opposed to, like you said, The Big Bang, that gets a lot of press. But we're very happy with the big projects that we've done, the team -- we have MVC protection behind the higher capital deployment ones, and the NGL project turned out to be a real good project for us, Tim, and the team put together a nice lower capital solution for our customers. So that's worked out well. So yeah, right now we're looking at what's the best return projects, they may be smaller bits of capital. As Pam said, right, at the moment, we're still feeling that that capital guidance that we've given is good. As we progress through the year, it looks like things are going to take a little longer than, we'll be a little bit under that. And that's kind of what we said, last quarter as well. So we're trying to give our best transparency, but I think you've described it well. It's not that we're opposed to doing something of a larger nature, if it comes to fruition, we're not opposed to that, we're not opposed to looking at anything that creates a lot of value. But in the short term, having capital discipline is a higher priority, lowering costs is a higher priority, generating increases in the amount of earnings that we establish is kind of where we're putting a lot of our focus. There hasn't been any change to date, Michael. But as you can see gas prices are now close to $3 on the benchmark. So things are looking up, Pam said it earlier, probably one of the biggest things that we've debated with the sell side in the buy side for a while, is our natural gas business. Pam mentioned it earlier, we think natural gas will be an important part of this energy evolution over time. We've kind of defended our natural gas position. When people have questions a lot of, why are we in this business, I think people are starting to see a little bit more of the stability that we talked about and some of the resiliency in our cash flows. So I hope people are seeing a little bit of what we've been thinking for a while. And then it's going to take a little bit of time. As mentioned earlier, and Greg commented on it, rigs are starting back a little bit more on the oil side, now that we're at $60 oil, so you're seeing rigs start to come back in that area. Natural gas will expect that to occur over time as well, albeit in a new dynamic, where producers are going to be a little bit more stringent about managing their cash flows. But I think in the long-term, we still like the position we're in and we like the business that we have. We're hoping the market has seen the resiliency that we've kind of talked about, and haven't had as much of a chance to display it. But the pandemic has given us that opportunity to show, year-on-year earnings growth in in 2020. And we continue to show that so. So hopefully that gives you a picture of what we're trying to do. In the meantime, I've tried to explain, quarter-to-quarter we can continue to evaluate the market, evaluate the projects. I think you said it well, we don't have a major one that we're ready to announce at this point, but we're looking at everything. So we spend a lot of time looking at the portfolio. Right at the moment, there's nothing on the front burner, as far as the question that people been asking us about divestments. So we don't have anything on the front burner. And the main reason I say that is, we'll like our assets, they're generating free cash, I'm a big believer in our assets have to generate free cash and the assets that we think are challenged, we'll put a little bit more attention there. But in the meantime, while they generate free cash, they're contributing to the partnership. So I think that's a big key, we're not forced to do anything. I use the term we're not giving any assets away. So, if we got a value that we thought was appropriate to create value for the unit-holders, and we would execute on it. But we haven't seen that today. We've been very open about that. We've run a few processes. And at the end of the day, we have not seen things that that we think would be of the value of us holding the assets ourselves. I hope that helps. You're welcome, Michael. Yes, Keith, I'll just add a little bit to that. One of the things your question is very similar to a lot we get -- we have the sports analogy would inning game or what quarter of the football game, et cetera. I like to think about it is every game, if I use the football analogy, every game that we approach, we're going to ask ourselves is there areas that we can still challenge ourselves more in? But we're clearly -- we played the first half if you want to use that term and we're evaluating is there other opportunities, as everybody knows, there's diminishing returns ultimately, there's only so much you can challenge yourself, but I'm hoping that we're leaving the market with every game plan, every time that we think about this, we're going to be asking ourselves that question because the market continues to evolve. And our cost structure is something that we should not put the playbook down on and say that's behind this now, it's something we're going to continue to watch, continue to challenge.  I do give the team a lot of credit, when I asked everybody to look at this concept of changing the cost structure, and I think the team's done a really nice job of looking at it. And there's some areas that we're still questioning and to be perfectly frank, some areas you go in, you think you can do X, and it has turned out to be y, plus or minus. And then the same thing in some other areas, you might do a little better than you're originally thinking, you might do a little worse.  But the point being is you keep challenging, to keep looking at it, keep asking yourself the question, is there an opportunity there? I personally, I'm a cost talk in a lot of ways. It's -- to talk about revenues, but dollar revenue and $1 of expense, get the same dollar to the bottom line. So, it's something that is top of mind for me all the time. So hopefully, it'll stay in focus for you guys to see how we progress on that. Yeah. Keith, I guess one of the things that we hope the market likes about us is we try and be as transparent as we can, especially on headwind. So, the two that we said, are very much out there that are material, it's the dapple situation and it's a sort of high plains pipeline. To serve high plains, we thought was resolved, it's kind of gotten bounced back now, again, so it's back out on the table. So those two issues are material in nature. So those are potential out there. Now, again, people ask us, what do we think is going to happen on? Again, we don't control that, we watch the court proceedings etcetera just like you guys do. But those are out there. I think Pam was very transparent when we said, the marine contracts was going to be a significant change to us, roughly $100 million. And I think, we gave everybody advance notice on that. So we will continue to be transparent on contracts. I liken it to very much to the questions we used to get on the G&P business all the time, people are really worried about that.  On the contract side, we don't have anything on the horizon that we need to make people aware of. In fact, if anything we're trying to make the relationship between MPC and MPLX, more of a win-win over time. And the way that we can integrate and try and drive value for both entities is really the main goal. So if we see something that we think is an issue that we need to make aware of, then we'll certainly disclose that. And like I said, Pam, I think it's done a nice job of that in the past. And that'll continue to be our mantra. So we don't want to surprise the market with anything out the Apple goes. I think everybody's watching to see how that plays itself out as an example. And if there's something else that we think is a headwind, we're certainly going to make you aware of it. You're welcome."

And if you got the right environment, it may drive a competitive project. But if you look at most of those out there, it requires stacking of incentives. And sometimes variable cost depending on the capture, transportation and sequester costs come into play. So if you have projects with low capture costs, and minimal transportation and some favorable geology, well, then that might cover it. But other projects would require things like LCFS uplift for certain products, in order to hurdle those higher costs. So again, it kind of depends. We do expect the government policies a little further define the regulatory framework. And it's possible that there could be additional incentives that come down the pike."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.\nKristina Kazarian: Good morning, and welcome to the MPLX fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our Web site at mplx.com, under the Investor tab. Joining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan, Chairman and CEO; John Quaid, CFO; and other members of the executive team. We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statements and non-GAAP disclaimer on Slide 2. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the call and during the question-and-answer session that follows. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Hennigan: Thanks, Kristina. Good morning. Thank you for joining our call. First off, I want to recognize a new Director on the MPLX Board. In November, Christy Breves, who recently served as CFO for U.S. Steel, was appointed as a new Independent Director. 2022 was a strong year as we successfully executed on all of our strategic priorities. Full year adjusted EBITDA was $5.8 billion and DCF was $5 billion.  Strong operational performance and customer demand drove record annual pipeline throughputs and increasing Gathering and Processing and fractionation throughputs with each quarter of the year. We also realized EBITDA growth from recent capital investments and remain focused on cost management. Overall, our efforts resulted in a 4% year-over-year adjusted EBITDA and DCF growth.  In line with our commitment to return capital, for the full year, MPLX returned over $3.5 billion of capital back to unitholders through our distribution and unit repurchases. We also made progress towards our goal of leading in sustainable energy through our methane reduction program and with the receipt of EPA's ENERGY STAR award for energy efficiency improvements at several terminals.  Today, we announced our capital expenditure outlook for 2023 of $950 million. Our plan includes approximately $800 million of growth capital and $150 million of maintenance capital. Our growth capital plan is anchored in the Marcellus, Permian and Bakken basins. In addition to new gas processing plants in the Marcellus and Permian, the remainder of our capital plan is mostly focused on other investments targeted at expansion or debottlenecking of existing assets to meet customer demand.  While our capital outlook is primarily focused on our current L&S and G&P footprint, we will continue to evaluate low carbon opportunities where we can leverage technologies that are complementary with our asset footprint and expertise.  Moving to our capital allocation framework. First, maintenance capital. We remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees, and support the communities in which we operate. Second, we remain focused on delivering a secure distribution. Third, after these commitments are met, we will invest to grow while maintaining strict capital discipline. And fourth, we also intend to return excess capital to unitholders. As I've said in the past, we believe this is both a return on and a return of capital business.  Last November, based on the strength and growth of our cash flows, we increased our distribution by 10% to an annual rate of $3.10 per unit, while maintaining a strong distribution coverage ratio of 1.6x. In 2023, we would expect to be similarly focused on our distribution as our primary tool to return capital to unitholders. We are optimistic about our opportunities in 2023 and remain focused on executing the strategic priorities of strict capital discipline, fostering a low cost culture, optimizing our asset portfolio, which are foundational to the growth of MPLX's cash flows.  Now let me turn the call over to John to discuss our operational and financial results for the quarter.\nJohn Quaid: Thanks, Mike. Slide 6 outlines the fourth quarter operational and financial performance highlights for our Logistics and Storage segment. L&S segment adjusted EBITDA increased $45 million when compared to fourth quarter 2021. The increased results were primarily driven by higher pipeline tariffs and contributions from pipeline equity affiliates, partially offset by higher maintenance project-related expenses in the quarter. Pipeline volumes were flat year-over-year, primarily due to the impacts associated with Marathon's refinery turnarounds in both quarters. Terminal volumes were up 4%.  Moving to our Gathering and Processing segment on Slide 7, G&P segment adjusted EBITDA decreased $36 million compared to fourth quarter 2021, as the benefits of higher volumes were more than offset by lower natural gas liquids prices, which averaged $0.78 per gallon for the quarter as compared to $1.05 in the fourth quarter of 2021. In total for the quarter, gathered volumes were up 14% year-over-year due to increased production in the Utica and our Southwest region, which includes our Permian operations.  Processing volumes were up 1% year-over-year, primarily from higher volumes in the Southwest, driven by increased customer demand and our investments in processing capacity in the Permian. In the Marcellus, while Gathering and Processing volumes were slightly lower year-over-year, we did see sequential increases for gathering, processing and fractionation volumes in the basin. These activity levels were in line with our expectations for increased producer activity in the back half of the year.  Moving to our fourth quarter financial highlights on Slide 8, total adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion was roughly flat versus the same period in the prior year, while distributable cash flow of $1.3 billion increased 5%. Results in the quarter were impacted by $23 million special compensation award provided to our employees in recognition of their efforts. We do not anticipate that this expense will structurally impact future costs.  In the fourth quarter, we returned $975 million to unitholders through approximately $800 million in distributions and $175 million of repurchases of common units held by the public. MPLX ended the year with nearly $850 million remaining available under its unit repurchase authorizations. Last week, MPLX declared a fourth quarter distribution of 0.775 per unit, resulting in a distribution coverage ratio of 1.6x for the fourth quarter.  MPLX ended the year with total debt of around $20 billion and a debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.5x, comfortably below our target of approximately 4x. While our absolute level of debt has remained relatively constant, our leverage has decreased due to the growth in our business. And at these leverage levels, we do not see the need to reduce our absolute level of debt.  Earlier today, we announced our intent to redeem the par value, the $600 million of outstanding Series B preferred units in mid February. Subject to market conditions, we expect to refinance these preferred units into long-term debt. In closing, we expect our solid operating performance and growth of our cash flows will enable us to continue to invest in and grow the business while also supporting the return of capital to MPLX unitholders.  Now let me turn the call back over to Kristina.\nKristina Kazarian: Thanks, John. As we open the call for questions, we ask that you limit yourself to one question plus a follow up. We may re-prompt for additional questions as time permits.  With that, Sheila, we're ready for questions today.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Brian Reynolds with UBS. Your line is open.\nBrian Reynolds: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Perhaps to start off on capital allocation, we saw continued commitments, unit repurchases and the redemption announcement on the preferreds. With the preferred redemption announcement and some of the debt maturities that are coming up in '23 and '24, was just curious if you could opine and discuss on how you expect any change in return of cash via special distribution or buybacks going forward, like we've seen in the past just given the upcoming debt maturities and the path that you expect to refinance as well? Thanks.\nJohn Quaid: Great. Hi, Brian. Good morning. Thanks for the question. We'll try and pick that apart in a couple of pieces. First, as I said in my comments and just to reiterate, right, we provided notice to the Series B holders that we're going to redeem those in February. As you note, we also have 1 billion of senior notes maturing in July. And given our leverage and where we are and as we've done in the past, we'll likely look to refinance both of those into long-term debt, subject to market conditions. So that's the first piece on the Bs and the senior notes. And then thinking about return to capital, as you saw us last year, we've gotten lots of feedback from investors; some prefer distribution, some prefer unit repurchases. We've tried to think about our structure around that framework. As you -- more recently, it seems like it's been tilted towards the distribution, as Mike commented, and as you know, we increased the distribution 10% here effective with the third quarter distribution, still really strong coverage at 1.6x, a strong balance sheet at 3.5x leverage. So I think that will be an area we'll continue to focus on in 2023. And then we'll also I think continue to be opportunistic, perhaps more opportunistic around unit repurchases, right? If you look back to when we began the program, we've done a little over 1 billion and about 29 a unit. In the fourth quarter, we did about 176 million. I think 31.75, somewhere in that ballpark. So I think it'll continue to be a part of our framework, but perhaps a little more opportunistic. And, Mike, do you want to add something as well?\nMike Hennigan: Yes, Brian, let me just add a little bit to it. Just on a simple basis, we're generating about 6 billion of EBITDA, about 5 billion of distributable cash flow after that. We've been spending roughly around 1 billion. So we have about $4 billion of free cash flow and distributing 3 billion through our base distribution, which has been leaving about $1 billion of cash after all that. So I think the key is we have a lot of flexibility. And as John said, we'll try and be opportunistic on the buyback side. We'll try and continue to show the market that we continue to grow this partnership. So you'll see us continue to increase distributions over time. So we'll talk about that at some point. But I think we're in a real good position from a financial standpoint, strong balance sheet, excess cash flow, looking for opportunities to deploy but staying strict on returns. And overall, hopefully, that's where the market wants us to be. \nBrian Reynolds: Great. Thanks. Really appreciate all that extra color. And maybe just to quickly touch on the operational side of the house, MPC refinery run siding [ph] into '23. It seems to be faring much better than peers. And curious if management could just opine on expectations for '23 products, volumes versus '22 and if you're seeing any nuances by products that could perhaps support resiliency and product volumes in '23 after just seeing really strong refinery runs last year? Thanks.\nMike Hennigan: It's a good question, Brian. I'm going to let Shawn give you a little more color. But I will say, at the MPC side of the house, we had a really strong year. Safe, reliable operations is key to our business on that side. We ran 96% utilization. If you've followed some of the activity during the year, we had deferred some turnaround activity to the back half of the year. But overall, it was a very strong utilization. So I'll let Shawn comment a little bit on the L&S side.\nShawn Lyon: Hi, Brian. This is Shawn. As Mike said, we had a strong year in '22. We had several records across our assets on the terminal pipeline side. And in '23, we're continuing to see another strong year. And we'll be matching the refinery rates that MPC and others habits. And then also we're excited about the growth out of the Permian and some of the pipelines coming out of the Permian. So, again, just like '22, we're excited to see again another solid year in '23 as far as volumes and growth.\nBrian Reynolds: Great. I'll leave it there. Enjoy the rest of your day. Thanks.\nShawn Lyon: Thanks, Brian.\nMike Hennigan: Thanks, Brian.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from John Mackay with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJohn Mackay: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the time. Maybe I'll pick up on the CapEx guide. You touched on some of the moving pieces. But I'm just curious if you could break it down a little more for us just in terms of -- and it can be loose, I suppose. But just how much of the guide is going towards these kind of named projects you've talked about, like the next Permian processing plants, versus going to the smaller bucket of one-offs versus I guess what we're calling kind of the emerging opportunities on the transmission side, any sort of breakdown there or kind of trend maybe even year-over-year would be interesting? Thank you.\nMike Hennigan: Hi, John. Good morning. I'll start and then I'll let John add some color. So in general, most of the capital program is targeted at what we'll call the smaller expansion to bottlenecking projects. I know people like to see flashy big projects, but we actually get the best returns as producers grow, whether it's in the G&P side or in the L&S side of the business. As production increases, we have a pretty big system that we can continue to bolt-on to add to expand a little bit here and there. It's where we get our higher return projects. Now, we're still going to add to the platform. As you mentioned, we got a couple of processing plants coming on, which will continue to increase our base, which then allows us to add some gathering to support that, et cetera. But the real story behind our growth, and if you step back, we are pretty large, as I just mentioned, about 6 billion of EBITDA. So our face plan is we're going to have mid single digit growth in our system, have good discipline so that we get high return projects, continue to add EBITDA, and at the end of the day look for those other opportunities like you mentioned in low carbon. There hasn't been a lot today. There's been a lot of rhetoric around it. And there's a lot of talk about different things. We're obviously involved in projects that are looking at CCUS. We're involved in a lot of stuff that's down the road, but not going to be hitting the 2023 earnings profile in a strong way yet. I am a believer over time, there are going to be more opportunities for us there. They'll just have to develop as technology advances, et cetera. So in the meantime, our concentration -- we use the term strict capital discipline. It's a nice way of saying we want to make sure we get good high returns that are really going to hit the bottom line every year consistently, because we've continued to grow this partnership year-after-year and obviously a big outcome of that is returning a lot of capital to our investors.\nShawn Lyon: Hi, John. It's Shawn. Just a couple of things to add to Mike's comments. So maybe one is an example of kind of an expansion in debottleneck. The other item we're looking at in the Marcellus is we've got some space on our existing processing plants. So we've got an opportunity to look at those gathering systems and invest the monies and fill up some space on plants we have sitting there and ready to go. And then also remember there's a number of those projects that are listed on the slide there, mainly around our Permian opportunities, where those projects given shipper support, et cetera, we've been financing those at the JV level. So there's a good amount of capital that's going to drive EBITDA growth that's not in our capital outlook just because of that's getting financed down at the joint venture. So just wanted to highlight that as well.\nJohn Mackay: That's helpful. I appreciate all the stuff. Maybe turning to the quarter, two things. John, I think you mentioned some higher expenses maybe on the L&S side in the quarter. And then you also mentioned the $23 million special comp award. Is there any kind of total number there that you might be able to give us for the quarter that maybe won't be there in a run rate if we're trying to look at 2023 going forward? Is it as simple as kind of adding back $23 million or maybe $25 million? And that's kind of a more representative run rate of the base business.\nJohn Quaid: Yes. John. Thanks for the question. So a couple of pieces there. The special compensation award by it's kind of term we're using there, that's a one-time item we decided to do here in the quarter and that was the expense for the entire items. So I don't know that we anticipate having another award in the first quarter, right? That was really our effort to look at our employees, kind of non-executive level employees' efforts in achieving our 2022 results and wanting to recognize that. So that's a little unique. The other piece gets around our frequent discussion around kind of project maintenance expenses. Certainly, we tend to be a little more back half loaded, sometimes that can move with MPC's turnaround schedules, et cetera. So that number year-over-year I think we see being roughly the same amount of expenses as we continue to focus on cost management. But it will move quarter-to-quarter, John, but I don't know that today we're going to provide that number. Just a flag for you, as in the past, first quarter does tend to be our lowest spend quarter around that activity just due to weather and other items. So hopefully, that's helpful.\nJohn Mackay: Great. I appreciate it. Thank you very much.\nJohn Quaid: You're welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nKeith Stanley: Hi. Good morning. I wanted to start just -- I know this is a very recent data point, but just any updated commentary you're hearing from producers unplanned [ph] Marcellus and Utica activity, given the very rapid decline in gas prices that we've seen and how that might be impacting your expectations as well?\nMike Hennigan: Keith, that's a good question. I'm going to let Greg take that one.\nGreg Floerke: Thanks, Keith. Really the 2022 prices, whether it be crude NGL or gas, were very supportive of increased drilling activity by producers and this is not just in the Permian Delaware, or even the Marcellus. It was across all basins. We've seen increased activity, so increased drilling in 2022 and some completions, and then completions into '23 mean higher volume outlook for '23. Certainly, there has been price volatility. We've seen prices over $10 per MMBtu in the summer, which, at a high and now we're kind of back to more of a normal level. But in the Permian, in places like the Bakken, even the condensate when on the Utica is really crude price driven. And the drilling is related to crude price, and we see the benefits of associated gas and NGLs that come off of that. So short-term price swings really, we don't expect right now will impact the volume as much because a lot of that activity was set up by drilling activity in 2022.\nKeith Stanley: Got it. Thanks. Second question, I just wanted to follow up on the distribution. So you had the 10% hike last quarter. Growth in the distribution I think was pretty small in the couple of years before that. How should investors think about distribution growth over the next several years for the company? Does it tie in your head to overall growth and cash flows of the business? Do you see some excess cushion and excess cash flow, so the distribution could grow potentially faster? Just how are you thinking about that over the next few years?\nJohn Quaid: Hi, Keith. It's John. I'll start and then I'm sure Michael will have some comments as well. Again, as you said, last quarter really driven off our confidence in the strength of our cash flows, we moved to the 10% distribution increase. But as I noted, still a really strong coverage ratio of 1.6x. And I think you've highlighted part of it, right? We've continued to grow the partnership. We've been focused on cost. And while we may have slowed on the distribution for a few years, we essentially built up our coverage. So that was partly -- you heard Mike talk about our target of kind of mid single digit growth. Ultimately, you would see the distribution getting towards that sort of run rate. But we probably have built up some capacity here to think about how we might look at the distribution later this year.\nMike Hennigan: I'm just going to add a little bit of -- repeat a little bit of what I said earlier, got to keep in mind the law of large numbers. We're roughly 6 billion of EBITDA. So if we grow that at mid single digit, that's $300 million more EBITDA, which would translate to more financial flexibility for us, whether we increase the base distribution, do buybacks or whatever. But the nice thing about our system is we're large enough that even mid single digit growth will add a significant amount of additional cash flow to a distribution that today is about $3 billion roughly. So if you think about the math of where does that even translate? It provides flexibility for us to make more moves. And to your point, everybody in this space kind of paused a little bit during COVID. And I think one of the things that I hoped the market recognized, we still grew earnings during that year, even though it was a tough year on the refining side of the house with reduced demand, et cetera. So part of it is to try and recognize where we are financially, part of it is to try and recognize where our growth potential is. And then, like I said, if you go to the simple math, you can start to kind of look at where our financial flexibility will be. And I keep saying it's a good problem to have. It's a good place to be. We'll try and reward investors in the best way that we can to get an overall total return in the manner that we think is most efficient at the time. We've traditionally said it's an all of the above approach. As John mentioned, we leaned in a little harder on distribution last year for the point that you made, as well as what John just made. We got strong coverage. We got continued line of sight for growth. So I think we're in a really good position to continue to grow the partnership.\nKeith Stanley: Thank you.\nMike Hennigan: You're welcome.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Theresa Chen with Barclays. Your line is open.\nTheresa Chen: Good morning. Mike, I'd love to get some of your thoughts on the potential low carbon expansion opportunities and generally growth beyond what you have in the slate right now? As far as your ability and willingness to invest in the low carbon renewable space, are there hurdles at this point a matter of technology, financial hurdles? And given that MPC has made significant progress in its renewable investments, is there volition down the line to do something together with a C-Corp?\nMike Hennigan: Yes. Theresa, so at a high level, most of our low carbon activity in the short term is geared at the MPC side of the house. So we'll talk a little bit more about that at the 11 o'clock call. A little less right now on the MPLX side. But as I mentioned earlier, we are a believer that technology will continue to advance. One example that everybody's aware of is gathering carbon and sequestering it. So that's a great opportunity on the MPLX side of the house. We're active in several projects, but they're not 2023 projects. They're not going to happen to -- are not going to impact earnings profile this year. So overall, as you're very aware on the MPC side of the house, we have a couple of renewable diesel plants. There's going to be more growth in that area. So to get a little more color on the MPC call as far as what's happening on low carbon, so I'll just ask you to listen in on that. We'll give a little more detail. And then on the MPLX side, we think things are coming. They're just not ready for primetime at this time.\nJohn Quaid: And then, Theresa, it\u2019s John. I might just jump in real quick. Just as a reminder, if you think about like the Martinez renewable fuels facility project that MPC is doing, those logistics assets around that were and remain MPLX assets. And we don't have a lot of investments to move around the different liquids. So to some degree, it maybe extends the life of the assets we have with minimal investments around those facilities.\nMike Hennigan: Theresa, it\u2019s Mike again. The one last thing to your question on what's limiting technology or whatever, in a lot of the areas, the returns that we can get on those opportunities are not quite meeting what we would like to implement. But I think over time, the technologies will evolve and that will be an area for us to invest. As we've been talking throughout the call, we have a lot of financial flexibility on this side of the house. John mentioned, we're 3.5x on the balance sheet, we're generating $1 billion a year of excess cash beyond growing distribution. So we have the financial flexibility. We are ready and able, but we are going to be strict on returns. So part of what has held us back from some of what I'll call the splashier discussions that the returns just are not at a level that we think is investable at this point. But we think they're going to get there. It's just a matter of time.\nTheresa Chen: Thank you for the thorough response and I agree, John, that we definitely look forward to that 2026 re-contracting on the Martinez logistics assets. Maybe turning to the Northeast for a second. Following the startup and ramp up of your deethanizer, would love to get your take on how that facility is doing to support feedstock delivery to the Monaca cracker as well as your general outlook for economics in the Northeast, given the recent price volatility?\nGreg Floerke: Theresa, this is Greg. I'll answer that question on several -- there's several layers to it. We have within MPLX over 300,000 barrels a day of deethanization capacity in our fleet. We're unique and then our fleet is -- our deethanizer actually fleet is spread across all of our processing plants. So we have the ability to reject or recover ethane almost by customer, but definitely by plant. All those plants are connected by purity ethane line and we deliver to Mariner East, Marina West, Utopia, ATEX as well as the Shell Falcon line for pipeline for Monaca. The Smithburg deethanizer is the latest addition to our fleet. It adds a little over 40,000 barrels a day of purity ethane production capability to our fleet, which I mentioned is over 300,000 barrels a day. So that plant is in operation. It's operating well. It's ramping up along with the rest of our fleet to not only supply Monaca but also all of the Gulf Coast, East Coast and even Canadian takeaway points. In terms of the economics, the fractionation spread between ethane and natural gas, whether it's rejected or not, recently we've seen natural gas prices drop at a little higher rate than the ethane price drop. So the economics for recovery have improved. But it's really up to the producer in terms of whether we recover more or reject. We have the ability to do both. We have the capacity to do it. And frankly, in the Northeast, most of the recovery is tied to commitments that are already made by the producers for those takeaway pipelines and to the Shell plant. So we continue to ramp up towards as we increase our utilization there.\nTheresa Chen: Thank you very much.\nMike Hennigan: You're welcome, Theresa.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi. Good morning.\nMike Hennigan: Hi, Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: Just want to shift over to the Permian a little bit if I could, as it relates to natural gas egress. And just wondering any high level thoughts you might be willing to share as far as takeaway tightness. We've seen Waha touch negative prices recently, not too long ago, and was just curious I guess that the Whistler expansion with Matterhorn, is there any ability to kind of start partial service ahead of the dates that you've said, or just trying to get a feel for how you see Permian egress tightness unfolding and what MPLX could do there?\nShawn Lyon: Hi, Jeremy. This is Shawn. I'll touch on gas takeaway out of the Permian there. As you know, we've got the Whistler Pipeline. And as we said, last quarter, we're really pleased by the ramp up of the volumes on there, again, showing that -- again, that gas takeaway as needed there. That volume and those commitments have continued to be strong, and we anticipate those will continue on into '23 here. We've got the half B [ph] expansion coming online in the third quarter of '23 for Whistler, and again we're seeing really meeting in expectations for that committed volume coming out of the Permian. And then on top of that, you got Matterhorn that we're a small participant in that really matches our producer and customers' needs coming out of there. So again, I think, as Greg said earlier, you're going to see volatility up and down on natural gas. But again, there's strong volume demand for the gas takeaway out of the Permian.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Thanks for that. And I was just curious I guess as it relates to weather, during the quarter there was some freezing conditions across country. Wondering if that impacted your operations at all, if there's any weather headwinds that you would be willing to quantify for us if they did materialize?\nJohn Quaid: Hi, Jeremy. It's John. Thanks for the question. I'll start and Greg and Shawn can chime in if they want to as well on the ops. So across our platform, in the fourth quarter, we probably had mostly lost profit opportunity as some of our producers mainly on the G&P side, obviously, when it gets that cold, they run into some issues. So that reduced our operations there for 10 to 14 days, give or take, different across the basins in the fourth quarter. That probably was a lost opportunity of somewhere around $10 million in the quarter. And as we look to this quarter, Q1 '23, partly impacts on MPC's operations, partly remember I'm talking adjusted EBITDA. And when we think about our joint ventures on the G&P side, that really is distributions. So there's part of the effect in Q4 that shows up as lower distributions in Q1 as well. So probably 10 million of lost opportunity in both Q4 and Q1.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you.\nMike Hennigan: You're welcome.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nNeal Dingmann: Good morning, all. My question is on your Marcellus G&P, specifically number of E&Ps, I haven't heard too much from them as far as plan for any change of activity but yet I did hear from a flag provider last week that suggested that you could see some slowdown in fracking activity for the next few months or a bit longer in Appalachia. So I would just love to hear, I did know you're -- looking at Slide 7, it was down a little bit, not a whole lot there versus the year-over-year. So I'm just curious more on your overall thoughts in the area for the remainder of the year.\nGreg Floerke: Neal, this is Greg. At this point, we still -- we're in close communication with producer customers and we track over time well pads that are being drilled and completion rates. And depending on rig availability, depending on weather, depending on pricing, those things, obviously, those forecasts can and do change. But we still -- as I mentioned before, a lot of the activity in the volume drive that we forecast into '23 is based on activity, drilling activity in '22 and then some completion activity that already has been underway. So there could be pads delayed, not aware of those, but that's always a possibility. But at this point, we still feel bullish about volume this year.\nNeal Dingmann: Yes, I agree. Go ahead, Mike. Sorry.\nMike Hennigan: Yes. Let me just add, even outside of the Marcellus, I think everybody realizes now there's a structural change in gas from a lot of perspective. So in some of the areas that had not seen a lot of activity, as Greg mentioned earlier, in '22, you're starting to see rigs in other basins outside of the Marcellus that haven't had a lot of activity. So I think overall, people are recognizing a structural change in gas now. Very short term, it's been a little warm relative to expectation coming into the winter. But if you pull back up to a higher level of structural change, more activity, rigs being used in basins that there has not been activity for a while, I think shows that there's a change in gas potential going forward.\nNeal Dingmann: Yes. Well said, Mike. And then one just clarification, I want to make sure on the gathering, you continue to have nice increase on the gather on the other side, non-Marcellus. Shawn, can you remind me of just capacity? I still think you have a bit there on the Permian at all. I'm just wondering again what is -- I think you talked about this earlier today. I just want to make clear on what is still the capacity available on the gathering side there.\nShawn Lyon: In terms of the Permian Delaware, the capacity, we basically build out and connect new wells and add compression as we need it to fill the processing capacity that we have.\nJohn Quaid: Neal, it's John. Specifically in the Permian, if that's what you're asking about, right, we've got our five plants, we're building our sixth. They're each about 200 million a day. So that's the size and scale of that operation, which, in our numbers, it's part of the Southwest region that we show. We're at a B heading to 1.2B. And we match the gathering which I believe you specifically asked for to that capacity.\nNeal Dingmann: That's right. Okay. Thanks, guys. Great details.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Spiro Dounis with Citi. Your line is open.\nSpiro Dounis: Thanks, operator. Good morning, team. Wanted to go back and follow up on one of Brian's questions just as we think about refinery run rates for '23. And if we zoom out a bit and just look at the industry as a whole, I believe it's supposed to be kind of a heavier refinery maintenance year this year. So curious how you're all thinking about the impact to your system overall, whether or not that ship flows on the export side or internally, just curious how you're thinking about the net benefit or negative there?\nMike Hennigan: Spiro, it's Mike. So I'll start off. MPC had a backend weighted turnaround year in '22. We're going to talk about a frontend weighted '23. But even with our activity there, I think one of the things that has been part of our success on the MPC side is to figure out a way to keep our utilizations high, despite taking our needed turnaround activities for safe, reliable operation. So it is a heavier year for us, especially if you think of the back half of the one year and the front half of the other on the MPC side. At the same time, even with that activity, we ran 96% utilization last year. We still expect a pretty strong year. It'll start off with more activity in the first quarter. But as Shawn mentioned earlier, we're still expecting -- even though we had a record year this year on the L&S side, we're still expecting a pretty strong year in '23.\nSpiro Dounis: Got it. That's helpful. Thanks, Mike. Second question, just thinking about CapEx going forward, you guys have been utilizing joint ventures pretty effectively over the last few years. And I guess I'm curious -- and you sort of look back and assess that strategy. I think you'd be satisfied with it. But I'm just curious how you're thinking about it going forward. Is that a strategy using joint ventures something you plan on doing from here on any sort of larger multiyear projects? And ultimately, do you see these joint ventures as a pathway to own more of these current assets or even maybe some of these joint venture partners over time?\nJohn Quaid: Hi, Spiro. It's John. I'll start and then let Mike chime in. I think certainly, to your first point, we definitely have been very pleased with our investments in the Permian. I don't know that we started those from a financial aspect as well as other considerations, right, when you're entering a joint venture relationship, sharing of risks, commercial opportunity, et cetera. So I think it depends on the situation, because as you know, we certainly have a strong balance sheet and generating a good bit of cash. So those have worked really well for us. I think where there's opportunities that have both commercial, operational, and perhaps financial reasons, we can look at JV opportunities. But given the strength of the balance sheet, I don't know that financially we would need to leverage them in that regard.\nMike Hennigan: Yes. Spiro, I was just going to add to what John said. It's pretty specific to the opportunity and to the desire of all the partners. We try and be a good partner, as John said, in a couple of these instances, we had the financial capability to finance it ourselves. When other members want to do it at the project level and we can live with that, we're okay with it. We're not opposed to it. And if it makes for a better partnership, that's fine for us. But I would tell you, it's specific to the project itself and who the partners are. But John mentioned earlier, when we quote our capital, that's the capital that we're typically doing on our side of the house, and then there is additional capital that comes from those projects that gets financed at that project level. So it's hard to answer your question other than it's specific to John's point. We have been happy with them. We've had good partners. We're usually aligned. The goal, obviously, in any JV is already aligned in the intent of the project, et cetera. And we've been fortunate to have good alignment with our partners. And where we finance it at the project level, we've been okay with that as well.\nSpiro Dounis: Helpful as always. Thanks for the time, guys.\nMike Hennigan: You're welcome.\nOperator: And our last question will come from Neel Mitra with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nNeel Mitra: Hi. Good morning. I wanted to touch on the MPC Galveston Bay upgrades. I was wondering if that would have any impact on the L&S segment once that's completed?\nMike Hennigan: I'll start and I'll let Shawn jump in. We're probably going to talk about that in a lot more specifics on the MPC call. But just in general, that project is pretty strategic for us. It's a lot more crude processing and [indiscernible] upgrading. So as you know, obviously down on Galveston Bay, we have flexibility to bring barrels in via pipeline and/or water. So depending on the specifics of where the best crude opportunity is, it could hit our system or it could come waterborne on the crude side. But obviously, the outcome of the products, that tends to move on some other pipes as well. So it's much more of an MPC impacting project than it is an MPLX project.\nNeel Mitra: Okay, got it. Thank you. And then my second question on the G&P side, can you sum up how you look at the Permian portfolio? You have some good gathering and processing, natural gas takeaway with Whistler and a little bit with Matterhorn. How far downstream do you want to go? Are you thinking about NGL pipelines? And then do you feel like you need more scale on the G&P side to feed some of the downstream assets? I'm just wondering how you envision this portfolio looking like in the intermediate to longer term.\nMike Hennigan: Yes. At a high level, yes, we would like to continue to expand our footprint there. But I'll let Greg and Shawn touch or Dave.\nDave Heppner: Neel, this is Dave. I think as you look at it, one of our strategies is to leverage the existing infrastructure and assets we have in place from gathering to processing in the long haul pipelines down to the export opportunities or the other infrastructure out there. So I think as you see, whether it be organic or inorganic growth opportunities, it's really going to keep that in the back of our mind. Again, all anchored by strict capital discipline and ensuring that we get the acceptable returns.\nNeel Mitra: And if I could just ask a follow up to that. Are you seeing some synergies between your gathering and processing and possibly being able to win contracts by having the Whistler capacity there, given the lack of natural gas takeaway and possibly bundling contracts between pipelines and G&P?\nGreg Floerke: Yes, they're definitely synergies. On the G&P side, for example, we're building and operating some of the crude gathering assets as we tie in new wells and put new [indiscernible] units in. There's associated gas that comes with that. So we connect the gas wells and bring the gas, and G&P operates that gathering system as well, the gas NOL, and then we operate the processing plants. But we're reliant then on handing off the residue gas to Whistler to bangle the NGLs. And then, of course, the crude coming from the pads is going to L&S operated downstream pipelines as well. So we operate seamlessly there.\nJohn Quaid: Neel, it's John. Definitely right to the point of your question, those producer customers want that product to the coast, and that's the solution we've built and we'll continue to look to think about how we can move further downstream across that value chain.\nMike Hennigan: It's Mike. I'll just add. We try or make every effort to be a full service provider. We will gather crude, we will gather gas. We will process the gas. We will transport the crude. Our intent is to be a partner to the producers or whoever needs to make infrastructure work for them or logistics work for them. So we try to be a full service provider and get into conversations, like you said on contracts or discussions as to what are their needs and how can we help them? And hopefully they turn into win-win situations.\nNeel Mitra: Great. I appreciate all the color. Thank you very much.\nMike Hennigan: You're welcome.\nKristina Kazarian: All right. With that, thank you guys for joining us today and thank you for your interest in MPLX. Should you have additional questions or if you'd like clarification on any of the topics we discussed this morning, members of our IR team will be available to take your call, so please just reach out. Thank you, everybody.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Slide 6 outlines the fourth quarter operational and financial performance highlights for our Logistics and Storage segment. L&S segment adjusted EBITDA increased $45 million when compared to fourth quarter 2021. The increased results were primarily driven by higher pipeline tariffs and contributions from pipeline equity affiliates, partially offset by higher maintenance project-related expenses in the quarter. Pipeline volumes were flat year-over-year, primarily due to the impacts associated with Marathon's refinery turnarounds in both quarters. Terminal volumes were up 4%.  Moving to our Gathering and Processing segment on Slide 7, G&P segment adjusted EBITDA decreased $36 million compared to fourth quarter 2021, as the benefits of higher volumes were more than offset by lower natural gas liquids prices, which averaged $0.78 per gallon for the quarter as compared to $1.05 in the fourth quarter of 2021. In total for the quarter, gathered volumes were up 14% year-over-year due to increased production in the Utica and our Southwest region, which includes our Permian operations.  Processing volumes were up 1% year-over-year, primarily from higher volumes in the Southwest, driven by increased customer demand and our investments in processing capacity in the Permian. In the Marcellus, while Gathering and Processing volumes were slightly lower year-over-year, we did see sequential increases for gathering, processing and fractionation volumes in the basin. These activity levels were in line with our expectations for increased producer activity in the back half of the year.  Moving to our fourth quarter financial highlights on Slide 8, total adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion was roughly flat versus the same period in the prior year, while distributable cash flow of $1.3 billion increased 5%. Results in the quarter were impacted by $23 million special compensation award provided to our employees in recognition of their efforts. We do not anticipate that this expense will structurally impact future costs.  In the fourth quarter, we returned $975 million to unitholders through approximately $800 million in distributions and $175 million of repurchases of common units held by the public. MPLX ended the year with nearly $850 million remaining available under its unit repurchase authorizations. Last week, MPLX declared a fourth quarter distribution of 0.775 per unit, resulting in a distribution coverage ratio of 1.6x for the fourth quarter.  MPLX ended the year with total debt of around $20 billion and a debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.5x, comfortably below our target of approximately 4x. While our absolute level of debt has remained relatively constant, our leverage has decreased due to the growth in our business. And at these leverage levels, we do not see the need to reduce our absolute level of debt.  Earlier today, we announced our intent to redeem the par value, the $600 million of outstanding Series B preferred units in mid February. Subject to market conditions, we expect to refinance these preferred units into long-term debt. In closing, we expect our solid operating performance and growth of our cash flows will enable us to continue to invest in and grow the business while also supporting the return of capital to MPLX unitholders.  Now let me turn the call back over to Kristina. Great. Hi, Brian. Good morning. Thanks for the question. We'll try and pick that apart in a couple of pieces. First, as I said in my comments and just to reiterate, right, we provided notice to the Series B holders that we're going to redeem those in February. As you note, we also have 1 billion of senior notes maturing in July. And given our leverage and where we are and as we've done in the past, we'll likely look to refinance both of those into long-term debt, subject to market conditions. So that's the first piece on the Bs and the senior notes. And then thinking about return to capital, as you saw us last year, we've gotten lots of feedback from investors; some prefer distribution, some prefer unit repurchases. We've tried to think about our structure around that framework. As you -- more recently, it seems like it's been tilted towards the distribution, as Mike commented, and as you know, we increased the distribution 10% here effective with the third quarter distribution, still really strong coverage at 1.6x, a strong balance sheet at 3.5x leverage. So I think that will be an area we'll continue to focus on in 2023. And then we'll also I think continue to be opportunistic, perhaps more opportunistic around unit repurchases, right? If you look back to when we began the program, we've done a little over 1 billion and about 29 a unit. In the fourth quarter, we did about 176 million. I think 31.75, somewhere in that ballpark. So I think it'll continue to be a part of our framework, but perhaps a little more opportunistic. And, Mike, do you want to add something as well? Yes. John. Thanks for the question. So a couple of pieces there. The special compensation award by it's kind of term we're using there, that's a one-time item we decided to do here in the quarter and that was the expense for the entire items. So I don't know that we anticipate having another award in the first quarter, right? That was really our effort to look at our employees, kind of non-executive level employees' efforts in achieving our 2022 results and wanting to recognize that. So that's a little unique. The other piece gets around our frequent discussion around kind of project maintenance expenses. Certainly, we tend to be a little more back half loaded, sometimes that can move with MPC's turnaround schedules, et cetera. So that number year-over-year I think we see being roughly the same amount of expenses as we continue to focus on cost management. But it will move quarter-to-quarter, John, but I don't know that today we're going to provide that number. Just a flag for you, as in the past, first quarter does tend to be our lowest spend quarter around that activity just due to weather and other items. So hopefully, that's helpful. You're welcome. Hi, Keith. It's John. I'll start and then I'm sure Michael will have some comments as well. Again, as you said, last quarter really driven off our confidence in the strength of our cash flows, we moved to the 10% distribution increase. But as I noted, still a really strong coverage ratio of 1.6x. And I think you've highlighted part of it, right? We've continued to grow the partnership. We've been focused on cost. And while we may have slowed on the distribution for a few years, we essentially built up our coverage. So that was partly -- you heard Mike talk about our target of kind of mid single digit growth. Ultimately, you would see the distribution getting towards that sort of run rate. But we probably have built up some capacity here to think about how we might look at the distribution later this year. And then, Theresa, it's John. I might just jump in real quick. Just as a reminder, if you think about like the Martinez renewable fuels facility project that MPC is doing, those logistics assets around that were and remain MPLX assets. And we don't have a lot of investments to move around the different liquids. So to some degree, it maybe extends the life of the assets we have with minimal investments around those facilities. Hi, Jeremy. It's John. Thanks for the question. I'll start and Greg and Shawn can chime in if they want to as well on the ops. So across our platform, in the fourth quarter, we probably had mostly lost profit opportunity as some of our producers mainly on the G&P side, obviously, when it gets that cold, they run into some issues. So that reduced our operations there for 10 to 14 days, give or take, different across the basins in the fourth quarter. That probably was a lost opportunity of somewhere around $10 million in the quarter. And as we look to this quarter, Q1 '23, partly impacts on MPC's operations, partly remember I'm talking adjusted EBITDA. And when we think about our joint ventures on the G&P side, that really is distributions. So there's part of the effect in Q4 that shows up as lower distributions in Q1 as well. So probably 10 million of lost opportunity in both Q4 and Q1. Neal, it's John. Specifically in the Permian, if that's what you're asking about, right, we've got our five plants, we're building our sixth. They're each about 200 million a day. So that's the size and scale of that operation, which, in our numbers, it's part of the Southwest region that we show. We're at a B heading to 1.2B. And we match the gathering which I believe you specifically asked for to that capacity. Hi, Spiro. It's John. I'll start and then let Mike chime in.

            "content": "Thanks, Keith. Really the 2022 prices, whether it be crude NGL or gas, were very supportive of increased drilling activity by producers and this is not just in the Permian Delaware, or even the Marcellus. It was across all basins. We've seen increased activity, so increased drilling in 2022 and some completions, and then completions into '23 mean higher volume outlook for '23. Certainly, there has been price volatility. We've seen prices over $10 per MMBtu in the summer, which, at a high and now we're kind of back to more of a normal level. But in the Permian, in places like the Bakken, even the condensate when on the Utica is really crude price driven. And the drilling is related to crude price, and we see the benefits of associated gas and NGLs that come off of that. So short-term price swings really, we don't expect right now will impact the volume as much because a lot of that activity was set up by drilling activity in 2022. Theresa, this is Greg. I'll answer that question on several -- there's several layers to it. We have within MPLX over 300,000 barrels a day of deethanization capacity in our fleet. We're unique and then our fleet is -- our deethanizer actually fleet is spread across all of our processing plants. So we have the ability to reject or recover ethane almost by customer, but definitely by plant. All those plants are connected by purity ethane line and we deliver to Mariner East, Marina West, Utopia, ATEX as well as the Shell Falcon line for pipeline for Monaca. The Smithburg deethanizer is the latest addition to our fleet. It adds a little over 40,000 barrels a day of purity ethane production capability to our fleet, which I mentioned is over 300,000 barrels a day. So that plant is in operation. It's operating well. It's ramping up along with the rest of our fleet to not only supply Monaca but also all of the Gulf Coast, East Coast and even Canadian takeaway points. In terms of the economics, the fractionation spread between ethane and natural gas, whether it's rejected or not, recently we've seen natural gas prices drop at a little higher rate than the ethane price drop. So the economics for recovery have improved. But it's really up to the producer in terms of whether we recover more or reject. We have the ability to do both. We have the capacity to do it. And frankly, in the Northeast, most of the recovery is tied to commitments that are already made by the producers for those takeaway pipelines and to the Shell plant. So we continue to ramp up towards as we increase our utilization there. Neal, this is Greg. At this point, we still -- we're in close communication with producer customers and we track over time well pads that are being drilled and completion rates. And depending on rig availability, depending on weather, depending on pricing, those things, obviously, those forecasts can and do change. But we still -- as I mentioned before, a lot of the activity in the volume drive that we forecast into '23 is based on activity, drilling activity in '22 and then some completion activity that already has been underway. So there could be pads delayed, not aware of those, but that's always a possibility. But at this point, we still feel bullish about volume this year. Yes, they're definitely synergies.

But we're reliant then on handing off the residue gas to Whistler to bangle the NGLs. And then, of course, the crude coming from the pads is going to L&S operated downstream pipelines as well. So we operate seamlessly there."

            "content": "Thanks, Kristina. Good morning. Thank you for joining our call. First off, I want to recognize a new Director on the MPLX Board. In November, Christy Breves, who recently served as CFO for U.S. Steel, was appointed as a new Independent Director. 2022 was a strong year as we successfully executed on all of our strategic priorities. Full year adjusted EBITDA was $5.8 billion and DCF was $5 billion.  Strong operational performance and customer demand drove record annual pipeline throughputs and increasing Gathering and Processing and fractionation throughputs with each quarter of the year. We also realized EBITDA growth from recent capital investments and remain focused on cost management. Overall, our efforts resulted in a 4% year-over-year adjusted EBITDA and DCF growth.  In line with our commitment to return capital, for the full year, MPLX returned over $3.5 billion of capital back to unitholders through our distribution and unit repurchases. We also made progress towards our goal of leading in sustainable energy through our methane reduction program and with the receipt of EPA's ENERGY STAR award for energy efficiency improvements at several terminals.  Today, we announced our capital expenditure outlook for 2023 of $950 million. Our plan includes approximately $800 million of growth capital and $150 million of maintenance capital. Our growth capital plan is anchored in the Marcellus, Permian and Bakken basins. In addition to new gas processing plants in the Marcellus and Permian, the remainder of our capital plan is mostly focused on other investments targeted at expansion or debottlenecking of existing assets to meet customer demand.  While our capital outlook is primarily focused on our current L&S and G&P footprint, we will continue to evaluate low carbon opportunities where we can leverage technologies that are complementary with our asset footprint and expertise.  Moving to our capital allocation framework. First, maintenance capital. We remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees, and support the communities in which we operate. Second, we remain focused on delivering a secure distribution. Third, after these commitments are met, we will invest to grow while maintaining strict capital discipline. And fourth, we also intend to return excess capital to unitholders. As I've said in the past, we believe this is both a return on and a return of capital business.  Last November, based on the strength and growth of our cash flows, we increased our distribution by 10% to an annual rate of $3.10 per unit, while maintaining a strong distribution coverage ratio of 1.6x. In 2023, we would expect to be similarly focused on our distribution as our primary tool to return capital to unitholders. We are optimistic about our opportunities in 2023 and remain focused on executing the strategic priorities of strict capital discipline, fostering a low cost culture, optimizing our asset portfolio, which are foundational to the growth of MPLX's cash flows.  Now let me turn the call over to John to discuss our operational and financial results for the quarter. Yes, Brian, let me just add a little bit to it. Just on a simple basis, we're generating about 6 billion of EBITDA, about 5 billion of distributable cash flow after that. We've been spending roughly around 1 billion. So we have about $4 billion of free cash flow and distributing 3 billion through our base distribution, which has been leaving about $1 billion of cash after all that. So I think the key is we have a lot of flexibility. And as John said, we'll try and be opportunistic on the buyback side. We'll try and continue to show the market that we continue to grow this partnership. So you'll see us continue to increase distributions over time. So we'll talk about that at some point. But I think we're in a real good position from a financial standpoint, strong balance sheet, excess cash flow, looking for opportunities to deploy but staying strict on returns. And overall, hopefully, that's where the market wants us to be. It's a good question, Brian. I'm going to let Shawn give you a little more color. But I will say, at the MPC side of the house, we had a really strong year. Safe, reliable operations is key to our business on that side. We ran 96% utilization. If you've followed some of the activity during the year, we had deferred some turnaround activity to the back half of the year. But overall, it was a very strong utilization. So I'll let Shawn comment a little bit on the L&S side. Thanks, Brian. Hi, John. Good morning. I'll start and then I'll let John add some color. So in general, most of the capital program is targeted at what we'll call the smaller expansion to bottlenecking projects. I know people like to see flashy big projects, but we actually get the best returns as producers grow, whether it's in the G&P side or in the L&S side of the business. As production increases, we have a pretty big system that we can continue to bolt-on to add to expand a little bit here and there. It's where we get our higher return projects. Now, we're still going to add to the platform. As you mentioned, we got a couple of processing plants coming on, which will continue to increase our base, which then allows us to add some gathering to support that, et cetera. But the real story behind our growth, and if you step back, we are pretty large, as I just mentioned, about 6 billion of EBITDA. So our face plan is we're going to have mid single digit growth in our system, have good discipline so that we get high return projects, continue to add EBITDA, and at the end of the day look for those other opportunities like you mentioned in low carbon. There hasn't been a lot today. There's been a lot of rhetoric around it. And there's a lot of talk about different things. We're obviously involved in projects that are looking at CCUS. We're involved in a lot of stuff that's down the road, but not going to be hitting the 2023 earnings profile in a strong way yet. I am a believer over time, there are going to be more opportunities for us there. They'll just have to develop as technology advances, et cetera. So in the meantime, our concentration -- we use the term strict capital discipline. It's a nice way of saying we want to make sure we get good high returns that are really going to hit the bottom line every year consistently, because we've continued to grow this partnership year-after-year and obviously a big outcome of that is returning a lot of capital to our investors. Keith, that's a good question. I'm going to let Greg take that one. I'm just going to add a little bit of -- repeat a little bit of what I said earlier, got to keep in mind the law of large numbers. We're roughly 6 billion of EBITDA. So if we grow that at mid single digit, that's $300 million more EBITDA, which would translate to more financial flexibility for us, whether we increase the base distribution, do buybacks or whatever. But the nice thing about our system is we're large enough that even mid single digit growth will add a significant amount of additional cash flow to a distribution that today is about $3 billion roughly. So if you think about the math of where does that even translate? It provides flexibility for us to make more moves. And to your point, everybody in this space kind of paused a little bit during COVID. And I think one of the things that I hoped the market recognized, we still grew earnings during that year, even though it was a tough year on the refining side of the house with reduced demand, et cetera. So part of it is to try and recognize where we are financially, part of it is to try and recognize where our growth potential is. And then, like I said, if you go to the simple math, you can start to kind of look at where our financial flexibility will be. And I keep saying it's a good problem to have. It's a good place to be. We'll try and reward investors in the best way that we can to get an overall total return in the manner that we think is most efficient at the time. We've traditionally said it's an all of the above approach. As John mentioned, we leaned in a little harder on distribution last year for the point that you made, as well as what John just made. We got strong coverage. We got continued line of sight for growth. So I think we're in a really good position to continue to grow the partnership. You're welcome. Yes. Theresa, so at a high level, most of our low carbon activity in the short term is geared at the MPC side of the house. So we'll talk a little bit more about that at the 11 o'clock call. A little less right now on the MPLX side. But as I mentioned earlier, we are a believer that technology will continue to advance. One example that everybody's aware of is gathering carbon and sequestering it. So that's a great opportunity on the MPLX side of the house. We're active in several projects, but they're not 2023 projects. They're not going to happen to -- are not going to impact earnings profile this year. So overall, as you're very aware on the MPC side of the house, we have a couple of renewable diesel plants. There's going to be more growth in that area. So to get a little more color on the MPC call as far as what's happening on low carbon, so I'll just ask you to listen in on that. We'll give a little more detail. And then on the MPLX side, we think things are coming. They're just not ready for primetime at this time. Theresa, it's Mike again. The one last thing to your question on what's limiting technology or whatever, in a lot of the areas, the returns that we can get on those opportunities are not quite meeting what we would like to implement. But I think over time, the technologies will evolve and that will be an area for us to invest. As we've been talking throughout the call, we have a lot of financial flexibility on this side of the house. John mentioned, we're 3.5x on the balance sheet, we're generating $1 billion a year of excess cash beyond growing distribution. So we have the financial flexibility. We are ready and able, but we are going to be strict on returns. So part of what has held us back from some of what I'll call the splashier discussions that the returns just are not at a level that we think is investable at this point. But we think they're going to get there. It's just a matter of time. You're welcome, Theresa. Hi, Jeremy. You're welcome. Yes. Let me just add, even outside of the Marcellus, I think everybody realizes now there's a structural change in gas from a lot of perspective. So in some of the areas that had not seen a lot of activity, as Greg mentioned earlier, in '22, you're starting to see rigs in other basins outside of the Marcellus that haven't had a lot of activity. So I think overall, people are recognizing a structural change in gas now. Very short term, it's been a little warm relative to expectation coming into the winter. But if you pull back up to a higher level of structural change, more activity, rigs being used in basins that there has not been activity for a while, I think shows that there's a change in gas potential going forward. Spiro, it's Mike. So I'll start off. MPC had a backend weighted turnaround year in '22. We're going to talk about a frontend weighted '23. But even with our activity there, I think one of the things that has been part of our success on the MPC side is to figure out a way to keep our utilizations high, despite taking our needed turnaround activities for safe, reliable operation. So it is a heavier year for us, especially if you think of the back half of the one year and the front half of the other on the MPC side. At the same time, even with that activity, we ran 96% utilization last year. We still expect a pretty strong year. It'll start off with more activity in the first quarter. But as Shawn mentioned earlier, we're still expecting -- even though we had a record year this year on the L&S side, we're still expecting a pretty strong year in '23. Yes. Spiro, I was just going to add to what John said. It's pretty specific to the opportunity and to the desire of all the partners. We try and be a good partner, as John said, in a couple of these instances, we had the financial capability to finance it ourselves. When other members want to do it at the project level and we can live with that, we're okay with it. We're not opposed to it. And if it makes for a better partnership, that's fine for us. But I would tell you, it's specific to the project itself and who the partners are. But John mentioned earlier, when we quote our capital, that's the capital that we're typically doing on our side of the house, and then there is additional capital that comes from those projects that gets financed at that project level. So it's hard to answer your question other than it's specific to John's point. We have been happy with them. We've had good partners. We're usually aligned. The goal, obviously, in any JV is already aligned in the intent of the project, et cetera. And we've been fortunate to have good alignment with our partners. And where we finance it at the project level, we've been okay with that as well. You're welcome. I'll start and I'll let Shawn jump in. We're probably going to talk about that in a lot more specifics on the MPC call. But just in general, that project is pretty strategic for us. It's a lot more crude processing and [indiscernible] upgrading. So as you know, obviously down on Galveston Bay, we have flexibility to bring barrels in via pipeline and/or water. So depending on the specifics of where the best crude opportunity is, it could hit our system or it could come waterborne on the crude side. But obviously, the outcome of the products, that tends to move on some other pipes as well. So it's much more of an MPC impacting project than it is an MPLX project. Yes. At a high level, yes, we would like to continue to expand our footprint there. But I'll let Greg and Shawn touch or Dave. It's Mike. I'll just add. We try or make every effort to be a full service provider. We will gather crude, we will gather gas. We will process the gas. We will transport the crude. Our intent is to be a partner to the producers or whoever needs to make infrastructure work for them or logistics work for them. So we try to be a full service provider and get into conversations, like you said on contracts or discussions as to what are their needs and how can we help them? And hopefully they turn into win-win situations. You're welcome."

I think as you look at it, one of our strategies is to leverage the existing infrastructure and assets we have in place from gathering to processing in the long haul pipelines down to the export opportunities or the other infrastructure out there.

Again, all anchored by strict capital discipline and ensuring that we get the acceptable returns."

At this time, all participants are in a listen [Audio Gap].\nKristina Kazarian: Good morning, and welcome to the MPLX third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at mplx.com, under the Investor tab. Joining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan, Chairman and CEO; John Quaid, CFO; and other members of the executive team. We invite you to read the safe harbor statements and non-GAAP disclaimer on slide 2. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the call and during the question-and-answer session that follows. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Hennigan: Thanks Kristina. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. First off, Shawn Lyon will be joining our calls as our new Senior Vice President of Logistics and Storage. Shawn has over 33 years of experience in engineering and leadership roles across our midstream and downstream organization. Most recently Shawn was President of Marathon Pipeline. Dave Heppner will also be joining our calls. He has over 34 years of experience with the company. Dave's role as Senior Vice President of Strategy and Business Development has been expanded to include a focus on midstream. Now turning to our business updates. Earlier today, we reported third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion and distributable cash flow of $1.3 billion, both of which represent record results and a 6% increase from the third quarter of last year. These results highlight the performance of our businesses and growth from our recent capital investments. Based on the strength and continued growth of our cash flows, today MPLX announced a 10% increase in the partnership's base distribution in addition to the $315 million of unit repurchases completed through the first nine months of the year. We continue to view this as a return on as well as a return of capital business. And this quarter, we advanced several organic growth projects. In the L&S segment, we continue to expand natural gas long haul and crude gathering pipelines supporting the growing Permian. Working with our partners, we are progressing our natural gas strategy with the expansion of the Whistler pipeline to 2.5 billion cubic feet per day, along with laterals into the Midland Basin and Corpus Christi markets, driven by increasing Permian natural gas production, interest for Whistler's additional capacity has been high, and we continue to expect it to come online in the third quarter of 2023. In the G&P segment, our growth focus remains mainly in the Permian and Marcellus Basin, although all other basins are generating positive cash flow. In the Permian, our 200 million cubic feet per day Tornado 2 processing plant is expected to be fully online by year-end and then ramping through the middle of next year. We're progressing our Preakness II processing plant, which we expect will come online in the first half of 2024, bringing our total Permian processing capacity to 1.2 billion cubic feet per day. In the Marcellus, our Smithburg de-ethanizer began operations this quarter and the facility has been ramping in line with in-basin demand. We are progressing the Harmon Creek II -- Harmon Creek II processing plant, which is expected to come online in the first half of 2024, bringing our total Marcellus processing capacity to 6.5 billion cubic feet per day. These asset additions will continue to support growing cash flows in our portfolio. Switching topics, we've received questions on the structure of MPLX and whether MPC will acquire partnership's outstanding public units. So we want to restate what we've said in the past. First, we've grown MPLX into an entity with a public float of approximately $12 billion, which compared to recent MLP roll-ups is substantially larger. MPLX is a strategic part of MPC's portfolio. MPLX has continued to demonstrate earnings growth, with the increased distribution announced today, MPC expects to receive $2 billion of distributions from MPLX annually. As MPLX pursues its growth opportunities, we expect the value of this strategic relationship will continue to be enhanced. MPC believes that its current capital allocation priorities are optimal for its shareholders and MPC does not plan to roll-up MPLX. As we continue to grow our cash flows, we also remain focused on executing the strategic priorities of strict capital discipline, fostering a low-cost culture and optimizing our asset portfolio. Shifting to Slide 4. Last quarter, we discussed our enhanced ESG commitments and disclosures with the June publication of both our annual sustainability and perspectives on climate-related scenarios reports. We're making progress on our targets and challenging ourselves to lead in sustainable energy by meeting the needs of today, while investing in an energy diverse future that creates shared value for all stakeholders. Now let me turn the call over to John to discuss our operational and financial results for the quarter.\nJohn Quaid : Thanks, Mike. Slide 5 outlines the third quarter operational and financial performance highlights for our Logistics and Storage segment. L&S segment adjusted EBITDA increased $65 million when compared to third quarter 2021. The increased results are primarily due to higher pipeline tariff rates and throughput partially offset by higher costs, including higher project expenses and fuel and power costs. Pipeline volumes were up 5%, driven primarily by increased utilization at MPC's refineries, while terminal volumes were down 1%, primarily due to the second quarter 2022 sale of several light product terminals. As you would have expected, our pipeline tariff rates increased in the third quarter. However, due to changes in the mix of throughputs, you will note our reported average rates were lower year-over-year. Moving to our Gathering and Processing segment on Slide 6. G&P segment adjusted EBITDA increased $17 million compared to third quarter 2021, primarily due to increased volumes, offset by increased operating costs, higher NGL prices also benefited the quarter with average NGL prices $0.05 per gallon higher than the prior year. Gathered volumes were up 12% year-over-year due to increased production in the Utica and Southwest regions. Processing volumes were up 2% year-over-year, primarily from higher volumes in the Southwest, which includes our Permian operations. In the Marcellus, while gathering and processing volumes were slightly lower year-over-year, we did see sequential increases for gathering, processing and fractionation volumes in line with our expectations for increased producer activity in the back half of the year. Moving to our third quarter financial highlights on Slide 7. Total adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion and distributable cash flow of $1.3 billion, both of which represent record quarterly results, also both increased 6% from the prior year. We returned $935 million to unitholders through $755 million of distributions and $180 million in repurchases of common units held by the public. As of September 30, we had just over $1 billion remaining available under our unit repurchase authorizations. As Mike discussed, based on our confidence in the business, we increased the base distribution by 10% to $0.775 per common unit, while maintaining strong coverage of 1.6 times. During the quarter, we've refinanced near-term senior notes maturities. We issued $1 billion of 10-year notes and used the net proceeds to redeem notes that were due in December of this year and March of 2023. We ended the quarter with total debt of approximately $20 billion and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 3.5 times, comfortably below our target leverage of four times. In closing, given our commitment to strict capital discipline and our continued adoption of a low-cost culture, we expect to continue generating strong cash flow, enhancing our financial flexibility to invest and grow the business, while also supporting the return of capital to MPLX unitholders. Now, let me turn the call back over to Kristina.\nKristina Kazarian: Thanks, John. As we open the call for questions, we ask that you limit yourself to one question plus one follow-up. We may re-prompt for additional questions as time permits. With that, Sheila, would you help us with questions?\nOperator: Absolutely. Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Brian Reynolds with UBS.\nKristina Kazarian: Hi, Sheila. If there is a question being asked, we can't hear. Would you mind re-prompting, Brian?\nOperator: Brian, if you please the un-mute feature on your phone. We're not able to hear you in conference, Brian Reynolds with UBS we're able to take your questions at this time.\nKristina Kazarian: Shelia, do you want to move to the next callers in the queue?\nBrian Reynolds: Oh, sorry, I was on \u2013 sorry I was on mute.\nKristina Kazarian: No, no worries, Brian. Good to hear you.\nBrian Reynolds: Sorry about that. Hi. Good morning, everyone. And Mike, it's great to read about your recent positive update.\nMike Hennigan: Thank you, Brian.\nBrian Reynolds: First to start-off on capital allocation process, particularly around the permanence, the distribution rates versus special, how should we think about the continuance of buybacks going forward? And how should we think about the ultimate leverage target given that leverage looks to be well below that four times target?\nJohn Quaid: Hey, good morning, Brian, it's John. I'll start with that and then Mike can jump in as well. So first of all, talking about the distribution. Look, as we said in our comments, it's really driven by our confidence in the business and the strength of our cash flows. Quarterly records on adjusted EBITDA and DCF, year-to-date $3.7 billion of distributable cash flow and the business also continues to generate cash, both in excess of our capital and our distribution running at about $730 million year-to-date. So all of that kind of gets us to the point as well, we're maintaining a strong balance sheet with leverage of 3.5 times and looking at a coverage of 1.6 after this distribution. So we -- our overall capital allocation rate hasn't changed, right? We want to ensure the safety of our assets, look at our distribution, grow the business as well and then look to return capital. And we continue to optimize that around the business and where we are. So certainly, confident in the strength of the business, drives our comfort with that 10% increase, but overall, we'll continue to look at other opportunities to return capital, right? We did $180 million of repurchases this quarter, but that will be dynamic, right? I know you asked about the pace of buybacks. I don't know if there's necessarily a pace. It's certainly an avenue for us to return capital, but we want to be opportunistic as we think about that as well, which is partly too, you've seen us maybe carrying some cash on, on the balance sheet from quarter-to-quarter. So I think our framework hasn't changed. We continue to optimize around that. And I think you'll see us doing that going forward, right? We'll probably see us look at that distribution, certainly subject to the Board's approval once a year. We'll continue to think about how we can be dynamic in our return of capital via unit repurchases. And just since you asked about it, the special, we're actually now calling the supplemental, but look, while not a tool we're going to use this year, that is something that remains available to us as we go forward. So lots of levers, and we're trying to work around that to optimize that return of capital.\nMike Hennigan: Hey, Brian, it's Mike. Let me just add a couple of comments. First off, before we get into the -- how are we going to return capital, the key for us is to show the market that we're continuing to grow the partnership. Growing earnings and cash flows put us in a good position to have this debate about what's the best way to return. At MPLX distributions are tax efficient, which is different than an MPC. At MPC, it's a little bit different situation for the C corp, but at MPLX distributions are a preferred way. At the same time, we've said a couple of times that we have an all of the above approach. So since we started the buyback program, we've executed somewhere around a little under $29 a unit. So as John says, we try and be dynamic. We look at the market conditions, but it all starts with generating and growing cash flows inside the partnership and then debating what's the best way to return that capital. And we've said all of the above, is the best way to describe it, because given the market conditions, we may lean one way or the other. I hope that helps you a little bit. Right now, as John said, we're very confident of the cash flow, so the permanent increase makes more sense. Last year, we debated a lot as to whether it was permanent, not permanent, because some of these calls are a little tricky. I used to use the term red bar and blue bar and that's still in my thinking as we describe the cash flows. But as we feel confident about them, we're going to increase distributions. As we see the market conditions allow us to buy back units, we're going to do that as well. So hopefully, that gives you a little more flavor. I know it's been hard for people to understand since it's bounced around a little bit, but it really has to do with where is the market at the time and how we feel about the cash flows. I hope that helps, Brian.\nBrian Reynolds: No, that's super helpful, and I appreciate the extra remarks there. Maybe as a follow-up, I appreciate the remarks around the potential low carbon opportunities just for Marathon as a general family. Could you maybe just talk a little bit more in depth about these opportunities? Kind of what has changed between this quarter and prior quarters, how does the IRA change things? And there is a pure refiner participating in the carbon pipeline in the Midwest. Is that something that MPLX could also participate in maybe supporting MPC, et cetera? Thanks.\nMike Hennigan: Brian, it's another really good question. Let me let Dave take a shot at how we think about investing capital, et cetera.\nDave Heppner: Hey Brian, I appreciate the question. This is Dave. So, as you would expect between MPC and MPLX, we look at numerous opportunities and a lot of them being driven in the low-carbon footprint as the industry and the country evolves in the energy evolution. And as you stated with the recent announcement of the IRA, that will have some impact as we evaluate those opportunities. I will say a couple of things are relative to that. Still pretty early, there's a lot of clarification relative to the IRA that needs to come to fruition before we can make forward-looking strategic decisions. Second is, as you touched on, between MPC and MPLX, there's a lot of integration opportunities along the value chain, which make these opportunities more viable for the overall enterprise. But I'll leave you with this that all our growth opportunities whether be in the base business or in this low-carbon energy evolution, it's all about return on capital. And if we can achieve those return on capital versus our other alternatives for those -- for that capital, we wouldn't proceed with those projects. Thank you.\nBrian Reynolds: Great. I really appreciate the color. Sorry about the mute, hiccup, and really great to hear you doing better, Mike. Have a great rest of your day.\nMike Hennigan: Thanks again, Brian. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from John Mackay with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJohn Mackay: Hey everyone. Good morning. Thanks for the time. Maybe I'll do something on the operating side, let's say, Northeast volumes are really strong. We've seen kind of mixed results from some others out there, particularly, I think Utica was, I don't know, record volumes since 2019 or something -- can you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the Northeast, whether these recent gains are sustainable, whether or not you're taking share from others? Just how do we think about that going forward given the overall basin still a little constrained?\nGreg Floerke: John, this is Greg, I'll take that question. The Northeast, our utilization remains high, but there is room for growth there. And the gas processing facilities are distributed across the Marcellus and the Utica around certain customers. And so we may be full at one plant and we're actually expanding. Harmon Creek 2 is a good example of that, which we announced last quarter. So, we're actually expanding there. Other plants still have room for production growth. The good news is, is that gas and NGL prices are -- continue to be supportive in the Northeast as well as elsewhere for more growth. And we do think it's sustainable as certain producers potentially remain flat or decline a bit, it makes room on the takeaway residue lines and NGL lines for more growth there. So, in general, we remain bullish. We are seeing more activity in the Utica area. We see a lot of growth on the gathering side there and also anticipate growth on the rich gas and process side. in the future.\nJohn Mackay: Thanks for that. Maybe as a follow-up, turning to Permian. Can you just give us an update on the Whistler extension? I think that's supposed to come online this quarter. Is that going to allow incremental egress out of the basin? And then maybe if you could just give us an update on what your position in Matterhorn is looking like? Thanks.\nShawn Lyon: Hey, John, this is Shawn. I'll take that. We're really excited about our position for gas takeaway out of the Permian. As we've seen differentials expand widen from Waha to Agua Dulce and Waha to Houston. We've seen on the original capacity for Whistler, that at near capacity, it's really matched the expectations that we've had -- and then as we've announced before, we've had an expansion that will come online in September of 2023, and that will again help us for the gas takeaway there. As we had in our prepared remarks, we have some laterals one coming in called the Martin County lateral coming in to Whistler. And one on the end that we're really excited about in the partnership we have with Cheniere that again, will go to liquid faction facility on the coast there. So that's where we stand there. Kind of moving to Matterhorn, we have decided and we announced it earlier to participate in Matterhorn. And again, that will help the gas take away there.\nMike Hennigan: Yes, I was just going to remind you on Matterhorn, right? We've got a 5% interest there. Again, that's driven by the producer volume we're able to bring to the project, right? I just don't want folks to think of some indication of our confidence in the project. It's really just driven by the volume we were able to bring in. So your question, you may have been recalling at one point, we were we were pushing for 15%, but we're coming in at 5% on that project, which is out a bit as well.\nJohn Mackay: All right. Thanks a lot. Appreciate the time today.\nMike Hennigan: Thanks, John\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Justin Jenkins with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nJustin Jenkins: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Mike, I want to echo Brian's comments on your health update. That's great to see.\nMike Hennigan: Thanks, Justin. Appreciate it.\nJustin Jenkins: I guess my first question \u2013 John, you mentioned project costs were up year-over-year in your remarks. But can I ask if that maybe came in lower than you expected in 3Q and have been part of the upside in the quarter itself and just your outlook on that line item into the fourth quarter here?\nJohn Quaid: Yes. Good morning, Justin, thanks for the question. Yes, while still up year-over-year, the team just continues to do an outstanding job of managing risk and managing projects and looking for efficiencies. So we probably did -- we had been kind of guiding to sequential changes that probably came in a good bit less than we were expecting. And again, just to talk about these projects in total, right? These are really larger maintenance programs we do. They are never going to be ratable quarter-by-quarter-by-quarter. And one of the things we've typically seen is the first quarter is the lowest and then the other quarters kind of ramp up, either driven off of weather or the timing of the program. So yes, I would say, probably sequentially, we did a really good job of managing those expenses, still up year-over-year. But that probably is driving some of the variance versus what we would have expected last quarter.\nJustin Jenkins: Okay. That's helpful. And John, I think my second one for you as well. On gross debt, it seems like we've been in the $20 billion to $21 billion range for a while now. Is that just coincidental, or should we think of that level starting to become more of a target here? And I guess, related to is the four times leverage target starting to turn into a ceiling, maybe?\nJohn Quaid: Great question, Justin. So yes. I mean the $20.1 million of kind of gross debt is where we've been, and we've been comfortable with it just because our leverage has been under our kind of four times guidepost. So you've seen us earlier this year twice go out and issue new notes to refinance upcoming maturities. And I would expect you'd see us to continue to do that. Looking out to next year, we've got a July maturity of about $1 billion that we'll look to address at the right time. We also too, maybe just -- and I'll just offer this up as well, we have some Series B preferred units. They're at a fixed rate now. But in February, they moved to a floating rate which, as of this morning would be 8.5%. So that will be something we'll look to address as well. Now that's not in the $20.1 million, because that 20.1% is just our senior notes. But that's something we've got on the radar as well. So I think you'll continue to see us to be comfortable with the leverage, provide us some financial flexibility as we think about running the business, but you'll see us continue to refinance those. I don't think you'll see us paying down debt.\nMike Hennigan: Justin, it's Mike. I just want to add what I said earlier is the business models we need to support our capital program and our distributions with cash flow generated through the partnership. And, obviously, we want to have access. So we haven't increased our debt level in quite some time to your point, it's been bouncing around that same level. The main reason the leverage has come down is because the earnings have gone up. So for a relatively constant debt and earnings going up, that's what's driving our leverage numbers down and we'll continue to look at that. But the key for us is run the partnership in such a way that we generate enough cash flows to self-sustain our capital program, our distribution have excess. So we have a good return program and obviously not increase our debt levels. I hope that helps.\nJustin Jenkins: Yeah. Perfect. Thanks all.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nMichael Blum: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just two quick ones for me. One, I'm sure you've seen diesel prices are really spiking in the Northeast. And I'm just curious if that presents any potential investment opportunities for MPLX?\nMike Hennigan: Dave, do you want to take that one?\nDave Heppner: Sure. Hey, Michael. Yeah, there's no question we're keeping an eye on that. And as I stated earlier, we look at everything as far as investment opportunities and with the expensive logistics and commercial footprint of MPC and MPLX, those opportunities pop up quite a bit. But again, a couple of things to keep in mind is -- these have to be long-term market fundamental changes to justify a long-term investment and getting back to the key point I touched on earlier, it's all about a return on capital and making sure that we can achieve the acceptable return on those capital investments for the long-term.\nMichael Blum: Great. Thanks for that. And then I wanted to ask, you guys have extensive marketing, NGL marketing operation in the Northeast. And I wonder if you could just speak to the shell cracker coming into service pretty soon here, how that might change dynamics for you in the Northeast? Thanks.\nGreg Floerke: Michael, this is Greg. Yeah, glad to answer that question or address that question. We're excited to see the Shells Monaca ethane cracker start to commission and ramp up in late third quarter. As I've mentioned before in previous calls, we expect to supply through our producers, recover and supply 80% to 90% of the flow into that plant. So it's a -- that's driving growth in terms of ethane recovery or Smithburg to -- excuse me, our Smithburg de-ethanizer is fully online now supporting that. So we -- the amount of ethane that we recover or where we recover is driven by the producers. But ultimately, the producers have the arrangements with the end user in this case, Shell. But yes, we do see growth in terms of ethane recovery in the Northeast and as that plant continues to ramp up.\nMike Hennigan : And Michael, it's Mike. I just want to add, we're still bullish the Marcellus. In the very short-term, the gas has been a little constrained, but like Greg just mentioned, so Shell is going to pull some ethane out, as you heard us say earlier, we're going to start up another processing plant. So as different producers execute their strategies up in the Northeast, we still think over the long-term, it's a great resource. It's a low-cost resource and it will be an important part of US natural gas supply for a long-term. Obviously, the constraints on pipelines need to get sorted out. We think that will happen, whether it's MVP or some of the others that are in process. But overall, we're still pretty bullish that the Marcellus is a good place to be. We have a strong position, as you mentioned, and Greg has talked about in the past. So we like our positioning there. We think it's a good area, and we believe it's going to continue to grow.\nMichael Blum: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nMike Hennigan : You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Theresa Chen with Barclays. Your line is open.\nTheresa Chen : Good morning everyone. Mike, it is great again to hear your voice. I want to first ask on the Whistler expansion coming online in the third quarter of next year. So initially, is this going to be involving any sort of ramp period or would that be immediate? And during any of the initial period, will it be completely belong and set to the contract for the third-party customers, or will you have any sort of marketing capability in that initial start-up?\nShawn Lyon : Hey, Theresa, this is Shawn. We've seen basically the interest in the expansion capacity be very high. And we expect that to be at our expectations or exceed it, again, based on the differentials we've seen between coming out of the Permian there. We think that's going to fill up fairly quickly along with what our expectations were.\nMike Hennigan : Hey, Theresa, it's Mike. I'll say, first of all, thank you for the kind words on my help. As far as the marketing goes, we do not market in that area. The producers are the players in that, and we are the transporters of it. So as Shawn said, we're pretty excited of the area needs to take away the business is continuing to grow. We're trying to be part of that growth profile, as Shawn mentioned. And at the end of the day, we believe it will ramp very quickly.\nTheresa Chen : Got it. And in relation to the ethane recovery dynamics as [indiscernible] comes online, I'm just curious as to your view on the utilization of that facility and the pull it will have across your system in light of the challenging pet chem dynamics globally right now and curtailments in utilization in existing plants as a result of these problematic netbacks?\nGreg Floerke: This is Greg again. The producers ultimately, as I mentioned before, determined whether we recover or reject ethane. And obviously, the residue gas prices in a region versus the ethane price has an impact on that. But the other thing that has a big impact is prior commitments that were made for ethane supply to downstream petrochemical companies and companies like Shell. So based on commitments that were made five, six, seven years ago or more, when the plant was in the FID phase. There's an expectation that we'll continue to recover ethane supply, for example, a Monaca plant. And that's true of other downstream crackers to the markets that our C2 pipeline delivers to, whether it's Gulf Coast, Canada or to Europe through the Marcus Hook connection. So we would expect with our over 300,000 barrels a day now with Smithburg de-ethanizer online in the region. We have \u2013 our utilization will clearly climb with ramp-up of Smithburg with the Monaca plant. But we still have capacity. We don't see an issue in the near-term there.\nTheresa Chen: That's very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nKeith Stanley: Hi. Thank you. I wanted to follow-up first. You cited the Series B preferred's that go to variable rate in February and also just being below the leverage target. Is one of the options you would consider to actually just issue debt to repay those preferreds and take that up a little bit since you're below the target, or if you take out the preps, would it more likely come from excess cash flows?\nJohn Quaid: Yeah. Hey, Keith, it's John. Thanks for the question. Certainly, when you think about those preferreds, and I may not have mentioned it, they've got a face of $600 million, right? So, not a big turn on leverage, we've got some capacity thinking about where those notes might be relative to that floating rate of 8.5%. It certainly would be a strong possibility for us to look to just move that over in a different part of the capital structure.\nKeith Stanley: Great. Second question, just I think last quarter, you talked about some cost inflation into 2023, and it felt like the companies definitely had a more optimistic tone on growth the past couple of quarters. So wondering, if you can give any directional sense of how you're thinking about CapEx into next year versus 2022? And any \u2013 any potential major projects you'd highlight aside from Whistler expansion and the processing plants that you're building? Thank you.\nShawn Lyon: Hey, Keith, it's Shawn. I'll take that one again. I mean, again, I think we've tried to talk about the projects we've had and that we've announced and some of those will roll into next year. I think we'll be ready to talk to you about our 2023 capital on next quarter's call. But I think we've highlighted the areas we're focused on with the gas plants Greg talked about in the Marcellus and the Permian. Again, what's interesting too, we've got opportunities around some of those Permian takeaway lines. But as you might recall us mentioning before, a lot of those will largely be financed at the JV level. So that's not going to draw too much capital against the budget as those move forward. So \u2013 but we've got a favorable price deck that supports some of our producer activities, and we'll be back to you next quarter with what 2023 looks like.\nMike Hennigan: Hey, Keith, it's Mike. Just to add. We have a little bit of I'll call it, all of the above approach on capital, as well as capital allocation. On the capital side, you heard that on the gas business, we're investing up in the Northeast. We're investing down in the Permian. In the L&S business, we're investing in some long-haul pipes and some other activities to support the refining business as we have today. So it's not as sexy, not to have a really big project. But personally, I like these smaller organic projects that have typically better returns than major large projects. So we're pretty happy with the capital program we have. It continues to chug along and generate earnings. And that's why I think at the end of the day, and you mentioned it earlier, thanks for noticing that, we continue to grow the earnings and the cash flows. And that's what puts us in a position to have that debate about what's the best way to return capital. But it all starts with growing earnings and growing cash flows within the partnership and that's where our main focus is, and then we can optimize after that.\nKeith Stanley: Thank you.\nMike Hennigan: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question will come from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nNeal Dingmann: Good morning, all. Thanks for getting me in. Just one question. So, I just -- you've done a great job, obviously, cash flow sort of speaks for itself. I\u2019m just wondering, given that strong cash flow, could you maybe -- you've talked around capital allocation a bit, but I'm just wondering a little bit more on how comfortable you all are allocating when it comes to cash flow, more towards growth versus shareholder returns? How you're thinking about that on a go forward?\nJohn Quaid: Hey, Neal, it's John. I'll start and then I'm sure Mike will chime in as well. Again, part of it, and maybe this is one of the things we've been doing, but maybe folks have noticed this quarter, we are still focused on growing the partnership and its earnings and cash flows, right? We've got a capital outlook this year of about, in total, across growth in maintenance and some other items, about $900 million. And we remain on track for that total spend. So we want to make sure we're growing the business. But we're also in a position where we've got the financial flexibility to do that and look at return of capital as well across a number of different tools, right, whether it's the permanent, whether it's repurchases. Again, we still have as an option, a supplemental distribution if and when that might make sense. And we just continue to try and optimize about that. But we're certainly not losing sight of our focus on growing the earnings and cash flows of the partnership.\nMike Hennigan: Yes, Neal, I'll just add to what John said. It's clearly the higher priority in our capital allocation. But at the same time, as Dave mentioned a couple of times, we're trying to have strict capital discipline, make sure that we're getting good returns, investing that capital wisely. And when we have those opportunities, we're advancing the ball. We certainly want to grow the earnings and cash flows over time. But we also like the position that we have such that, if we maintain good discipline have a good, robust program. John mentioned, we're spending a little under $1 billion in capital. That's a good base to add on to some of the current assets that we have. And then, if there's excess cash beyond that, we still test it against additional capital, to your point, where we say we'll return it to unitholders. So in our mind, it's still a win-win. If we think there's a good investment opportunity, we'll go that way. And hopefully, investors have confidence that we're delivering good returns. And if not, we'll return capital and we'll debate whether it's via the distribution or buybacks.\nKristina Kazarian: Sheila, was that it?\nEnd of Q&A:\nOperator: Thank you. Yes. We are showing no further questions.\nKristina Kazarian: Sounds great. Well, thank you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in MPLX. Should you have additional questions or would you like clarification on any of the topics discussed this morning, members of our team will be available to take your call. Thank you, everybody.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Slide 5 outlines the third quarter operational and financial performance highlights for our Logistics and Storage segment. L&S segment adjusted EBITDA increased $65 million when compared to third quarter 2021. The increased results are primarily due to higher pipeline tariff rates and throughput partially offset by higher costs, including higher project expenses and fuel and power costs. Pipeline volumes were up 5%, driven primarily by increased utilization at MPC's refineries, while terminal volumes were down 1%, primarily due to the second quarter 2022 sale of several light product terminals. As you would have expected, our pipeline tariff rates increased in the third quarter. However, due to changes in the mix of throughputs, you will note our reported average rates were lower year-over-year. Moving to our Gathering and Processing segment on Slide 6. G&P segment adjusted EBITDA increased $17 million compared to third quarter 2021, primarily due to increased volumes, offset by increased operating costs, higher NGL prices also benefited the quarter with average NGL prices $0.05 per gallon higher than the prior year. Gathered volumes were up 12% year-over-year due to increased production in the Utica and Southwest regions. Processing volumes were up 2% year-over-year, primarily from higher volumes in the Southwest, which includes our Permian operations. In the Marcellus, while gathering and processing volumes were slightly lower year-over-year, we did see sequential increases for gathering, processing and fractionation volumes in line with our expectations for increased producer activity in the back half of the year. Moving to our third quarter financial highlights on Slide 7. Total adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion and distributable cash flow of $1.3 billion, both of which represent record quarterly results, also both increased 6% from the prior year. We returned $935 million to unitholders through $755 million of distributions and $180 million in repurchases of common units held by the public. As of September 30, we had just over $1 billion remaining available under our unit repurchase authorizations. As Mike discussed, based on our confidence in the business, we increased the base distribution by 10% to $0.775 per common unit, while maintaining strong coverage of 1.6 times. During the quarter, we've refinanced near-term senior notes maturities. We issued $1 billion of 10-year notes and used the net proceeds to redeem notes that were due in December of this year and March of 2023. We ended the quarter with total debt of approximately $20 billion and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 3.5 times, comfortably below our target leverage of four times. In closing, given our commitment to strict capital discipline and our continued adoption of a low-cost culture, we expect to continue generating strong cash flow, enhancing our financial flexibility to invest and grow the business, while also supporting the return of capital to MPLX unitholders. Now, let me turn the call back over to Kristina. Hey, good morning, Brian, it's John. I'll start with that and then Mike can jump in as well. So first of all, talking about the distribution. Look, as we said in our comments, it's really driven by our confidence in the business and the strength of our cash flows. Quarterly records on adjusted EBITDA and DCF, year-to-date $3.7 billion of distributable cash flow and the business also continues to generate cash, both in excess of our capital and our distribution running at about $730 million year-to-date. So all of that kind of gets us to the point as well, we're maintaining a strong balance sheet with leverage of 3.5 times and looking at a coverage of 1.6 after this distribution. So we -- our overall capital allocation rate hasn't changed, right? We want to ensure the safety of our assets, look at our distribution, grow the business as well and then look to return capital. And we continue to optimize that around the business and where we are. So certainly, confident in the strength of the business, drives our comfort with that 10% increase, but overall, we'll continue to look at other opportunities to return capital, right? We did $180 million of repurchases this quarter, but that will be dynamic, right? I know you asked about the pace of buybacks. I don't know if there's necessarily a pace. It's certainly an avenue for us to return capital, but we want to be opportunistic as we think about that as well, which is partly too, you've seen us maybe carrying some cash on, on the balance sheet from quarter-to-quarter. So I think our framework hasn't changed. We continue to optimize around that. And I think you'll see us doing that going forward, right? We'll probably see us look at that distribution, certainly subject to the Board's approval once a year. We'll continue to think about how we can be dynamic in our return of capital via unit repurchases. And just since you asked about it, the special, we're actually now calling the supplemental, but look, while not a tool we're going to use this year, that is something that remains available to us as we go forward. So lots of levers, and we're trying to work around that to optimize that return of capital. Yes. Good morning, Justin, thanks for the question. Yes, while still up year-over-year, the team just continues to do an outstanding job of managing risk and managing projects and looking for efficiencies. So we probably did -- we had been kind of guiding to sequential changes that probably came in a good bit less than we were expecting. And again, just to talk about these projects in total, right? These are really larger maintenance programs we do. They are never going to be ratable quarter-by-quarter-by-quarter. And one of the things we've typically seen is the first quarter is the lowest and then the other quarters kind of ramp up, either driven off of weather or the timing of the program. So yes, I would say, probably sequentially, we did a really good job of managing those expenses, still up year-over-year. But that probably is driving some of the variance versus what we would have expected last quarter. Great question, Justin. So yes. I mean the $20.1 million of kind of gross debt is where we've been, and we've been comfortable with it just because our leverage has been under our kind of four times guidepost. So you've seen us earlier this year twice go out and issue new notes to refinance upcoming maturities. And I would expect you'd see us to continue to do that. Looking out to next year, we've got a July maturity of about $1 billion that we'll look to address at the right time. We also too, maybe just -- and I'll just offer this up as well, we have some Series B preferred units. They're at a fixed rate now. But in February, they moved to a floating rate which, as of this morning would be 8.5%. So that will be something we'll look to address as well. Now that's not in the $20.1 million, because that 20.1% is just our senior notes. But that's something we've got on the radar as well. So I think you'll continue to see us to be comfortable with the leverage, provide us some financial flexibility as we think about running the business, but you'll see us continue to refinance those. I don't think you'll see us paying down debt. Yeah. Hey, Keith, it's John. Thanks for the question. Certainly, when you think about those preferreds, and I may not have mentioned it, they've got a face of $600 million, right? So, not a big turn on leverage, we've got some capacity thinking about where those notes might be relative to that floating rate of 8.5%.

            "name": "Greg Floerke",
            "content": "John, this is Greg, I'll take that question. The Northeast, our utilization remains high, but there is room for growth there. And the gas processing facilities are distributed across the Marcellus and the Utica around certain customers. And so we may be full at one plant and we're actually expanding. Harmon Creek 2 is a good example of that, which we announced last quarter. So, we're actually expanding there. Other plants still have room for production growth. The good news is, is that gas and NGL prices are -- continue to be supportive in the Northeast as well as elsewhere for more growth. And we do think it's sustainable as certain producers potentially remain flat or decline a bit, it makes room on the takeaway residue lines and NGL lines for more growth there. So, in general, we remain bullish. We are seeing more activity in the Utica area. We see a lot of growth on the gathering side there and also anticipate growth on the rich gas and process side. in the future. Michael, this is Greg. Yeah, glad to answer that question or address that question. We're excited to see the Shells Monaca ethane cracker start to commission and ramp up in late third quarter. As I've mentioned before in previous calls, we expect to supply through our producers, recover and supply 80% to 90% of the flow into that plant.

            "name": "Mike Hennigan",
            "content": "Thanks Kristina. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. First off, Shawn Lyon will be joining our calls as our new Senior Vice President of Logistics and Storage. Shawn has over 33 years of experience in engineering and leadership roles across our midstream and downstream organization. Most recently Shawn was President of Marathon Pipeline. Dave Heppner will also be joining our calls. He has over 34 years of experience with the company. Dave's role as Senior Vice President of Strategy and Business Development has been expanded to include a focus on midstream. Now turning to our business updates. Earlier today, we reported third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion and distributable cash flow of $1.3 billion, both of which represent record results and a 6% increase from the third quarter of last year. These results highlight the performance of our businesses and growth from our recent capital investments. Based on the strength and continued growth of our cash flows, today MPLX announced a 10% increase in the partnership's base distribution in addition to the $315 million of unit repurchases completed through the first nine months of the year. We continue to view this as a return on as well as a return of capital business. And this quarter, we advanced several organic growth projects. In the L&S segment, we continue to expand natural gas long haul and crude gathering pipelines supporting the growing Permian. Working with our partners, we are progressing our natural gas strategy with the expansion of the Whistler pipeline to 2.5 billion cubic feet per day, along with laterals into the Midland Basin and Corpus Christi markets, driven by increasing Permian natural gas production, interest for Whistler's additional capacity has been high, and we continue to expect it to come online in the third quarter of 2023. In the G&P segment, our growth focus remains mainly in the Permian and Marcellus Basin, although all other basins are generating positive cash flow. In the Permian, our 200 million cubic feet per day Tornado 2 processing plant is expected to be fully online by year-end and then ramping through the middle of next year. We're progressing our Preakness II processing plant, which we expect will come online in the first half of 2024, bringing our total Permian processing capacity to 1.2 billion cubic feet per day. In the Marcellus, our Smithburg de-ethanizer began operations this quarter and the facility has been ramping in line with in-basin demand. We are progressing the Harmon Creek II -- Harmon Creek II processing plant, which is expected to come online in the first half of 2024, bringing our total Marcellus processing capacity to 6.5 billion cubic feet per day. These asset additions will continue to support growing cash flows in our portfolio. Switching topics, we've received questions on the structure of MPLX and whether MPC will acquire partnership's outstanding public units. So we want to restate what we've said in the past. First, we've grown MPLX into an entity with a public float of approximately $12 billion, which compared to recent MLP roll-ups is substantially larger. MPLX is a strategic part of MPC's portfolio. MPLX has continued to demonstrate earnings growth, with the increased distribution announced today, MPC expects to receive $2 billion of distributions from MPLX annually. As MPLX pursues its growth opportunities, we expect the value of this strategic relationship will continue to be enhanced. MPC believes that its current capital allocation priorities are optimal for its shareholders and MPC does not plan to roll-up MPLX. As we continue to grow our cash flows, we also remain focused on executing the strategic priorities of strict capital discipline, fostering a low-cost culture and optimizing our asset portfolio. Shifting to Slide 4. Last quarter, we discussed our enhanced ESG commitments and disclosures with the June publication of both our annual sustainability and perspectives on climate-related scenarios reports. We're making progress on our targets and challenging ourselves to lead in sustainable energy by meeting the needs of today, while investing in an energy diverse future that creates shared value for all stakeholders. Now let me turn the call over to John to discuss our operational and financial results for the quarter. Thank you, Brian. Hey, Brian, it's Mike. Let me just add a couple of comments. First off, before we get into the -- how are we going to return capital, the key for us is to show the market that we're continuing to grow the partnership. Growing earnings and cash flows put us in a good position to have this debate about what's the best way to return. At MPLX distributions are tax efficient, which is different than an MPC. At MPC, it's a little bit different situation for the C corp, but at MPLX distributions are a preferred way. At the same time, we've said a couple of times that we have an all of the above approach. So since we started the buyback program, we've executed somewhere around a little under $29 a unit. So as John says, we try and be dynamic. We look at the market conditions, but it all starts with generating and growing cash flows inside the partnership and then debating what's the best way to return that capital. And we've said all of the above, is the best way to describe it, because given the market conditions, we may lean one way or the other. I hope that helps you a little bit. Right now, as John said, we're very confident of the cash flow, so the permanent increase makes more sense. Last year, we debated a lot as to whether it was permanent, not permanent, because some of these calls are a little tricky. I used to use the term red bar and blue bar and that's still in my thinking as we describe the cash flows. But as we feel confident about them, we're going to increase distributions. As we see the market conditions allow us to buy back units, we're going to do that as well. So hopefully, that gives you a little more flavor. I know it's been hard for people to understand since it's bounced around a little bit, but it really has to do with where is the market at the time and how we feel about the cash flows. I hope that helps, Brian. Brian, it's another really good question. Let me let Dave take a shot at how we think about investing capital, et cetera. Thanks again, Brian. Appreciate it. Yes, I was just going to remind you on Matterhorn, right? We've got a 5% interest there. Again, that's driven by the producer volume we're able to bring to the project, right? I just don't want folks to think of some indication of our confidence in the project. It's really just driven by the volume we were able to bring in. So your question, you may have been recalling at one point, we were we were pushing for 15%, but we're coming in at 5% on that project, which is out a bit as well. Thanks, John Thanks, Justin. Appreciate it. Justin, it's Mike. I just want to add what I said earlier is the business models we need to support our capital program and our distributions with cash flow generated through the partnership. And, obviously, we want to have access. So we haven't increased our debt level in quite some time to your point, it's been bouncing around that same level. The main reason the leverage has come down is because the earnings have gone up. So for a relatively constant debt and earnings going up, that's what's driving our leverage numbers down and we'll continue to look at that. But the key for us is run the partnership in such a way that we generate enough cash flows to self-sustain our capital program, our distribution have excess. So we have a good return program and obviously not increase our debt levels. I hope that helps. Dave, do you want to take that one? And Michael, it's Mike. I just want to add, we're still bullish the Marcellus. In the very short-term, the gas has been a little constrained, but like Greg just mentioned, so Shell is going to pull some ethane out, as you heard us say earlier, we're going to start up another processing plant. So as different producers execute their strategies up in the Northeast, we still think over the long-term, it's a great resource. It's a low-cost resource and it will be an important part of US natural gas supply for a long-term. Obviously, the constraints on pipelines need to get sorted out. We think that will happen, whether it's MVP or some of the others that are in process. But overall, we're still pretty bullish that the Marcellus is a good place to be. We have a strong position, as you mentioned, and Greg has talked about in the past. So we like our positioning there. We think it's a good area, and we believe it's going to continue to grow. You're welcome. Hey, Theresa, it's Mike. I'll say, first of all, thank you for the kind words on my help. As far as the marketing goes, we do not market in that area. The producers are the players in that, and we are the transporters of it. So as Shawn said, we're pretty excited of the area needs to take away the business is continuing to grow. We're trying to be part of that growth profile, as Shawn mentioned. And at the end of the day, we believe it will ramp very quickly. Hey, Keith, it's Mike. Just to add. We have a little bit of I'll call it, all of the above approach on capital, as well as capital allocation. On the capital side, you heard that on the gas business, we're investing up in the Northeast. We're investing down in the Permian. In the L&S business, we're investing in some long-haul pipes and some other activities to support the refining business as we have today. So it's not as sexy, not to have a really big project. But personally, I like these smaller organic projects that have typically better returns than major large projects. So we're pretty happy with the capital program we have. It continues to chug along and generate earnings. And that's why I think at the end of the day, and you mentioned it earlier, thanks for noticing that, we continue to grow the earnings and the cash flows. And that's what puts us in a position to have that debate about what's the best way to return capital. But it all starts with growing earnings and growing cash flows within the partnership and that's where our main focus is, and then we can optimize after that. You're welcome. Yes, Neal, I'll just add to what John said. It's clearly the higher priority in our capital allocation. But at the same time, as Dave mentioned a couple of times, we're trying to have strict capital discipline, make sure that we're getting good returns, investing that capital wisely. And when we have those opportunities, we're advancing the ball. We certainly want to grow the earnings and cash flows over time. But we also like the position that we have such that, if we maintain good discipline have a good, robust program. John mentioned, we're spending a little under $1 billion in capital. That's a good base to add on to some of the current assets that we have. And then, if there's excess cash beyond that, we still test it against additional capital, to your point, where we say we'll return it to unitholders. So in our mind, it's still a win-win. If we think there's a good investment opportunity, we'll go that way. And hopefully, investors have confidence that we're delivering good returns. And if not, we'll return capital and we'll debate whether it's via the distribution or buybacks."

            "name": "Dave Heppner",
            "content": "Hey Brian, I appreciate the question. This is Dave. So, as you would expect between MPC and MPLX, we look at numerous opportunities and a lot of them being driven in the low-carbon footprint as the industry and the country evolves in the energy evolution. And as you stated with the recent announcement of the IRA, that will have some impact as we evaluate those opportunities. I will say a couple of things are relative to that. Still pretty early, there's a lot of clarification relative to the IRA that needs to come to fruition before we can make forward-looking strategic decisions. Second is, as you touched on, between MPC and MPLX, there's a lot of integration opportunities along the value chain, which make these opportunities more viable for the overall enterprise. But I'll leave you with this that all our growth opportunities whether be in the base business or in this low-carbon energy evolution, it's all about return on capital. And if we can achieve those return on capital versus our other alternatives for those -- for that capital, we wouldn't proceed with those projects. Thank you. Sure. Hey, Michael. Yeah, there's no question we're keeping an eye on that. And as I stated earlier, we look at everything as far as investment opportunities and with the expensive logistics and commercial footprint of MPC and MPLX, those opportunities pop up quite a bit. But again, a couple of things to keep in mind is -- these have to be long-term market fundamental changes to justify a long-term investment and getting back to the key point I touched on earlier, it's all about a return on capital and making sure that we can achieve the acceptable return on those capital investments for the long-term."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.\nKristina Kazarian: Good morning, and welcome to the MPLX second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at mplx.com, under the Investor tab. Joining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan, Chairman and CEO; John Quaid, CFO; and other members of the executive team. We invite you to read the safe harbor statements and non-GAAP disclaimer on Slide 2. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the call and during the question-and-answer session that follows. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Hennigan: Thanks Kristina. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call. Earlier today, we reported second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion. Our operating results this quarter represented 6% increase from the second quarter of last year. This performance highlights the continued resiliency of our base business, tailwinds from higher NGL prices, as well as the growth coming from recent capital investments. In late June, we've renewed several pipeline contracts with MPC. These pipeline systems are fit for purpose and integral to MPC\u2019s refining and marketing system. The renewal and extension of these contracts make economic and financial sense for both entities. Contracts now have extended terms to 2032 and have two automatic renewal provisions, which will allow for an additional 10 years of extensions, which could take them out to 2042. We continue to view the business as a return on as well as a return of capital business. And this quarter, we advance several organic growth projects. In the L&S segment, we continue to expand long haul natural gas and crude gathering pipeline supporting the growing Permian and Bakken regions. Specifically in the Permian, working with our partners, we continue to progress our natural gas strategy with the expansion of the Whistler pipeline from 2 bcf per day to 2.5 bcf per day, along with laterals into the Midland basin and Corpus Christi markets. In the G&P segment, we remain focused on the Permian and Marcellus basins in response to producer demand. In the Permian, construction advanced on our Tornado 2 processing plant, which is expected to come online in the second half of 2022. We are also planning to build our sixth processing plant in the basin, Preakness II, which is expected to be online in the first half of 2024. This will bring our total Permian processing capacity up to 1.2 bcf per day. In the Marcellus, our Smithburg de-ethanizer is expected to come online to meet incremental in-basin demand in the third quarter of 2022. Additionally, we plan to add the Harmon Creek II processing plant, which will expect to come online in the first half of 2024. This will bring total processing capacity up to 6.5 bcf per day in the Marcellus. Our capital allocation framework remains unchanged. In year-to-date, we have returned slightly over $1.6 billion to our unitholders through distributions and unit repurchases. Today is part of our long-term commitment to capital return. We announced an incremental $1 billion unit repurchased authorization. And with the strength and stability of the business, we will evaluate an increase to our base distribution later in the year. Shifting to Slide 4, this quarter, we continue to enhance our ESG commitments and disclosures with the recent publication of both our annual sustainability and perspectives on climate related scenarios report. We continue to make progress on our 2030 targets to reduce methane emissions intensity 75% from 2016 levels. Through last year, we've achieved a 47 \u2013 I'm sorry, 46% reduction, further enhancing the lower carbon profile of our natural gas business. We've also added a biodiversity target to develop sustainable landscapes across 50% of our MPL compatible right-of-ways are about 10,000 acres by the end of 2025. Through the end of last year, we've already achieved nearly 10% of this target. We're challenging ourselves to lead in sustainable energy by meeting the needs of today while investing in an energy diverse future that creates shared value for all of our stakeholders. Now let me turn the call over to John to discuss our operational and financial results for the quarter.\nJohn Quaid: Thanks Mike. Slide 5 outlines the second quarter operational and financial performance highlights for our Logistics and Storage segment. The L&S segment adjusted EBITDA increased $19 million when compared to second quarter of 2021 do primarily to higher throughputs. Pipeline volumes were up 6% and terminal volumes were up 4% year-over-year, driven largely by increased utilization at MPC\u2019s refineries. Moving on to our gathering and processing segment on Slide 6. G&P segment adjusted EBITDA increased $64 million compared to second quarter of 2021, largely due to higher NGL prices. For the quarter, NGL prices averaged $1.18 per gallon, which is $0.43 per gallon higher than the average from the second quarter of 2021. Gathered volumes were up 11% due to increased production in the Utica and Southwest offset slightly by a decrease in the Marcellus. Processing volumes were roughly flat as compared to the second quarter of 2021. Moving to Slide 7. Our second quarter financial results demonstrate the earnings and cash flow resiliency \u2013 excuse me, and stability of our business. For the quarter, total adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion was up 6% from the prior year, while distributed cash flow of $1.2 billion was flat compared to 2021, primarily due to one-time benefits experienced last year. Free cash flow after distributions increased to $614 million in the second quarter. This number does include approximately $65 million in asset sales proceeds, primarily from the sale of several light product terminals and a $266 million working capital benefit, which we anticipate may largely reverse in the third quarter. Project related expenses increased nearly $30 million in the quarter, and we anticipate an incremental $40 million increase from 2Q to 3Q in project related expenses. Looking at other financial highlights for the quarter, MPLX declared a second quarter distribution of $0.750 per unit resulting in distribution coverage ratio of 1.69 times. We ended the quarter with total debt of about $20 billion and a leverage ratio of 3.5 times. Looking forward over the next 12 months, we have roughly \u2013 we have $2 billion of senior note maturities, which subject to market conditions, we would expect to refinance into long-term debt. After quarter end, we entered into a new $2 billion five-year credit facility to replace the previously existing facility. The new credit facility extends to July of 2027. In closing, given current business conditions, our commitment to strict capital discipline and our continued adoption of a low cost culture, we expect to continue generating strong cash flow. Enhancing our financial flexibility to invest and grow the business while also supporting the return of capital to MPX unitholders. Now, let me turn the call back over to Kristina.\nKristina Kazarian: Thanks John. As we open the call for questions, we ask that you limit yourself to one question plus a follow up. We may reprompt for additional questions as time permits. With that, operator will open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from John Mackay with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJohn Mackay: Hey, good morning. Thanks for the time. And nice to hear from you, Mike, I wanted to start on just capital allocation, got the new buyback authorization, but the buyback number during the second quarter was also a little bit lower than I think most of us expected. Can you just talk a little bit about how you're thinking about, think about that going forward and balance that against some of your comments on potentially increasing the distribution later in this year? Thanks.\nMike Hennigan: Yes, John, thanks for your comment. I'm going to let John take that one.\nJohn Quaid: Hey morning, John. Thanks for the question. First, I wouldn't read too much into \u2013 our activity in the second quarter and nothing about it should be viewed as a deviation from our capital allocation philosophy. You'll remember in the first quarter, our free cash flow after distributions was less than $100 million, we were coming into a year, forecasting higher capital spending and continuing to look at some growth opportunities. But looking forward, right, we ended this quarter with $300 million on the balance sheet and with our incremental $1 billion authorization, we now have total authorization of $1.2 billion for the repurchase of units. So I think if you look forward in the second half, we'd expect to be perhaps more dynamic and opportunistic as we look at unit repurchases. And of course, all done in line with SEC regs, which from time to time can limit our flexibility, but overall, I think we can continue to anticipate kind of in all of the above approach, certainly subject to cash flow growth opportunities and market conditions so in addition to unit repurchases, right, we'll reassess our base distribution as we did last year and certainly any change there would be subject to board approval. We have a supplemental as perhaps a tax efficient tool for capital return, but you might see us maybe holding some level of cash as we look to evaluate growth opportunities and really opportunistically look to return capital. So I think that's the big picture and I'll turn it back to Mike if he wants to add anything.\nMike Hennigan: I think you covered it well.\nJohn Mackay: No, that was great. Really thorough, appreciate the detail there. Maybe just follow up on kind of underlying fundamental stuff. Can we talk a little bit about what's going on in the Northeast? I think Marcellus processing was, kind of lowest we've seen in a couple quarters, but you'd have felt kind of bounced back nicely. Wondering if you can kind of just unpack those two for us.\nGreg Floerke: John, this is Greg, I'll speak to that question. We've seen a period of load growth to even flat sort of maintenance drilling in the Northeast over the last particularly post-COVID demand destruction era and even a flat year-over-year number would be, would represent, quite a bit of drilling and new pads coming online to hold off that decline. We have continued to see that production come on, probably more of the early ramp has been focused in the crude areas because the crude pricing level is what drove more of the rig activity. So Permian, Bakken but we are now seeing starting to see that activity up ramp up. And we expect to see more of a back half of 2022 volume load versus early in the year. So some producers have continued to maintain a little bit of growth and some have continued to decline and not necessarily maintained. So that really is the primary explanation.\nJohn Mackay: Okay. Appreciate that. Thanks for the time everyone.\nMike Hennigan: Thanks John.\nOperator: Next, we will hear from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. You may proceed.\nMichael Blum: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So yes, I wanted to stand the Northeast a little bit from unless I'm wrong. This is the first new processing plant you've announced in quite a while. So just wanted to get your view on if you're seeing any like, really change in the growth rate for volumes in the Northeast and then kind of related to that if Mountain Valley pipeline does get done, do you think that would influence your view of kind of basic growth overall and then specifically anything for MPLX?\nGreg Floerke: Yes. Greg, again, as I had mentioned before, we do expect to see some ramp up in growth in the Northeast beyond what we've seen over the last 18 months. In terms of the new plant, the processing plants are really sort of specific to the gathering area and the producers, even within an area like the Marcellus. So we have some plants that have run close or at are very near capacity over the last 18 months. And some that aren't quite at that level overall, we're still at high utilization, but we do see the need over the next 12 to 18 months for more capacity in the specific area where we're building Harmon Creek plant.\nMike Hennigan: And Michael, this is Mike. I'll just add that. So what Greg has said, it's been a constrained area for a while. And our anticipation as MVP will get done. The shell plan is going to come up. As you pointed out, we're going to build another processing plan. So I think we're finally going to start to see a little bit more growth in the area that's been somewhat constrained for a little bit, as Greg just mentioned.\nMichael Blum: Great. I appreciate that. My second question is really probably more strategic in nature. There's been recently a few sponsors which have chosen to buy in their MLPs. So they're just curious, just get your latest thoughts on the MPC, MPLX relationship and structure, and whether it's still makes sense from your perspective, maintain a separate publicly traded MLP. Thanks.\nMike Hennigan: Yes, Michael, we get that question often at the MPC call. Our quick answer is our situation is a lot different than many of the others that you've seen, roll it up. So we're pretty comfortable in the structure that we have today. We still think it's good for the marathon family. It works for both, as we just talked about in our prepared remarks, we just, re-upped another 10 years of asset use between the two entities. So we're pretty comfortable with where we stand and we think it's a good structure for us.\nMichael Blum: Great. Thank you very much.\nMike Hennigan: You're welcome.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Brian Reynolds with UBS. Your line is open.\nBrian Reynolds: Hi, good morning, everyone. Was just curious if you could provide any incremental details in the L&S contract extension with MPC, do any rates move up or down or are there any other pipeline assets that were previously not included in the agreement that are now in the agreement? Thanks.\nTim Aydt: Yes, I'll take that one, Brian. This is Tim. So I think you're familiar with the fact that these pipelines are really critical to both MPLX and stable earnings as well as to MPC\u2019s operations. So as a result, both MPLX and MPC agreed to renew and actually extend the contract for another 10 years. And it's a pretty significant contract. But to your question, the contract terms were not changed other than extending the contract duration, which does certainly provide more certainty for an extended number of years on these very key systems. I guess, it'd be important to keep in mind that these specific logistics assets under contract with MPC are indeed fit for purpose and they're integral to the refining and marketing system. So not only does it make operational sense, but renewal with MPC certainly made financial sense for both parties. I think the last thing I would touch on is that while we're talking about this specific contract with MPC, we do have a lot of other systems and so forth. And so we continue to focus on maximizing the utilization of all of those systems including those that serve third parties as well.\nJohn Quaid: So hopefully that's helpful. And hey, Brian, it's John, I just might add on to Tim's comments. One of the things that really was part of our thinking around this as well, was maybe some questions from investors on the commitment of MPC to MPLX and we think this renewal certainly is evidence of that commitment. And just as a reminder, too, I think Tim, might have mentioned as well, but these are all largely FERC index based systems. So their rates have been moving every year in line with the indices.\nBrian Reynolds: Great, appreciate all that color. My one follow up question is just around any initial thoughts on the potential pipeline reform build and then potential impacts in the Northeast JMP business. I know you briefly touched on it a little bit earlier, but curious if there's any unique opportunities that MPLX would now consider that it previously hasn't, given it hasn't met its risk adjusted profile, just given the regulatory uncertainty. Thanks.\nMike Hennigan: And Brian, you speaking to the inflation reduction act or a different legislation, I thought I heard you refer to a different legislation. I just want to make sure\u2026\nBrian Reynolds: Inflation reduction effectively the side deal that mentioned.\nMike Hennigan: So obviously, pretty long bill, the details were just released and we continue to evaluate it. I think a couple of key points for MPLX. One, you see some focus around methane emission and I would say, and we've kind of talked about it on the call. Mike commented on some in his prepared remarks. We've been working very hard to reduce those emissions. We feel like right now with the current draft, we don't see a significant impact to our overall system. Really a benefit of the work we've done to-date to reduce those emissions. There may be some opportunities around renewables, but I think we're encouraged, but we need to see kind of how that all flows through the final legislation. \nTim Aydt: And maybe I would just, this is Tim. I would just add maybe a couple of things from the logistics standpoint. There are some provisions in the current version of it that does increase the 45Q tax credit. And that could be supportive of CCS projects, which we have an interest in. And then there's also some provisions for SAF and hydrogen production, which could drive some future logistics needs as well. If that was part of your question. So, but as John said, it's early, so we're going to continue to monitor it.\nBrian Reynolds: Nope. Great, that covered it. Appreciate all the color and have a great rest of your day. \nTim Aydt: Thank you, Brian.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Jeremy Tonet with JPMC. Your line is open.\nSteve McGee: This is Steve McGee for Jeremy. Really just one for me, wanted to see if there was any further updates to Matterhorn. Just how you're thinking about participating and any further details you can give us there.\nTim Aydt: Sure. This is Tim. I will take that one. As we've mentioned before, we do believe in the strong growth of the Permian and believe that beyond even the announced expansions of the existing pipes, such as Whistler, that a couple of more pipes are going to be needed over the next five plus years. Matterhorn is the first of those which is why the partners FID the project in May as for our equity ownership in Matterhorn that's not been totally finalized yet, but it does currently stand at 5%. And so from a monetary standpoint, that would represent about $30 million of investment and then that of course would reflect some level of project financing. So that's relatively small stake here on Matterhorn. But that's \u2013 we put a lot of our commitments toward the Whistler side of the house and its expansion.\nSteve McGee: Got it super helpful there. Actually, if I could just one more, just wanted to see with just cost increases if you're seeing any kind of cost pressures right now throughout the business. And then with that, how much of that do you, it's permanent versus how much do you think you can optimize again?\nTim Aydt: So this is Tim again, and you're basically referring to some of the inflation protection. I would assume that we have so. So I'll attack that question in that regard. I would say that like others, we are certainly seeing some inflationary cost pressures across most all of our spend categories, quite frankly. And these increases are largely in line with the public indicators for material, equipment, labor and freight. We are seeing line pipe and energy cost that may be up a little more significantly. For example, our fuel and power is up about 15% year-on-year for our pipeline side of the house. The teams are certainly working hard to help offset these increases by completing more of the work in-house, maybe deferring some non-critical work and realizing operating efficiencies through the ideas of our workforce. I think if you're talking more on the capital side, much of our 2022 capital spend was contracted previously, so early in the year we didn't see as much impact on our capital spend, but we do expect that with increased cost you're going to see that later in the year. We still maintain our capital guidance of $700 million and intend to spend that and stay within budget. I would say that the increased costs for capital projects are probably going to show up more significantly in 2023, as we are starting to see a lot of rate sheet increases from contractors and other service providers. So hopefully that gives you a little flare to what we're seeing.\nSteve McGee: Yep. That's perfect. Thanks guys. I'll leave you there.\nTim Aydt: Okay. Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Theresa Chen with Barclays. Your line is open.\nTheresa Chen: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. And it's great to hear from you, Mike. So maybe beginning with the demand side of things across L&S given the incremental concern following the recent economic data and just market worries about recession, your second quarter utilization of the parent and the volumes of the MLP would indicate that things are going well, but would love to hear your outlook across the demand regions please?\nMike Hennigan: Yeah. Theresa its Mike thank you for your comment first. The demand question is obviously one that we continue to monitor, and I guess at the end of the day, we're still pretty bullish of what we're seeing across the commodities. It was interesting give you more detail than you probably wanted, 4th of July weekend, which is typically a stronger weekend was not that strong in our system, but then subsequent to that the rest of July really picked up again. So I think the reason we're still constructive is overall, we're still mostly at pre-pandemic levels across the system. So we think there's still room to run on the demand side. It's been choppy. Like I said, if we went and went into the season with Memorial Day weekend 4th of July, the bigger weekends that typically show some robust numbers, we didn't really see those, but then the other times during the month, we've seen some strong recovery. So I think at the end of the day, we're still pretty constructive. Overall we think demand has more to go once we get back to a normal post-pandemic environment. Inventories are still constructive, as you mentioned, our whole thought process on the refining side of the house in the second quarter was run as reliably as we could in the margin environment, produce as much transportation fuel as possible. And really obviously continue to show the market that we're running a low cost system. So low cost, strong reliability and we'll take what the market offers as far as margins. And right now it's hard not to still be constructive. Demand is looking good. Inventories are low it's still a pretty constructive environment for us.\nTheresa Chen: Thank you for that detailed response. And then turning to the contractual site of your assets or the contractual nature of your L&S assets and following the inflation data that we received thus far in the escalator tracking in that mid teens range. Can you remind us of the expected inflation tailwinds that you will have within L&S? And to the extent you can share any color on captain colors around your gathering assets as well, that'd be great?\nTim Aydt: Yeah, I can \u2013 this is Tim. I can kick that off. And I think your questions really about the inflation protection and so forth that some of our contracts may have. So we do have some level of inflation protection in almost all of our L&S and G&P contracts. They range from some of the small fixed escalators up to the variable escalators that are based on either CPI, PPI or the FERC indexes for those qualifying assets. For those regulated pipelines we typically adjust our rates in line with, for guidance. And most of those pipelines sought dated rates go into effect on July 1. While we don't really expect to see an in \u2013 we do expect to see an increase in revenue from those rate changes, but we don't expect to see a material change to the EBITDA given that these rate escalators are really meant to cover your increases in cost.  And then maybe just a reminder as well, that less than about one-third of the L&S EBITDA is directly tied to the FERC escalator which means that the majority of those are tied again to the fixed escalators or CPI or PPI. So hopefully that's helpful.\nTheresa Chen: Thank you.\nTim Aydt: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Danny for Neal Dingmann with Truist. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey guys, could you \u2013 going back to the return to capital question, can you speak to consideration of a supplemental distribution versus unit repurchases when created value for unit holders?\nJohn Quaid: Yeah. Morning, Danny, thanks for the question. So again, overall, we're in a maybe an envious position, given the cash we're generating cover in our capital plan, a $900 million in our base distribution of $3 billion so that gets us to kind of this fork in the road. Again, I think I want to push you back that we continue to kind of see an all of the above approach. Certainly being opportunistic about unit repurchases. I mean, the supplemental can be tax efficient, but again, as I said, we might look to maybe hold some cash to be a little bit more opportunistic with our return to capital as we continue to evaluate growth opportunities as well. So that's kind of the framework maybe a little bit bigger picture than your question, but hopefully that's helpful, Mike, I don't know if you want to add something as well.\nMike Hennigan: Yeah, I'm just going to add, we said this in the past, but I'll just remind everybody that it's interesting to us that different unit holders have different views on return on capital. Some feel very strongly that buying units back is the preferred way to go. And others feel just as strongly that send me a check. And our situation as we look at it, we try and optimize as John has said, and kind of having all of the above approach. It wasn't too long ago that our yield was trading at 20% in that environment. We're going to buy back units it's just compelling to do that.  And then there's other times where we're going to look at it and say the supplemental makes sense. And we're going to also look at the permanent one. So we've tried to differentiate a little bit between what we think is permanent growth in earnings as a result of our capital investments, et cetera, versus some of these cash flows that we're getting, we think are transitory in nature due to some of the current market conditions. And that's why we put those more in the supplemental. So I think John said it very well. Our approach is all of the above. I think that fits the full investor base that we have, because there's a lot of different views from different people and strong views too.  I would say people are very convicted that, some tell us very, very strongly that unit buybacks is the way to go and others tell us very, very strongly, please send me a check, that's the way I'd like to see return of capital. So our approach has been to look at market conditions, look at where we stand as far as our projections, evaluate our ability to invest capital, because we keep saying it's a return of and return on. So we look at both of those. And at the end of the day, we're trying to create as much value as we can in the earnings. And then we're trying to be as efficient as we can in when we're returning it hopeful. Hopefully that gives you a little bit more color.\nUnidentified Analyst: No, that's very helpful. Thank you. That's it for me.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question will come from Harry Mateer with Barclays. Your line is open.\nHarry Mateer: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Your first question, your leverage is tracking well below the target of four times. You've historically provided. So is that four times number still good to use? And how should we think about your willingness to use that capacity for like this incremental repurchase program and accelerated or would that not be something you'd like to do?\nMike Hennigan: Yeah, I'll let John comment, but one thing I do want to remind everybody is yeah, we are very comfortable that four times we've shown a lot of stability in these cash flows, but the reason we're at 3.5 times is basically because we've kept that flat and we've grown earnings. So as a result of that we've said this for a while that our leverage is going to decrease as a result. So one of the things that we will continue to monitor is as earnings grow, where is our leverage overall, we don't want to be under levered, but I think what you've seen over the last couple years is a change in that. We're going to manage the business such that we're going to generate free cash flow, invest capital in a more disciplined way, such that we're not adding to debt. So we've been kind of flat debt for a while. And that's why our leverage has been where it's been. John, do you want to add?\nJohn Quaid: No. Mike, I think you said it and just kind of refer back to some of my comments in the remarks as well. We've got some maturities coming our way and we're looking to refinance those. So I think just another kind of thing evident though in line with what Mike was just talking about.\nHarry Mateer: Okay. Thanks. And then that's a good segue. John, my follow-up, so you did comment about the senior maturities. Yeah. One question I've been feeling is just given how fluid the rates market has been. Curious how you're thinking about those preferreds, that reset to floating rate early next year, would seem to be pretty expensive capital with where rates are heading. So have you guys thought about where those fit in the capital structure longer-term?\nJohn Quaid: Without a doubt? No. And I definitely appreciate the question. That's certainly something that's been on our planning as well, as we're looking forward not just to these senior note maturities, but those Series Bs, you've kind of summarized it well, high cost and opportunity to look to manage those when they become callable in February of 2023.\nHarry Mateer: Okay. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. \nKristina Kazarian: All right, Sheila, if we don't have any other questions, thank you for joining us today and thanks for your interest in MPLX. If you have any questions that didn't get answered on the call today, our Investor Relations team is here to help any time. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "Tim Aydt",
            "content": "Yes, I'll take that one, Brian. This is Tim. So I think you're familiar with the fact that these pipelines are really critical to both MPLX and stable earnings as well as to MPC's operations. So as a result, both MPLX and MPC agreed to renew and actually extend the contract for another 10 years. And it's a pretty significant contract. But to your question, the contract terms were not changed other than extending the contract duration, which does certainly provide more certainty for an extended number of years on these very key systems. I guess, it'd be important to keep in mind that these specific logistics assets under contract with MPC are indeed fit for purpose and they're integral to the refining and marketing system. So not only does it make operational sense, but renewal with MPC certainly made financial sense for both parties. I think the last thing I would touch on is that while we're talking about this specific contract with MPC, we do have a lot of other systems and so forth. And so we continue to focus on maximizing the utilization of all of those systems including those that serve third parties as well. And maybe I would just, this is Tim. I would just add maybe a couple of things from the logistics standpoint. There are some provisions in the current version of it that does increase the 45Q tax credit. And that could be supportive of CCS projects, which we have an interest in. And then there's also some provisions for SAF and hydrogen production, which could drive some future logistics needs as well. If that was part of your question. So, but as John said, it's early, so we're going to continue to monitor it. Thank you, Brian. Sure. This is Tim. I will take that one. As we've mentioned before, we do believe in the strong growth of the Permian and believe that beyond even the announced expansions of the existing pipes, such as Whistler, that a couple of more pipes are going to be needed over the next five plus years. Matterhorn is the first of those which is why the partners FID the project in May as for our equity ownership in Matterhorn that's not been totally finalized yet, but it does currently stand at 5%. And so from a monetary standpoint, that would represent about $30 million of investment and then that of course would reflect some level of project financing. So that's relatively small stake here on Matterhorn. But that's \u2013 we put a lot of our commitments toward the Whistler side of the house and its expansion. So this is Tim again, and you're basically referring to some of the inflation protection. I would assume that we have so. So I'll attack that question in that regard. I would say that like others, we are certainly seeing some inflationary cost pressures across most all of our spend categories, quite frankly. And these increases are largely in line with the public indicators for material, equipment, labor and freight. We are seeing line pipe and energy cost that may be up a little more significantly. For example, our fuel and power is up about 15% year-on-year for our pipeline side of the house. The teams are certainly working hard to help offset these increases by completing more of the work in-house, maybe deferring some non-critical work and realizing operating efficiencies through the ideas of our workforce. I think if you're talking more on the capital side, much of our 2022 capital spend was contracted previously, so early in the year we didn't see as much impact on our capital spend, but we do expect that with increased cost you're going to see that later in the year. We still maintain our capital guidance of $700 million and intend to spend that and stay within budget. I would say that the increased costs for capital projects are probably going to show up more significantly in 2023, as we are starting to see a lot of rate sheet increases from contractors and other service providers. So hopefully that gives you a little flare to what we're seeing. Okay. Thanks, Steve. Yeah, I can \u2013 this is Tim. I can kick that off. And I think your questions really about the inflation protection and so forth that some of our contracts may have. So we do have some level of inflation protection in almost all of our L&S and G&P contracts. They range from some of the small fixed escalators up to the variable escalators that are based on either CPI, PPI or the FERC indexes for those qualifying assets. For those regulated pipelines we typically adjust our rates in line with, for guidance. And most of those pipelines sought dated rates go into effect on July 1.

And then maybe just a reminder as well, that less than about one-third of the L&S EBITDA is directly tied to the FERC escalator which means that the majority of those are tied again to the fixed escalators or CPI or PPI.

            "content": "Thanks Mike. Slide 5 outlines the second quarter operational and financial performance highlights for our Logistics and Storage segment. The L&S segment adjusted EBITDA increased $19 million when compared to second quarter of 2021 do primarily to higher throughputs. Pipeline volumes were up 6% and terminal volumes were up 4% year-over-year, driven largely by increased utilization at MPC's refineries. Moving on to our gathering and processing segment on Slide 6. G&P segment adjusted EBITDA increased $64 million compared to second quarter of 2021, largely due to higher NGL prices. For the quarter, NGL prices averaged $1.18 per gallon, which is $0.43 per gallon higher than the average from the second quarter of 2021. Gathered volumes were up 11% due to increased production in the Utica and Southwest offset slightly by a decrease in the Marcellus. Processing volumes were roughly flat as compared to the second quarter of 2021. Moving to Slide 7. Our second quarter financial results demonstrate the earnings and cash flow resiliency \u2013 excuse me, and stability of our business. For the quarter, total adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion was up 6% from the prior year, while distributed cash flow of $1.2 billion was flat compared to 2021, primarily due to one-time benefits experienced last year. Free cash flow after distributions increased to $614 million in the second quarter. This number does include approximately $65 million in asset sales proceeds, primarily from the sale of several light product terminals and a $266 million working capital benefit, which we anticipate may largely reverse in the third quarter. Project related expenses increased nearly $30 million in the quarter, and we anticipate an incremental $40 million increase from 2Q to 3Q in project related expenses. Looking at other financial highlights for the quarter, MPLX declared a second quarter distribution of $0.750 per unit resulting in distribution coverage ratio of 1.69 times. We ended the quarter with total debt of about $20 billion and a leverage ratio of 3.5 times. Looking forward over the next 12 months, we have roughly \u2013 we have $2 billion of senior note maturities, which subject to market conditions, we would expect to refinance into long-term debt. After quarter end, we entered into a new $2 billion five-year credit facility to replace the previously existing facility. The new credit facility extends to July of 2027. In closing, given current business conditions, our commitment to strict capital discipline and our continued adoption of a low cost culture, we expect to continue generating strong cash flow. Enhancing our financial flexibility to invest and grow the business while also supporting the return of capital to MPX unitholders. Now, let me turn the call back over to Kristina. Hey morning, John. Thanks for the question. First, I wouldn't read too much into \u2013 our activity in the second quarter and nothing about it should be viewed as a deviation from our capital allocation philosophy. You'll remember in the first quarter, our free cash flow after distributions was less than $100 million, we were coming into a year, forecasting higher capital spending and continuing to look at some growth opportunities. But looking forward, right, we ended this quarter with $300 million on the balance sheet and with our incremental $1 billion authorization, we now have total authorization of $1.2 billion for the repurchase of units. So I think if you look forward in the second half, we'd expect to be perhaps more dynamic and opportunistic as we look at unit repurchases. And of course, all done in line with SEC regs, which from time to time can limit our flexibility, but overall, I think we can continue to anticipate kind of in all of the above approach, certainly subject to cash flow growth opportunities and market conditions so in addition to unit repurchases, right, we'll reassess our base distribution as we did last year and certainly any change there would be subject to board approval. We have a supplemental as perhaps a tax efficient tool for capital return, but you might see us maybe holding some level of cash as we look to evaluate growth opportunities and really opportunistically look to return capital. So I think that's the big picture and I'll turn it back to Mike if he wants to add anything. So hopefully that's helpful. And hey, Brian, it's John, I just might add on to Tim's comments. One of the things that really was part of our thinking around this as well, was maybe some questions from investors on the commitment of MPC to MPLX and we think this renewal certainly is evidence of that commitment. And just as a reminder, too, I think Tim, might have mentioned as well, but these are all largely FERC index based systems. So their rates have been moving every year in line with the indices. Yeah. Morning, Danny, thanks for the question. So again, overall, we're in a maybe an envious position, given the cash we're generating cover in our capital plan, a $900 million in our base distribution of $3 billion so that gets us to kind of this fork in the road. Again, I think I want to push you back that we continue to kind of see an all of the above approach. Certainly being opportunistic about unit repurchases. I mean, the supplemental can be tax efficient, but again, as I said, we might look to maybe hold some cash to be a little bit more opportunistic with our return to capital as we continue to evaluate growth opportunities as well.

            "name": "Greg Floerke",
            "content": "John, this is Greg, I'll speak to that question. We've seen a period of load growth to even flat sort of maintenance drilling in the Northeast over the last particularly post-COVID demand destruction era and even a flat year-over-year number would be, would represent, quite a bit of drilling and new pads coming online to hold off that decline. We have continued to see that production come on, probably more of the early ramp has been focused in the crude areas because the crude pricing level is what drove more of the rig activity. So Permian, Bakken but we are now seeing starting to see that activity up ramp up. And we expect to see more of a back half of 2022 volume load versus early in the year. So some producers have continued to maintain a little bit of growth and some have continued to decline and not necessarily maintained. So that really is the primary explanation. Yes. Greg, again, as I had mentioned before, we do expect to see some ramp up in growth in the Northeast beyond what we've seen over the last 18 months. In terms of the new plant, the processing plants are really sort of specific to the gathering area and the producers, even within an area like the Marcellus. So we have some plants that have run close or at are very near capacity over the last 18 months. And some that aren't quite at that level overall, we're still at high utilization, but we do see the need over the next 12 to 18 months for more capacity in the specific area where we're building Harmon Creek plant."

            "name": "Mike Hennigan",
            "content": "Thanks Kristina. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call. Earlier today, we reported second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion. Our operating results this quarter represented 6% increase from the second quarter of last year. This performance highlights the continued resiliency of our base business, tailwinds from higher NGL prices, as well as the growth coming from recent capital investments. In late June, we've renewed several pipeline contracts with MPC. These pipeline systems are fit for purpose and integral to MPC's refining and marketing system. The renewal and extension of these contracts make economic and financial sense for both entities. Contracts now have extended terms to 2032 and have two automatic renewal provisions, which will allow for an additional 10 years of extensions, which could take them out to 2042. We continue to view the business as a return on as well as a return of capital business. And this quarter, we advance several organic growth projects. In the L&S segment, we continue to expand long haul natural gas and crude gathering pipeline supporting the growing Permian and Bakken regions. Specifically in the Permian, working with our partners, we continue to progress our natural gas strategy with the expansion of the Whistler pipeline from 2 bcf per day to 2.5 bcf per day, along with laterals into the Midland basin and Corpus Christi markets. In the G&P segment, we remain focused on the Permian and Marcellus basins in response to producer demand. In the Permian, construction advanced on our Tornado 2 processing plant, which is expected to come online in the second half of 2022. We are also planning to build our sixth processing plant in the basin, Preakness II, which is expected to be online in the first half of 2024. This will bring our total Permian processing capacity up to 1.2 bcf per day. In the Marcellus, our Smithburg de-ethanizer is expected to come online to meet incremental in-basin demand in the third quarter of 2022. Additionally, we plan to add the Harmon Creek II processing plant, which will expect to come online in the first half of 2024. This will bring total processing capacity up to 6.5 bcf per day in the Marcellus. Our capital allocation framework remains unchanged. In year-to-date, we have returned slightly over $1.6 billion to our unitholders through distributions and unit repurchases. Today is part of our long-term commitment to capital return. We announced an incremental $1 billion unit repurchased authorization. And with the strength and stability of the business, we will evaluate an increase to our base distribution later in the year. Shifting to Slide 4, this quarter, we continue to enhance our ESG commitments and disclosures with the recent publication of both our annual sustainability and perspectives on climate related scenarios report. We continue to make progress on our 2030 targets to reduce methane emissions intensity 75% from 2016 levels. Through last year, we've achieved a 47 \u2013 I'm sorry, 46% reduction, further enhancing the lower carbon profile of our natural gas business. We've also added a biodiversity target to develop sustainable landscapes across 50% of our MPL compatible right-of-ways are about 10,000 acres by the end of 2025. Through the end of last year, we've already achieved nearly 10% of this target. We're challenging ourselves to lead in sustainable energy by meeting the needs of today while investing in an energy diverse future that creates shared value for all of our stakeholders. Now let me turn the call over to John to discuss our operational and financial results for the quarter. Yes, John, thanks for your comment. I'm going to let John take that one. I think you covered it well. Thanks John. And Michael, this is Mike. I'll just add that. So what Greg has said, it's been a constrained area for a while. And our anticipation as MVP will get done. The shell plan is going to come up. As you pointed out, we're going to build another processing plan. So I think we're finally going to start to see a little bit more growth in the area that's been somewhat constrained for a little bit, as Greg just mentioned. Yes, Michael, we get that question often at the MPC call. Our quick answer is our situation is a lot different than many of the others that you've seen, roll it up. So we're pretty comfortable in the structure that we have today. We still think it's good for the marathon family. It works for both, as we just talked about in our prepared remarks, we just, re-upped another 10 years of asset use between the two entities. So we're pretty comfortable with where we stand and we think it's a good structure for us. You're welcome. And Brian, you speaking to the inflation reduction act or a different legislation, I thought I heard you refer to a different legislation. I just want to make sure... So obviously, pretty long bill, the details were just released and we continue to evaluate it. I think a couple of key points for MPLX. One, you see some focus around methane emission and I would say, and we've kind of talked about it on the call. Mike commented on some in his prepared remarks. We've been working very hard to reduce those emissions. We feel like right now with the current draft, we don't see a significant impact to our overall system. Really a benefit of the work we've done to-date to reduce those emissions. There may be some opportunities around renewables, but I think we're encouraged, but we need to see kind of how that all flows through the final legislation. Yeah. Theresa its Mike thank you for your comment first. The demand question is obviously one that we continue to monitor, and I guess at the end of the day, we're still pretty bullish of what we're seeing across the commodities. It was interesting give you more detail than you probably wanted, 4th of July weekend, which is typically a stronger weekend was not that strong in our system, but then subsequent to that the rest of July really picked up again. So I think the reason we're still constructive is overall, we're still mostly at pre-pandemic levels across the system. So we think there's still room to run on the demand side. It's been choppy. Like I said, if we went and went into the season with Memorial Day weekend 4th of July, the bigger weekends that typically show some robust numbers, we didn't really see those, but then the other times during the month, we've seen some strong recovery. So I think at the end of the day, we're still pretty constructive. Overall we think demand has more to go once we get back to a normal post-pandemic environment. Inventories are still constructive, as you mentioned, our whole thought process on the refining side of the house in the second quarter was run as reliably as we could in the margin environment, produce as much transportation fuel as possible. And really obviously continue to show the market that we're running a low cost system. So low cost, strong reliability and we'll take what the market offers as far as margins. And right now it's hard not to still be constructive. Demand is looking good. Inventories are low it's still a pretty constructive environment for us. Yeah, I'm just going to add, we said this in the past, but I'll just remind everybody that it's interesting to us that different unit holders have different views on return on capital. Some feel very strongly that buying units back is the preferred way to go. And others feel just as strongly that send me a check. And our situation as we look at it, we try and optimize as John has said, and kind of having all of the above approach. It wasn't too long ago that our yield was trading at 20% in that environment.

And then we're trying to be as efficient as we can in when we're returning it hopeful. Hopefully that gives you a little bit more color. Yeah, I'll let John comment, but one thing I do want to remind everybody is yeah, we are very comfortable that four times we've shown a lot of stability in these cash flows, but the reason we're at 3.5 times is basically because we've kept that flat and we've grown earnings.

With that, I'll turn it over to Mike.\nMike Hennigan: Thanks, Kristina. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our call. Earlier today, we reported first quarter results, which continues to demonstrate the cash flow resiliency and stability of our business. We delivered adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 billion, which was up 3% from the prior year, and we returned over $850 million of capital to unitholders through distributions and unit repurchases. Our logistics and storage business benefited from the recovery in consumer demand and our gathering and processing business benefited from higher NGL prices. This quarter, we also advanced several organic growth projects. In L&S, we progressed crude gathering projects in the Permian and Bakken as well as a number of smaller expansion and debottlenecking projects. We are investing in our Permian natural gas and NGL takeaway systems, including yesterday's announced expansion of the Whistler pipeline to 2.5 billion cubic feet per day driven by growing demand from producers. In G&P, our growth capital focus is largely on projects in the Permian, Marcellus and Bakken basins. In the Permian, our fourth processing plant is ramping up to full capacity and we're progressing construction of a fifth processing plant, which will take our total capacity in the basin to 1 million cubic feet per day. With higher commodity prices, we are seeing a pickup in producer activity across our focus basins, we will maintain strict capital discipline as we assess these inbounds. Let me also highlight several pipeline contracts that we have with MPC, which are coming up for renewal. Because these pipeline systems are so critical to both MPLX's stable earnings and cash flows in MPC's operations, we are in the process of finalizing agreements to renew and extend them for 10 years and we'll finish papering them up in the next several weeks, well ahead of their scheduled year-end expiration. We believe renewal of our contracts with MPC makes economic and financial sense for both entities. Our logistics assets under contract with MPC are fit for purpose and integral to its refining and marketing system. We also remain focused on maximizing the utilization of all of our logistics assets through business with MPC and third parties. Shifting to Slide 4, we remain focused on leading in sustainable energy by lowering the carbon intensity of our operations and products, improving energy efficiency and conserving natural resources. Through last year-end, MPLX achieved an approximately 45% reduction in its methane emissions intensity across our natural gas gathering and processing operations. As a result of our progress, in February, we expanded our goals with a new 2030 target to reduce methane emissions intensity by 75%. We are also participating in a project led by Cheniere Energy to further the deployment of advanced monitoring technologies and protocols to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across the midstream sector. As the energy industry evolves, we're working to continuously improve our environmental performance while meeting society's energy needs, focusing on sustainability and positioning ourselves to continue to deliver positive results in an energy diverse future. Now let me turn the call over to John to discuss our operational and financial results for the quarter.\nJohn Quaid: Thanks, Mike. Slide 5 outlines the first quarter operational and financial performance highlights for our Logistics & Storage segment. L&S segment adjusted EBITDA increased $8 million when comparing first quarter 2022 to first quarter 2021. Pipeline volumes were up 4% and terminal volumes were up 13% year-over-year. The benefits of these higher throughputs were largely offset by environmental costs incurred in the quarter. Moving on to our Gathering and Processing segment on Slide 6. G&P segment adjusted EBITDA increased $33 million compared to first quarter 2021, largely due to higher NGL prices. For the quarter, NGL prices averaged $1.15 per gallon, which is $0.42 per gallon higher than the average in the first quarter of 2021. Overall, gathered volumes were up 4% as compared to first quarter of 2021 while processing and fractionation volumes were down 1% and 6%, respectively. Focusing on our largest region, the Marcellus, gathered volumes were up 1%, while processing and fractionation volumes decreased 3% and 4%, respectively. In the Marcellus, the changes in processing and fractionation volumes were primarily due to the timing of new production. And looking at the other areas, we saw growth in processing volumes in the Southwest as we've added capacity in the Permian. Moving to Slide 7. Our first quarter financial results demonstrate the earnings and cash flow resiliency and stability of our business. For the quarter, total adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 billion was up 3% from the prior year and distributable cash flow of $1.2 billion was up over 6% from the prior year. As a reminder, while we strive for stable and growing financial results, our operating expenses can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter depending on the timing of various regulatory, maintenance and other project-related work. As we look forward in 2022, these project-related expenses could be as much as $50 million higher for each of the remaining quarters of the year as compared to the first quarter, as we complete this work over the balance of the year. Looking at other financial highlights for the quarter. MPLX declared a first quarter distribution of $0.7050 per unit, resulting in a distribution coverage ratio of 1.65x for the first quarter. In early March, we issued $1.5 billion of 30-year senior notes, and proceeds from this offering were primarily used to repay amounts borrowed under our intercompany loan with MPC. We ended the quarter with total debt of around $20 billion and a leverage ratio of 3.7x. In closing, given current business conditions, our commitment to strict capital discipline and our continued adoption of a low-cost culture, we expect to continue generating strong cash flows, enhancing our financial flexibility to invest and grow the business, while also supporting the return of capital to MPLX unitholders. Now let me turn the call back over to Kristina.\nKristina Kazarian: Thanks, John. [Operator Instructions] With that, Elan we're ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from John McKay from Goldman Sachs.\nJohn Mackay : Why don't we start on the -- and it's nice to hear you on the call, Mike. Why don\u2019t we start on the recontracting, I think it makes sense, we're on the 10-year anniversary of the IPO. Can you maybe just share a little bit more on maybe what some of the puts and takes you guys are looking at? How those contracts work now? And are we talking about kind of the whole portfolio or just an initial set of pipes, so things like the fuels distribution might not be being looked at yet?\nJohn Quaid: John, it's John. Let me start with that and then Mike can add on if he has any additional comments. So in Mike's prepared remarks, what we're really referring to there are the pipeline contracts, right, that would have been part of the initial IPO. So in 2012, here we are in 2022, end of this year those contracts were set to expire. And really based on maybe feedback from investors, there were questions on whether or not we were going to renew these. And again, we've continued to say these are integral assets fit for purpose for MPC. So the parties really kind of discussed this a little bit earlier in the process. That contract would have had two 5-year automatic renewals. We're going ahead and renewing it for 10. So that's how we've handled the pipeline contract. We'll look to future contracts as we move forward. Again, I think you would have heard Mike in his prepared remarks that we think renewing these contracts is beneficial economically and financially for both entities. So Mike, anything you want to add?\nMike Hennigan: Yes, John, it's Mike. I often ask people, is there anything we're doing that we shouldn't be? Or is there anything we're not doing that we should be? And to our surprise, we kept getting some questions around contracts with MPC. Now as I said in my prepared remarks, it makes financial and economic sense for both entities. So MPC is going to use MPLX assets. It's a given. So we were surprised that people were concerned about that. So our normal cadence, as John just said, would have been when they come up. But since people have asked us about it, we said, \u201cOkay, since it\u2019s a question in people\u2019s mind, we\u2019ll take that question off the table.\u201d MPC and MPLX are going to continue to do business, it\u2019s integral to both entities and it\u2019s a win-win for both entities.\nJohn Mackay : I\u2019ll ask my follow-up, and I am sure I'll ask them on the buybacks. So maybe I'll do something kind of more on the macro. So it's obviously -- it's a pretty strong backdrop for refining, but at least in the second quarter, we've seen product exports pick up pretty hard. And you guys have talked in the past about actually having lower product exports is better for the MPLX L&S portfolio. So I'm wondering if you can just spend a little bit of time on kind of talking about what the refining macro should mean for L&S kind of through the balance of the year.\nTim Aydt: John, this is Tim Aydt. I'll take that question. First off, we do see demand for refined products remaining very strong. We expect as well that refiners are going to continue to have high utilization rates, and they're going to try to meet those market needs that are out there today. Our pipeline utilization remains very high, and our terminal volumes are actually in record territory. And I think you've kind of noticed from the past that we have some pretty strong MVCs. So our contract structures are pretty solid. And as a result, we don't really have a lot of, I'd say, it's a muted sensitivity to changes in refinery utilization. So I think that's a little bit on maybe the backdrop. If you talk about maybe the exports a bit. We have a large portfolio of assets, and that includes docs in several locations that support these exports. It could be Garyville, it could be Mount Airy, it could be the Galveston Bay docks, et cetera. And in general, we don't really expect major swings within L&S revenue based on shifting product patterns. We have a very flexible system that can swing to the pipe in the U.S. Gulf Coast or it can swing to the water, as needed. And again, the MVCs back up several little systems. I think if you look at the crude side, we're similarly well positioned, I would say, to participate on the crude exports. We have the South Texas Gateway, and we have our loop ownership interest and both of those have those capabilities. So hopefully, that's helpful.\nMike Hennigan: John, it's Mike. I just -- I don't know if you were looking at the first quarter results, but if you weren't aware, MPC had 2 outages on the Gulf Coast that impacted our business. One was the Texas City power outage, the entire city took out our Galveston Bay facility and the other was an unplanned outage at Garyville. So if you're looking at those quarterly results, I just wanted to point that out as well.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan.\nJeremy Tonet : I just wanted to touch base on processing needs across your footprint, particularly I guess, in Appalachia and the Permian. Appalachia, I'm curious with incremental NGL egress with Mariner East online with the shell cracker coming, do you see more of a move towards the liquids-rich production there? And how could that impact your processing? And similarly, in the Permian, we see tightness in processing there and just wondering, what type of opportunities that might breath for MPLX?\nMike Hennigan: Greg, do you want to take that one?\nGreg Floerke: Sure. Thanks, Mike. Jeremy, yes, to address the question, starting with Appalachia, we \u2013 so the Monaca plant is something we\u2019ve been anticipating and are excited about. We are in the process of building our -- the latest -- our de-ethanizer fleet in that Smithburg in West Virginia, which has coincided early third quarter to come online along with that cracker, but that will increase our ethane production capacity over 300,000 barrels a day.  And if you combine the 4 pipelines, the takeaway ethane out of the basin, along with Monaca, the recently completed expansion of Mariner 2 and Mariner 2X, which frees up more ethane capacity and the ongoing increase in prices for ethane, I think there is an opportunity for producers to recover more ethane in the basin.  In terms of overall activity, I think it's been publicly announced by a number of our larger producers that they are still in maintenance to low single-digit growth mode. So in terms of liquid production for propane and heavier products, we expect that to stay pretty stable. The takeaway lines are fairly well in balance. Switching to the Permian, obviously, a big growth area for us right now, completing our fifth plant later this year and in the process of continuing to ramp up, utilization into our fourth plant, Preakness, which was put in service late last year. So I think that they're \u2013 it\u2019s going to continue, obviously, with crude prices being where they are, and gas prices, there's going to be continued growth in that area, we would expect, tied to takeaway volume. Tim, you may want to add on the downstream part of the Permian. Hopefully, that answers your question, Jeremy.\nTim Aydt: Yes. Jeremy, I would just add that when you look at the Permian, there's a lot of forecasts out there that are predicting up to 6 Bcf a day of increased demand by 2028. And that's going to obviously be a big pull on the -- not only the processing, but also the pipeline takeaway capacity. So I think you're starting to see that as it moves. The LNG markets are growing. I think you're going to continue to see investments needed across the midstream in that regard.\nJeremy Tonet : Got it. And then just pivoting back towards the contract renewals as you wait out there. Just wondering, how would you say the market today compares to the market when those contracts were first signed? Just wondering if you'd say the market is better or worse than when those rates were first struck.\nJohn Quaid: Jeremy, it's John again. Remember, these are pipeline contracts. A lot of them are going to have base rates or other rates that have been moving, frankly, year-to-year. So maybe a little bit different if you're thinking of our marine contract, which we renewed about a year ago. That would have had a completely different structure than what\u2019s in these pipeline contracts.\nJeremy Tonet : Got it. So is it fair to assume no real change in the rates of material size? Is that the right way to think about it?\nJohn Quaid: Well, yes, as I was saying, the rates have already been changing every year based on other factors. So we're really just looking to kind of maintain the terms and lock in a term that we already planned on renewing, so.\nMike Hennigan: Let me just add that most of them are indexed just like many pipelines are. So as John mentioned, it can be indexed to FERC or something else. So over time, there's a changing, but it's still a very market-related rate.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brian Reynolds from UBS.\nBrian Reynolds: And Mike, it's good to hear you on the call as well. For my first question, I wanted to dig into the capital allocation framework as it relates to MPLX's return of capital strategy. It appears there's roughly $200 million or a little more left on the share buyback authorization. And I was curious, if you could share some thoughts around future return of capital, including potential reauthorization of the buyback program or a potential special distribution, similar to what we saw in 3Q of last year.\nJohn Quaid: Brian, it's John. I'll maybe start with that one, and then Mike can add on some comments. So again, our kind of framework that we've talked about before remains, right? We're going to look to maintain a strong balance sheet. We're going to look to invest for the safety and security of our assets at our employees. We're going to secure our distribution. We're going to look at growth capital, where can we grow the business. And then as we look at capital that's left over, then we get to a point of how do we think about returning that either via distributions, whether that be base or perhaps a supplemental distribution or unit repurchases. If you look at this quarter, right, we've said -- we said, \u201chey, we're going to look at the cash flow we're generating each quarter\u201d. This quarter we had about, as Mike said, $850 million of free cash flow. Our base distribution was $758 million and we did a $100 million of unit repurchases. So effectively, have looked at where we were there.  Now one of the things we said last quarter, which I just want to reiterate this quarter as well, I\u2019m not sure you can look at the programmatic unit repurchases we did last year and assume that's what we're going to do this year. I think we're looking at how we think about creating value for all unitholders. And I think as part of that, right, a supplemental distribution is certainly a tool for us as we think of return to capital.\nBrian Reynolds: Great. I appreciate all the color. Maybe as just a follow-up on some of the growth project questions as we start to look at 2023 and beyond. You alluded to finishing up your fifth processing plant in the Permian at year end. Maybe could you talk about the potential for your further growth projects, will that include a BANGL pipeline expansion? And when could we see that? And then what are your thoughts around participation in the new greenfield natural gas pipeline out of the Permian post the reannounced Whistler expansion as well?\nJohn Quaid: Yes. I'll take that one, Brian. So obviously, you're right. We did announce yesterday the expansion of the Whistler pipeline to 2.5 Bcf. We obviously, as I just mentioned earlier, there's a lot more growth anticipated on the natural gas side beyond what the Whistler expansion would do and some of the other expansions that are that are being announced. I would say that most forecasts call for a second Permian gas pipeline to be required by the end -- by 2025 and a second one by 2028. So certainly, there's opportunities there to continue to look for incremental investments, we\u2019ve been very public about the facts that we\u2019re going to continue to look at the extension into the natural gas and NGL value chain. As for BANGL, obviously, we continue to monitor that. We did announce in January, we brought on another partner in that in the form of Rattler Midstream. And so with that comes additional dedicated acreage, et cetera. So I think that over the course of time, you're going to continue to see NGL volumes grow. And with that, we have various cost-effective expansions we can put in place.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question is from Keith Stanley from Wolfe Research.\nKeith Stanley : First, I wanted to ask on the Whistler expansion. So I think the initial project was fully contract under 10 year terms. Should we expect a similar approach here and then just any thoughts you can give on how to think about the tariff for an expansion and how that might compare to how you would look at a new build overall?\nTim Aydt: So Keith, this is Tim. I'll start that. I might not be able to answer all your questions specifically. But again, as we did announce yesterday, we are expanding that. I think maybe a few things on the way of background in case others have questions. I mentioned in the first quarter that we were evaluating that. Obviously, we concluded that evaluation. And I think one of the things that's important is that the system was originally designed and permitted with potential expansion in mind. So it is very capital efficient. It does not require new rights of way or any redesign. From a status standpoint, our compressors are on order. We anticipate the expansion is going to be in service in September of 2023. As for the contract terms and potentially -- we were not able to really talk about [contracts], but I would provide some maybe assistance with that. And I would just characterize those as long-term take-or-pay and they're fee-based, which means they're very rateable cash flows for the JV. So again, being an expansion, it is capital efficient and lower risk. So it's a strong investment, but I'll probably just leave it there.\nKeith Stanley : Okay. Great. And then second one, I just wanted to follow up on volumes in the quarter. So your G&P volumes were down a little bit versus the fourth quarter kind of across the regions. And I feel like we've heard some consistent commentary from others today, especially in Appalachia. But just how are you thinking about volumes over the balance of the year in G&P, both Appalachia and then Southwest also looked like it was down a little bit even with Preakness presumably ramping up a little?\nMike Hennigan: Greg, do you want to take that?\nGreg Floerke: Sure. Keith, yes, starting with Appalachia, the Utica has continued as far as process volume continues to decline as focus has been on some of the dry lean gas in that area. So generally, the gathering in the Utica swings up and down. It's most affected by some of the new dry lean wells that come on and the timing of those pads. We did have some weather-related impact on our processing gathered volumes, which also affects fractionation in Marcellus. Most of that in early February related to Ice and Power and freeze offs, which drove most of the Marcellus impact. Yes. And if you go to the West and focus on that, yes, we have continued to have growth in the Permian Delaware, but we also do have some other areas that were either impacted by weather or by timing of pads coming online. The Bakken, for example, has had -- continues to have weather issues as well as the Rockies. But I think the key point is that weather does impact us a lot in the first quarter. The other thing that you'll see is that most of -- even on a maintenance level drilling program for the full year, that doesn't necessarily mean flat levels quarter-to-quarter and a lot of the production because of weather and construction and drilling schedules tends to be more back-end loaded. So there will be some more natural decline just due to pad, the timing of new pads coming online measured against just the ongoing decline of existing wells.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Blum from Wells Fargo.\nMichael Blum: Just really one, commodity prices are obviously very high right now. We've seen some M&A transactions in the G&P space over the last few months. Just curious, any updates on your long-term initiatives to divest some of your noncore assets? Are you seeing any changes in the market?\nMike Hennigan: Yes, Michael, it's Mike. We don't really have anything new to report there. We had mentioned a while back that we wanted to change our portfolio a little bit, but the market was not at the same place we were. Since that time, we're now looking at currently $8 gas. And I said a couple of times on calls, our basins are generating free cash flow. So even though some of them are not going to get a lot of capital in the future because they're not long-term strategic, in the meantime, though, they're generating free cash. So we're still steadfast in what we believe is the right valuation for the assets. And if others met it then something could happen. But right now, we don't have anything going in that regard at all.\nOperator: And I am showing no further questions at this time.\nKristina Kazarian: All right. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. If you have any questions that were not answered during the call today, please feel free to reach out afterwards. We're here to help out at any time. Operator, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.",

We are in the process of building our -- the latest -- our de-ethanizer fleet in that Smithburg in West Virginia, which has coincided early third quarter to come online along with that cracker, but that will increase our ethane production capacity over 300,000 barrels a day.  And if you combine the 4 pipelines, the takeaway ethane out of the basin, along with Monaca, the recently completed expansion of Mariner 2 and Mariner 2X, which frees up more ethane capacity and the ongoing increase in prices for ethane, I think there is an opportunity for producers to recover more ethane in the basin.  In terms of overall activity, I think it's been publicly announced by a number of our larger producers that they are still in maintenance to low single-digit growth mode. So in terms of liquid production for propane and heavier products, we expect that to stay pretty stable. The takeaway lines are fairly well in balance. Switching to the Permian, obviously, a big growth area for us right now, completing our fifth plant later this year and in the process of continuing to ramp up, utilization into our fourth plant, Preakness, which was put in service late last year. So I think that they're \u2013 it's going to continue, obviously, with crude prices being where they are, and gas prices, there's going to be continued growth in that area, we would expect, tied to takeaway volume. Tim, you may want to add on the downstream part of the Permian. Hopefully, that answers your question, Jeremy. Sure. Keith, yes, starting with Appalachia, the Utica has continued as far as process volume continues to decline as focus has been on some of the dry lean gas in that area. So generally, the gathering in the Utica swings up and down. It's most affected by some of the new dry lean wells that come on and the timing of those pads. We did have some weather-related impact on our processing gathered volumes, which also affects fractionation in Marcellus. Most of that in early February related to Ice and Power and freeze offs, which drove most of the Marcellus impact. Yes. And if you go to the West and focus on that, yes, we have continued to have growth in the Permian Delaware, but we also do have some other areas that were either impacted by weather or by timing of pads coming online. The Bakken, for example, has had -- continues to have weather issues as well as the Rockies. But I think the key point is that weather does impact us a lot in the first quarter. The other thing that you'll see is that most of -- even on a maintenance level drilling program for the full year, that doesn't necessarily mean flat levels quarter-to-quarter and a lot of the production because of weather and construction and drilling schedules tends to be more back-end loaded. So there will be some more natural decline just due to pad, the timing of new pads coming online measured against just the ongoing decline of existing wells."

            "content": "Thanks, Kristina. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our call. Earlier today, we reported first quarter results, which continues to demonstrate the cash flow resiliency and stability of our business. We delivered adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 billion, which was up 3% from the prior year, and we returned over $850 million of capital to unitholders through distributions and unit repurchases. Our logistics and storage business benefited from the recovery in consumer demand and our gathering and processing business benefited from higher NGL prices. This quarter, we also advanced several organic growth projects. In L&S, we progressed crude gathering projects in the Permian and Bakken as well as a number of smaller expansion and debottlenecking projects. We are investing in our Permian natural gas and NGL takeaway systems, including yesterday's announced expansion of the Whistler pipeline to 2.5 billion cubic feet per day driven by growing demand from producers. In G&P, our growth capital focus is largely on projects in the Permian, Marcellus and Bakken basins. In the Permian, our fourth processing plant is ramping up to full capacity and we're progressing construction of a fifth processing plant, which will take our total capacity in the basin to 1 million cubic feet per day. With higher commodity prices, we are seeing a pickup in producer activity across our focus basins, we will maintain strict capital discipline as we assess these inbounds. Let me also highlight several pipeline contracts that we have with MPC, which are coming up for renewal. Because these pipeline systems are so critical to both MPLX's stable earnings and cash flows in MPC's operations, we are in the process of finalizing agreements to renew and extend them for 10 years and we'll finish papering them up in the next several weeks, well ahead of their scheduled year-end expiration. We believe renewal of our contracts with MPC makes economic and financial sense for both entities. Our logistics assets under contract with MPC are fit for purpose and integral to its refining and marketing system. We also remain focused on maximizing the utilization of all of our logistics assets through business with MPC and third parties. Shifting to Slide 4, we remain focused on leading in sustainable energy by lowering the carbon intensity of our operations and products, improving energy efficiency and conserving natural resources. Through last year-end, MPLX achieved an approximately 45% reduction in its methane emissions intensity across our natural gas gathering and processing operations. As a result of our progress, in February, we expanded our goals with a new 2030 target to reduce methane emissions intensity by 75%. We are also participating in a project led by Cheniere Energy to further the deployment of advanced monitoring technologies and protocols to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across the midstream sector. As the energy industry evolves, we're working to continuously improve our environmental performance while meeting society's energy needs, focusing on sustainability and positioning ourselves to continue to deliver positive results in an energy diverse future. Now let me turn the call over to John to discuss our operational and financial results for the quarter. Yes, John, it's Mike. I often ask people, is there anything we're doing that we shouldn't be? Or is there anything we're not doing that we should be? And to our surprise, we kept getting some questions around contracts with MPC. Now as I said in my prepared remarks, it makes financial and economic sense for both entities. So MPC is going to use MPLX assets. It's a given. So we were surprised that people were concerned about that. So our normal cadence, as John just said, would have been when they come up. But since people have asked us about it, we said, \u201cOkay, since it's a question in people's mind, we'll take that question off the table.\u201d MPC and MPLX are going to continue to do business, it's integral to both entities and it's a win-win for both entities. John, it's Mike. I just -- I don't know if you were looking at the first quarter results, but if you weren't aware, MPC had 2 outages on the Gulf Coast that impacted our business. One was the Texas City power outage, the entire city took out our Galveston Bay facility and the other was an unplanned outage at Garyville. So if you're looking at those quarterly results, I just wanted to point that out as well. Greg, do you want to take that one? Let me just add that most of them are indexed just like many pipelines are. So as John mentioned, it can be indexed to FERC or something else. So over time, there's a changing, but it's still a very market-related rate. Greg, do you want to take that? Yes, Michael, it's Mike. We don't really have anything new to report there. We had mentioned a while back that we wanted to change our portfolio a little bit, but the market was not at the same place we were. Since that time, we're now looking at currently $8 gas. And I said a couple of times on calls, our basins are generating free cash flow. So even though some of them are not going to get a lot of capital in the future because they're not long-term strategic, in the meantime, though, they're generating free cash. So we're still steadfast in what we believe is the right valuation for the assets. And if others met it then something could happen. But right now, we don't have anything going in that regard at all."

At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.\nKristina Kazarian: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to MPLX's fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at mplx.com, under the Investor tab. Joining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan, Chairman and CEO; Kris Hagedorn, CFO. Also with us is John Quaid, as our CFOs transition into their new roles and other members of the executive team. We invite you to read the safe harbor statements and non-GAAP disclaimer on Slide 2. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the call and during the question-and-answer session that follows. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there, as well as in our filings with the SEC. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Hennigan: Thanks, Kristina. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call. I'd like to acknowledge Kris Hagedorn, MPLX's new CFO joining our call. We look forward to Kris' financial leadership having served in various roles in the midstream sector, previously being the Controller of MPLX and most recently, Controller of MPC. 2023 was a strong year as we successfully executed our strategic priorities. Full year adjusted EBITDA was $6.3 billion. Distributable cash flow was $5.3 billion and adjusted free cash flow was $4.1 billion. Our results reflect the continued growth of the partnership and its cash flows in our L&S segment, strong operational performance and customer demand drove record pipeline throughput, and strong growth in terminal throughput demonstrating the value of our relationship with MPC. In our G&P segment, we saw record throughput in our gathering, processing and fractionation operations driven mainly by our assets in the Marcellus and Permian basins. Our focus on cost management, strong operational performance and growth from recent capital investments resulted in adjusted EBITDA growth of nearly 9%, and DCF growth of over 7% for the year. In line with our commitment to return capital, the growth of MPLX's cash flow supported the return of $3.3 billion to unit holders through distributions. We've increased our quarterly distribution 10% each of the last two years, which now stands at $3.40 per unit on an annualized basis, and we still have strong distribution coverage of 1.6x. Turning to the macro, the United States continues to be a low cost producer of energy fuels needed across the globe. Our expectations on the long-term production outlook in our key basins are unchanged. We expect strong demand for hydrocarbons will support growth across our asset footprint. In our largest basin the Marcellus, the cost to develop is at the low end of the cost curve and below current commodity prices. In the fourth quarter, process utilization reached 96%, and we expect producer drilling activity to support continued volume growth in the Marcellus. We've seen similar growth rates in the Utica, where processing utilization increase 10% year-over-year. Both basins are seeing wells with longer laterals, which are resulting in higher volumes, highlighting the strength and opportunities we see in our Northeast footprint. In the Permian Basin, crew prices remain attractive and associated gas production continues to grow as producers execute drilling and completion activities. As part of our Permian growth strategy, we acquired the remaining interest of a gathering and processing joint venture in the Delaware Basin for approximately $270 million at an attractive multiple. This acquisition illustrates our ability to grow the cash flow of the partnership through the lens of strict capital discipline. We're confident in our ability to grow the partnership and are focused on executing the strategic priorities of strict capital discipline, fostering a low-cost culture, and optimizing our asset portfolio, all of which are foundational to the growth of MPLX's cash flows. Turning to our capital plan. Today, we announced a capital expenditure outlook of $1.1 billion for 2024. Our plan includes $950 million of growth capital and $150 million of maintenance capital. We remain committed to capital discipline and our 2024 growth capital outlook is anchored in the Marcellus and Permian basins. Our integrative footprints in these basins have positioned the partnership with a steady source of opportunities to expand our value chains, particularly around natural gas and NGL assets. We plan to continue growing these operations through organic projects, investment in our Permian joint ventures, and bold on opportunities. In the L&S segment, construction is progressing on the Whistler, Agua Dulce to Corpus Christi or ADCC natural gas pipeline, which is expected to be in service in the third quarter of 2024. We're also progressing the expansion of the BANGL joint venture NGL pipeline to approximately 200,000 barrels per day, which is expected to be completed in the first half of 2025. These projects are largely financed at the JV level. Therefore, our portion of the JV finance capital spending is not reflected in our capital outlook. In G&P segment, we're bringing new gas processing plans online to meet increasing customer demand. In the Marcellus Basin, we advance construction of the Harmon Creek II gas processing plan, which is expected to be online at the end of the first quarter. Similarly, in the Permian Basin, we progress construction of Preakness II, which is expected to be online early in the second quarter. Additionally, we are building our seventh gas processing plant in the basin secretariat, which is expected to be online in the second half of 2025. Once operational, our total processing capacity in the Delaware Basin will be approximately 1.4 billion cubic feet per day. Outside of these strategic basins, the remainder of our capital plan is mostly comprised of smaller high return investments, targeted at expansion or the bottlenecking of existing assets and projects related to expected increased producer activity. While our capital outlook is primarily focused on our L&S and G&P footprint, we will evaluate low carbon opportunities to leverage technologies that are complimentary with our asset footprint to create a competitive advantage. Moving to capital allocation, we're optimistic about our opportunities in 2024. First, maintenance capital. We are steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees, and support the communities we operate in. Second, we're focused on delivering a secure distribution and expect this will remain our primary return of capital tool. Third, we'll invest to grow the business. This is both a return-on and a return-off capital business. As we look at 2024, our priority is to invest to grow the business at superior returns. After these priorities, we'll assess the opportunistic return of capital to unit holders. Recent industry consolidation has not changed our perspectives on the structure of MPLX. MPLX is a strategic investment for MPC, and MPC does not plan the role of the partnership. Now let me turn the call over to Kris to discuss our operational and financial results for the quarter.\nKris Hagedorn: Thanks, Mike. Slide 7 outlines the fourth quarter operational and financial performance highlights for our logistics and storage segment. The L&S segment reported its fourth consecutive quarter of $1 billion adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA increased $110 million when compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily driven by higher rates and throughputs, including growth from equity affiliates. Proof pipeline volumes were up 4%, primarily because of refinery maintenance schedules in the prior year, product pipeline volumes and terminal volumes were flat. Moving to our gathering and processing segment on Slide 8. The G&P segment adjusted EBITDA increased $59 million compared to fourth quarter 2022. This was driven by higher gathering and processing volumes. Total gathered volumes were up 1% year-over-year, primarily due to increased production in the Marcellus in the Southwest. Processing volumes were up 9% year-over-year, primarily from higher volumes in the Marcellus and the Utica driven by increased customer demand. Focusing in on the Marcellus, by far our largest basin of G&P operations, we saw year-over-year volume increases of 10% for gathering, and 9% for processing, driven by increased drilling and production growth. Marcellus' processing utilization reached 96% in the fourth quarter. Illustrating the need for our Harmon Creek II facility, fractionation volumes grew 1% due to higher processed volumes, which were offset by lower Ethan recoveries. Moving to our fourth quarter financial highlights on Slide 9, total adjusted EBITDA of $1.6 billion and distributable cash flow of $1.4 billion increased 12% and 9% respectively from prior year. Turning to our balance sheet on Slide 10. Growth of our cash flows has continued to reduce MPLX leverage, which now stands at 3.3x. We believe the stability of our cash flows supports leverage in the range of 4x. And while MPLX has just over $1 billion of notes maturing later this year, we currently do not expect to structurally lower our debt. When evaluating the short-term maturity, we'll consider all opportunities available to us to optimize our cost of debt. MPLX's strong balance sheet, including a year-end cash balance of $1 billion, plus the ability to utilize the intercompany facility within MPC provides us with financial flexibility to invest in the business and optimize capital allocation. Now let me hand it back to Mike for some final thoughts.\nMike Hennigan : Thanks, Kris. In closing, MPLX is a strong history of growing the partnerships cash flows by executing strategic priorities, all while maintaining strict capital discipline. We continue to aim for mid-single-digit growth rate over multiple year periods. It's what we believe is appropriate to aim for, given our commitment to capital discipline and the size of our partnership within our capital allocation framework. But this should not be interpreted as annual guidance. And as you can see in our results, we've achieved this growth in adjusted EBITDA and DCF. By deploying capital wisely, controlling our costs and optimizing operations to get the most out of our assets, we have grown DCF by 7.1% on a four year compound annual basis. Our growth tends to come in stair steps as we develop and bring projects online. And this disciplined approach to growing cash flows creates financial flexibility and underpins our commitment to returning capital to unit holders. We've increased our quarterly distribution 10% each of the last two years and the business continues to generate free cash flow after distributions of over $800 million annually. So we believe, we're in a strong position to continue to consistently grow our distributions. MPLX is a strategic investment for MPC and as MPLX pursues its growth opportunities, the value of this strategic relationship will be enhanced. We're confident in our growth opportunities and ability to generate strong cash flows. In 2023, we saw total unit holder return of 22%, underpinned by annual adjusted EBITDA growth of nearly 9% and DCF growth of 7%. In fact, we have grown EBITDA by nearly $1.2 billion over the last four years and have over 7% DCF growth CAGR over the same timeframe. By advancing our high return growth projects anchored into Marcellus and Permian basins, along with our focus on cost and portfolio optimization, we intend to grow our cash flows, allowing us to reinvest in the business and continue to return capital to unit holders. Now let me turn the call back over to Kristina.\nKristina Kazarian: Thanks, Mike. As we open the call for questions, we ask that you limit yourself to one question plus a follow-up. We may re-prompt for additional questions as time permits. With that, we'll now open the call to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from John Mackay with Goldman Sachs.\nJohn Mackay: I just wanted to start on the quarter. I mean, it was pretty strong across the board versus where we were. Just wondering, were there any kind of one-offs in the quarter or is this a kind of healthy enough run rate that we can think of MPLX growing off of from here?\nKris Hagedorn: Yeah, John, I would say we really did not have any significant one-offs up or down. You'll notice in our adjusted EBITDA, we did have insurance proceeds, but those were adjusted out, so really nothing significant to point to.\nJohn Mackay: Follow-up, just on the CapEx guidance lately higher than last couple years, acknowledging it's only a $100 million, but, is that any shift that you're seeing in opportunities or is that a kind of maybe a change in willingness to spend? Maybe you could just kind of frame up, how you got to the \u201824 budget versus, maybe \u201823 or \u201822?\nMike Hennigan: John, this is Mike. It's a good question. So as you know, we're a service provider and at the end of the day, we react to the producer needs especially on the G&P side of the business. And as I said in the prepared remarks, sometimes it can be a step change. We do have a couple plans coming on Harmon Creek II, Preakness II, we got secretariat coming next year. So we have a little bit of a growth spurt in processing plant construction. So that's part of it. But the main reason though, that we've been spending this I'll say roughly around a billion dollars a year, is we have a large enough footprint that we believe over time that we can generate better than normal returns and continue to grow. As I said in my prepared remarks, one of the things we're proud of is we've grown DCF about 7% consistently over the last four years. And a lot of that has to do with the term we use is strict capital discipline. Continuing to really look for better return projects. I know for you guys, a lot of times it doesn't come off as big announcements, but hopefully the results show you that we're getting good deployment of capital, getting good returns, and like I said, we're kind of proud of 7% growth for the size of our partnership over a four-year CAGR. I hopefully speaks for itself.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Reynolds with UBS.\nBrian Reynolds : Maybe to start off on the operations in the multi-year mid-single-digit earnings growth cadence, while understanding this is not \u201824 earnings guidance, just kind of curious if you can unpack some of the main drivers for earnings growth in \u201824 relative to \u201823. Seems like marathon throughput volume should be up year-over-year, even with some of the, the 1Q turnaround activity. But curious if you could maybe unpack some of the other drivers, the base business for the year.\nMike Hennigan : Yes, Brian, this is Mike again. I think similar to the, the way John was asking the question is, the way we look at this is we obviously have a multi-year lens that we're looking at stuff and we're trying to figure out where it's the best way to deploy capital. I keep having this funny conversation about, it's not guidance, but I'm kind of telling you that, we're looking to make sure that we can grow our cash flows consistently year-on-year. As I just said, it's been 7% for four years in a row. So we look at the plan, the team is constantly looking at organic growth. We haven't done a lot of M&A, but as you saw, we just recently bought out a JV partner and Dave and his team are constantly looking at assets to help the portfolio. So we kind of look at all that together and kind of look out over a couple years and say, do we fulfill our goals of continuing to grow the cash flows, because we want to keep moving that distribution up. We've shown you 10% the last couple years, at the end of the day our lens tends to look out further compared to what you see, but hopefully you're seeing in the results. And let me let Dave make a couple comments on the market in general.\nDave Heppner : Yes, Brian, this is Dave, as Mike said. So as we think about M&A and growth, one thing I want to make clear is, so growth through M&A for us isn't just buying assets for the fact of buying assets. We look to pursue opportunities, number one, high quality assets. Number two, align with our long-term strategies. And number three, allow us to, I'll use the word bolt-on, or capture synergies and integration value along our value chains, whether it be crude, nat gas, or NGL. So with all that said, that's kind of how we look at it. And the overriding, Mike touched on it. We continue touch on it through the lens of strict capital discipline or acceptable risk adjusted return. So, as we've looked through a lot of the opportunities out there and there is a lot of activity. It really gets back to we feel we have a lot of high return organic projects to utilize our capital versus some step out M&A opportunities that we've evaluated up to this point.\nBrian Reynolds : And I guess maybe through the broader context of organic growth and potentially strategic bolt-on M&A as you alluded to in the prepared remarks. Do you have an updated view on maybe the Corpus market in BANGL? Clearly it stands for Mont Belvieu alternative. So kind of curious if there's other opportunities maybe downstream, either for further gas or maybe some frack downstreams outside of Mont Belvieu that you'd be interested in growing into overtime.\nDave Heppner : Yeah, Brian, this is Dave again. So -- we done, as we just talked about here, we're very public about our plans to expand all of our value chains. And I'll touch on NGL, specifically the BANGL expansion all the way down to the markets. And as you know, whether we are going to extend these value chains either independently or via partners as we have with our JV partners out there, the strategy is really getting all the way down to the water and having export optionality. So as you might have heard in mid-December, MPLX submitted an air permit application for NGO fractionation storage down in the Texas City market. So that filing, as you would expect is a step we take as any project manager evaluate optionality and through the project development to submit those permits. So that kind of gives you a view of how we're thinking about it. But also it doesn't imply that the project has received FID approval and we're proceeding with it, and we'll continue to evaluate all options as we achieve that value chain build-out, ensure that we're getting the highest and most acceptable rate of return on those investments. So hopefully that gives you a little more color on the NGL fractionation side of it. Maybe I'll turn over to Shawn, talk a little bit about the BANGL side.\nShawn Lyon : As Dave mentioned, I'll speak to a little bit to the BANGL pipeline there. If you look at BANGL itself, it's really the strength of the partnership that ties the acreage into it. We've got an integrated play as Dave and Mike have mentioned with the G&P gas plants, plus other partners that are in it. So we feel really good about the partnership of BANGL that is driving the demand. The other part that we really are pleased with is the capital discipline and the capital efficiency of the BANGL project over time. Last year we announced the 200,000 barrels per day expansion again as the volume comes on, we're ready to expand and continue on down that path. So we feel good about what positioning the pipeline to set up for some of the opportunities that Dave talked about.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Theresa Chen with Barclays.\nTheresa Chen: Quick follow-up related to the BANGL commentary if I may. Can you just help us walk through the economics behind the expansion and given that there seems to be quite a bit of Permian NGL capacity coming online between multiple projects, including yours -- how do you view the evolution of rates over the next few years? Are you not really susceptible given the integrated strategy?\nShawn Lyon : Hey, Theresa, this is Shawn. Hey, good question. I think there's been a lot of discussion about that. I'll just really speak to again, our view of BANGL, of how, again, it's really two things, the strength of the partners that really are driving the volume on BANGL and then also the capital efficiency. And we really feel we're positioned to be really competitive in that market. So feel really good about that. Again, bringing on the expansion as the volume is there, we know it's there. We've got the integrated win-win or value with our G&P business and other partners that are attached to BANGL. So we feel good about all those things that is driving it.\nMike Hennigan: Theresa, this is Mike. Can't give you a lot of detail on the economics, but the capacity is there. So the capital investment is relatively low. We're adding horsepower as an example. So this is an example of one of those projects where the amount of capital deployed is relatively low. And as Shawn mentioned, we have dedication, we know volumes are going to come. So it fits into what we call the higher return bucket compared to other type of investments. Hope that helps a little bit.\nTheresa Chen: And then maybe turning to the residue side. So after Matterhorn begins service this year, there's still a visible need for additional long-haul residue egress out of the basin, right? And thus far, none of the project vendor\u2019s development have moved forward. When do you see residue takeaway becoming a problem for the basin? And given your interest in Whistler or Matterhorn, what do you view as MPLX's role in the incremental build out of Permian residue capacity?\nDave Heppner: Hey, Theresa, this is Dave. So I'll tackle that one. So you touched on a lot of it, and Shawn, and we have is, as you know we're participating in those long-haul pipes, whether it be Whistler that came on originally in 3Q 2021, and then the expansion in September, 2023, whether be Matterhorn, which will be coming on in 3Q 2024, and subsequently ADCC, which coming on at the same timeframe. So all those are supporting our participating in the long-haul pipes and that value chain from basin down to the Gulf Coast. So, as we look forward, number one, we continue to see strong production forecast out of the Permian, which will continue to allow us to evaluate and analyze expansion projects or new projects going forward. With all that said, maybe back to your question, based on our current forecast, we would expect to see after our projects come online that I referenced probably around the late \u201826, early \u201827 timeframe, the additional long-haul expansion capacity is going to be needed based on those forecasts. Hopefully that helps a little bit.\nMike Hennigan: Theresa, it's Mike. I just wanted to add, aside from the Permian, I think the market is under appreciating the growth potential up in the Marcellus. It's been talked about being in maintenance mode for some amount of time, but if you look recently there's starting to be a growth spurt occurring up in that area as well. And I think if people look at it over time, eventually MVP will come online and it's going to unlock some more growth. And I think, that's another area that probably hasn't been appreciated as much. But if you look over, even just the last year, the last couple quarters in our results in general the processing volumes have really kicked up compared to where they've been recently. So aside from the Permian growth, which gets a lot of attention, I think, the Marcellus and also the Utica, again, Utica was an area that probably was a little less thought of recently but it's also starting to go into a growth mode as well. I'll let Greg give a couple comments on that. Because I don't want people to miss that thought.\nGreg Floerke : Yes, thanks Mike. This is Greg, Theresa. In terms of the volume that we process, little over 6 billion cubic feet a day, which is nearly 6% of the U.S. total gas is of the 9.5, that we process in total was in the Marcellus. And that wrote -- that drove our utilization of our processing plant fleet up to 96%, which is a new record for us. All of that process gas generated a lot of C3 plus liquids in particular, so that drove our fractionation utilization up to 82% in growing. We have a unique integrated system in the Northeast that's totally different than what we have in the Southwest, and that we have to fractionate our own liquids and then find outlets. Fortunately, we have outlets to the East Coast for export and as well as into the Midwest for our cornerstone pipeline, and we have access for gasoline into Canada, as well as butane into the Midwest. So we have a really good position there and Harmon Creek II, coming online is much needed at the utilization point we're at now. We've also -- as Mike mentioned, brought our Utica utilization up to 49% and growing after a period of time where there wasn't growth. And we see a lot of good tailwinds with new producers moving into Utica and new state land auctions coming up expected this year. And we have existing capacity, not only the processing plants, but fractionation and liquid and gas pipelines to fill. So that's leveraging those existing assets and without a lot of new capital is a big focus for us.\nTheresa Chen : Thank you for that detailed answer across multiple regions.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.\nJeremy Tonet : Just wanted to touch base on the acquisition a little bit more if I could, if you're able to share a bit more color on the JV interest acquired. Are these existing assets in the Permian or assets otherwise that are kind of, can be relocated to the Permian? And I guess, just thoughts on the type of synergies that could be captured here, what that could mean for economics?\nMike Hennigan: Yes, Jeremy, I'll start. So this particular situation $270 million to buy out our partner, obviously we were the operator of the assets, so we're very familiar with the operations. We know what volumes and contractual dedications we have to it. We said it was an attractive multiple. It was a little under seven just to give you a flavor as to where the economics of that were. So these are things that Dave and his team are always talking to our partners about. If there's an opportunity where somebody is willing to get out for their reasons and we see it as a good opportunity for us that's how these transact. We go into these types of things just looking to be a good partner with all of our JV partners. But there are times when, like in this case the partner wanted to exit at a time when we thought it was a good opportunity. So that's how those kind of play themselves out. We don't count on them, but when those conversations come up, we're certainly willing to look at it. And then in general, we as you know in this space, we have quite a bit of JVs across our footprint. So most of the time we're just trying to work with our partners on how to grow the interest so that both of us, or three of us, or however many partners are in it, are all getting a win. And that's kind of the way we look at it from the partnership standpoint. And then aside from that, our teams are looking, how do we bolt-on where can we do some, some little bit of capital organic capital investment such that we can add to it, whether it's a JV asset or just one of our own assets. So it's kind of like what I said at the beginning, we're kind of looking out throughout the year, we're looking at where can we bolt-on, where can we add stuff? And if bolt-on isn't sexy when it comes to the earnings calls, but it's really good return. So, they're the types of projects we really like.\nJeremy Tonet: And just to clarify, are these assets currently in the Permian or could they be relocated to the Permian? Just want to make sure I was clear there.\nMike Hennigan: They're in the Permian today. They're in the Delaware.\nJeremy Tonet: And as far as M&A, a lot's been talked about today, but it sounds like you're saying these bolt-ons are more likely than anything larger in nature is how we should generally think about potential M&A activity.\nMike Hennigan : Jeremy, it's a balance. Obviously if you're going to get involved in M&A and to a large extent if you get into biggers, the returns are going to be much more competitive. Because a lot of people are going to be involved in that process. The ones that we like better, as long as they continue to be there for us is where we can just organically invest and get a much higher return than the M&A market will typically give you. And as long as we continue to have those, that's why, look, when we announce our total capital, a large majority of it we don't talk about on earnings calls or press releases or things like that because there's smaller projects, but they're much higher returns. So, we tend to favor those just because of the return that they give us. And that's why some people keep scratching their head a little bit of how you guys grow in the partnership 7% CAGR over four years. And a lot of it has to do with self-help, things that we're doing internally, these bolt-ons that we're doing, and then occasionally adding stuff that meets earnings call discussions, et cetera. So it's a combination of all those, but what I hope investors are not realizing is we're sitting here behind the scenes, looking at it over multiple years and seeing that we think we can continue to grow the partnership we have in the back of our head what that means for how we're going to return capital. Obviously it starts with, you got to get a return on that capital and then we think about what's the best way to return it, and that's kind of the internal discussions that we're having all the time.\nOperator: Next we'll hear from Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research.\nKeith Stanley : Wanted to follow-up on some of the good growth that you saw in Marcellus and Utica and Q4 and through last year and some of the positive commentary on 2024, or would you say your integrated footprint across Appalachia is allowing you to take market share over time in that market, and that's part of why you're able to see a little better growth? Or do you see the Basin kind of inflecting positively with MVP and you're just kind of maintaining your market share overall?\nGreg Floerke : I would say, it's some of both. We have the most extensive integrated footprint in the Basin both across the Utica and the Marcellus. They're interconnected. We have access to multiple fractionation facilities. We have a distributed [indiscernible] plant. So, we have a lot of flexibility there, but we also are -- it's just good rock. The Utica and the Marcellus basins in terms of uniformity are really good. And I think there's some combination of existing producers that are drilling longer laterals that are driving more production per pad. And then there are, the Utica is a good example of some new producers moving into the region and taking advantage of particularly the light oil and condensate window over there, which brings associated gas and NGLs as well. So really a combination of both our scale and integration as well as new production, new producers.\nKeith Stanley: Second question. I guess just on the growth outlook and Mike, you've talked about this a lot already, but the company's investing a billion a year of capital. If we're in a world without kind of an inflation escalators anymore, and assume kind of flattish commodity prices, is a billion a year of capital enough to hit your growth targets, or do you need to continue to find self-help type mechanisms, whether it's costs, efficiency improvements, tuck-in M&A, et cetera in order to hit the growth target? So is a billion enough per year or do you need to find other things to get there as well?\nMike Hennigan: Yeah, Keith, it's Mike again. Yeah, it's a combination. So what I was saying? If you look at the history we've been spending around a billion even slightly under the last couple years, and recall that, that number also includes that $150 million initial maintenance. So we take a look at our portfolio and we try to examine where do we think we have opportunities. And it's really what I was saying to Jeremy's question. It's a combination of all of it. But I think, if you look at the results, 7% over four years, we're about a $6 billion, EBITDA business. So, you're looking roughly at about $400 million a year of growth at that 7%. So we look at what we have on paper and we try and think about how do we get to those kind of levels. That's why I kind of just generically call it mid-single-digit, just as a generic number. But we're really thinking for our size of partnership that if we can continue to grow 300, 400, 500, those kind of numbers we think is sufficient to keep what we think is a very steady growth in return of capital, which we think the market would like. So we look at all of it, we look at our self-help, we look at efficiencies, we look at different things that are occurring as far as capital. But up until this point, that's about the level that we've needed to spend to be in that range. To your point, if we thought, at times we need to deploy more capital, that's something that we would have at our, at our hand, at our toolbox, so to speak. So, we look at it all, we try and figure out our plan. I know it's probably frustrating for your side of the fence because you don't get to see them all the year, but that's what we're trying to do. And it's all to try and show that the market that, we're going to continue to grow the cash flows, we're going to continue to increase the distribution, we're going to continue to return capital and hopefully that, is a good day for investors. Last year we talked about total unit holder return of 22%. We're pretty proud of that and hopefully, investors have found that to be a good outcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo.\nMichael Blum: Wanted to ask, there's been a lot of M&A consolidation in the upstream space and I'm wondering if that's had any impact on you either directly or indirectly. Some of your producer customers maybe are involved in some of those, and just curious if there's positive or negative or maybe no impact, but just curious if that's had any impact on you guys.\nGreg Floerke: This is Greg. I would say that there really has been no impact, or at least no material impact. We have -- there is consolidation, but for the most part we have agreements with one party or the other, and in some cases longstanding agreements. So I would, the answer would be really no impact there.\nDave Heppner: Yes, Michael. Similarly on the accrued side, and there hasn't been anything that we could say directly correlates to that. Obviously, we gather in a lot of basins and whether it's a single producer or a consolidated producer, it's really the area and the dedications that come with that really impact it as opposed to who the owner is.\nMike Hennigan : And I might add with one of the recent consolidation activities we saw, we actually did see an uptick in credit profile. So that was actually helpful to us as we thought about our credit profile.\nMichael Blum : And then, I know this has been asked on prior calls, but you're sitting there with a billion dollars of cash on the balance sheet. You didn't do any buybacks in Q4. It sounds like you're going to maintain the same level of debt, so you're not, it's not going to go away. So just maybe just some comments on how you're thinking about maintaining that level of cash and what type of financial flexibility that will give you.\nMike Hennigan : I think you hit it on the head with your last comment, Michael. It gives us flexibility. As we started into the year, as I said, we always have a plan in place, but we had a pretty strong year. We had record throughputs in the L&S side of the business as well as the G&P side of the business. EBITDA turned out to be 9% year-on-year growth. So it falls into the category of a good problem to have. Like you said, at the end of the day, we spent a little bit of money on the acquisition that we talked about. We deployed capital, and I made the statement that last couple years we've been generating, roughly about $800 million beyond our commitment. So it's been a good problem to have. I know people are wondering what our plan there is and short-term, it's just having that flexibility. We haven't done a lot of buybacks. We've told the market that we're going to [indiscernible] on the side of distributing through increasing the distribution, which we've done a couple years in a row. We still think that's our primary tool, is the term that we've used. We've talked on previous calls about volatility in the equity price. It's been a factor in some of our decisions, but at the end of the day, it does give us a little bit of flexibility and hopefully over time you'll get to see how we deploy it.\nOperator: And our final question for today will come from Neal Dingmann with Truist.\nNeal Dingmann: My questions on the Permian that you've talked a bit about specifically, I've seen a little bit I guess year-to-date on some weather weakness just in some areas. I'm wonder, have how you had any impact there? And then secondly, sounds like and I just want to double check, are your longer-term, you've got a lot of attractive projects such as our plans such as Wink-to-Webster and others. Are those still right on plan?\nMike Hennigan : To your first question, Neil, obviously there's always weather issues that occur every year, but nothing significant compared to what we've seen in the last years. But certainly, it's the type of thing that we battle at this time of the year in general. But I wouldn't say there's anything major that we needed to discuss and --\nShawn Lyon : Regarding your question regarding Wink-to-Webster, we continue our plea with the ramp up and the volume we've seen come across Wink-to-Webster in \u201823. And likewise in \u201824, we expect to see a little bit of increase. So, going forward. So really pleased with that investment in that JV partnership going forward in \u201824 and beyond.\nNeal Dingmann: And then just secondly, you guys touched already on the Utica, but I'm just wondering, it looked like you're spending a bit more on the Utica gather. I'm just wondering is it perceived growth there or what's driving this project?\nGreg Floerke: It is perceived growth. We've already seen growth in the Utica. We're filling up existing processing capacity, liquid capacity and transmission and compression. But there is also always going to be in areas where we gather additional capital to connect new well pads, which is a sign of growth from multiple producers. So that is a sign of more growth and we're excited to see it.\nNeal Dingmann: Look forward to it. Thank you all.\nKristina Kazarian: All right. Well, thank you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in MPLX. Should you have additional questions or would you like clarification on any of the topics discussed today, members of the IR team will be available to take your call.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "content": "Yes, thanks Mike. This is Greg, Theresa. In terms of the volume that we process, little over 6 billion cubic feet a day, which is nearly 6% of the U.S. total gas is of the 9.5, that we process in total was in the Marcellus. And that wrote -- that drove our utilization of our processing plant fleet up to 96%, which is a new record for us. All of that process gas generated a lot of C3 plus liquids in particular, so that drove our fractionation utilization up to 82% in growing. We have a unique integrated system in the Northeast that's totally different than what we have in the Southwest, and that we have to fractionate our own liquids and then find outlets. Fortunately, we have outlets to the East Coast for export and as well as into the Midwest for our cornerstone pipeline, and we have access for gasoline into Canada, as well as butane into the Midwest. So we have a really good position there and Harmon Creek II, coming online is much needed at the utilization point we're at now. We've also -- as Mike mentioned, brought our Utica utilization up to 49% and growing after a period of time where there wasn't growth. And we see a lot of good tailwinds with new producers moving into Utica and new state land auctions coming up expected this year. And we have existing capacity, not only the processing plants, but fractionation and liquid and gas pipelines to fill. So that's leveraging those existing assets and without a lot of new capital is a big focus for us. I would say, it's some of both. We have the most extensive integrated footprint in the Basin both across the Utica and the Marcellus. They're interconnected. We have access to multiple fractionation facilities.

            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Slide 7 outlines the fourth quarter operational and financial performance highlights for our logistics and storage segment. The L&S segment reported its fourth consecutive quarter of $1 billion adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA increased $110 million when compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily driven by higher rates and throughputs, including growth from equity affiliates. Proof pipeline volumes were up 4%, primarily because of refinery maintenance schedules in the prior year, product pipeline volumes and terminal volumes were flat. Moving to our gathering and processing segment on Slide 8. The G&P segment adjusted EBITDA increased $59 million compared to fourth quarter 2022. This was driven by higher gathering and processing volumes. Total gathered volumes were up 1% year-over-year, primarily due to increased production in the Marcellus in the Southwest. Processing volumes were up 9% year-over-year, primarily from higher volumes in the Marcellus and the Utica driven by increased customer demand. Focusing in on the Marcellus, by far our largest basin of G&P operations, we saw year-over-year volume increases of 10% for gathering, and 9% for processing, driven by increased drilling and production growth. Marcellus' processing utilization reached 96% in the fourth quarter. Illustrating the need for our Harmon Creek II facility, fractionation volumes grew 1% due to higher processed volumes, which were offset by lower Ethan recoveries. Moving to our fourth quarter financial highlights on Slide 9, total adjusted EBITDA of $1.6 billion and distributable cash flow of $1.4 billion increased 12% and 9% respectively from prior year. Turning to our balance sheet on Slide 10. Growth of our cash flows has continued to reduce MPLX leverage, which now stands at 3.3x. We believe the stability of our cash flows supports leverage in the range of 4x. And while MPLX has just over $1 billion of notes maturing later this year, we currently do not expect to structurally lower our debt. When evaluating the short-term maturity, we'll consider all opportunities available to us to optimize our cost of debt. MPLX's strong balance sheet, including a year-end cash balance of $1 billion, plus the ability to utilize the intercompany facility within MPC provides us with financial flexibility to invest in the business and optimize capital allocation. Now let me hand it back to Mike for some final thoughts. Yeah, John, I would say we really did not have any significant one-offs up or down. You'll notice in our adjusted EBITDA, we did have insurance proceeds, but those were adjusted out, so really nothing significant to point to."

            "name": "Shawn Lyon",
            "content": "As Dave mentioned, I'll speak to a little bit to the BANGL pipeline there. If you look at BANGL itself, it's really the strength of the partnership that ties the acreage into it. We've got an integrated play as Dave and Mike have mentioned with the G&P gas plants, plus other partners that are in it. So we feel really good about the partnership of BANGL that is driving the demand. The other part that we really are pleased with is the capital discipline and the capital efficiency of the BANGL project over time. Last year we announced the 200,000 barrels per day expansion again as the volume comes on, we're ready to expand and continue on down that path. So we feel good about what positioning the pipeline to set up for some of the opportunities that Dave talked about. Hey, Theresa, this is Shawn. Hey, good question. I think there's been a lot of discussion about that. I'll just really speak to again, our view of BANGL, of how, again, it's really two things, the strength of the partners that really are driving the volume on BANGL and then also the capital efficiency. And we really feel we're positioned to be really competitive in that market. So feel really good about that. Again, bringing on the expansion as the volume is there, we know it's there. We've got the integrated win-win or value with our G&P business and other partners that are attached to BANGL. So we feel good about all those things that is driving it. Regarding your question regarding Wink-to-Webster, we continue our plea with the ramp up and the volume we've seen come across Wink-to-Webster in \u201823. And likewise in \u201824, we expect to see a little bit of increase. So, going forward. So really pleased with that investment in that JV partnership going forward in \u201824 and beyond."

            "name": "Mike Hennigan",
            "content": "Thanks, Kristina. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call. I'd like to acknowledge Kris Hagedorn, MPLX's new CFO joining our call. We look forward to Kris' financial leadership having served in various roles in the midstream sector, previously being the Controller of MPLX and most recently, Controller of MPC. 2023 was a strong year as we successfully executed our strategic priorities. Full year adjusted EBITDA was $6.3 billion. Distributable cash flow was $5.3 billion and adjusted free cash flow was $4.1 billion. Our results reflect the continued growth of the partnership and its cash flows in our L&S segment, strong operational performance and customer demand drove record pipeline throughput, and strong growth in terminal throughput demonstrating the value of our relationship with MPC. In our G&P segment, we saw record throughput in our gathering, processing and fractionation operations driven mainly by our assets in the Marcellus and Permian basins. Our focus on cost management, strong operational performance and growth from recent capital investments resulted in adjusted EBITDA growth of nearly 9%, and DCF growth of over 7% for the year. In line with our commitment to return capital, the growth of MPLX's cash flow supported the return of $3.3 billion to unit holders through distributions. We've increased our quarterly distribution 10% each of the last two years, which now stands at $3.40 per unit on an annualized basis, and we still have strong distribution coverage of 1.6x. Turning to the macro, the United States continues to be a low cost producer of energy fuels needed across the globe. Our expectations on the long-term production outlook in our key basins are unchanged. We expect strong demand for hydrocarbons will support growth across our asset footprint. In our largest basin the Marcellus, the cost to develop is at the low end of the cost curve and below current commodity prices. In the fourth quarter, process utilization reached 96%, and we expect producer drilling activity to support continued volume growth in the Marcellus. We've seen similar growth rates in the Utica, where processing utilization increase 10% year-over-year. Both basins are seeing wells with longer laterals, which are resulting in higher volumes, highlighting the strength and opportunities we see in our Northeast footprint. In the Permian Basin, crew prices remain attractive and associated gas production continues to grow as producers execute drilling and completion activities. As part of our Permian growth strategy, we acquired the remaining interest of a gathering and processing joint venture in the Delaware Basin for approximately $270 million at an attractive multiple. This acquisition illustrates our ability to grow the cash flow of the partnership through the lens of strict capital discipline. We're confident in our ability to grow the partnership and are focused on executing the strategic priorities of strict capital discipline, fostering a low-cost culture, and optimizing our asset portfolio, all of which are foundational to the growth of MPLX's cash flows. Turning to our capital plan. Today, we announced a capital expenditure outlook of $1.1 billion for 2024. Our plan includes $950 million of growth capital and $150 million of maintenance capital. We remain committed to capital discipline and our 2024 growth capital outlook is anchored in the Marcellus and Permian basins. Our integrative footprints in these basins have positioned the partnership with a steady source of opportunities to expand our value chains, particularly around natural gas and NGL assets. We plan to continue growing these operations through organic projects, investment in our Permian joint ventures, and bold on opportunities. In the L&S segment, construction is progressing on the Whistler, Agua Dulce to Corpus Christi or ADCC natural gas pipeline, which is expected to be in service in the third quarter of 2024. We're also progressing the expansion of the BANGL joint venture NGL pipeline to approximately 200,000 barrels per day, which is expected to be completed in the first half of 2025. These projects are largely financed at the JV level. Therefore, our portion of the JV finance capital spending is not reflected in our capital outlook. In G&P segment, we're bringing new gas processing plans online to meet increasing customer demand. In the Marcellus Basin, we advance construction of the Harmon Creek II gas processing plan, which is expected to be online at the end of the first quarter. Similarly, in the Permian Basin, we progress construction of Preakness II, which is expected to be online early in the second quarter. Additionally, we are building our seventh gas processing plant in the basin secretariat, which is expected to be online in the second half of 2025. Once operational, our total processing capacity in the Delaware Basin will be approximately 1.4 billion cubic feet per day. Outside of these strategic basins, the remainder of our capital plan is mostly comprised of smaller high return investments, targeted at expansion or the bottlenecking of existing assets and projects related to expected increased producer activity. While our capital outlook is primarily focused on our L&S and G&P footprint, we will evaluate low carbon opportunities to leverage technologies that are complimentary with our asset footprint to create a competitive advantage. Moving to capital allocation, we're optimistic about our opportunities in 2024. First, maintenance capital. We are steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees, and support the communities we operate in. Second, we're focused on delivering a secure distribution and expect this will remain our primary return of capital tool. Third, we'll invest to grow the business. This is both a return-on and a return-off capital business. As we look at 2024, our priority is to invest to grow the business at superior returns. After these priorities, we'll assess the opportunistic return of capital to unit holders. Recent industry consolidation has not changed our perspectives on the structure of MPLX. MPLX is a strategic investment for MPC, and MPC does not plan the role of the partnership. Now let me turn the call over to Kris to discuss our operational and financial results for the quarter. Thanks, Kris. In closing, MPLX is a strong history of growing the partnerships cash flows by executing strategic priorities, all while maintaining strict capital discipline. We continue to aim for mid-single-digit growth rate over multiple year periods. It's what we believe is appropriate to aim for, given our commitment to capital discipline and the size of our partnership within our capital allocation framework. But this should not be interpreted as annual guidance. And as you can see in our results, we've achieved this growth in adjusted EBITDA and DCF. By deploying capital wisely, controlling our costs and optimizing operations to get the most out of our assets, we have grown DCF by 7.1% on a four year compound annual basis. Our growth tends to come in stair steps as we develop and bring projects online. And this disciplined approach to growing cash flows creates financial flexibility and underpins our commitment to returning capital to unit holders. We've increased our quarterly distribution 10% each of the last two years and the business continues to generate free cash flow after distributions of over $800 million annually. So we believe, we're in a strong position to continue to consistently grow our distributions. MPLX is a strategic investment for MPC and as MPLX pursues its growth opportunities, the value of this strategic relationship will be enhanced. We're confident in our growth opportunities and ability to generate strong cash flows. In 2023, we saw total unit holder return of 22%, underpinned by annual adjusted EBITDA growth of nearly 9% and DCF growth of 7%. In fact, we have grown EBITDA by nearly $1.2 billion over the last four years and have over 7% DCF growth CAGR over the same timeframe. By advancing our high return growth projects anchored into Marcellus and Permian basins, along with our focus on cost and portfolio optimization, we intend to grow our cash flows, allowing us to reinvest in the business and continue to return capital to unit holders. Now let me turn the call back over to Kristina. John, this is Mike. It's a good question. So as you know, we're a service provider and at the end of the day, we react to the producer needs especially on the G&P side of the business. And as I said in the prepared remarks, sometimes it can be a step change. We do have a couple plans coming on Harmon Creek II, Preakness II, we got secretariat coming next year. So we have a little bit of a growth spurt in processing plant construction. So that's part of it. But the main reason though, that we've been spending this I'll say roughly around a billion dollars a year, is we have a large enough footprint that we believe over time that we can generate better than normal returns and continue to grow. As I said in my prepared remarks, one of the things we're proud of is we've grown DCF about 7% consistently over the last four years. And a lot of that has to do with the term we use is strict capital discipline. Continuing to really look for better return projects. I know for you guys, a lot of times it doesn't come off as big announcements, but hopefully the results show you that we're getting good deployment of capital, getting good returns, and like I said, we're kind of proud of 7% growth for the size of our partnership over a four-year CAGR. I hopefully speaks for itself. Yes, Brian, this is Mike again. I think similar to the, the way John was asking the question is, the way we look at this is we obviously have a multi-year lens that we're looking at stuff and we're trying to figure out where it's the best way to deploy capital. I keep having this funny conversation about, it's not guidance, but I'm kind of telling you that, we're looking to make sure that we can grow our cash flows consistently year-on-year. As I just said, it's been 7% for four years in a row. So we look at the plan, the team is constantly looking at organic growth. We haven't done a lot of M&A, but as you saw, we just recently bought out a JV partner and Dave and his team are constantly looking at assets to help the portfolio. So we kind of look at all that together and kind of look out over a couple years and say, do we fulfill our goals of continuing to grow the cash flows, because we want to keep moving that distribution up. We've shown you 10% the last couple years, at the end of the day our lens tends to look out further compared to what you see, but hopefully you're seeing in the results. And let me let Dave make a couple comments on the market in general. Theresa, this is Mike. Can't give you a lot of detail on the economics, but the capacity is there. So the capital investment is relatively low. We're adding horsepower as an example. So this is an example of one of those projects where the amount of capital deployed is relatively low. And as Shawn mentioned, we have dedication, we know volumes are going to come. So it fits into what we call the higher return bucket compared to other type of investments. Hope that helps a little bit. Theresa, it's Mike. I just wanted to add, aside from the Permian, I think the market is under appreciating the growth potential up in the Marcellus. It's been talked about being in maintenance mode for some amount of time, but if you look recently there's starting to be a growth spurt occurring up in that area as well. And I think if people look at it over time, eventually MVP will come online and it's going to unlock some more growth. And I think, that's another area that probably hasn't been appreciated as much. But if you look over, even just the last year, the last couple quarters in our results in general the processing volumes have really kicked up compared to where they've been recently. So aside from the Permian growth, which gets a lot of attention, I think, the Marcellus and also the Utica, again, Utica was an area that probably was a little less thought of recently but it's also starting to go into a growth mode as well. I'll let Greg give a couple comments on that. Because I don't want people to miss that thought. Yes, Jeremy, I'll start. So this particular situation $270 million to buy out our partner, obviously we were the operator of the assets, so we're very familiar with the operations. We know what volumes and contractual dedications we have to it. We said it was an attractive multiple. It was a little under seven just to give you a flavor as to where the economics of that were. So these are things that Dave and his team are always talking to our partners about. If there's an opportunity where somebody is willing to get out for their reasons and we see it as a good opportunity for us that's how these transact. We go into these types of things just looking to be a good partner with all of our JV partners. But there are times when, like in this case the partner wanted to exit at a time when we thought it was a good opportunity. So that's how those kind of play themselves out. We don't count on them, but when those conversations come up, we're certainly willing to look at it. And then in general, we as you know in this space, we have quite a bit of JVs across our footprint. So most of the time we're just trying to work with our partners on how to grow the interest so that both of us, or three of us, or however many partners are in it, are all getting a win. And that's kind of the way we look at it from the partnership standpoint. And then aside from that, our teams are looking, how do we bolt-on where can we do some, some little bit of capital organic capital investment such that we can add to it, whether it's a JV asset or just one of our own assets. So it's kind of like what I said at the beginning, we're kind of looking out throughout the year, we're looking at where can we bolt-on, where can we add stuff? And if bolt-on isn't sexy when it comes to the earnings calls, but it's really good return. So, they're the types of projects we really like. They're in the Permian today. They're in the Delaware. Jeremy, it's a balance. Obviously if you're going to get involved in M&A and to a large extent if you get into biggers, the returns are going to be much more competitive. Because a lot of people are going to be involved in that process. The ones that we like better, as long as they continue to be there for us is where we can just organically invest and get a much higher return than the M&A market will typically give you. And as long as we continue to have those, that's why, look, when we announce our total capital, a large majority of it we don't talk about on earnings calls or press releases or things like that because there's smaller projects, but they're much higher returns. So, we tend to favor those just because of the return that they give us. And that's why some people keep scratching their head a little bit of how you guys grow in the partnership 7% CAGR over four years. And a lot of it has to do with self-help, things that we're doing internally, these bolt-ons that we're doing, and then occasionally adding stuff that meets earnings call discussions, et cetera. So it's a combination of all those, but what I hope investors are not realizing is we're sitting here behind the scenes, looking at it over multiple years and seeing that we think we can continue to grow the partnership we have in the back of our head what that means for how we're going to return capital. Obviously it starts with, you got to get a return on that capital and then we think about what's the best way to return it, and that's kind of the internal discussions that we're having all the time. Yeah, Keith, it's Mike again. Yeah, it's a combination. So what I was saying? If you look at the history we've been spending around a billion even slightly under the last couple years, and recall that, that number also includes that $150 million initial maintenance. So we take a look at our portfolio and we try to examine where do we think we have opportunities. And it's really what I was saying to Jeremy's question. It's a combination of all of it. But I think, if you look at the results, 7% over four years, we're about a $6 billion, EBITDA business. So, you're looking roughly at about $400 million a year of growth at that 7%. So we look at what we have on paper and we try and think about how do we get to those kind of levels. That's why I kind of just generically call it mid-single-digit, just as a generic number. But we're really thinking for our size of partnership that if we can continue to grow 300, 400, 500, those kind of numbers we think is sufficient to keep what we think is a very steady growth in return of capital, which we think the market would like. So we look at all of it, we look at our self-help, we look at efficiencies, we look at different things that are occurring as far as capital. But up until this point, that's about the level that we've needed to spend to be in that range. To your point, if we thought, at times we need to deploy more capital, that's something that we would have at our, at our hand, at our toolbox, so to speak. So, we look at it all, we try and figure out our plan. I know it's probably frustrating for your side of the fence because you don't get to see them all the year, but that's what we're trying to do. And it's all to try and show that the market that, we're going to continue to grow the cash flows, we're going to continue to increase the distribution, we're going to continue to return capital and hopefully that, is a good day for investors. Last year we talked about total unit holder return of 22%. We're pretty proud of that and hopefully, investors have found that to be a good outcome. And I might add with one of the recent consolidation activities we saw, we actually did see an uptick in credit profile. So that was actually helpful to us as we thought about our credit profile. I think you hit it on the head with your last comment, Michael. It gives us flexibility. As we started into the year, as I said, we always have a plan in place, but we had a pretty strong year. We had record throughputs in the L&S side of the business as well as the G&P side of the business. EBITDA turned out to be 9% year-on-year growth. So it falls into the category of a good problem to have. Like you said, at the end of the day, we spent a little bit of money on the acquisition that we talked about. We deployed capital, and I made the statement that last couple years we've been generating, roughly about $800 million beyond our commitment. So it's been a good problem to have. I know people are wondering what our plan there is and short-term, it's just having that flexibility. We haven't done a lot of buybacks. We've told the market that we're going to [indiscernible] on the side of distributing through increasing the distribution, which we've done a couple years in a row. We still think that's our primary tool, is the term that we've used. We've talked on previous calls about volatility in the equity price. It's been a factor in some of our decisions, but at the end of the day, it does give us a little bit of flexibility and hopefully over time you'll get to see how we deploy it. To your first question, Neil, obviously there's always weather issues that occur every year, but nothing significant compared to what we've seen in the last years. But certainly, it's the type of thing that we battle at this time of the year in general. But I wouldn't say there's anything major that we needed to discuss and --"

            "name": "Dave Heppner",
            "content": "Yes, Brian, this is Dave, as Mike said. So as we think about M&A and growth, one thing I want to make clear is, so growth through M&A for us isn't just buying assets for the fact of buying assets. We look to pursue opportunities, number one, high quality assets. Number two, align with our long-term strategies. And number three, allow us to, I'll use the word bolt-on, or capture synergies and integration value along our value chains, whether it be crude, nat gas, or NGL. So with all that said, that's kind of how we look at it. And the overriding, Mike touched on it. We continue touch on it through the lens of strict capital discipline or acceptable risk adjusted return. So, as we've looked through a lot of the opportunities out there and there is a lot of activity. It really gets back to we feel we have a lot of high return organic projects to utilize our capital versus some step out M&A opportunities that we've evaluated up to this point. Yeah, Brian, this is Dave again. So -- we done, as we just talked about here, we're very public about our plans to expand all of our value chains. And I'll touch on NGL, specifically the BANGL expansion all the way down to the markets. And as you know, whether we are going to extend these value chains either independently or via partners as we have with our JV partners out there, the strategy is really getting all the way down to the water and having export optionality. So as you might have heard in mid-December, MPLX submitted an air permit application for NGO fractionation storage down in the Texas City market. So that filing, as you would expect is a step we take as any project manager evaluate optionality and through the project development to submit those permits. So that kind of gives you a view of how we're thinking about it. But also it doesn't imply that the project has received FID approval and we're proceeding with it, and we'll continue to evaluate all options as we achieve that value chain build-out, ensure that we're getting the highest and most acceptable rate of return on those investments. So hopefully that gives you a little more color on the NGL fractionation side of it. Maybe I'll turn over to Shawn, talk a little bit about the BANGL side. Hey, Theresa, this is Dave. So I'll tackle that one. So you touched on a lot of it, and Shawn, and we have is, as you know we're participating in those long-haul pipes, whether it be Whistler that came on originally in 3Q 2021, and then the expansion in September, 2023, whether be Matterhorn, which will be coming on in 3Q 2024, and subsequently ADCC, which coming on at the same timeframe. So all those are supporting our participating in the long-haul pipes and that value chain from basin down to the Gulf Coast. So, as we look forward, number one, we continue to see strong production forecast out of the Permian, which will continue to allow us to evaluate and analyze expansion projects or new projects going forward. With all that said, maybe back to your question, based on our current forecast, we would expect to see after our projects come online that I referenced probably around the late \u201826, early \u201827 timeframe, the additional long-haul expansion capacity is going to be needed based on those forecasts. Hopefully that helps a little bit. Yes, Michael. Similarly on the accrued side, and there hasn't been anything that we could say directly correlates to that. Obviously, we gather in a lot of basins and whether it's a single producer or a consolidated producer, it's really the area and the dedications that come with that really impact it as opposed to who the owner is."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.\nKristina Kazarian: Thank you, Sheila. Good morning, and welcome to the MPLX third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at mplx.com under the Investors tab. Joining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan, Chairman and CEO; John Quaid, CFO; and other members of the executive team. We invite you to read the safe harbor statements and non-GAAP disclaimer on Slide 2. It's a reminder that we'll be making forward-looking statements during the call and during the question-and-answer session that follows. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.\nMichael Hennigan: Thanks, Kristina. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call. Earlier today, we reported third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $1.6 billion and distributable cash flow of $1.4 billion, each set a new quarterly record for MPLX with both increasing over 8% year-over-year. Our L&S business set a new record for crude pipeline throughput and saw strong terminal throughputs, demonstrating the value of our relationship with MPC. In our G&P business, we saw record throughput in our processing and fractionation operations driven mainly by our assets in the Permian and Marcellus basins. Our long-term production outlook for our G&P producer customers in our key basins remains largely unchanged. In our largest basin, the Marcellus, the cost to develop remains at the low end of the cost curve and still below current commodity prices, we expect to see maintenance level drilling activity continue. While in the Permian, crude prices remained strong and prices for associated gas do not significantly impact producer activity. Our integrated footprint in these basins position the partnership with a steady source of growth opportunities. For the second year in a row, based on the strength and continued growth of our cash flows, last week, we announced a 10% increase in the partnership's distribution, which now stands at $3.40 per unit on an annualized basis. We're committed to returning capital to unitholders and expect our distribution to be the primary return of capital tool supplemented with opportunistic repurchases. We are well positioned to optimize return of capital given the strength of the business and our balance sheet. Our position on MPLX and its structure is unchanged. MPLX is a strategic investment for MPC, which now expects to receive $2.2 billion in annual cash flows via the distribution. MPC believes that its current capital allocation priorities are optimal for its shareholders and MPC does not plan to roll up MPLX. We remain confident in our ability to grow the partnership and our focus on executing the strategic priorities of strict capital discipline, fostering a low-cost culture and optimizing our asset portfolio, all of which are foundational to the continued growth of MPLX's cash flows. Now let me turn the call over to John to discuss our growth as well as our operational and financial results for the quarter.\nJohn Quaid: Thanks, Mike. As you can see on Slide 5, MPLX has a strong history of growing its cash flows by executing the strategic priorities Mike just highlighted. Looking back over the last 3 years, you can see that our growth comes in stair steps as we develop and bring projects online. And through the first 9 months of this year, distributable cash flow has grown over 6% versus the prior year. We are progressing our 2023 capital program, which remains forecasted at $950 million, including $800 million of growth capital and $150 million of maintenance capital. In the L&S segment, our joint venture natural gas, crude and NGL pipeline projects in the Permian are progressing. Whistler's expansion, the 2.5 billion cubic feet per day was completed at the end of the third quarter, and we're seeing strong demand for the natural gas pipeline. Construction is progressing on the associated Agua Dulce Corpus Christi Pipeline lateral, which is expected to be in service in the third quarter of 2024. On the Wink to Webster crude pipeline, we expect volumes to ramp over the next 2 years as the pipeline continues to play segments into service. Turning to our participation in the NGL value chain. We are progressing the expansion of the BANGL pipeline to about 200,000 barrels per day, which is expected to be completed in the first half of 2025. The capital-efficient expansion of this long-haul pipeline is supported by existing and growing demand for NGL takeaway from the Permian's Delaware and Midland Basins to the fractionation hub in Sweeny, Texas. All of these projects are largely financed at the JV level, and therefore, our portion of the JV finance capital spending is not reflected in our capital outlook. In the G&P segment, we remain focused on growth investments in the Permian and Marcellus basins in response to producer demand. We are bringing online new gas processing plants in the Permian Delaware Basin to meet increasing demand while targeting strong returns with strict capital discipline. We're progressing construction of Preakness II, which we expect to be online in the first half of 2024. And announced last quarter, we would be building our seventh gas processing plant in the basin Secretariat, which is expected to be online in the second half of 2025. Once operational, these plants will bring our total processing capacity in the Delaware Basin up to 1.4 Bcf per day. In the Marcellus Basin, we are also advancing construction of the Harmon Creek II gas processing plant, which we expect will be online in the first half of 2024. Slide 6 outlines the third quarter operational and financial performance highlights for our Logistics & Storage segment. The L&S segment reported its third consecutive quarter with $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA. L&S segment adjusted EBITDA increased $122 million when compared to third quarter '22, primarily driven by higher rates and throughputs, including growth from equity affiliates. Third quarter 2023 segment adjusted EBITDA excludes Garyville incident response cost of $63 million. Crude pipeline volumes were up 9% and represent a new quarterly record for the partnership as we grew crude oil throughputs through expansion and debottlenecking activities. Product pipeline volumes were down 9%, driven by less favorable market dynamics and effects from Marathon's refinery downtime. Terminal volumes were up 7% due to higher customer demand, including effects from Marathon's refinery turnarounds in both quarters. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we do expect some headwinds of approximately $30 million to $40 million to sequential L&S segment results from lower throughput volumes as a result of MPC's planned turnaround activity, as well as higher operating expenses due to the timing of maintenance projects. Moving to our Gathering & Processing segment on Slide 7. G&P segment adjusted EBITDA increased $3 million compared to third quarter 2022 as the benefits of higher volumes and throughput fees were offset by lower NGL prices. While our G&P segment is largely a fee-based business, we do have some direct sensitivity to natural gas liquids prices. For the quarter, NGL prices averaged $0.68 per gallon as compared to $1.01 in the third quarter of 2022, resulting in a $32 million unfavorable effect. Total gathered volumes were up 3% year-over-year due to increased production in the Permian and the Marcellus. Processing volumes were up 5% year-over-year, primarily from higher volumes in the Marcellus and Permian, driven by increased customer demand and our investment in Permian processing capacity. Focusing in on the Marcellus, by far, our largest basin of operations, we saw year-over-year volume increases of 4% for gathering and 5% for processing, driven by increased customer demand and fractionation volumes grew 10%, primarily due to increases to our fractionation capacity to meet in-basin demand for ethane. Moving to our third quarter financial highlights on Slide 8. Total adjusted EBITDA of $1.6 billion and distributable cash flow of $1.4 billion increased 8.5% and 8.6%, respectively, from the prior year. As Mike discussed, based on our confidence in the continued growth of our cash flows, we increased the base distribution 10% to $0.85 per common unit while maintaining strong coverage of 1.6 times. We are committed to returning capital to unitholders and year-to-date we have returned $2.4 billion through our distributions. Our capital allocation framework remains unchanged, and we continue to expect the distribution will be our primary tool to return capital. Opportunistic repurchases of units held by the public also remain a tool to supplement capital returns. The growth of our cash flows and our strong balance sheet, including a quarter end cash balance of $960 million and leverage of 3.4 times, provides us with financial flexibility to optimize capital allocation. Now let me hand it back to Mike for some final thoughts.\nMichael Hennigan: Thanks, John. In closing, the growth of our cash flows continues to enable us to invest in and grow the business while supporting our commitment to return capital to unitholders. We continue to expect our distribution to be the primary return of capital tool. And with the recently announced 10% increase to the partnership's base distribution, MPC now receives $2.2 billion annually from MPLX's distributions, illustrating its strategic value as part of MPC's portfolio. As MPLX pursues its growth opportunities, we believe the value of this strategic relationship will continue to be enhanced. We are confident in our growth opportunities and ability to generate strong cash flows. By advancing our high-return growth projects anchored in the Marcellus and Permian Basins, along with our focus on cost and portfolio optimization, we intend to grow our cash flows, allowing us to reinvest in the business and return capital to unitholders. Now let me turn the call back over to Kristina.\nKristina Kazarian: Thanks, Mike. As we open the call for questions, we ask that you limit yourself to one question plus a follow-up. We may re-prompt for additional questions as time permits. And with that, Sheila, we're ready for the questions today.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Mackay with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJohn Mackay: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the time. I wanted to start on maybe the distribution increase last week. Maybe if you could just frame up for us how you were thinking about the 10% level, what that kind of means for cadence going forward? And if you could kind of touch about - touch on that in the context of leverage now being down at 3.4 [ph] versus the 4.0 [ph] ceiling? Thanks.\nJohn Quaid: Hey. Good morning, John. Thanks for the question. Yes, I think it all gets down to we've got a significant amount of financial flexibility here. I think as you can see where we stand as we've been very focused around our capital allocation to growth, but also making sure we're returning capital to unitholders. As you know, we've talked in the past, we stay very focused on where our coverage is and digging into that, very comfortable here with this increase staying at 1.6 times, certainly some capacity there. Again, very happy where the balance sheet is. But I think, as I think about - I'm sure Michael has some comments as well. I mean, that's not just return of but also looking for opportunities to invest and drive return on capital as well. So I think we're in a very comfortable spot. Happy to do 10% for the second year in a row and continue to be focused on both growing the partnership and also driving returns to unitholders.\nMichael Hennigan: And John, it's Mike. I'll just add that the way we think about it from an investor perspective is, at the end of the day, we're trading around a 9% yield roughly, and we've been saying to the market. And I think we've demonstrated in our results, we're going to continue to grow earnings somewhere around that mid-single digit. It will be a little stairsteppy. But if you look at our CAGR since 2019, it's been a little north of 6%. So as I think about the investment opportunity for people, our yield plus growth should give a pretty strong opportunity for people to invest in the equity. And the way we think about it, as John just said, is we're thinking about this over the longer term. We have a lot of financial flexibility right now. We have cash on the balance sheet, which is both blue bar and red bar. So we have more distribution growth capable. We have opportunistic capabilities. If we see more volatility come back into the equity, which we haven't seen for a little bit of time, but we'll see how that changes. But overall, we're trying to position ourselves as a good investment for people that are interested in the type of cash flows that we're generating. So hopefully, that gives you some perspective as the way to think about it from an investor angle.\nJohn Mackay: I appreciate that. Thanks. And maybe picking up on the themes of continuing to invest in the business, obviously, reiterated growth CapEx guidance for the year. We've also seen - I think if we look at third quarter, growth CapEx came in a little lighter than we would have been than we expected. Maybe you can just talk about the cadence of growth spending from here, where opportunities might sit beyond the project backlog you've announced so far? Thanks.\nJohn Quaid: Yes. Thanks, John. I'll jump in on that one. I think as we've said before to it, our capital doesn't - right, it tends to move quarter-to-quarter. So you're not going to see kind of ratable amounts again here this morning. We stated again, we're still looking around that $800 million of growth capital for this year. And again, in my remarks and on Slide 5, we've tried to summarize kind of the major projects we're working towards. We've got two processing plants, one in the Marcellus, one in the Permian, coming online in the first half of next year. We announced last quarter another processing plant in the Permian, which will be out in 2025, right? So you'll probably start to see us spend some money on that. And then we've got a number of the different JV pipeline projects that we're progressing as well. So again, I think you've asked before and we've said, hey, that plus or minus $1 billion of kind of run rate CapEx is probably a comfortable zone for us. And I think the opportunities kind of remain in those main basins. And then also, too, we also continue to look for opportunities around our large L&S footprint in support of MPC, where there are opportunities for us to find smaller bolt-on acquisitions where we can operate a midstream asset and MPC can commercially create value around that.\nOperator: Thank you...\nJohn Mackay: Appreciate the time. Thank you.\nJohn Quaid: Thanks, John. You're welcome.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Theresa Chen with Barclays. You may proceed.\nTheresa Chen: Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. John, maybe if I can touch on your last point about potential bolt-on acquisitions, especially at the asset level. We've received multiple announcements from some of your competitors and peers about wanting to disperse assets into the market. Are there particular areas along your infrastructure value chain that you find more attractive to invest in, given what's out in the market from companies today as well as potentially a piece of TMX later on?\nJohn Quaid: Theresa, I'll maybe ask Dave to chime in on that one.\nDavid Heppner: Theresa. So this is Dave. So yes, that's a great question. So as we look at opportunities to pursue, number one, we always look into high-quality assets that are aligned with our long-term strategies. And also provide the ability to integrate and capture synergies along our value chains, mainly around crude, nat gas and NGLs and also finally, of course, is a return of capital - return on capital, I'm sorry. They always have to give us the appropriate acceptable risk-adjusted return. So I think as you think through that, it's really - there's a lot of M&A out there, as you stated. We continue to look at them, but we're looking through the lens of strict capital discipline on those key tenants, high-quality assets and synergies and integration value. So that's kind of how we're thinking through it.\nJohn Quaid: And Theresa, it's John again. Maybe just to add on to that with some examples. And again, these are what we like to call kind of singles, maybe they're even bunts [ph] But - earlier this year, we were able to acquire some boats and barges to expand our marine fleet to provide increased flexibility to MPC on moving product. Last year, we had a rail facility near our Dickinson MPCs, Dickinson refinery that MPLX was able to acquire to move product there too. So that's the piece is that value of interacting with our sponsor or again, we can kind of find those. So I'd say it's across, as Dave said, that whole value chain, where do we - those are assets we know how to run and operate, and we've got a customer that needs them too. So I'd say it's around those kind of examples as well. Mike, did you want to...\nMichael Hennigan: Yes. Theresa, I'm going to add on to John's comment there. So obviously, on the calls, people like to hear big sexy [ph] projects, and that's not been our forte. But we have been investing in smaller - where we get a really good return for a little to no capital. As an example, we had record crude throughput it's not sexy to come out and say we added a pump here or something along those lines, but where you can deploy small amounts of capital and get large returns, we think those are really great opportunities for us. And the magnitude of the size of our asset base enables Shawn's team and Greg's team to look throughout all of our assets and come back. And even though the total capital number seems to some people to say, how are you getting this growth? Well, part of it is because we're getting some really good returns out of that deployment. And to me, that's part of the game that we're trying to do is get the highest possible returns out of the lowest capital deployment. And at the end of the day, to me, it still comes down to are you generating cash flows. And we feel very confident that at the end of the day, our cash flow generation is showing a consistent pattern that we think investors should find appealing. Hopefully, that's answering your question in a little bit more detail.\nTheresa Chen: It does. Thank you. And within the context of capital allocation, you have a healthy balance sheet, ample coverage, JV finance projects and the cash on your balance sheet is building to nearly $1 billion. Can you just remind us how much cash you want to keep on the balance sheet on a ratable basis? Should we just assume that the cash continues to build? What's the best uses of that cash over the near and medium term?\nJohn Quaid: Theresa, great question. I don't think we've really talked about kind of a targeted cash level for MPLX, right, as a kind of stable midstream entity. It's not something we've been focused on. I think for us, we've been focused on how do we optimize that capital allocation. How do we maintain that flexibility for both opportunities to invest in and grow the cash flows of the partnership and other opportunities to continue to grow our return of capital as well. So I think it's just been a spot of where we are, but we like that flexibility that it gives us for those two levers. Mike, would you...\nMichael Hennigan: Yes, Theresa, I'll add that it wasn't our desire. We didn't set out to say let's end up with $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet. What has disappeared a little bit from the market is the volatility in the unit price. We have a decent amount of that cash that I call red bar that's targeted to repurchase units. Now we haven't done that for a little bit of time. It's not that we've given up on that. We just have been surprised at how much tighter the equity price is traded. But if they're ready to deploy? Is it suboptimal? You could argue that sometimes, but we're getting a decent interest rate on it right at the moment as we sit here. So it's not hurting us real bad. And we're just looking for that opportunity. So it's ready to be deployed if we see what we call that opportunistic. At the same time, there's a portion of that cash that's what I call blue bar, which is there for the long term. And back to the question that was asked earlier, could we have pushed the distribution more? Yes, we could. We have the financial flexibility to do that. But in our opinion, what we're trying to do is convince investors that it's a good longer-term play. We're not just going to come out and bang it really high and then kind of disappear. We want to show people that we're going to generate cash flows very consistently. That's why you've heard me say over the last couple of quarters, we're going to do midstream, I mean, mid-single-digit growth. And it's not aspirational. We've been doing that since 2019. So that's part of what we're trying to convince the market is that we understand if you invest in us, that you want to get a good return, you want to see a growing distribution. We think 10% a couple of years in a row is a good number. By your question, you know that we have more financial capability to do more, and we can just decide to try and manage that over the long term. And if we get a little volatility in the equity, we'll deploy some repurchasing power as well.\nTheresa Chen: Thank you.\nMichael Hennigan: You're welcome.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Brian Reynolds with UBS. Your line is open.\nBrian Reynolds: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Maybe to follow up on some of the growth expectations for MPLX of which Permian is the large driver. While we've seen some of the activity in the Permian weekend as of late, the medium-term outlook for the Permian kind of remains intact with some forecast pointing to greater than 1 million barrels per day of growth from today through year-end '25. So kind of curious if maybe you can talk a little bit more macro, but it would be great if you could just talk Permian fundamentals from an MPLX perspective, and whether you're seeing some similar growth trends over a multiyear outlook at the MPLX level? Thanks.\nMichael Hennigan: Brian, it's a good question. I'm going to let Shawn talk a little bit about what were going on in the pipes, whether it's Wink to Webster or BANGL et cetera, I'll let them do it, and then let Greg talk a little bit about what we got going in the processing area. As you know, it is an area of focus for us, it's no secret that there's a lot of growth in the Permian. And we're just trying to enable our own ability to get in there and invest prudently and generate cash flows along with all the other competitors are trying to do the same. So Shawn, why don't you give a little more color on what we got going there?\nShawn Lyon: Sure. Hey, Brian, this is Shawn. Really, I'll first touch on our NGL pipeline BANGL. Last quarter, we talked about the expansion on that pipeline. And really, that's been a capital efficient pipeline for us. And as volume has come available, we've said we would announce the expansion, and we did that last quarter. So we're really pleased with that, and that will take us to the Sweeny hub there in Sweeny, Texas. The other Wink to Webster, if you look at that pipeline there, it continues to ramp up as per plan. And really, we're seeing those cash flows increase over the next couple of years as the commitments continue to ramp up. So again, really pleased with both those long-haul strategic pipelines. And again, they're measured, but they're steady and it's meeting the expectations we thought to return cash to the partnership.\nBrian Reynolds: Great. Thanks. And maybe to touch on the Permian natural gas takeaway. We continue to work through all available brownfield capacity here over the next, call it, 6 months to a year. But beyond that, more greenfield is needed. MPLX has some unique relationships there, but MPLX is in a much different position today than it was a few years ago, just given a much larger processing capacity position in its existing balance sheet. So kind of curious how MPLX's participation in future Permian natural gas takeaway or LNG supply made different a year or 2 from now versus how it participated in prior cycles? Thanks.\nJohn Quaid: Brian, it's John. I'll start and let some of the team jump in as well. As you know, really excited with our relationship there with the - resulted in the Whistler project, right, building that line, expanding it, adding lines to the end to get from Agua Dulce markets. We're a small player in the Matterhorn pipeline, right, coming online in third quarter '24, again, would have loved to have been a bigger player. But I think as you know, the way those work, your participation is driven by the producer volume you bring to the project. So we'll continue to look for those opportunities where it makes sense. But I'd also say, look, we've got a platform there right now that we can continue to optimize as well off of that base, whether, again, it's more straws on the front end or more pipe on the tail end to get the other end customer markets and other opportunities to expand there. So again, we remain really bullish the Permian.\nBrian Reynolds: Great. thanks. I'll leave it there.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nBharath Reddy: Hey, guys. This is Bharath Reddy on for Jeremy. I think in the past, you guys have discussed the potential for renewed Utica activity to improve processing plant utilization and flows on regional pipes such as Cornerstone. So just wondering if you could provide any updated thoughts here. Thanks.\nMichael Hennigan: Yes. Utica is an area, and I'll let Greg comment in a second. Like we were talking about earlier. We do have already deployed capital there and we have excess capacity. So going back to the question Theresa asked earlier, we love when that opportunity starts to present itself. Greg, why don't you give a little update there?\nGregory Floerke: Yes. This is Greg. The Utica is an area that had strong growth early on, along with the Marcellus and then some of the rigs moved from there more of the Marcellus now with sustainable crude prices and good levels. That's driven better prices for condensate and for the light oil in the western portion of the Utica window. So we are seeing more activity there and even new producers moving into the area and leasing acreage and starting to make plans. So we're excited to start to see some growth again in the Utica and volumes pick up there. And as Mike said, we've got capacity now that we can grow into by connecting pads and we essentially already have the gathering system and the processing capacity there to handle that.\nBharath Reddy: Got it. That's helpful. And I think previously discussed Capline as a potential midstream asset within the MPC portfolio that could kind of be dropped down. So just curious on updated thoughts on how MPC could drop down interest in remaining logistics assets?\nJohn Quaid: Yes, it's John. I'll take that. We've kind of said, look, we've got some assets, whether it's Capline, Gray Oak, as some other midstream-type assets that are up on the sponsor's balance sheet. I think right now, we're kind of - we can save those for a rainy day, not something that's really on the front burner for us, but it certainly gives us some optionality looking out into the future.\nBharath Reddy: Great. Thanks.\nJohn Quaid: You're welcome.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. You may proceed.\nKeith Stanley: Hi. Good morning. Two follow-up questions. First, on the Permian. Are you considering larger opportunities at all to expand the value chain further downstream? Or do you think your strategy will stay focused on processing plants and pipelines?\nJohn Quaid: No, no, great question, Keith. I appreciate it. We've said, look, we'll continue to look at where we might be able to participate up and down that whole value chain. Certainly, to date, right, it's been on the processing side and then the takeaway capacity. But we like participating in that, and if there's more opportunities to touch the molecule along that chain. That's something we can certainly consider and take a look at.\nKeith Stanley: Great. Second one, just on the distribution, just to clarify, is there an ultimate level of kind of long-term cash flow coverage you would look at? Or any other metric that you think could help investors think about multiyear distribution growth relative to the growth you expect in the underlying business?\nJohn Quaid: No, it's a great question, Keith. I appreciate it. I mean it's one, we haven't given a framework. We've talked more conceptually about it. You heard Mike talk a little bit about red bar and blue bar cash flows. So we really dig into our results to understand what's that year in and year out stable cash flow that we call blue bar when we think about where the distribution is and where we might want to head. I would just say, I think we've got ample capacity there as we look forward to manage that. And again, we want to continue to keep growing the cash flows at kind of that plus or minus mid-single digits as well, which should drive an opportunity around distribution growth.\nMichael Hennigan: Keith, it's Mike. I'll repeat what I said earlier a little bit as I think about it from an investor standpoint, what type of return is the investor getting if they invest in us. So - so I look at our - where we're going to trade from a yield standpoint. Again, we personally think we should trade a little lower in yield, but the market has kept us around that around 9% or so, somewhere in that range. And then we look at the growth and try and put ourselves in a position that we offer the market a good total return opportunity. So that's the way I think about it long term. We kind of evaluate where the market is going to trade us. We think out in time as to where that distribution needs to be to be one part of the equation. We think of how much cash flows need to grow to be part of that equation. And then we kind of manage it across time, if that makes sense to you. And kind of like people have asked earlier, we didn't set out to have $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet. That wasn't a stated goal. It's kind of the way the market has played out for us. We're not opposed to it. Financial flexibility is not a bad thing. It's just the way it's played out that we haven't gotten to deploy some of the repurchasing that we would have liked up until this point. And like I said, we have more capacity on the blue side, but we want to make sure investors see it as a better long-term investment.\nKeith Stanley: Got it. Thank you.\nMichael Hennigan: You're welcome.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nMichael Blum: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I just had two quick questions really. One, I'm sure you're aware there's been many NGL pipeline expansion announcements out of the Permian. So just can you remind us if your - the BANGL expansion is contracted? And second question is in the L&S segment. You had a big increase in the average pipeline tariff year-over-year 13%. How much of that was just driven by the inflation escalators? Or are there other factors contributing to that really big increase? Thanks.\nMichael Hennigan: Hey. Michael, good morning. Thanks for the questions. I'll maybe take the first one and then pass it over to Shawn. So when you think about BANGL, we certainly have dedications to that line, but right, you're not going to have commitments on a natural gas liquids line. But we do look and see, you can kind of imply those same producers do have commitments, for example, on natural gas takeaway lines. So we know they're committed there. It gives us some comfort on how the volume might flow through BANGL. But typical with NGL lines, right, it's dedications not commitments. And I'll leave it - turn it to Shawn for the first question.\nShawn Lyon: Hey, Michael, this is Sean. Thanks for the question. Really, if you look at our average tariff pipeline average pipeline tariff, it's around the 13%. It just so happens that, that's exactly the FERC rate that we announced - that FERC announced July 1. But that just happens to be the same right there. It's really due to the tariff mix that it just happens on the pipelines that we use the most on our increased throughput that helped drive that. The other piece I would say that is something that we try to make sure that people are aware of FERC-directed - directly FERC tied to our assets. It's only about 20% of our overall NPLX EBITDA is tied to the FERC index there. So hopefully, that gives you a little more color on your question there as far as the FERC rate there.\nMichael Hennigan: And Michael, it's Mike. I'll just add that, obviously, what FERC is trying to do is to look at all those impacts that are raising costs and they're hitting us as well. And what we do as a team is to say we got to be better than that average. We've got to look for opportunities for us where we can run it at a lower cost compared to where the average of the industry is. And in that way, we'll create a little bit of value. But our costs definitely move up with those impacts, and we try and optimize around that.\nMichael Blum: Perfect. Thank you.\nMichael Hennigan: You're welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Irwin with Citi. Your line is open.\nDoug Irwin: Hi. Thanks for the question. Just another on the balance sheet. Looking at Slide 10 in the earnings presentation. It looks like you have almost $3 billion of debt maturing over the next couple of years. I'm just curious if you could talk about how you're thinking about the securities here in the high rate environment, particularly in the context of all the cash you have on the balance sheet and already being below your leverage target?\nJohn Quaid: Yes. Hey, Doug, it's John. Thanks for the question. Yes, we've got, what, about $1.150 billion [ph] due December of next year and then the next several years at plus or minus $1 billion, $1.4 billion [ph] So I think as you've seen us in the recent past, we'll look to be thoughtful about how we do that. Certainly, you're spot on, given where rates are today versus the last refinancing we did. Again, we've got some financial flexibility there. And I'd say it's not only the cash on our balance sheet, but we've got revolver with our parent as well, which gives us some flexibility to be thoughtful about the right time to look to refinance.\nDoug Irwin: Got it. Thanks. And then you talked about potential growth opportunities with MPC. And I think one that came up last quarter was hydrogen. And I think MPC is involved in at least one of the hydrogen hubs that was just selected for funding negotiations. Wondering if you could kind of talk about what you see MPLX's potential role being here and maybe just help frame that opportunity to that.\nDavid Heppner: Yes, Doug, this is Dave. So yes, you are correct, actually. Of the 7 hydrogen hubs that received DOE funding at $7 billion, MPC/MPLX is involved in 2 of those. One in Appalachia and one end one in the Heartland. And so specifically around MPLX involvement, it's going to be more around the storage and transportation of hydrogen and CO2 rather than constructing hydrogen production facilities. That would be more on the MPC side of the equation. The last piece I'll leave you with, why all these projects have received DOE funding. That's just the first step. It's a big milestone, first of all. It's good to get narrowed down and secure the funds from the DOE. But that's the first step in a long journey to secure the agreements with DOE, design and construct the project. So we'll talk more about these into next year, but I appreciate you bringing that up. And like I say, we're excited on the first step of receiving funding on those 2 projects.\nDoug Irwin: Great. Thanks.\nDavid Heppner: You're welcome.\nOperator: And our final question will come from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nNeal Dingmann: Good morning, guys. Thanks for getting me in. You've talked around this and my first question, maybe just around general activity thoughts. I'm just wondering, is the long-term production outlook for your G&P producer customers, would you all consider that as good today as you thought it would be at the beginning of the year or maybe even it sounds like it would be slightly better than you initially expected. Just wondering sort of general thoughts.\nGregory Floerke: Neal, this is Greg. I would say that if you look at a year ago where prices were, they were about double on gas and NGLs. And a lot of the forecast was built around some expectation of that as the prices came down, we did see some slowing of growth in terms of rig activity and bringing new pads on. So yes, I think that, that was expected based on the pricing changes, but we have been seeing growth maybe beyond even what you would expect. And I think that shows that people are still very - producers are still bullish on where pricing is going with the LNG plants that are going to come online over the next couple of years. NGL prices have been supportive. And really, the production - drilling and production costs have come down as the producers are drilling longer laterals. That brings more volume in faster and it keeps the cost level below even where some of the lower prices are. So yes, we have seen growth single-digit low to medium single-digit across most of the basins, and that's been really good to see.\nNeal Dingmann: That's great detail. And then just my second, maybe just around your capital program, specifically, given the - it sounds like just continuous efficiencies you all see, would you expect maybe going forward, that maintenance capital declined slightly from the current 150 level?\nJohn Quaid: Neal, it's John. I don't know that I'd expect the change in maintenance capital, right? When we think about our capital allocation framework, that first kind of step is making sure we're investing to maintain the safety and reliability of our assets. So I don't know that I'd expect a change there.\nNeal Dingmann: Okay. Thank you, all. Appreciate it.\nJohn Quaid: You're welcome.\nA - Kristina Kazarian: All right. Sheila. Well, if there's nobody else in the queue. Thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in MPLX. Should you have additional questions or would you like clarification on any of the topics discussed today. Members of the Investor Relations team will be available to take your call. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "John Quaid",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. As you can see on Slide 5, MPLX has a strong history of growing its cash flows by executing the strategic priorities Mike just highlighted. Looking back over the last 3 years, you can see that our growth comes in stair steps as we develop and bring projects online. And through the first 9 months of this year, distributable cash flow has grown over 6% versus the prior year. We are progressing our 2023 capital program, which remains forecasted at $950 million, including $800 million of growth capital and $150 million of maintenance capital. In the L&S segment, our joint venture natural gas, crude and NGL pipeline projects in the Permian are progressing. Whistler's expansion, the 2.5 billion cubic feet per day was completed at the end of the third quarter, and we're seeing strong demand for the natural gas pipeline. Construction is progressing on the associated Agua Dulce Corpus Christi Pipeline lateral, which is expected to be in service in the third quarter of 2024. On the Wink to Webster crude pipeline, we expect volumes to ramp over the next 2 years as the pipeline continues to play segments into service. Turning to our participation in the NGL value chain. We are progressing the expansion of the BANGL pipeline to about 200,000 barrels per day, which is expected to be completed in the first half of 2025. The capital-efficient expansion of this long-haul pipeline is supported by existing and growing demand for NGL takeaway from the Permian's Delaware and Midland Basins to the fractionation hub in Sweeny, Texas. All of these projects are largely financed at the JV level, and therefore, our portion of the JV finance capital spending is not reflected in our capital outlook. In the G&P segment, we remain focused on growth investments in the Permian and Marcellus basins in response to producer demand. We are bringing online new gas processing plants in the Permian Delaware Basin to meet increasing demand while targeting strong returns with strict capital discipline. We're progressing construction of Preakness II, which we expect to be online in the first half of 2024. And announced last quarter, we would be building our seventh gas processing plant in the basin Secretariat, which is expected to be online in the second half of 2025. Once operational, these plants will bring our total processing capacity in the Delaware Basin up to 1.4 Bcf per day. In the Marcellus Basin, we are also advancing construction of the Harmon Creek II gas processing plant, which we expect will be online in the first half of 2024. Slide 6 outlines the third quarter operational and financial performance highlights for our Logistics & Storage segment. The L&S segment reported its third consecutive quarter with $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA. L&S segment adjusted EBITDA increased $122 million when compared to third quarter '22, primarily driven by higher rates and throughputs, including growth from equity affiliates. Third quarter 2023 segment adjusted EBITDA excludes Garyville incident response cost of $63 million. Crude pipeline volumes were up 9% and represent a new quarterly record for the partnership as we grew crude oil throughputs through expansion and debottlenecking activities. Product pipeline volumes were down 9%, driven by less favorable market dynamics and effects from Marathon's refinery downtime. Terminal volumes were up 7% due to higher customer demand, including effects from Marathon's refinery turnarounds in both quarters. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we do expect some headwinds of approximately $30 million to $40 million to sequential L&S segment results from lower throughput volumes as a result of MPC's planned turnaround activity, as well as higher operating expenses due to the timing of maintenance projects. Moving to our Gathering & Processing segment on Slide 7. G&P segment adjusted EBITDA increased $3 million compared to third quarter 2022 as the benefits of higher volumes and throughput fees were offset by lower NGL prices. While our G&P segment is largely a fee-based business, we do have some direct sensitivity to natural gas liquids prices. For the quarter, NGL prices averaged $0.68 per gallon as compared to $1.01 in the third quarter of 2022, resulting in a $32 million unfavorable effect. Total gathered volumes were up 3% year-over-year due to increased production in the Permian and the Marcellus. Processing volumes were up 5% year-over-year, primarily from higher volumes in the Marcellus and Permian, driven by increased customer demand and our investment in Permian processing capacity. Focusing in on the Marcellus, by far, our largest basin of operations, we saw year-over-year volume increases of 4% for gathering and 5% for processing, driven by increased customer demand and fractionation volumes grew 10%, primarily due to increases to our fractionation capacity to meet in-basin demand for ethane. Moving to our third quarter financial highlights on Slide 8. Total adjusted EBITDA of $1.6 billion and distributable cash flow of $1.4 billion increased 8.5% and 8.6%, respectively, from the prior year. As Mike discussed, based on our confidence in the continued growth of our cash flows, we increased the base distribution 10% to $0.85 per common unit while maintaining strong coverage of 1.6 times. We are committed to returning capital to unitholders and year-to-date we have returned $2.4 billion through our distributions. Our capital allocation framework remains unchanged, and we continue to expect the distribution will be our primary tool to return capital. Opportunistic repurchases of units held by the public also remain a tool to supplement capital returns. The growth of our cash flows and our strong balance sheet, including a quarter end cash balance of $960 million and leverage of 3.4 times, provides us with financial flexibility to optimize capital allocation. Now let me hand it back to Mike for some final thoughts. Hey. Good morning, John. Thanks for the question. Yes, I think it all gets down to we've got a significant amount of financial flexibility here. I think as you can see where we stand as we've been very focused around our capital allocation to growth, but also making sure we're returning capital to unitholders. As you know, we've talked in the past, we stay very focused on where our coverage is and digging into that, very comfortable here with this increase staying at 1.6 times, certainly some capacity there. Again, very happy where the balance sheet is. But I think, as I think about - I'm sure Michael has some comments as well. I mean, that's not just return of but also looking for opportunities to invest and drive return on capital as well. So I think we're in a very comfortable spot. Happy to do 10% for the second year in a row and continue to be focused on both growing the partnership and also driving returns to unitholders. Yes. Thanks, John. I'll jump in on that one. I think as we've said before to it, our capital doesn't - right, it tends to move quarter-to-quarter. So you're not going to see kind of ratable amounts again here this morning. We stated again, we're still looking around that $800 million of growth capital for this year. And again, in my remarks and on Slide 5, we've tried to summarize kind of the major projects we're working towards. We've got two processing plants, one in the Marcellus, one in the Permian, coming online in the first half of next year. We announced last quarter another processing plant in the Permian, which will be out in 2025, right? So you'll probably start to see us spend some money on that. And then we've got a number of the different JV pipeline projects that we're progressing as well. So again, I think you've asked before and we've said, hey, that plus or minus $1 billion of kind of run rate CapEx is probably a comfortable zone for us. And I think the opportunities kind of remain in those main basins. And then also, too, we also continue to look for opportunities around our large L&S footprint in support of MPC, where there are opportunities for us to find smaller bolt-on acquisitions where we can operate a midstream asset and MPC can commercially create value around that. Thanks, John. You're welcome. Theresa, I'll maybe ask Dave to chime in on that one. And Theresa, it's John again. Maybe just to add on to that with some examples. And again, these are what we like to call kind of singles, maybe they're even bunts [ph] But - earlier this year, we were able to acquire some boats and barges to expand our marine fleet to provide increased flexibility to MPC on moving product. Last year, we had a rail facility near our Dickinson MPCs, Dickinson refinery that MPLX was able to acquire to move product there too. So that's the piece is that value of interacting with our sponsor or again, we can kind of find those. So I'd say it's across, as Dave said, that whole value chain, where do we - those are assets we know how to run and operate, and we've got a customer that needs them too. So I'd say it's around those kind of examples as well. Mike, did you want to... Theresa, great question. I don't think we've really talked about kind of a targeted cash level for MPLX, right, as a kind of stable midstream entity. It's not something we've been focused on. I think for us, we've been focused on how do we optimize that capital allocation. How do we maintain that flexibility for both opportunities to invest in and grow the cash flows of the partnership and other opportunities to continue to grow our return of capital as well. So I think it's just been a spot of where we are, but we like that flexibility that it gives us for those two levers. Mike, would you... Brian, it's John. I'll start and let some of the team jump in as well. As you know, really excited with our relationship there with the - resulted in the Whistler project, right, building that line, expanding it, adding lines to the end to get from Agua Dulce markets. We're a small player in the Matterhorn pipeline, right, coming online in third quarter '24, again, would have loved to have been a bigger player. But I think as you know, the way those work, your participation is driven by the producer volume you bring to the project. So we'll continue to look for those opportunities where it makes sense. But I'd also say, look, we've got a platform there right now that we can continue to optimize as well off of that base, whether, again, it's more straws on the front end or more pipe on the tail end to get the other end customer markets and other opportunities to expand there. So again, we remain really bullish the Permian. Yes, it's John. I'll take that. We've kind of said, look, we've got some assets, whether it's Capline, Gray Oak, as some other midstream-type assets that are up on the sponsor's balance sheet. I think right now, we're kind of - we can save those for a rainy day, not something that's really on the front burner for us, but it certainly gives us some optionality looking out into the future. You're welcome. No, no, great question, Keith. I appreciate it. We've said, look, we'll continue to look at where we might be able to participate up and down that whole value chain. Certainly, to date, right, it's been on the processing side and then the takeaway capacity. But we like participating in that, and if there's more opportunities to touch the molecule along that chain. That's something we can certainly consider and take a look at. No, it's a great question, Keith. I appreciate it. I mean it's one, we haven't given a framework. We've talked more conceptually about it. You heard Mike talk a little bit about red bar and blue bar cash flows. So we really dig into our results to understand what's that year in and year out stable cash flow that we call blue bar when we think about where the distribution is and where we might want to head. I would just say, I think we've got ample capacity there as we look forward to manage that. And again, we want to continue to keep growing the cash flows at kind of that plus or minus mid-single digits as well, which should drive an opportunity around distribution growth. Yes. Hey, Doug, it's John. Thanks for the question. Yes, we've got, what, about $1.150 billion [ph] due December of next year and then the next several years at plus or minus $1 billion, $1.4 billion [ph] So I think as you've seen us in the recent past, we'll look to be thoughtful about how we do that. Certainly, you're spot on, given where rates are today versus the last refinancing we did. Again, we've got some financial flexibility there. And I'd say it's not only the cash on our balance sheet, but we've got revolver with our parent as well, which gives us some flexibility to be thoughtful about the right time to look to refinance. Neal, it's John. I don't know that I'd expect the change in maintenance capital, right? When we think about our capital allocation framework, that first kind of step is making sure we're investing to maintain the safety and reliability of our assets. So I don't know that I'd expect a change there. You're welcome."

            "content": "Sure. Hey, Brian, this is Shawn. Really, I'll first touch on our NGL pipeline BANGL. Last quarter, we talked about the expansion on that pipeline. And really, that's been a capital efficient pipeline for us. And as volume has come available, we've said we would announce the expansion, and we did that last quarter. So we're really pleased with that, and that will take us to the Sweeny hub there in Sweeny, Texas. The other Wink to Webster, if you look at that pipeline there, it continues to ramp up as per plan. And really, we're seeing those cash flows increase over the next couple of years as the commitments continue to ramp up. So again, really pleased with both those long-haul strategic pipelines. And again, they're measured, but they're steady and it's meeting the expectations we thought to return cash to the partnership. Hey, Michael, this is Sean. Thanks for the question. Really, if you look at our average tariff pipeline average pipeline tariff, it's around the 13%. It just so happens that, that's exactly the FERC rate that we announced - that FERC announced July 1. But that just happens to be the same right there. It's really due to the tariff mix that it just happens on the pipelines that we use the most on our increased throughput that helped drive that. The other piece I would say that is something that we try to make sure that people are aware of FERC-directed - directly FERC tied to our assets. It's only about 20% of our overall NPLX EBITDA is tied to the FERC index there. So hopefully, that gives you a little more color on your question there as far as the FERC rate there."

            "name": "David Heppner",
            "content": "Theresa. So this is Dave. So yes, that's a great question. So as we look at opportunities to pursue, number one, we always look into high-quality assets that are aligned with our long-term strategies. And also provide the ability to integrate and capture synergies along our value chains, mainly around crude, nat gas and NGLs and also finally, of course, is a return of capital - return on capital, I'm sorry. They always have to give us the appropriate acceptable risk-adjusted return. So I think as you think through that, it's really - there's a lot of M&A out there, as you stated. We continue to look at them, but we're looking through the lens of strict capital discipline on those key tenants, high-quality assets and synergies and integration value. So that's kind of how we're thinking through it. Yes, Doug, this is Dave. So yes, you are correct, actually. Of the 7 hydrogen hubs that received DOE funding at $7 billion, MPC/MPLX is involved in 2 of those. One in Appalachia and one end one in the Heartland. And so specifically around MPLX involvement, it's going to be more around the storage and transportation of hydrogen and CO2 rather than constructing hydrogen production facilities. That would be more on the MPC side of the equation. The last piece I'll leave you with, why all these projects have received DOE funding. That's just the first step. It's a big milestone, first of all. It's good to get narrowed down and secure the funds from the DOE. But that's the first step in a long journey to secure the agreements with DOE, design and construct the project. So we'll talk more about these into next year, but I appreciate you bringing that up. And like I say, we're excited on the first step of receiving funding on those 2 projects. You're welcome."

            "name": "Michael Hennigan",
            "content": "Thanks, Kristina. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call. Earlier today, we reported third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $1.6 billion and distributable cash flow of $1.4 billion, each set a new quarterly record for MPLX with both increasing over 8% year-over-year. Our L&S business set a new record for crude pipeline throughput and saw strong terminal throughputs, demonstrating the value of our relationship with MPC. In our G&P business, we saw record throughput in our processing and fractionation operations driven mainly by our assets in the Permian and Marcellus basins. Our long-term production outlook for our G&P producer customers in our key basins remains largely unchanged. In our largest basin, the Marcellus, the cost to develop remains at the low end of the cost curve and still below current commodity prices, we expect to see maintenance level drilling activity continue. While in the Permian, crude prices remained strong and prices for associated gas do not significantly impact producer activity. Our integrated footprint in these basins position the partnership with a steady source of growth opportunities. For the second year in a row, based on the strength and continued growth of our cash flows, last week, we announced a 10% increase in the partnership's distribution, which now stands at $3.40 per unit on an annualized basis. We're committed to returning capital to unitholders and expect our distribution to be the primary return of capital tool supplemented with opportunistic repurchases. We are well positioned to optimize return of capital given the strength of the business and our balance sheet. Our position on MPLX and its structure is unchanged. MPLX is a strategic investment for MPC, which now expects to receive $2.2 billion in annual cash flows via the distribution. MPC believes that its current capital allocation priorities are optimal for its shareholders and MPC does not plan to roll up MPLX. We remain confident in our ability to grow the partnership and our focus on executing the strategic priorities of strict capital discipline, fostering a low-cost culture and optimizing our asset portfolio, all of which are foundational to the continued growth of MPLX's cash flows. Now let me turn the call over to John to discuss our growth as well as our operational and financial results for the quarter. Thanks, John. In closing, the growth of our cash flows continues to enable us to invest in and grow the business while supporting our commitment to return capital to unitholders. We continue to expect our distribution to be the primary return of capital tool. And with the recently announced 10% increase to the partnership's base distribution, MPC now receives $2.2 billion annually from MPLX's distributions, illustrating its strategic value as part of MPC's portfolio. As MPLX pursues its growth opportunities, we believe the value of this strategic relationship will continue to be enhanced. We are confident in our growth opportunities and ability to generate strong cash flows. By advancing our high-return growth projects anchored in the Marcellus and Permian Basins, along with our focus on cost and portfolio optimization, we intend to grow our cash flows, allowing us to reinvest in the business and return capital to unitholders. Now let me turn the call back over to Kristina. And John, it's Mike. I'll just add that the way we think about it from an investor perspective is, at the end of the day, we're trading around a 9% yield roughly, and we've been saying to the market. And I think we've demonstrated in our results, we're going to continue to grow earnings somewhere around that mid-single digit. It will be a little stairsteppy. But if you look at our CAGR since 2019, it's been a little north of 6%. So as I think about the investment opportunity for people, our yield plus growth should give a pretty strong opportunity for people to invest in the equity. And the way we think about it, as John just said, is we're thinking about this over the longer term. We have a lot of financial flexibility right now. We have cash on the balance sheet, which is both blue bar and red bar. So we have more distribution growth capable. We have opportunistic capabilities. If we see more volatility come back into the equity, which we haven't seen for a little bit of time, but we'll see how that changes. But overall, we're trying to position ourselves as a good investment for people that are interested in the type of cash flows that we're generating. So hopefully, that gives you some perspective as the way to think about it from an investor angle. Yes. Theresa, I'm going to add on to John's comment there. So obviously, on the calls, people like to hear big sexy [ph] projects, and that's not been our forte. But we have been investing in smaller - where we get a really good return for a little to no capital. As an example, we had record crude throughput it's not sexy to come out and say we added a pump here or something along those lines, but where you can deploy small amounts of capital and get large returns, we think those are really great opportunities for us. And the magnitude of the size of our asset base enables Shawn's team and Greg's team to look throughout all of our assets and come back. And even though the total capital number seems to some people to say, how are you getting this growth? Well, part of it is because we're getting some really good returns out of that deployment. And to me, that's part of the game that we're trying to do is get the highest possible returns out of the lowest capital deployment. And at the end of the day, to me, it still comes down to are you generating cash flows. And we feel very confident that at the end of the day, our cash flow generation is showing a consistent pattern that we think investors should find appealing. Hopefully, that's answering your question in a little bit more detail. Yes, Theresa, I'll add that it wasn't our desire. We didn't set out to say let's end up with $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet. What has disappeared a little bit from the market is the volatility in the unit price. We have a decent amount of that cash that I call red bar that's targeted to repurchase units. Now we haven't done that for a little bit of time. It's not that we've given up on that. We just have been surprised at how much tighter the equity price is traded. But if they're ready to deploy? Is it suboptimal? You could argue that sometimes, but we're getting a decent interest rate on it right at the moment as we sit here. So it's not hurting us real bad. And we're just looking for that opportunity. So it's ready to be deployed if we see what we call that opportunistic. At the same time, there's a portion of that cash that's what I call blue bar, which is there for the long term. And back to the question that was asked earlier, could we have pushed the distribution more? Yes, we could. We have the financial flexibility to do that. But in our opinion, what we're trying to do is convince investors that it's a good longer-term play. We're not just going to come out and bang it really high and then kind of disappear. We want to show people that we're going to generate cash flows very consistently. That's why you've heard me say over the last couple of quarters, we're going to do midstream, I mean, mid-single-digit growth. And it's not aspirational. We've been doing that since 2019. So that's part of what we're trying to convince the market is that we understand if you invest in us, that you want to get a good return, you want to see a growing distribution. We think 10% a couple of years in a row is a good number. By your question, you know that we have more financial capability to do more, and we can just decide to try and manage that over the long term. And if we get a little volatility in the equity, we'll deploy some repurchasing power as well. You're welcome. Brian, it's a good question. I'm going to let Shawn talk a little bit about what were going on in the pipes, whether it's Wink to Webster or BANGL et cetera, I'll let them do it, and then let Greg talk a little bit about what we got going in the processing area. As you know, it is an area of focus for us, it's no secret that there's a lot of growth in the Permian. And we're just trying to enable our own ability to get in there and invest prudently and generate cash flows along with all the other competitors are trying to do the same. So Shawn, why don't you give a little more color on what we got going there? Yes. Utica is an area, and I'll let Greg comment in a second. Like we were talking about earlier. We do have already deployed capital there and we have excess capacity. So going back to the question Theresa asked earlier, we love when that opportunity starts to present itself. Greg, why don't you give a little update there? Keith, it's Mike. I'll repeat what I said earlier a little bit as I think about it from an investor standpoint, what type of return is the investor getting if they invest in us. So - so I look at our - where we're going to trade from a yield standpoint. Again, we personally think we should trade a little lower in yield, but the market has kept us around that around 9% or so, somewhere in that range. And then we look at the growth and try and put ourselves in a position that we offer the market a good total return opportunity. So that's the way I think about it long term. We kind of evaluate where the market is going to trade us. We think out in time as to where that distribution needs to be to be one part of the equation. We think of how much cash flows need to grow to be part of that equation. And then we kind of manage it across time, if that makes sense to you. And kind of like people have asked earlier, we didn't set out to have $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet. That wasn't a stated goal. It's kind of the way the market has played out for us. We're not opposed to it. Financial flexibility is not a bad thing. It's just the way it's played out that we haven't gotten to deploy some of the repurchasing that we would have liked up until this point. And like I said, we have more capacity on the blue side, but we want to make sure investors see it as a better long-term investment. You're welcome. Hey. Michael, good morning. Thanks for the questions. I'll maybe take the first one and then pass it over to Shawn. So when you think about BANGL, we certainly have dedications to that line, but right, you're not going to have commitments on a natural gas liquids line. But we do look and see, you can kind of imply those same producers do have commitments, for example, on natural gas takeaway lines. So we know they're committed there. It gives us some comfort on how the volume might flow through BANGL. But typical with NGL lines, right, it's dedications not commitments. And I'll leave it - turn it to Shawn for the first question. And Michael, it's Mike. I'll just add that, obviously, what FERC is trying to do is to look at all those impacts that are raising costs and they're hitting us as well. And what we do as a team is to say we got to be better than that average. We've got to look for opportunities for us where we can run it at a lower cost compared to where the average of the industry is. And in that way, we'll create a little bit of value. But our costs definitely move up with those impacts, and we try and optimize around that. You're welcome."

[Operator Instructions].Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.\nKristina Kazarian: Good morning, and welcome to the MPLX Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at mplx.com under the Investor tab. Joining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan, Chairman and CEO; John Quaid, CFO; and other members of the executive team. We invite you to read the safe harbor statements and non-GAAP disclaimer on Slide 2. It\u2019s a reminder that we\u2019ll be making forward-looking statements during the call and during the question-and-answer session that follows. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike.\nMichael Hennigan: Thanks, Kristina. Good morning and thank you for joining our call. Earlier today, we reported second quarter results. Our business delivered adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion, an increase of 5% year-over-year and a new quarterly record. Distributable cash flow of nearly $1.3 billion was up 6% versus the second quarter of last year and was also a new record. We continue to see strength in our base business and contributions from our growth capital investments driving DCF for the first half of the year up 6% as compared to last year. We also remain focussed on return of capital. We continue to expect our distribution to be the primary return of capital tool supplemented with opportunistic repurchases. Based on the strength of the business and our balance sheet we are well positioned to continue to optimize return of capital. While natural gas and NGL prices are lower than last year, our long-term production outlook for our G&P producer customers in our key basins remains largely unchanged. In our largest base in the Marcellus the cost of develop remains at the low end of the cost curve and still below current commodity prices and we expect to see maintenance level drilling activity continue. The recent U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision to allow the MVP pipeline construction to continue in support of for natural gas development in the region. In the Permian, our production outlook is unchanged as crude prices remain strong and prices for associated gas do not significantly impact producer activity. Our integrated footprints in these resilient basins position the partnership with a steady source of earnings and growth opportunities. This quarter, we advanced our natural gas and NGL value chain strategies with the announcement of new projects in the Permian. We remain confident in our ability to grow and are focused on executing the strategic priorities of strict capital discipline, fostering a low cost culture and optimizing our asset portfolio all of which are foundational to the continued growth of MPLXs cash flows. We continue to enhance our ESG commitment and disclosures with the publication of both our annual sustainability and prospectus on climate related scenario reports. We continue to make progress on our 2030 target to reduce mid-stream methane emission intensity 75% from 2016 levels. To our focus on methane program, we have implemented measures that have achieved approximately 10,000 tons per year of methane emissions reduction. We also continue progressing our biodiversity target to apply sustainable landscapes to 10,000 acres of pipeline rightaways by the end of 2025. Through last year, we\u2019ve achieved over 10% of this target. MPLX is also participating in alliances focussed on CCUS and hydrogen hubs. We will continue to evaluate low carbon opportunities where we can leverage technologies that are complimentary with our asset footprint and expertise. We continue to challenge ourselves to lead in sustainable energy by meeting the needs of today while investing in an energy diverse future that creates share value for all our stakeholders. Now let me turn the call over to John to discuss our growth as well as our operational and financial results for the quarter.\nJohn Quaid: Thanks Mike. As Mike referenced in his remarks, MPLX has a strong history of successfully executing the strategic priorities of strict capital discipline, fostering a low cost culture and optimizing our asset portfolio, all of which are foundational to the growth of MPLXs cash flows. And through the first half of this year, distributable cash flow has grown 6% year-over-year. Looking back over the last three years as you can see on slide 5, our growth is not linear but instead tends the common stair steps as we develop and bring projects online. For 2023, our capital program outlook remains at $950 million, including $800 million of growth capital and $150 million of maintenance capital. In the L&S segment, our joint venture projects in the Permian are progressing. We see strong demand for the Whistler natural gas pipeline and its expansion to 2.5 billion cubic feet per day, which remains on schedule for completion in September. We\u2019re also planning to expand the BANGL joint venture pipeline to 200,000 barrels per day as we look to grow our participation in the NGL value chain. The capital-efficient expansion of this long-haul pipeline is supported by existing and growing demand for NGL takeaway from the Permian\u2019s Delaware and Midland basins to the fractionation hub in Sweeney, Texas. We expect the expansion to be completed in the first half of 2025. On the Wink-to-Webster crude pipeline, we expect volumes to ramp this year and over the next two years as the pipeline continues to place segments in service. And as a reminder, these three projects, Whistler, BANGL, and Wink-to-Webster, are largely financed at the JV level, and therefore, our portion of the debt-financed capital spending is not reflected in our capital outlook. In the G&P segment, we remain focused on growth investments in the Permian and Marcellus basins in response to producer demand. In the Permian\u2019s Delaware basin, we continue to bring online new gas processing plants to meet increasing customer demand while targeting strong returns with strict capital discipline. Our Tornado II processing plant began service at the end of last year, and we are advancing construction of Preakness II, which we expect to be online in the first half of 2024. We recently approved plans to build our seventh gas processing plant in the basin, Secretariat, which is expected online in the second half of 2025. This will bring our total processing capacity in the Delaware basin up to 1.4 bcf per day. In the Marcellus basin, we are also progressing construction of the Harmon Creek II gas processing plant, which we expect will come online in the first half of 2024. Slide 6 outlines the second quarter operational and financial performance highlights for our logistics and storage segment. The L&S segment reported its second consecutive $1 billion adjusted EBITDA quarter. L&S segment adjusted EBITDA increased $56 million when compared to second quarter 2022, primarily driven by higher rates and growth in total throughputs. Crude pipeline volumes were up 4% and represent a new quarterly record for the partnership as we grew crudal throughputs through expansion and debottlenecking activities. Product pipeline volumes were down 6%, driven by more favorable market dynamics in the second quarter of last year and effects from Marathon\u2019s refinery turnarounds. Terminal volumes were up 3% due to effects associated with Marathon\u2019s refinery turnarounds in both quarters. Moving to our Gathering And Processing Segment on slide 7, G&P segment adjusted EBITDA increased $18 million compared to the second quarter of 2022, as the benefits of higher volumes and throughput fees were offset by lower NGL prices. While our G&P segment is largely a fee-based business, we do have some direct sensitivity to natural gas liquids prices. For the quarter, NGL prices averaged $0.63 per gallon as compared to $1.18 in the second quarter of 2022, resulting in a roughly $50 million headwind for the results. Total Gathering volumes were up 9% year-over-year due to increased production in the Utica and the Permian. Processing volumes were up 6% year-over-year, primarily from higher volumes in the Marcellus and Permian, driven by increased customer demand and our investment in Permian processing capacity. Focusing in on the Marcellus, by far our largest basin of G&P operations, we saw year-over-year volume increases of 3% for Gathering and 5% for Processing, driven by increased customer demand. Fractionation volumes grew 10%, primarily due to recent increases to our fractionation capacity to meet in-basin demand for ethane. Our capital allocation framework remains unchanged, and year-to-date we have returned $1.6 billion through distributions to our unit holders. We continue to expect our distribution to be our primary return-of-capital tool, and opportunistic repurchases of units held by the public also remain a tool to supplement capital returns. The growth of our cash flows and strong balance sheet, including a quarter-end cash balance of over $750 million, provides us with financial flexibility to continue to optimize capital allocation and return of capital. Now let me hand it back to Mike for some final thoughts.\nMichael Hennigan: Thanks, John. In closing, MPLX\u2019s growth strategy continues to support our commitment to return capital to unit holders. MPLX remains a strategic part of MPC\u2019s portfolio, supported by over $2 billion MPC expects to receive annually from MPLX distributions. And as MPLX pursues its growth opportunities, we expect the value of this strategic relationship will continue to be enhanced. We continue to be confident in our growth opportunities and ability to generate strong cash flows. By advancing our high-return growth projects anchored in the Marcellus and Permian basins, along with our focus on cost and portfolio optimization, we expect to grow our cash flows, allowing us to continue to reinvest in the business and return capital to unit holders. Now let me turn the call back over to Kristina.\nKristina Kazarian: Thanks Mike. As we open the call for questions, we ask that you limit yourself to one question plus a follow-up. We may re-prompt for additional questions as time permits. With that, we will now open the call to questions. Sheila?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Reynolds with UBS. Your line is open.\nBrian Reynolds: Hi, good morning, everyone. Fundamentals out of the Permian continue to be really strong. And I was just curious if you could provide a little bit more detail on the BANGL pipeline expansion. Is this really driven by growth on MPLX's dedicated acreage? Curious about further potential expansion or extension opportunities on that BANGL pipeline in the future? Thanks.\nMichael Hennigan: Yes, good morning, Brian. I\u2019ll start off and I\u2019ll let Dave kick in there. We\u2019ve been trying to tell the market that our main basins, Marcellus, Permian, is where we\u2019re concentrating a lot of our capital efforts. The announcement today of continuing the ad processing plan and as your question around BANGL just further solidifies where we\u2019ve been putting a lot of our emphasis. So let me let Dave give you a little bit more color on BANGL specifically.\nDavid Heppner: Hey, Brian. So let me start off just by a little background. Of course, we\u2019re a 25% owner in existing a BANGL system and that was brought on service in Q4 2021. And we\u2019ve been very happy with that capital efficient project. So start that as a foundation. And as we look at the expansion, it\u2019s really anchored by what you touched on, our growth and also just the overall Permian growth. And so our expansion of BANGL 200 a day is kind of a two-prong. It\u2019s the installation of additional pumping capacity on the existing main line and then also construction of a new pipe on the southern section. So those together is what we\u2019re referring to as the expansion project. And as John noted, that project currently is projected to be complete the first half of 2025. Looking beyond 2025, should the supply and demand dynamics remain strong in the Permian, the BANGL Partners are in a position, including ourselves, to consider additional expansions of the pipe. And the last comment I want to make is just to reinforce a note that John stated, is that we currently anticipate financing this BANGL Project at that level through the JV and therefore that will not reflect in our capital outlook going forward. So just a couple of points there. Thanks.\nBrian Reynolds: Great. Appreciate all that color. And then maybe to pivot to capital allocation and I appreciate the color in the prepared remarks, but just kind of curious, just given that we\u2019re approaching the 3Q distribution potential rate that we\u2019ve seen in prior years. And given Emcolox\u2019s [Ph] preference for the BP raise over buybacks from the last few calls. Curious if you could just perhaps talk about an optimized capital structure at MPLX just given that leverage is starting to trend below 3.5.\nJohn Quaid: Hey Morning Brian. It\u2019s John. Thanks for the question. Yes, I mean, I think as we\u2019ve said, we\u2019ve been focused on the distribution as our primary returning capital tool. We\u2019ll look at that in the second half of the year, like we did last November. Certainly, we\u2019re coming from a position of strength, right? The strong balance sheet leveraged around three and a half distribution coverage 1.7 and $750 million a cash on the balance sheet really gives us that flexibility to work to optimize capital return. Again, focused on the distribution as that tool, as we think about where we want leveraged comfortable with where we are. We did a 10% increase last year and our coverage is actually going up. So I think in a strong position and maybe one other thing too, I mean, certainly we haven\u2019t done any buybacks to the last two quarters, but it does still remain a tool for us. Again, we try and be trying to optimize in that area as well and being opportunistic with those repurchases, but as I\u2019m sure you and others have seen the units, the volunteer and the units is almost moved to the nothing, which is maybe removed some of those opportunities for us recently, but still remains a tool for us. And Mike, I don\u2019t know if you wanted to add.\nMichael Hennigan: No, okay, that answers your question, Brian.\nBrian Reynolds: That did appreciate all the color and enjoy the rest of your morning. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we\u2019ll hear from Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. You may proceed.\nKeith Stanley: Hi, good morning. Thank you. If I could just follow on the last question on capital return to start. Obviously, you haven\u2019t done the buybacks in the first after the year, you did a lot less you did 500 million. How are you thinking about total capital return and prospects for growing total return of capital being at holders just because buybacks are going down? Should we think distribution growth can kind of offset that and make up for it? So you have growing total return of capital, just overall thoughts on that value proposition.\nMichael Hennigan: Hey, Keith, it\u2019s Mike. Let me start and I\u2019ll pick up where John left off in the last answer and trying to give you a little bit more color. So, I color code our cash flows and I use red and blue as the examples. Red cash flows are cash flows that we don\u2019t count on at a continuing basis, but they\u2019re source of equity. Blue cash flows are those that we think that are there continually on-going in time. What we typically think about is, as a general rule, not that you can\u2019t apply both, but red cash flows are buybacks and blue cash flows support the distribution. We can use blue for buybacks, but just as a general rule, think about it that way. As John mentioned, we have decent amount of cash on the balance sheet, mainly because in the last two quarters, our volatility has changed quite a bit. I don\u2019t know that we have a good reason for that, but prior to that, we were buying back using red bar cash flows at a significantly lower number than where we trade on average. In other words, during the quarter, we get these dips. The capital markets give these dips that we hit opportunistically. So if you look back in time, we\u2019ve bought over $1 billion of buybacks and we\u2019ve averaged less than $30. Mainly because we\u2019ve gotten these dips to volatility of the stock trades in such a way that we get these dips that we\u2019ve acted on. Now, in the last couple quarters, we haven\u2019t had those dips the way we\u2019ve seen in the past. Again, I don\u2019t know exactly why the volatility has come out, but as a result, that cash is still sitting on the balance sheet. So, we still have two sets of cash flows sitting on the balance sheet. Some that\u2019s still targeted for buybacks, and some that\u2019s targeted for on-going growth in the distribution. As a matter of course, the main thing that we concentrate on is generating cash. Obviously, that\u2019s the name of the game here. And I\u2019ve said on a couple other calls, they were trying to do mid-single digit. And if you look at our slides, it\u2019ll show you, there\u2019s a good chart in there that shows your distributable cash flow over last couple years. As average, the little on their 7% so the main focus for us is, let\u2019s make sure we\u2019re growing the partnership, growing those cash flows, identifying the type of cash flows we see, and then looking to implement a program that supports distribution growth, long-term, which we\u2019ve said is our primary tool, mainly because we\u2019re mainly growing blue cash flows. When we get the red cash flows, we look at those to supplement our program and be a little bit more opportunistic. Now, some investors have said, hey why don\u2019t you use blue for buybacks? That\u2019s still a tool, as well as John used the analogy, these are all on our tool belt. And we\u2019ll continue to think about those. So, where we stand right today is I don\u2019t want people to look at our results and read into it that we\u2019re not thinking about buybacks. We are, but we\u2019ve just been surprised at how the volatility has changed quite a bit in the last couple of quarters. So, we won\u2019t really think that a little bit going forward. In the meantime, as John mentioned we still have that cash on the balance sheet. We are looking in, we\u2019ll talk to you next quarter about where we\u2019re going to go with distribution growth. But we\u2019re in a good position, mainly driven by the fact that our concentration is growing the cash flows and then trying to optimize for as much value as we can. I hope that helps.\nKeith Stanley: Yes, that is helpful time the cash balance to the, to the buyback activity. Second, on really the question, just curious that the company historically hasn\u2019t been a big acquirer of assets, but it does seem like we\u2019ve seen asset prices come down in the market recently. And obviously, you have a lot of financial flexibility. It\u2019s just any updated thoughts on how you\u2019re thinking about the potential ability to play a role in a minute.\nMichael Hennigan: Yes Keith, it\u2019s something. Again, it\u2019s on the tool belt. It\u2019s something that Dave and the team continually look at. We measured against our own internal organic growth projects. And very often, we find that we have a list of projects that we just think will get us a higher return compared to some of the opportunities out there. But we\u2019re looking; we\u2019re always active in trying to manage that process, whether it\u2019s inbound or something that we\u2019re thinking about. But we\u2019re comparing it against what we have internally. I\u2019ve said a couple times recently that some of these smaller, maybe not flashy projects, they generate significantly higher returns. We\u2019re pretty large size MLP and to grow, 6% to 7% DCF CAGR requires us to get good returns on the project. So I use the term strict capital discipline. We try to as best we can, look at all of our opportunities. And then put the capital to work to get us the best return. So it\u2019s something that\u2019s out there. We haven\u2019t seen something that we would like. I will tell you we\u2019ve been active in some processes, but we\u2019re also kind of discipline as to what number we\u2019re willing to do and what number we\u2019re willing to walk away from. So I think that discipline serves us well and keeps us in a good position to grow the partnership with good returns.\nKeith Stanley: Thank you.\nMichael Hennigan: Now you\u2019re welcome, Keith.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.\nMichael Hennigan: Good morning, Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: Just wanted to pick up on last comment you put out there at the 67% DCF CAGR, is that something that you see the business being able to achieve over some sustained period of time realizing that\u2019s not a guidance number, but just trying to dig into that comment a little bit more.\nMichael Hennigan: Jeremy, I\u2019ve said it a couple of times and thank you for saying it\u2019s not meant to be guidance. It\u2019s just meant to be what we see as far as our capital spend that we think is appropriate for us, the size of our, current EBITDA and DCF, that mid-single-digit growth, kind of fits what I think is our financial model. So as we sit down as a team and talk about our plans for next year and next three years and the next five years, I kind of think about where we\u2019re going to be as far as growing our cash flows, etcetera, etcetera. So it\u2019s not meant to be guidance and I said that a couple of calls ago, but I just kind of point to, like I said, if you look at our slide, and John mentioned this, our business can be stair-steppy as opposed to continuous because you bring a plan on here or there or start a pipeline up here or there. So if you actually look at our slide, it\u2019ll show you that we had 6%, then we had about 10%, then we had about 4% and if you look over the time frame, the CAGR was a little under 7%. So year-to-date this year, we\u2019re about 6% DCF growth and that\u2019s kind of for the size we are for the capital that I think we want to execute, it kind of puts me in that realm. And that\u2019s why I think we\u2019ve been showing, hopefully the market\u2019s been seeing, very steady cash flows, but more importantly, growing cash flows. There was some concern if you go back a couple years with COVID on the stability of cash flows and I think we\u2019ve shown that even through 2020 but more importantly I hope the market is picking up that we\u2019re being really thoughtful as to our capital investments and we\u2019re growing the partnership and then we get to the topic that keeps just recently asked after growing the cash which is the priority then then optimizing how do we how do we invest and how do we return. So I continually say these businesses are both a return on and a return of capital business and we\u2019re trying to concentrate on doing well in both areas.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That\u2019s very helpful there. And just wanted to pick up on another company set there with regards to CapEx deployment just wondering any thoughts you might be able to share with regards to what type of capacity an annual basis you see MPLX having to deploy growth capital. And then on the other side of the gas given the assets as they sit right now what type of opportunity set do you see that does you see it matching there or is the interest and kind of expanding in other platforms to create new growth initiatives.\nMichael Hennigan: Yes Jeremy it\u2019s a good question and in our capital allocation framework we clearly identify return on to be a higher priority than return of. We are looking to grow the cash flows and we are looking to invest. Right now we\u2019ve been kind of in a pattern such that we\u2019re generating five billion of distributable cash flow but we\u2019re investing capital such that we have about $1 billion of free cash flow beyond that. And that\u2019s that\u2019s served as well, but to your point it\u2019s not limiting us if we see more investment that we like. We\u2019re happy to do that and that\u2019s countered by this concept of being strict on capital discipline making sure we get good returns. I think it\u2019s really important in this space to show the market that when we invest capital that we\u2019re going to get good returns on it. And if we continue that track record, then I think people will support the equity. In the short-term, that\u2019s about where we\u2019ve ended up, but to the question that was asked earlier we are open and we constantly are debating what\u2019s the right level and what are the right projects and where do we think we should deploy the money that\u2019s owned by the owners. And to the extent that we feel good about it we\u2019ve ended up with this roughly about $1 billion of capital investment roughly and that\u2019s left us with about $1 billion of free cash flow. So we\u2019ve kind of been in that mode recently. We\u2019re comfortable with it, but we also have flexibility around it as well if that makes sense to you.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That is very helpful. Thank you for that.\nMichael Hennigan: You\u2019re welcome Jeremy.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Theresa Chen with Barclays. Your line is open.\nTheresa Chen: Morning. I\u2019d like to touch on John\u2019s comment earlier about the level of distribution increase. So from a backward looking perspective John it sounds like the 10% last year was covered still enough with maybe too low and as we think about the third quarter this year and beyond. Especially arguably as we have more and more blue cash flow flows with online projects based on fee based contracts and visible volume growth should we think about that 10% or the floor.\nJohn Quaid: That\u2019s a definition of a champagne problem Theresa, but I I\u2019m not, thanks for the question but, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d think about it as a floor again. We try and be cognizant of where we are again Mike talks about red and blue. We think about that blue, we think about the capital we want to put the work. We can look at that and say, how do we kind of fiddle that into kind of a self-funding model even though hey if we\u2019ve got the right project we could go and finance it, but certainly where the balance is now, it\u2019s not really a question. So I think we\u2019re trying to be prudent around the increase in how we think about the percentage certainly that percentage last year versus our peers was very different. Again some peers have cut and they\u2019re kind of -- getting their distributions back to where they were. We did, we haven\u2019t cut our distribution. So I think about it more around the framework of that blue bar cash we have. How do we almost the glide pass to our ultimate growth rate of where the partnerships going to be because to some degree what we\u2019ve done here is. We managed through COVID, continue to grow the partnership. We were driving blue bar cash flows and essentially drove our coverage up. So now we\u2019re thinking about, are we\u2019re comfortable with the business confidence in those cash flows how do we work those cash flows into the distribution, and ultimately overtime, kind of align that with the growth rate of the of the partnership. So, I don\u2019t know that I would say it\u2019s a floor, but certainly a marker for what we did last year hopefully that that helps a little.\nTheresa Chen: Thank you. And on the topic of low carbon technology would you provide us some color on how you\u2019re thinking about your potential participation and what are the pathways and really the likelihood of commercialization for hydrogen hubs is in -- within your footprint?\nDavid Heppner: Yes, Theresa this is Dave. Only touch on that for you, so our cells MPLX along the MPC, we\u2019ve been we are involved right now on three of the hydrogen hubs out there. Three of the 33 that have made it to the final, are submittal for funding phase. So and those projects are unique in each of their own as far as level of level investment, so those are you know in the final submittment phase. We anticipate getting final response from the deal we at the end of this year. And I think I want to go back to the comments that that both Mike and John touched on. So while we\u2019re involved in these a lot of it\u2019s dependent on the funding but it\u2019s all back to strict capital discipline. As we look at emerging energy evolution emerging technologies carbon capture hydrogen. We\u2019re excited about it, it is part of our strategy going forward but it\u2019s with the backdrop of ensuring that the money we\u2019re investing achieves the rate returns that we\u2019re targeting. So more to come on that, and I think as DOE [Ph] makes the final decisions on their grants and their funding at the end of this year we\u2019ll have some more updates on it.\nMichael Hennigan: Hey Theresa, it\u2019s Mike. I just want to add one of the benefits we have of is our footprint and as Dave mentioned we\u2019re active in at least three of those hubs right now so that we can participate in the discussion whether it\u2019s on the Gulf Coast or up in Marcellus or in the Bakken or wherever it is our footprint allows us to have these opportunities. And to the question I was asked earlier is one of the advantages of having this wide footprint and the connectivity that we have is our organic choices are strong which gives us the ability to forgo having to do something else because our plate has enough activity on it that gives us a good enough return. So I think one of the strengths we have is the breadth of our portfolio and we\u2019re always trying to figure out how to optimize that and where we think we can benefit by being stronger. As you heard today investing some more capital in the Permian we\u2019ve been very open about that scenario of concentration for us and we put a lot of effort there. So continuing to grow our footprint in that area should not be a surprise to anybody. But to your question on low carbon, we are looking a lot at different things as Dave mentioned but we are coming back to, it\u2019s got a show return that makes sense to us if we\u2019re going to deploy capital. So hopefully that helps as well.\nTheresa Chen: It does. Thank you.\nMichael Hennigan: You\u2019re welcome Theresa.\nOperator: And our last question will come from Neal Dingmann with Truist. Your line is open.\nNeal Dingmann: Good morning guys thanks for getting me in. My question first is just on potential non-core divestitures, I think. Simply you all mentioned the past how you\u2019re looking to potentially shed some of the non-core terminals or G&P utility lines and just wondering what\u2019s the magnitude of potential sales we still could expect going forward.\nJohn Quaid: Yes, hey Neil it\u2019s John thanks for the question. Yes we\u2019ve had some assets here and there smaller ones and probably the both the L&S and G&P side of the shop that we\u2019ve been able to find other owners for I think when -- this comment and we continue to look at that right around all of our assets if they don\u2019t make sense in our hands did they make sense and others. I would say the large majority of those assets on the L&S side we know our customer MPC and we know how critical those are to their operations on the G&P side. We talk from time to time about some of the basins we\u2019re in, which are much smaller than our presence say in the Marcellus, which is really the largest part of our G&P operations. Look those are generating free cash flow but we\u2019re maybe not looking to significantly invest in those, so if there\u2019s someone that maybe that fits better in their portfolio we would, we would listen. Again, there\u2019s been a little bit of a gap between the bid and the asset there, and given they\u2019re not kind of a burning platform for us, we haven\u2019t had significant urgency to do something there, but something we\u2019ll always look at.\nNeal Dingmann: Yes, that makes sense. And then my, just my last one is on the crude pipeline growth. You all mentioned volumes, I think you said are up 4% part due to the bottleneck and I\u2019m just wondering, can this growth continue as maybe there\u2019s future opportunities you\u2019re looking at?\nShawn Lyon: Hey, Neal, this is Shawn. We\u2019re pleased where we are right now with the crude pipeline\u2019s growth, and it\u2019s really driven by the high refinery utilization, but we continue to look for organic projects that unlock, debottlenecking, increased capacity. So we\u2019ll continue doing that, as Mike and John said, as we look forward and future capital outlays again really to match the refineries and the needs of our customers that are connected to our crude pipeline. So again, we\u2019re pleased at where we\u2019re at, and we\u2019ll continue looking for those organic growth opportunities.\nNeal Dingmann: Great. Thank you all for the time.\nShawn Lyon: You\u2019re welcome.\nKristina Kazarian: All right, Sheila, is there anyone else in the queue?\nOperator: We are showing no further questions at this time.\nKristina Kazarian: Sounds great. Thank you so much for joining us today. And thank you for your interest in MPLX. Should you have additional questions or would you like clarification on any of the topics discussed today, members of the Investor Relations Team will be here today to help out and take your calls.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you once again for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "John Quaid",
            "content": "Thanks Mike. As Mike referenced in his remarks, MPLX has a strong history of successfully executing the strategic priorities of strict capital discipline, fostering a low cost culture and optimizing our asset portfolio, all of which are foundational to the growth of MPLXs cash flows. And through the first half of this year, distributable cash flow has grown 6% year-over-year. Looking back over the last three years as you can see on slide 5, our growth is not linear but instead tends the common stair steps as we develop and bring projects online. For 2023, our capital program outlook remains at $950 million, including $800 million of growth capital and $150 million of maintenance capital. In the L&S segment, our joint venture projects in the Permian are progressing. We see strong demand for the Whistler natural gas pipeline and its expansion to 2.5 billion cubic feet per day, which remains on schedule for completion in September. We're also planning to expand the BANGL joint venture pipeline to 200,000 barrels per day as we look to grow our participation in the NGL value chain. The capital-efficient expansion of this long-haul pipeline is supported by existing and growing demand for NGL takeaway from the Permian's Delaware and Midland basins to the fractionation hub in Sweeney, Texas. We expect the expansion to be completed in the first half of 2025. On the Wink-to-Webster crude pipeline, we expect volumes to ramp this year and over the next two years as the pipeline continues to place segments in service. And as a reminder, these three projects, Whistler, BANGL, and Wink-to-Webster, are largely financed at the JV level, and therefore, our portion of the debt-financed capital spending is not reflected in our capital outlook. In the G&P segment, we remain focused on growth investments in the Permian and Marcellus basins in response to producer demand. In the Permian's Delaware basin, we continue to bring online new gas processing plants to meet increasing customer demand while targeting strong returns with strict capital discipline. Our Tornado II processing plant began service at the end of last year, and we are advancing construction of Preakness II, which we expect to be online in the first half of 2024. We recently approved plans to build our seventh gas processing plant in the basin, Secretariat, which is expected online in the second half of 2025. This will bring our total processing capacity in the Delaware basin up to 1.4 bcf per day. In the Marcellus basin, we are also progressing construction of the Harmon Creek II gas processing plant, which we expect will come online in the first half of 2024. Slide 6 outlines the second quarter operational and financial performance highlights for our logistics and storage segment. The L&S segment reported its second consecutive $1 billion adjusted EBITDA quarter. L&S segment adjusted EBITDA increased $56 million when compared to second quarter 2022, primarily driven by higher rates and growth in total throughputs. Crude pipeline volumes were up 4% and represent a new quarterly record for the partnership as we grew crudal throughputs through expansion and debottlenecking activities. Product pipeline volumes were down 6%, driven by more favorable market dynamics in the second quarter of last year and effects from Marathon's refinery turnarounds. Terminal volumes were up 3% due to effects associated with Marathon's refinery turnarounds in both quarters. Moving to our Gathering And Processing Segment on slide 7, G&P segment adjusted EBITDA increased $18 million compared to the second quarter of 2022, as the benefits of higher volumes and throughput fees were offset by lower NGL prices. While our G&P segment is largely a fee-based business, we do have some direct sensitivity to natural gas liquids prices. For the quarter, NGL prices averaged $0.63 per gallon as compared to $1.18 in the second quarter of 2022, resulting in a roughly $50 million headwind for the results. Total Gathering volumes were up 9% year-over-year due to increased production in the Utica and the Permian. Processing volumes were up 6% year-over-year, primarily from higher volumes in the Marcellus and Permian, driven by increased customer demand and our investment in Permian processing capacity. Focusing in on the Marcellus, by far our largest basin of G&P operations, we saw year-over-year volume increases of 3% for Gathering and 5% for Processing, driven by increased customer demand. Fractionation volumes grew 10%, primarily due to recent increases to our fractionation capacity to meet in-basin demand for ethane. Our capital allocation framework remains unchanged, and year-to-date we have returned $1.6 billion through distributions to our unit holders. We continue to expect our distribution to be our primary return-of-capital tool, and opportunistic repurchases of units held by the public also remain a tool to supplement capital returns. The growth of our cash flows and strong balance sheet, including a quarter-end cash balance of over $750 million, provides us with financial flexibility to continue to optimize capital allocation and return of capital. Now let me hand it back to Mike for some final thoughts. Hey Morning Brian. It's John. Thanks for the question. Yes, I mean, I think as we've said, we've been focused on the distribution as our primary returning capital tool. We'll look at that in the second half of the year, like we did last November. Certainly, we're coming from a position of strength, right? The strong balance sheet leveraged around three and a half distribution coverage 1.7 and $750 million a cash on the balance sheet really gives us that flexibility to work to optimize capital return. Again, focused on the distribution as that tool, as we think about where we want leveraged comfortable with where we are. We did a 10% increase last year and our coverage is actually going up. So I think in a strong position and maybe one other thing too, I mean, certainly we haven't done any buybacks to the last two quarters, but it does still remain a tool for us. Again, we try and be trying to optimize in that area as well and being opportunistic with those repurchases, but as I'm sure you and others have seen the units, the volunteer and the units is almost moved to the nothing, which is maybe removed some of those opportunities for us recently, but still remains a tool for us. And Mike, I don't know if you wanted to add. That's a definition of a champagne problem Theresa, but I I'm not, thanks for the question but, I don't know if I'd think about it as a floor again. We try and be cognizant of where we are again Mike talks about red and blue. We think about that blue, we think about the capital we want to put the work. We can look at that and say, how do we kind of fiddle that into kind of a self-funding model even though hey if we've got the right project we could go and finance it, but certainly where the balance is now, it's not really a question.

            "name": "Michael Hennigan",
            "content": "Thanks, Kristina. Good morning and thank you for joining our call. Earlier today, we reported second quarter results. Our business delivered adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion, an increase of 5% year-over-year and a new quarterly record. Distributable cash flow of nearly $1.3 billion was up 6% versus the second quarter of last year and was also a new record. We continue to see strength in our base business and contributions from our growth capital investments driving DCF for the first half of the year up 6% as compared to last year. We also remain focussed on return of capital. We continue to expect our distribution to be the primary return of capital tool supplemented with opportunistic repurchases. Based on the strength of the business and our balance sheet we are well positioned to continue to optimize return of capital. While natural gas and NGL prices are lower than last year, our long-term production outlook for our G&P producer customers in our key basins remains largely unchanged. In our largest base in the Marcellus the cost of develop remains at the low end of the cost curve and still below current commodity prices and we expect to see maintenance level drilling activity continue. The recent U.S. Supreme Court's decision to allow the MVP pipeline construction to continue in support of for natural gas development in the region. In the Permian, our production outlook is unchanged as crude prices remain strong and prices for associated gas do not significantly impact producer activity. Our integrated footprints in these resilient basins position the partnership with a steady source of earnings and growth opportunities. This quarter, we advanced our natural gas and NGL value chain strategies with the announcement of new projects in the Permian. We remain confident in our ability to grow and are focused on executing the strategic priorities of strict capital discipline, fostering a low cost culture and optimizing our asset portfolio all of which are foundational to the continued growth of MPLXs cash flows. We continue to enhance our ESG commitment and disclosures with the publication of both our annual sustainability and prospectus on climate related scenario reports. We continue to make progress on our 2030 target to reduce mid-stream methane emission intensity 75% from 2016 levels. To our focus on methane program, we have implemented measures that have achieved approximately 10,000 tons per year of methane emissions reduction. We also continue progressing our biodiversity target to apply sustainable landscapes to 10,000 acres of pipeline rightaways by the end of 2025. Through last year, we've achieved over 10% of this target. MPLX is also participating in alliances focussed on CCUS and hydrogen hubs. We will continue to evaluate low carbon opportunities where we can leverage technologies that are complimentary with our asset footprint and expertise. We continue to challenge ourselves to lead in sustainable energy by meeting the needs of today while investing in an energy diverse future that creates share value for all our stakeholders. Now let me turn the call over to John to discuss our growth as well as our operational and financial results for the quarter. Thanks, John. In closing, MPLX's growth strategy continues to support our commitment to return capital to unit holders. MPLX remains a strategic part of MPC's portfolio, supported by over $2 billion MPC expects to receive annually from MPLX distributions. And as MPLX pursues its growth opportunities, we expect the value of this strategic relationship will continue to be enhanced. We continue to be confident in our growth opportunities and ability to generate strong cash flows. By advancing our high-return growth projects anchored in the Marcellus and Permian basins, along with our focus on cost and portfolio optimization, we expect to grow our cash flows, allowing us to continue to reinvest in the business and return capital to unit holders. Now let me turn the call back over to Kristina. Yes, good morning, Brian. I'll start off and I'll let Dave kick in there. We've been trying to tell the market that our main basins, Marcellus, Permian, is where we're concentrating a lot of our capital efforts. The announcement today of continuing the ad processing plan and as your question around BANGL just further solidifies where we've been putting a lot of our emphasis. So let me let Dave give you a little bit more color on BANGL specifically. No, okay, that answers your question, Brian. Hey, Keith, it's Mike. Let me start and I'll pick up where John left off in the last answer and trying to give you a little bit more color. So, I color code our cash flows and I use red and blue as the examples. Red cash flows are cash flows that we don't count on at a continuing basis, but they're source of equity. Blue cash flows are those that we think that are there continually on-going in time. What we typically think about is, as a general rule, not that you can't apply both, but red cash flows are buybacks and blue cash flows support the distribution. We can use blue for buybacks, but just as a general rule, think about it that way. As John mentioned, we have decent amount of cash on the balance sheet, mainly because in the last two quarters, our volatility has changed quite a bit. I don't know that we have a good reason for that, but prior to that, we were buying back using red bar cash flows at a significantly lower number than where we trade on average. In other words, during the quarter, we get these dips. The capital markets give these dips that we hit opportunistically. So if you look back in time, we've bought over $1 billion of buybacks and we've averaged less than $30. Mainly because we've gotten these dips to volatility of the stock trades in such a way that we get these dips that we've acted on. Now, in the last couple quarters, we haven't had those dips the way we've seen in the past. Again, I don't know exactly why the volatility has come out, but as a result, that cash is still sitting on the balance sheet. So, we still have two sets of cash flows sitting on the balance sheet. Some that's still targeted for buybacks, and some that's targeted for on-going growth in the distribution. As a matter of course, the main thing that we concentrate on is generating cash. Obviously, that's the name of the game here. And I've said on a couple other calls, they were trying to do mid-single digit. And if you look at our slides, it'll show you, there's a good chart in there that shows your distributable cash flow over last couple years. As average, the little on their 7% so the main focus for us is, let's make sure we're growing the partnership, growing those cash flows, identifying the type of cash flows we see, and then looking to implement a program that supports distribution growth, long-term, which we've said is our primary tool, mainly because we're mainly growing blue cash flows. When we get the red cash flows, we look at those to supplement our program and be a little bit more opportunistic. Now, some investors have said, hey why don't you use blue for buybacks? That's still a tool, as well as John used the analogy, these are all on our tool belt. And we'll continue to think about those. So, where we stand right today is I don't want people to look at our results and read into it that we're not thinking about buybacks. We are, but we've just been surprised at how the volatility has changed quite a bit in the last couple of quarters. So, we won't really think that a little bit going forward. In the meantime, as John mentioned we still have that cash on the balance sheet. We are looking in, we'll talk to you next quarter about where we're going to go with distribution growth. But we're in a good position, mainly driven by the fact that our concentration is growing the cash flows and then trying to optimize for as much value as we can. I hope that helps. Yes Keith, it's something. Again, it's on the tool belt. It's something that Dave and the team continually look at. We measured against our own internal organic growth projects. And very often, we find that we have a list of projects that we just think will get us a higher return compared to some of the opportunities out there. But we're looking; we're always active in trying to manage that process, whether it's inbound or something that we're thinking about. But we're comparing it against what we have internally. I've said a couple times recently that some of these smaller, maybe not flashy projects, they generate significantly higher returns. We're pretty large size MLP and to grow, 6% to 7% DCF CAGR requires us to get good returns on the project. So I use the term strict capital discipline. We try to as best we can, look at all of our opportunities. And then put the capital to work to get us the best return. So it's something that's out there. We haven't seen something that we would like. I will tell you we've been active in some processes, but we're also kind of discipline as to what number we're willing to do and what number we're willing to walk away from. So I think that discipline serves us well and keeps us in a good position to grow the partnership with good returns. Now you're welcome, Keith. Good morning, Jeremy. Jeremy, I've said it a couple of times and thank you for saying it's not meant to be guidance. It's just meant to be what we see as far as our capital spend that we think is appropriate for us, the size of our, current EBITDA and DCF, that mid-single-digit growth, kind of fits what I think is our financial model. So as we sit down as a team and talk about our plans for next year and next three years and the next five years, I kind of think about where we're going to be as far as growing our cash flows, etcetera, etcetera. So it's not meant to be guidance and I said that a couple of calls ago, but I just kind of point to, like I said, if you look at our slide, and John mentioned this, our business can be stair-steppy as opposed to continuous because you bring a plan on here or there or start a pipeline up here or there. So if you actually look at our slide, it'll show you that we had 6%, then we had about 10%, then we had about 4% and if you look over the time frame, the CAGR was a little under 7%. So year-to-date this year, we're about 6% DCF growth and that's kind of for the size we are for the capital that I think we want to execute, it kind of puts me in that realm. And that's why I think we've been showing, hopefully the market's been seeing, very steady cash flows, but more importantly, growing cash flows. There was some concern if you go back a couple years with COVID on the stability of cash flows and I think we've shown that even through 2020 but more importantly I hope the market is picking up that we're being really thoughtful as to our capital investments and we're growing the partnership and then we get to the topic that keeps just recently asked after growing the cash which is the priority then then optimizing how do we how do we invest and how do we return. So I continually say these businesses are both a return on and a return of capital business and we're trying to concentrate on doing well in both areas. Yes Jeremy it's a good question and in our capital allocation framework we clearly identify return on to be a higher priority than return of. We are looking to grow the cash flows and we are looking to invest. Right now we've been kind of in a pattern such that we're generating five billion of distributable cash flow but we're investing capital such that we have about $1 billion of free cash flow beyond that. And that's that's served as well, but to your point it's not limiting us if we see more investment that we like. We're happy to do that and that's countered by this concept of being strict on capital discipline making sure we get good returns. I think it's really important in this space to show the market that when we invest capital that we're going to get good returns on it. And if we continue that track record, then I think people will support the equity. In the short-term, that's about where we've ended up, but to the question that was asked earlier we are open and we constantly are debating what's the right level and what are the right projects and where do we think we should deploy the money that's owned by the owners. And to the extent that we feel good about it we've ended up with this roughly about $1 billion of capital investment roughly and that's left us with about $1 billion of free cash flow. So we've kind of been in that mode recently. We're comfortable with it, but we also have flexibility around it as well if that makes sense to you. You're welcome Jeremy. Hey Theresa, it's Mike. I just want to add one of the benefits we have of is our footprint and as Dave mentioned we're active in at least three of those hubs right now so that we can participate in the discussion whether it's on the Gulf Coast or up in Marcellus or in the Bakken or wherever it is our footprint allows us to have these opportunities. And to the question I was asked earlier is one of the advantages of having this wide footprint and the connectivity that we have is our organic choices are strong which gives us the ability to forgo having to do something else because our plate has enough activity on it that gives us a good enough return. So I think one of the strengths we have is the breadth of our portfolio and we're always trying to figure out how to optimize that and where we think we can benefit by being stronger. As you heard today investing some more capital in the Permian we've been very open about that scenario of concentration for us and we put a lot of effort there. So continuing to grow our footprint in that area should not be a surprise to anybody. But to your question on low carbon, we are looking a lot at different things as Dave mentioned but we are coming back to, it's got a show return that makes sense to us if we're going to deploy capital. So hopefully that helps as well. You're welcome Theresa."

            "name": "David Heppner",
            "content": "Hey, Brian. So let me start off just by a little background. Of course, we're a 25% owner in existing a BANGL system and that was brought on service in Q4 2021. And we've been very happy with that capital efficient project. So start that as a foundation. And as we look at the expansion, it's really anchored by what you touched on, our growth and also just the overall Permian growth. And so our expansion of BANGL 200 a day is kind of a two-prong. It's the installation of additional pumping capacity on the existing main line and then also construction of a new pipe on the southern section. So those together is what we're referring to as the expansion project. And as John noted, that project currently is projected to be complete the first half of 2025. Looking beyond 2025, should the supply and demand dynamics remain strong in the Permian, the BANGL Partners are in a position, including ourselves, to consider additional expansions of the pipe. And the last comment I want to make is just to reinforce a note that John stated, is that we currently anticipate financing this BANGL Project at that level through the JV and therefore that will not reflect in our capital outlook going forward. So just a couple of points there. Thanks. Yes, Theresa this is Dave. Only touch on that for you, so our cells MPLX along the MPC, we've been we are involved right now on three of the hydrogen hubs out there. Three of the 33 that have made it to the final, are submittal for funding phase. So and those projects are unique in each of their own as far as level of level investment, so those are you know in the final submittment phase. We anticipate getting final response from the deal we at the end of this year. And I think I want to go back to the comments that that both Mike and John touched on. So while we're involved in these a lot of it's dependent on the funding but it's all back to strict capital discipline. As we look at emerging energy evolution emerging technologies carbon capture hydrogen. We're excited about it, it is part of our strategy going forward but it's with the backdrop of ensuring that the money we're investing achieves the rate returns that we're targeting. So more to come on that, and I think as DOE [Ph] makes the final decisions on their grants and their funding at the end of this year we'll have some more updates on it."

        "content": "Operator: Welcome to the MPLX First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. My name is Sheila, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.\nKristina Kazarian: Good morning, and welcome to the MPLX First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at mplx.com under the Investor tab. Joining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan, Chairman and CEO; John Quaid, CFO; and other members of the executive team.  We invite you to read the safe harbor statements and non-GAAP disclaimer on Slide 2. It's a reminder that we'll be making forward-looking statements during the call and during the question-and-answer session that follows. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.\nMichael Hennigan: Thanks, Kristina. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. Earlier today, we reported our first quarter results. Our business continues to grow and delivered adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion, an increase of 9% year-over-year and a new quarterly record for the partnership. Distributable cash flow of nearly $1.3 billion was up 5% year-over-year.  Turning to the macro environment. While natural gas prices have come down recently, our long-term production outlook in our key regions remains largely unchanged. In our largest basin, the Marcellus, the cost to deliver for our key producer customers is still below the current prices. In the Permian and Bakken, our production outlook is unchanged as crude prices are strong and prices for associated gas do not significantly impact producer activity in these basins.  This quarter, we advanced our growth projects, which are anchored in the Marcellus, Permian and Bakken basins. We expect these disciplined investments in high-return projects, along with our focus on cost and portfolio optimization continue to drive cash flow growth. While our capital outlook is focused on our current O&S and G&P asset base, we are participating in 3 publicly announced alliances focused on CCUS and hydrogen technologies.  We will continue to evaluate low-carbon opportunities where we can leverage technologies that are complementary with our asset footprint and expertise. And we remain -- we remain optimistic -- sorry about that, about our opportunities in 2023, and are focused on executing the strategic priorities of strict capital discipline, fostering a low-cost culture, optimizing our asset portfolio, all of which are foundational to the growth of MPLX's cash flows.  Now let me turn the call over to John to discuss our growth as well as our operational and financial results for the quarter.\nJohn Quaid: Thanks, Mike. Looking back over the last several years, our successful execution of the foundational strategic priorities, Mike just referenced, has resulted in a 6.8% compound annual growth rate for our DCF. As you can see on this slide, our growth is not linear and tends to come in stair steps as we develop and bring projects online. Last quarter, we announced a 2023 capital outlook of $950 million, including $800 million of growth capital and $150 million of maintenance capital.  Across both segments, we are focused on projects targeted at expansion or debottlenecking of existing assets to meet customer demand. In the L&S segment, our joint venture projects in the Permian are progressing. We see strong demand for the Whistler natural gas pipeline and its expansion to 2.5 billion cubic feet per day which remains on schedule for completion this September. We also expect volumes on the Wink to Webster crude pipeline to ramp over this year and the next 2 years as the pipeline continues to play segments into service. And as a reminder, these projects are largely financed at the joint venture level and the related capital is not reflected in our capital spending or capital outlook.  In the G&P segment, Tor\u00f1ado II, our fifth 200 million cubic feet per day gas processing plant in the Permian came online in the fourth quarter of last year and is already operating near capacity, ahead of our midyear goal. We are also progressing Preakness II, our sixth plant in the Permian and the plant in the Marcellus, Harmon Creek II, both of these gas processing plants are expected to be online in the first half of 2024.  Slide 6 outlines the first quarter operational and financial performance highlights for our Logistics and Storage segment. The L&S segment reported record results with its first $1 billion adjusted EBITDA quarter. L&S segment adjusted EBITDA increased $122 million when compared to first quarter 2022. The increased results were primarily driven by growth in throughputs and higher rates across our L&S business lines. Total pipeline volumes were up 6% year-over-year, primarily due to growth in crude oil throughputs associated with expansion and debottlenecking activities and impacts associated with Marathon's refinery turnarounds. Terminal volumes were similarly up 5%.  Moving to our Gathering and Processing segment on Slide 7. G&P segment adjusted EBITDA increased $4 million, compared to first quarter 2022 as higher throughput fees and volumes were offset by lower natural gas liquids prices. While our G&P segment is largely a fee-based business, we do have some direct sensitivity to natural gas liquids prices. As a rough rule of thumb, our annual results are impacted by about $20 million for every $0.05 per gallon change in NGL prices. NGL prices averaged $0.77 per gallon for the quarter, as compared to $1.15 in the first quarter of 2022, resulting in roughly a $40 million unfavorable effect versus the prior year period.  For the quarter, total gathered volumes were up 21% year-over-year due to increased production in the Utica and the Permian. Processing volumes were up 4% year-over-year, primarily from higher volumes in the Permian driven by increased customer demand and our investments and processing capacity. Focusing in on the Marcellus, our largest basin of G&P operations, we saw year-over-year increases for gathering and fractionation volumes driven by increased customer demand and our investments in fractionation capacity.  Moving to our first quarter financial highlights on Slide 8. Total adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion was up 9% from the prior year, while distributable cash flow of $1.3 billion increased 5%. The lower year-over-year DCF growth was partly due to timing of maintenance capital expenditures, which were $30 million higher than the prior year. While we expect annual project-related expenses to be flat with the prior year, these projects are not performed ratably over the year.  As discussed last quarter, the first quarter is typically our lowest quarter for project-related expenses. As we look to the second quarter, we anticipate these expenses will increase sequentially as they have done in prior years. MPLX declared a first quarter distribution of $0.775 per unit, resulting in a distribution coverage ratio of 1.6x for the quarter.  During the quarter, we issued $1.6 billion in senior notes, and we redeemed the $600 million of outstanding Series B preferred notes and $1 billion of senior notes scheduled to mature in July. MPLX ended the quarter with total debt of around $21 billion and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 3.5x. Our leverage ratio has decreased over the last few years as our earnings have grown while our absolute debt level has remained relatively constant, providing the partnership with financial flexibility.  Now let me hand it back to Mike for some final thoughts.\nMichael Hennigan: Thanks, John. In closing, MPLX's growth strategy supports our commitment to return capital to the unitholders. MPLX remains a strategic part of MPC's portfolio, supported by the over $2 billion MPC receives annually from MPLX distribution. And as MPLX pursues its growth opportunities, we expect the value of this strategic relationship will continue to be enhanced.  Our business continues to grow and generate strong cash flows. By advancing our high-return growth projects anchored in the Marcellus, Permian and Bakken basins along with our focus on cost and portfolio optimization, we expect to continue to grow our cash flows, allowing us to reinvest in the business and return capital to unitholders. And for 2023, we expect the distribution to be our primary tool to return capital to unitholders.  Now let me turn the call back over to Kristina.\nKristina Kazarian: Thanks, Mike. [Operator Instructions]. With that, we'll now open the call to questions, Sheila.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.\nJeremy Tonet: Just want to pick up with some of your later comments there as it relates to capital allocation. I was just wondering if you could kind of update us, I guess, on how your thoughts on capital allocation have evolved over time and where you see it today? And what factors kind of have driven that change or evolution of views over time?\nJohn Quaid: Jeremy, it's John. Great question. I'll take that and then let Mike comment as well. Certainly, as we look at where we are now, right, we're -- as we said last quarter, we're focused on the distribution. We certainly, over the last few years, have had opportunities on the repurchase side, and we'll continue to look at that. We're perhaps more opportunistic than we have been in the past as we commented last quarter. And even if you think back, we even tried to supplemental at one point, I think we've tried that and maybe got some reaction on that one that maybe is not still a tool for us, but not our primary focus.  So as we look at where we are now, again, looking back at last year's numbers, $6 billion of EBITDA, $5 billion of DCF, $4 billion of free cash flow, paying out $3 billion in distribution, $1 billion left over, we're sitting in a strong position. Balance sheet is strong, gives us that financial flexibility to think about capital allocation across the business. As you see, we continue to focus on strict capital discipline. We haven't changed our outlook of $800 million of growth spending for the year. And really, I think as we've kind of pivoted here recently, we see the distribution as our best opportunity to drive value for all unitholders while still supplementing that with opportunistic unit repurchases.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Just curious, I guess, on the driver there and the shift towards more distribution growth over unit repurchases, if you could provide a little bit more color on kind of what were the drivers in that thought process?\nJohn Quaid: Yes. I mean I think as I was saying, Jeremy, when we looked at kind of the space, our opportunity, you think even through COVID and maybe if you want to call it the COVID recession, we continue to grow the cash flow of the partnership and have kind of built up coverage as we pulled back -- we pulled back on our distribution, others may have cut. And now that we look at where we are, we certainly see that tool as the one that best -- gives us the best opportunity to solidify that value for all unitholders. That certainly has progressed over time.  I mean it's one thing. If you think about the over $1 billion of repurchases we did, we did at an average unit price of $29 a unit, right? We're sitting at about $35 today. So we always continue to look at where those levers are, but again, I think over time, as the options have evolved, right now, we see the best opportunity to drive value in the distribution.\nMichael Hennigan: Jeremy, it's Mike. I'm going to add that in the quarter, there was less volatility than normal in the unit price. We still have buybacks on the tool belt. But as John said and we said in our prepared remarks, we want investors to know we're committed to growing cash flows, and as a result, we're committed to growing our base distribution. We still have everything on the tool belt, but we're going to lean harder in general towards distributions to show investors we're continuing to grow the cash flows.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful. And just one last one, if I could. Mike, I know that MPLX isn't a forward guidance company. But last quarter, you provided a bit more color as far as kind of mid-single-digit growth potential, and I was just wondering, a strong result this quarter. Is that repeatable? Is that part of kind of that mid-single-digit growth that you were talking about? It seems like Street expectations in future years still aren't at that level. So just wondering how we should think about that or what people might be missing?\nMichael Hennigan: Yes. Thanks, Jeremy. It's a good question. And a lot of people have written it in a certain fashion. What I meant was a general outlook of the business, but it will be stair-step, particularly on the natural gas side of our business. So let me just give you the facts, and then I'll come back to the comment. The fact is our distributable cash flow grew 6% in 2020 despite COVID. It grew 11% in 2021. It grew 4% in 2022. So if you look at that 3-year CAGR, it was 6.8%. And you can see a little bit of the stair-step, up 6%, up 11%, up 4%. So it's bouncing around a little bit.  So I've gotten a lot of questions about how we view our growth. So I was just trying to give what I consider just a general outlook of the business. And if you look at the last 3 years, I think that supports the statement. I'm hoping that helps. And thanks for commenting that we're not generally a guidance company, but just trying to give you a little bit better feel for how we think about the business and the growth of the cash flows.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Brian Reynolds with UBS.\nBrian Reynolds: Maybe just to follow up quickly on capital allocation priorities and the growth CapEx. You've discussed the low multiple type build projects already in the backlog. But kind of curious if you can just give us maybe a '24, '25 outlook towards CapEx? Are there attractive growth projects that MPLX is looking at that could potentially impact share buyback or unit buybacks in support of that DPU growth over the long term?\nJohn Quaid: Brian, it's John. So I don't know that we're ready to provide '24 to '25 guidance at this point, right? You have seen us the last few years, talk about kind of a zone for where we're looking, what that piece of our capital allocation looks like. I don't know that we're anticipating a major change there, but probably a little bit early to talk about '24, '25 at this point.\nBrian Reynolds: I guess just as a quick follow-up. Is it fair to say that the projects would be pretty similar to the current slate of projects? Or is there anything else that MPLX is looking at?\nJohn Quaid: Yes. I mean if you think about some of the big ones I talked about, we'll still be spending some money on in '24 to get them up and running. But it's kind of been our playbook, right? We continue to look at opportunities and the best ones we see are across our footprint in the basins and areas where we've got strength, on the G&P side or strong tie-ins with MPC as well. So I think we're going to continue to look at those opportunities. And that's what we kind of got in the pipeline right now, but it could always change, but that's where we are right now.\nMichael Hennigan: Brian, it's Mike. I'm just going to add. Our asset base is big enough. We're roughly $6 billion of EBITDA at this point. Our asset base is large enough that we get these organic growth opportunities that are not headliners, but they provide meaningful returns. And like I just answered to Jeremy's question, when you look at growing DCF 6%, 11%, 4% over the last 3 years or about a 7% CAGR, it kind of shows -- hopefully, it shows the market that we have opportunities. We're continuing to grow the cash flows, albeit not these big headliner type projects, just a lot of smaller higher return projects, which we think are easily executed and just drive right to the bottom line quickly.  So to your question, yes, there's a backlog of things that we're looking at that are similar. We'll continue to grow the asset base and kind of bolt on to all the places that we see where growth can be. And it's primarily in those basins that we've talked about as the larger ones, but we still have smaller projects occurring in those other basins as well. So if we spend the capital that we're thinking about over time, we think we're going to continue to grow those cash flows just the way we've described.\nBrian Reynolds: Great. And just as my one follow-up, we have seen some CapEx inflation on some Permian-related long-haul projects. Could you just give us an update on your current kind of budget versus actual so far on just Permian nat gas projects? And are they expected to come online on time and on budget?\nMichael Hennigan: Yes, I'll let Shawn take a stab at that one. .\nShawn Lyon: Thanks for the question. This is Shawn. One of the -- we really -- on Whistler, we continue to see strong demand for that contracted capacity there and are pleased with that. The expansion that we've announced previously that should come online in September of this year really is on plan and on budget. So we're pleased with that. And again, the dynamics or fundamentals for the Permian gas takeaway are still strong. So thanks for the question.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research.\nKeith Stanley: There was a reference to portfolio optimization as a focus, I think, a few times on the prepared remarks and in the release. Any updates there? I assume you're alluding to some of the less core assets and regions? Are you more optimistic on finding opportunities for portfolio optimization?\nJohn Quaid: Keith, it's John. Thanks for the question. I think there, again, maybe kind of similar to Mike's comments on the capital side, it's probably more little singles and doubles. We had some maybe even at a lower level than our noncore basins. We've had some asset sales here and there if you look back at our results over the last year or so finding maybe terminals that maybe fit better in somebody's portfolio than ours or, for example, on the G&P side, we might have some natural gas supply lines for utilities that the utilities might be interested.  So it's probably been smaller things like that, that we've been doing that we probably don't raise to a level where we talk about those specific items in our materials, but again, those continue to drive the cash flow performance of the portfolio. I'd say on the basins, we continue to look there, but really don't have any pressing or immediate updates on that right now.\nKeith Stanley: Great. And separate question. Just you highlighted there's still $1 billion of excess free cash flow basically after distributions and clearly pointing to more distribution growth as a focus. Aside from distributions, do you look at other potential options? And I guess I'm asking specifically our acquisitions more likely in the mix just as you have a lot of this financial cushion and capacity?\nJohn Quaid: Yes. Thanks for that. I'll start, and then I'll let Mike comment as well. I mean, certainly, we have the company financially in a position where if the right opportunity with the right type of high-quality assets that fits into our strategy and our footprint and has the right risk-adjusted return, right? If we had all those criteria and some others, we've got the partnership in a position where we can take advantage of those. But as I think you've heard us say over a number of quarterly calls, we're pretty strict in how we look at that. It just tends to be more challenging to get the returns on those type of projects versus maybe the opportunities we have organically within our own system in the places where we operate.\nMichael Hennigan: Yes, Keith, I'm going to add to what John just said at the end, because that's really the key. In order for us to look at something else, it's got a hurdle what we can do on our own, and we just had such a good track record of finding higher return projects that we haven't reached out to some of these others. We continue to look at a lot of things. I think people are wondering if we're looking at different opportunities, we are. We have a whole group that does that. And at the end of the day, we compare it to what we have as our plan that we have total control over.  As you know, in the M&A market, we don't have control of that. So we compare it to what we have internally. And if there's an opportunity, we're not opposed to pursuing it, but we do have the words we use is strict capital discipline and believe in getting really strong returns with the capital that we invest.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Theresa Chen with Barclays.\nTheresa Chen: I'd love to just sense of how volumes are trending across your G&P footprint just in light of lower natural gas prices and going back to your comment earlier, Mike, about production economics still being intact, what are you hearing on the ground from your customers?\nMichael Hennigan: Yes. Thanks, Theresa. I'm going to let Greg start, and then I'll come in after that.\nGregory Floerke: Theresa, this is Greg. As Mike mentioned earlier, the -- our largest area, which is Appalachia, particularly Marcellus, is one of the lowest cost production basin. So if you look at the macro drivers for what determines activity, the production cost level versus gas price, the amount of firm transportation capacity commitments by various producers and then hedging activity. And I think particularly in the Marcellus, the boxes are check there for most of the producers.  The -- if there's one thing we see, it's probably a shift -- the potential for a shift from lean gas, non-processable gas into rich gas basins. Definitely, if you rank the basins, the crude basins are obviously the most attractive with good crude pricing levels versus gas. And that activity is going to continue regardless of the natural gas prices. Waha is a good example of that, negative prices at times, but good crude prices still spurring growth.  The -- in general, we see more -- likely more shift to ethane recovery versus rejection, because those recovery spreads for fractioning ethane are positive. But we think that there should be continued potential shift over the rich gas areas from maybe more dry gas areas, which is very supportive of our large processing and both ethane -- de-ethanization and C3+ fractionation base in the Northeast in particular.\nMichael Hennigan: Theresa, it's Mike. I'll just add. I think Greg hit it on the head. As you see fluctuations in gas prices, and obviously, everybody has seen them over the last year or so. The rigs move around depending on wet versus dry, depending on the region and whether it has takeaway capacity, et cetera. Overall, we've been bullish natural gas, and we continue to be that into the future, particularly into a low carbon future. But there's going to be some stair steps that play itself out. . Takeaway capacity from the U.S. will change with more LNG next year and beyond. That's one thing that will happen as hopefully, permitting reform gets a little bit more advanced. You'll see some projects advance on a more timely fashion. But in general, I think we're still believing that the U.S. natural gas market is advantaged globally, and it will be an area of growth for us for some time.\nTheresa Chen: And in terms of the seasonality in your project-related expenses and the anticipated increase quarter-over-quarter heading into second quarter, is there a magnitude you can point to on how we should frame that?\nJohn Quaid: Theresa, it's John. Thanks for the question. Yes, I mean, again, I think it's something that flows similar to year-to-year. If you look at last year, 1Q to Q2, those costs were probably up about $30 million. We could maybe see something a little bit higher this year, but at least that gives you a little bit of a sense of the magnitude. And hopefully, that's helpful.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo.\nMichael Blum: Just had a question on the L&S segment. You had really strong volumes on the crude and terminal side. I'm just wondering, is this kind of a sustainable level? Or is there anything specific going on this quarter to point to?\nJohn Quaid: Michael, it's John. Thanks for the question. I think there's a couple of things there. One, as we highlighted, there's some of that effect that's driven off of the MPC refinery turnarounds. And things to remember is our pipelines of crude into the refineries and product out, they aren't the same level at every refinery. So depending on which refinery is up or down, you may or may not see the effect, for example, on the crude side if the crude coming into that refinery is on somebody else's pipeline. So there's a little bit of that effect in there.  And again, too, I mean, one of the things that's driving that growth is also our pipelines around the crude gathering business as we continue to grow that primarily in the Permian as well. So that's kind of baked into those numbers. So it's the mix of those 2 things that's driving the relative increase.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question will come from Doug Irwin with Citi.\nDouglas Irwin: Maybe to follow up on that last comment around some of the turnaround schedules. And if you look at kind of maintenance CapEx for 1Q, you're already about 1/3 of the way through the annual guidance number here. So just curious if there's kind of any heavy maintenance activity to call out in the quarter? And kind of how we should be thinking about the rest of the year given the MPC's turnarounds tend to be kind of more back half weighted?\nJohn Quaid: Yes. No, great question, Doug. So part of what's happening on the MPLX side with our maintenance capital, we do have some timing things this quarter. Again, we haven't changed our outlook of $150 million for the year, a little bit higher this quarter at $44 million, driven by a couple of major items. One, on the marine side of the business, when we replace assets, barges, vessels, but we maintain at the same level of total assets, we treat that and report that as maintenance capital, because we're not really growing our EBITDA, we're kind of maintaining it.  So we did have some asset replacements on the marine side that are just specific to that quarter that we don't have planned for the rest of the year. We also had some work around compressor station in Oklahoma, some repairs we were doing, and that work was completed in the quarter, and we don't see a significant item like that over the balance of the year. So again, -- it's more the maintenance on our assets, not necessarily tied to MPC's turnaround schedule.\nMichael Hennigan: Doug, it's Mike. Just for clarity, MPC's schedule is front half weighted in '23, mainly in Q1 and Q2. And last year, it was back half weighted mainly Q3 and Q4. So just to give you that color on MPC as well.\nDouglas Irwin: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then maybe just another follow-up on Brian's earlier question about this Permian gas takeaway. We've seen some peers file additional permits here recently for Permian pipelines, which seems to kind of signal demand for more capacity kind of beyond what's already been announced. I'm just kind of curious to get your broader thoughts on Permian gas takeaway and kind of how you see these dynamics playing out over the next few years?\nShawn Lyon: Doug, thanks for the question. This is Shawn. As I mentioned, we're continuing to be -- the gas takeaway, the demand continues to be strong. Our Whistler investment is paying out. And again, we look forward to the expansion of Whistler and Matterhorn. And we continue looking at future opportunities in that area. But we see that strong demand, as Greg and Mike have said, base to get to the crude. So we're pleased with where we're at and look forward to the future opportunities that we see.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities.\nNeal Dingmann: First question is just on the potential of the Marcellus expansion and bottleneck. I know you've spoken in the past. I believe I'm just kind of curious on, number one, the amount of space that you still have there on the existing processing plants and just sort of what the thoughts are on investing capital there in the near term given gas prices?\nGregory Floerke: Neal, this is Greg. In terms of the capacity, we process over 6 billion cubic feet a day of gas in Appalachia. Our utilization has continued to be in the high 80% to 90% range over the last few years. And so we see some producers not continuing to drill to maintain levels, some are growing. And so generally, though, it's sort of flat to slight growth in the processed volume area, but also drives fractionation. As the -- some of the rigs shift to dry gas, you typically see much higher volumes on IPs with dry gas than you do with rigs. So it opens up more takeaway capacity. As we also see more ethane recovery, it opens up takeaway capacity on the residue lines.  So -- in terms of individual producers, we'll continue to see growth. Some of our recently announced Harmon Creek II project expansion is a sign of that. So on a producer-by-producer basis, there is growth in some areas, essentially with room made for that capacity by declines in others.\nNeal Dingmann: Very good. And then you touched on this, I just want to make sure I understand just on what you most recently seen on the MPC refinery runs. I'm just wondering any change on expected activity or utilization for you all?\nJohn Quaid: Neal, it's John. That's a great question. And I think sometimes the challenge for folks to understand what kind of sensitivity we have or frankly don't have, the changes in MPC's utilization. So -- and it's really driven off of the MVCs and in some cases, right, some of our assets are fee for capacity. So we're getting paid to run and operate those assets regardless of utilization levels. So while we do have some sensitivity to MPC's refinery utilization, I think, it's maybe a little bit less than folks might think it is.\nOperator: And our last question will come from Neel Mitra with Bank of America.\nIndraneel Mitra: Firstly, I wanted to ask what inflation adders you have in place? And maybe how much they are, are they kind of FERC related? And where they reside or are they in L&S primarily or also in the G&P segment? And finally, when you would expect the timing of inflation adders to impact earnings?\nShawn Lyon: Neel, thanks for the question. This is Shawn. As you know, FERC is -- they're going through their process now. It's very public, very transparent to determine what that index rate is for the entire industry. And then once we -- we should hear in the next couple of weeks. Once we get that, we'll go through our process based on their guidance system by system to make sure we can implement it and then we'll post our tariff at the end of May with implementation in July. So I don't want to get ahead of ourselves, but really, it's -- we'll know more in a month where we're at, but we're just following their guidance as they move through their very public process. So hopefully, that helps Neel. So -- but thanks for the question.\nJohn Quaid: And Neel, it's John. Let me just add generally, right? So Shawn is speaking to the pipeline portion of our business. We have other inflation escalators. Some are fixed, some are linked to CPI, some are linked to other indexes. Some of those are effective Jan 1, some were effective July 1. So Shawn is speaking specifically to the pipelines, but we do see -- our contracts do have those escalators in across other portions of the L&S business, and we even see it a little bit on the G&P business as well. So again, just generally giving you -- but it's a mix. Some are fixed, some are indexed to certain items. And again, they have different effective dates as well. .\nIndraneel Mitra: Got it. My follow-up question, your equity interest in the Whistler expansion and also Matterhorn Express. One of your peers talked about their expansion being delayed a couple of months. I was just wondering if you could comment on if there's any potential delays or bottlenecks for your projects going forward right now or if you see any constraints?\nShawn Lyon: This is Shawn again. We are not seeing on our Whistler expansion. Again, we're not seeing any delays, and we're on plan and on budget.\nKristina Kazarian: All right. With that, thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in MPLX. Should you have additional questions or would like clarification on any of the topics discussed this morning, members of the Investor Relations team are available to take your calls. Have a great day, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "John Quaid",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Looking back over the last several years, our successful execution of the foundational strategic priorities, Mike just referenced, has resulted in a 6.8% compound annual growth rate for our DCF. As you can see on this slide, our growth is not linear and tends to come in stair steps as we develop and bring projects online. Last quarter, we announced a 2023 capital outlook of $950 million, including $800 million of growth capital and $150 million of maintenance capital.  Across both segments, we are focused on projects targeted at expansion or debottlenecking of existing assets to meet customer demand. In the L&S segment, our joint venture projects in the Permian are progressing. We see strong demand for the Whistler natural gas pipeline and its expansion to 2.5 billion cubic feet per day which remains on schedule for completion this September. We also expect volumes on the Wink to Webster crude pipeline to ramp over this year and the next 2 years as the pipeline continues to play segments into service. And as a reminder, these projects are largely financed at the joint venture level and the related capital is not reflected in our capital spending or capital outlook.  In the G&P segment, Torn\u0303ado II, our fifth 200 million cubic feet per day gas processing plant in the Permian came online in the fourth quarter of last year and is already operating near capacity, ahead of our midyear goal. We are also progressing Preakness II, our sixth plant in the Permian and the plant in the Marcellus, Harmon Creek II, both of these gas processing plants are expected to be online in the first half of 2024.  Slide 6 outlines the first quarter operational and financial performance highlights for our Logistics and Storage segment. The L&S segment reported record results with its first $1 billion adjusted EBITDA quarter. L&S segment adjusted EBITDA increased $122 million when compared to first quarter 2022. The increased results were primarily driven by growth in throughputs and higher rates across our L&S business lines. Total pipeline volumes were up 6% year-over-year, primarily due to growth in crude oil throughputs associated with expansion and debottlenecking activities and impacts associated with Marathon's refinery turnarounds. Terminal volumes were similarly up 5%.  Moving to our Gathering and Processing segment on Slide 7. G&P segment adjusted EBITDA increased $4 million, compared to first quarter 2022 as higher throughput fees and volumes were offset by lower natural gas liquids prices. While our G&P segment is largely a fee-based business, we do have some direct sensitivity to natural gas liquids prices. As a rough rule of thumb, our annual results are impacted by about $20 million for every $0.05 per gallon change in NGL prices. NGL prices averaged $0.77 per gallon for the quarter, as compared to $1.15 in the first quarter of 2022, resulting in roughly a $40 million unfavorable effect versus the prior year period.  For the quarter, total gathered volumes were up 21% year-over-year due to increased production in the Utica and the Permian. Processing volumes were up 4% year-over-year, primarily from higher volumes in the Permian driven by increased customer demand and our investments and processing capacity. Focusing in on the Marcellus, our largest basin of G&P operations, we saw year-over-year increases for gathering and fractionation volumes driven by increased customer demand and our investments in fractionation capacity.  Moving to our first quarter financial highlights on Slide 8. Total adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion was up 9% from the prior year, while distributable cash flow of $1.3 billion increased 5%. The lower year-over-year DCF growth was partly due to timing of maintenance capital expenditures, which were $30 million higher than the prior year. While we expect annual project-related expenses to be flat with the prior year, these projects are not performed ratably over the year.  As discussed last quarter, the first quarter is typically our lowest quarter for project-related expenses. As we look to the second quarter, we anticipate these expenses will increase sequentially as they have done in prior years. MPLX declared a first quarter distribution of $0.775 per unit, resulting in a distribution coverage ratio of 1.6x for the quarter.  During the quarter, we issued $1.6 billion in senior notes, and we redeemed the $600 million of outstanding Series B preferred notes and $1 billion of senior notes scheduled to mature in July. MPLX ended the quarter with total debt of around $21 billion and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 3.5x. Our leverage ratio has decreased over the last few years as our earnings have grown while our absolute debt level has remained relatively constant, providing the partnership with financial flexibility.  Now let me hand it back to Mike for some final thoughts. Jeremy, it's John. Great question. I'll take that and then let Mike comment as well. Certainly, as we look at where we are now, right, we're -- as we said last quarter, we're focused on the distribution. We certainly, over the last few years, have had opportunities on the repurchase side, and we'll continue to look at that. We're perhaps more opportunistic than we have been in the past as we commented last quarter. And even if you think back, we even tried to supplemental at one point, I think we've tried that and maybe got some reaction on that one that maybe is not still a tool for us, but not our primary focus.  So as we look at where we are now, again, looking back at last year's numbers, $6 billion of EBITDA, $5 billion of DCF, $4 billion of free cash flow, paying out $3 billion in distribution, $1 billion left over, we're sitting in a strong position. Balance sheet is strong, gives us that financial flexibility to think about capital allocation across the business. As you see, we continue to focus on strict capital discipline. We haven't changed our outlook of $800 million of growth spending for the year. And really, I think as we've kind of pivoted here recently, we see the distribution as our best opportunity to drive value for all unitholders while still supplementing that with opportunistic unit repurchases. Yes. I mean I think as I was saying, Jeremy, when we looked at kind of the space, our opportunity, you think even through COVID and maybe if you want to call it the COVID recession, we continue to grow the cash flow of the partnership and have kind of built up coverage as we pulled back -- we pulled back on our distribution, others may have cut. And now that we look at where we are, we certainly see that tool as the one that best -- gives us the best opportunity to solidify that value for all unitholders. That certainly has progressed over time.  I mean it's one thing. If you think about the over $1 billion of repurchases we did, we did at an average unit price of $29 a unit, right? We're sitting at about $35 today. So we always continue to look at where those levers are, but again, I think over time, as the options have evolved, right now, we see the best opportunity to drive value in the distribution. Brian, it's John. So I don't know that we're ready to provide '24 to '25 guidance at this point, right? You have seen us the last few years, talk about kind of a zone for where we're looking, what that piece of our capital allocation looks like. I don't know that we're anticipating a major change there, but probably a little bit early to talk about '24, '25 at this point. Yes. I mean if you think about some of the big ones I talked about, we'll still be spending some money on in '24 to get them up and running. But it's kind of been our playbook, right? We continue to look at opportunities and the best ones we see are across our footprint in the basins and areas where we've got strength, on the G&P side or strong tie-ins with MPC as well. So I think we're going to continue to look at those opportunities. And that's what we kind of got in the pipeline right now, but it could always change, but that's where we are right now. Keith, it's John. Thanks for the question. I think there, again, maybe kind of similar to Mike's comments on the capital side, it's probably more little singles and doubles. We had some maybe even at a lower level than our noncore basins. We've had some asset sales here and there if you look back at our results over the last year or so finding maybe terminals that maybe fit better in somebody's portfolio than ours or, for example, on the G&P side, we might have some natural gas supply lines for utilities that the utilities might be interested.  So it's probably been smaller things like that, that we've been doing that we probably don't raise to a level where we talk about those specific items in our materials, but again, those continue to drive the cash flow performance of the portfolio. I'd say on the basins, we continue to look there, but really don't have any pressing or immediate updates on that right now. Yes. Thanks for that. I'll start, and then I'll let Mike comment as well. I mean, certainly, we have the company financially in a position where if the right opportunity with the right type of high-quality assets that fits into our strategy and our footprint and has the right risk-adjusted return, right? If we had all those criteria and some others, we've got the partnership in a position where we can take advantage of those. But as I think you've heard us say over a number of quarterly calls, we're pretty strict in how we look at that. It just tends to be more challenging to get the returns on those type of projects versus maybe the opportunities we have organically within our own system in the places where we operate. Theresa, it's John. Thanks for the question. Yes, I mean, again, I think it's something that flows similar to year-to-year. If you look at last year, 1Q to Q2, those costs were probably up about $30 million. We could maybe see something a little bit higher this year, but at least that gives you a little bit of a sense of the magnitude. And hopefully, that's helpful. Michael, it's John. Thanks for the question. I think there's a couple of things there. One, as we highlighted, there's some of that effect that's driven off of the MPC refinery turnarounds. And things to remember is our pipelines of crude into the refineries and product out, they aren't the same level at every refinery. So depending on which refinery is up or down, you may or may not see the effect, for example, on the crude side if the crude coming into that refinery is on somebody else's pipeline. So there's a little bit of that effect in there.  And again, too, I mean, one of the things that's driving that growth is also our pipelines around the crude gathering business as we continue to grow that primarily in the Permian as well. So that's kind of baked into those numbers. So it's the mix of those 2 things that's driving the relative increase. Yes. No, great question, Doug. So part of what's happening on the MPLX side with our maintenance capital, we do have some timing things this quarter. Again, we haven't changed our outlook of $150 million for the year, a little bit higher this quarter at $44 million, driven by a couple of major items. One, on the marine side of the business, when we replace assets, barges, vessels, but we maintain at the same level of total assets, we treat that and report that as maintenance capital, because we're not really growing our EBITDA, we're kind of maintaining it.  So we did have some asset replacements on the marine side that are just specific to that quarter that we don't have planned for the rest of the year. We also had some work around compressor station in Oklahoma, some repairs we were doing, and that work was completed in the quarter, and we don't see a significant item like that over the balance of the year. So again, -- it's more the maintenance on our assets, not necessarily tied to MPC's turnaround schedule. Neal, it's John. That's a great question. And I think sometimes the challenge for folks to understand what kind of sensitivity we have or frankly don't have, the changes in MPC's utilization. So -- and it's really driven off of the MVCs and in some cases, right, some of our assets are fee for capacity. So we're getting paid to run and operate those assets regardless of utilization levels. So while we do have some sensitivity to MPC's refinery utilization, I think, it's maybe a little bit less than folks might think it is. And Neel, it's John. Let me just add generally, right?

            "name": "Gregory Floerke",
            "content": "Theresa, this is Greg. As Mike mentioned earlier, the -- our largest area, which is Appalachia, particularly Marcellus, is one of the lowest cost production basin. So if you look at the macro drivers for what determines activity, the production cost level versus gas price, the amount of firm transportation capacity commitments by various producers and then hedging activity. And I think particularly in the Marcellus, the boxes are check there for most of the producers.  The -- if there's one thing we see, it's probably a shift -- the potential for a shift from lean gas, non-processable gas into rich gas basins. Definitely, if you rank the basins, the crude basins are obviously the most attractive with good crude pricing levels versus gas. And that activity is going to continue regardless of the natural gas prices. Waha is a good example of that, negative prices at times, but good crude prices still spurring growth.  The -- in general, we see more -- likely more shift to ethane recovery versus rejection, because those recovery spreads for fractioning ethane are positive.

            "name": "Michael Hennigan",
            "content": "Thanks, Kristina. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. Earlier today, we reported our first quarter results. Our business continues to grow and delivered adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion, an increase of 9% year-over-year and a new quarterly record for the partnership. Distributable cash flow of nearly $1.3 billion was up 5% year-over-year.  Turning to the macro environment. While natural gas prices have come down recently, our long-term production outlook in our key regions remains largely unchanged. In our largest basin, the Marcellus, the cost to deliver for our key producer customers is still below the current prices. In the Permian and Bakken, our production outlook is unchanged as crude prices are strong and prices for associated gas do not significantly impact producer activity in these basins.  This quarter, we advanced our growth projects, which are anchored in the Marcellus, Permian and Bakken basins. We expect these disciplined investments in high-return projects, along with our focus on cost and portfolio optimization continue to drive cash flow growth. While our capital outlook is focused on our current O&S and G&P asset base, we are participating in 3 publicly announced alliances focused on CCUS and hydrogen technologies.  We will continue to evaluate low-carbon opportunities where we can leverage technologies that are complementary with our asset footprint and expertise. And we remain -- we remain optimistic -- sorry about that, about our opportunities in 2023, and are focused on executing the strategic priorities of strict capital discipline, fostering a low-cost culture, optimizing our asset portfolio, all of which are foundational to the growth of MPLX's cash flows.  Now let me turn the call over to John to discuss our growth as well as our operational and financial results for the quarter. Thanks, John. In closing, MPLX's growth strategy supports our commitment to return capital to the unitholders. MPLX remains a strategic part of MPC's portfolio, supported by the over $2 billion MPC receives annually from MPLX distribution. And as MPLX pursues its growth opportunities, we expect the value of this strategic relationship will continue to be enhanced.  Our business continues to grow and generate strong cash flows. By advancing our high-return growth projects anchored in the Marcellus, Permian and Bakken basins along with our focus on cost and portfolio optimization, we expect to continue to grow our cash flows, allowing us to reinvest in the business and return capital to unitholders. And for 2023, we expect the distribution to be our primary tool to return capital to unitholders.  Now let me turn the call back over to Kristina. Jeremy, it's Mike. I'm going to add that in the quarter, there was less volatility than normal in the unit price. We still have buybacks on the tool belt. But as John said and we said in our prepared remarks, we want investors to know we're committed to growing cash flows, and as a result, we're committed to growing our base distribution. We still have everything on the tool belt, but we're going to lean harder in general towards distributions to show investors we're continuing to grow the cash flows. Yes. Thanks, Jeremy. It's a good question. And a lot of people have written it in a certain fashion. What I meant was a general outlook of the business, but it will be stair-step, particularly on the natural gas side of our business. So let me just give you the facts, and then I'll come back to the comment. The fact is our distributable cash flow grew 6% in 2020 despite COVID. It grew 11% in 2021. It grew 4% in 2022. So if you look at that 3-year CAGR, it was 6.8%. And you can see a little bit of the stair-step, up 6%, up 11%, up 4%. So it's bouncing around a little bit.  So I've gotten a lot of questions about how we view our growth. So I was just trying to give what I consider just a general outlook of the business. And if you look at the last 3 years, I think that supports the statement. I'm hoping that helps. And thanks for commenting that we're not generally a guidance company, but just trying to give you a little bit better feel for how we think about the business and the growth of the cash flows. Brian, it's Mike. I'm just going to add. Our asset base is big enough. We're roughly $6 billion of EBITDA at this point. Our asset base is large enough that we get these organic growth opportunities that are not headliners, but they provide meaningful returns. And like I just answered to Jeremy's question, when you look at growing DCF 6%, 11%, 4% over the last 3 years or about a 7% CAGR, it kind of shows -- hopefully, it shows the market that we have opportunities. We're continuing to grow the cash flows, albeit not these big headliner type projects, just a lot of smaller higher return projects, which we think are easily executed and just drive right to the bottom line quickly.  So to your question, yes, there's a backlog of things that we're looking at that are similar. We'll continue to grow the asset base and kind of bolt on to all the places that we see where growth can be. And it's primarily in those basins that we've talked about as the larger ones, but we still have smaller projects occurring in those other basins as well. So if we spend the capital that we're thinking about over time, we think we're going to continue to grow those cash flows just the way we've described. Yes, I'll let Shawn take a stab at that one. . Yes, Keith, I'm going to add to what John just said at the end, because that's really the key. In order for us to look at something else, it's got a hurdle what we can do on our own, and we just had such a good track record of finding higher return projects that we haven't reached out to some of these others. We continue to look at a lot of things. I think people are wondering if we're looking at different opportunities, we are. We have a whole group that does that. And at the end of the day, we compare it to what we have as our plan that we have total control over.  As you know, in the M&A market, we don't have control of that. So we compare it to what we have internally. And if there's an opportunity, we're not opposed to pursuing it, but we do have the words we use is strict capital discipline and believe in getting really strong returns with the capital that we invest. Yes. Thanks, Theresa. I'm going to let Greg start, and then I'll come in after that. Theresa, it's Mike. I'll just add. I think Greg hit it on the head. As you see fluctuations in gas prices, and obviously, everybody has seen them over the last year or so. The rigs move around depending on wet versus dry, depending on the region and whether it has takeaway capacity, et cetera. Overall, we've been bullish natural gas, and we continue to be that into the future, particularly into a low carbon future. But there's going to be some stair steps that play itself out. . Takeaway capacity from the U.S. will change with more LNG next year and beyond. That's one thing that will happen as hopefully, permitting reform gets a little bit more advanced. You'll see some projects advance on a more timely fashion. But in general, I think we're still believing that the U.S. natural gas market is advantaged globally, and it will be an area of growth for us for some time. Doug, it's Mike. Just for clarity, MPC's schedule is front half weighted in '23, mainly in Q1 and Q2. And last year, it was back half weighted mainly Q3 and Q4. So just to give you that color on MPC as well."

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.\nKristina Kazarian: Good morning, and welcome to MPLX's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at mplx.com under the Investor tab. Joining me on the call today are Maryann Mannen, President and CEO; Kris Hagedorn, CFO; and other members of the executive team. We invite you to read the safe harbor statements and non-GAAP disclaimer on Slide 2. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the call and during the question-and-answer session that follows. Actual results may differ materially from what are expected today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC. And with that, I'll turn it over to Maryann.\nMaryann Mannen: Thanks, Kristina. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. We have grown MPLX adjusted EBITDA by over 7% through the first 9 months of the year when compared to last year, which supported the decision to increase the distribution 12.5% this quarter. While delivering on our commitment to safely operate our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees and support the communities in which we operate, in the third quarter, MPLX generated record adjusted EBITDA of $1.7 billion, a 7% increase compared to last year's third quarter. Distributable cash flow was $1.4 billion, which supported the return of nearly $950 million to unitholders. We are committed to returning capital to unitholders primarily through a growing distribution, but also through unit buybacks. And our growing portfolio is expected to support this level of annual distribution increases in the future. Turning to the macro. The United States continues to be a low-cost producer of energy fuels needed across the globe, and the outlook for hydrocarbons remains robust. Grid electrification, onshoring, near-shoring and data center development are driving natural gas demand growth forecast through the end of the decade. As demand increases for natural gas-powered electricity, we are well positioned to support the development plans of our producer customers. Globally, demand for transportation fuels is expected to grow, outpacing near-term capacity additions. The U.S. refining industry is expected to remain structurally advantaged over the rest of the world, and we believe Marathon's refining assets are the most competitive in each region in which they operate. Our operations within these refining value chains will provide future growth opportunities. MPLX advanced its strategic growth objectives with capital spending expected at over $1 billion for the year. Anchored in the Permian and Marcellus basins, our integrated footprint positions the partnership with opportunities to grow our natural gas and NGL assets. Within our gathering and processing businesses, producer activity remains robust across the Marcellus, Utica and Permian Basins. We are bringing new gas processing plants online to meet increasing customer demand in the Permian and Marcellus basins. In the Northeast, drilling efficiencies and longer laterals are allowing producers to hold costs steady while growing production volumes. In the Utica, producers are targeting economically advantaged liquids-rich acreage. Our year-to-date processing volumes have increased 50% versus the prior year. Producers' interest in working with MPLX remains strong. As new wells are placed online, we are positioned for throughput to increase in the Utica with minimal capital spending. In the Marcellus, we are building the Harmon Creek III processing plant and adding fractionation capacity as we work with our customers to align capacity expansion with their drilling plans. This project further enhances MPLX's position as the largest processor of natural gas and fractionator of NGLs in the Northeast. Once online in the second half of 2026, MPLX is expected to have Northeast processing capacity of 8.1 billion cubic feet per day and fractionation capacity of 800,000 barrels a day. Demonstrating our commitment to operational excellence, our Bluestone plant recently became the first natural gas facility in the country to achieve the U.S. EPA's ENERGY STAR. This requires reducing energy intensity by 10% within 5 years, and I am proud to share our team achieved an intensity reduction at Bluestone of approximately 12% in just 24 months. This accomplishment demonstrates our approach to continuous improvements and will reduce operating costs at the processing plant. Moving to the Permian, the Preakness II processing plant began operations in July and we are constructing the Secretariat processing plant. MPLX processing capacity in the Delaware Basin in the Permian is expected to be 1.4 Bcf per day once Secretariat is online in the second half of 2025. In the L&S segment, strong production in the Permian continues to create opportunities to execute on our wellhead-to-water strategy across crude, natural gas and NGLs. In the third quarter, we closed the acquisition of additional interest in the BANGL pipeline, bringing our ownership interest to 45%. The expansion of this pipeline to 250,000 barrels a day is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2025 as we progress the development of this strategic asset in our NGL value chain and wellhead-to-water strategy. Additionally, progress continues on the Blackcomb and Rio Bravo pipeline, which will connect Permian Basin supply to Gulf Coast domestic and export markets. Both pipelines are anticipated in service in the second half of 2026. The remainder of our capital plan is mostly comprised of smaller, higher-return investments targeted at expansion or debottlenecking of existing assets. For example, we have increased the size of our inland marine fleet to enhance product placement flexibility, expanded pipelines to serve regional demand growth and added storage to optimize crude blending for third parties. We have been able to execute our growth strategy using cash from operations, funding organic opportunities like the Preakness II, Secretariat and Harmon Creek II and III processing plants and inorganic growth opportunities like the Summit Utica acquisition and our acquisition of additional interest in the BANGL pipeline. We are confident in the potential of these growth opportunities to generate durable cash flow for MPLX supporting our commitment to return capital to unitholders. Now let me turn the call over to Kris to discuss our operational and financial results for the quarter.\nCarl Hagedorn: Thanks, Maryann. Slide 6 outlines the third quarter operational and financial performance highlights for the Logistics and Storage segment. L&S segment adjusted EBITDA set a new record, increasing $66 million when compared to third quarter 2023. This was driven by higher rates and throughputs, including growth from equity affiliates, offset by higher associated operating expenses. Pipeline volumes were up year-over-year, primarily due to lower volume impact from refinery maintenance and higher throughputs on the West Coast. Terminal volumes were also up year-over-year, primarily due to higher throughputs on the West Coast. Moving to our Gathering and Processing segment highlights on Slide 7. The G&P segment also established a new record to adjusted EBITDA -- increase -- as adjusted EBITDA increased $52 million compared to the third quarter of 2023. This was driven by increased volumes, including contributions from recently acquired assets in the Utica and Permian Basins. Total gathered volumes were up 8% year-over-year, primarily due to increased production in the Marcellus and the addition of dry gas volumes from Utica assets acquired earlier this year. Processing volumes were up 9% year-over-year, primarily from higher volumes in the Utica, Southwest and the Marcellus. Our recently placed in service processing plants, Harmon Creek II and Preakness II continue to see increased volumes and are expected to reach capacity within the next 12 months. In the Utica, volumes have increased 43% year-over-year, highlighting the value producers are seeing in the liquids-rich acreage. Total fractionation volumes grew 4% year-over-year, primarily due to higher volumes processed and ethane recoveries in the Marcellus and Utica. Focusing on the Marcellus, by far, our largest basin of G&P operations, we saw year-over-year volume increases of 11% for gathering and 4% for processing, driven by production growth. Marcellus processing utilization was 92% in the quarter, reflecting the continued ramp of our Harmon Creek II processing plant. Our Gathering and Processing business continues to grow, and today, MPLX handles over 10% of all natural gas produced in the United States, having recently processed a new daily record of over 10 Bcf per day. Moving to our third quarter financial highlights on Slide 8. Total adjusted EBITDA of $1.7 billion and distributable cash flow of $1.4 billion increased 7% and 5%, respectively from the prior year. MPLX returned $873 million in distributions and $76 million in unit repurchases to its unitholders this quarter. As Maryann discussed, based on our confidence in the growth of the business, we increased the distribution by 12.5% to approximately $3.83 per unit annualized, while maintaining strong distribution coverage of 1.5x. MPLX ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.4 billion. As a reminder, MPLX expects to retire $1.65 billion of senior notes maturing in December 2024 and February 2025. At the end of the quarter, our leverage was 3.4x. Now let me hand it back to Maryann for some final thoughts.\nMaryann Mannen: Thanks, Kris. We have delivered over 6% adjusted EBITDA growth and just under 8% DCF growth on a 3-year compound annual basis. We are executing our strategy and advancing growth opportunities across our value chain. In the Permian, we continue to see growth opportunities in our natural gas, NGL and crude value chains. In the Marcellus and Utica, producer activity remains robust, supporting growth of our gathering, processing and fractionation footprint. Advancing these high-return growth projects position us to grow our cash flow. MPLX is a strategic investment for Marathon. And with the distribution increase, MPC now expects to receive nearly $2.5 billion annually from MPLX, illustrating the strategic value of MPLX within MPC's portfolio. And as both pursue growth opportunities, the value of this strategic relationship is further enhanced. The growth and durability of our cash flows combined with strong coverage and low leverage provides MPLX considerable financial flexibility, driving the decision to increase the distribution by 12.5% this quarter. Our commitment to operational excellence, our growth opportunities and our financial flexibility position us to support this level of annual distribution increase in the future. Now let me turn the call back over to Kristina.\nKristina Kazarian: Thanks, Maryann. As we open the call for questions, we ask that you limit yourself to one question plus a follow-up. We may reprompt for additional questions as time permits. With that, Sheila, we're ready for the questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from John Mackay with Goldman Sachs.\nJohn Mackay: I appreciate all the comments around the distribution increase. Just curious if you could frame up a little more what drove the increase this year for 12.5% versus 10% prior? And how should we think about the forward pace of distribution growth from here?\nMaryann Mannen: John, thanks for the question. First, I'd say, look, the durability of our cash flows have really been the impetus for our decision to increase the distribution 12.5% versus the prior few years at 10%. We're executing our strategy. We're identifying and completing growth projects as we've talked about. We've announced a few of them here recently. I mentioned a few of them in my comments as well. We continue to reinvest in the business. And we're utilizing our portfolio of assets when you look at our capabilities in the Utica as an example. And then we think what we're trying to do here is really responsibly return capital to unitholders through this distribution and using share buyback appropriately as well. We think we've demonstrated over the last 3-year period distributable cash flows at just under 8%, EBITDA growth right in the range of 6%. We hope that you see our ability to continue to grow that. We've talked about our opportunities in the short term. We talked about our wellhead-to-water strategy. We've announced over the last couple of quarters, our commitment to build out our NGL and nat gas strategies as well. And so as we look out to the future, the strength of that mid-single-digit growth opportunity gives us the confidence to share that 12% distribution increase and give you some visibility for that into the future.\nJohn Mackay: Appreciate that. And maybe just turning to the Marcellus. Yes, this is one of the larger projects you've announced up there in a while. Maybe if you can kind of just frame up what you're seeing from the broader opportunity set there? Obviously, the Utica has recovered nicely. It looks like this would be some kind of incremental growth on the Marcellus side. Curious on just is Harmon III a one-off, let's say, or could there be more in the future?\nMaryann Mannen: Sure, John. As you know, one of the things we've been trying to convey is the advancing of the strategy, Permian, Marcellus and Utica. As I mentioned, we'll be completing the Secretariat gas processing plant. That was our seventh in the late 2025. And then Harmon Creek III, I think is another example of working with our producer customers to provide just-in-time. I'm going to pass this to Greg because I think he'll share with you a bit more as how he sees the opportunities unfolding in the Marcellus.\nGregory Floerke: John, we look at the Marcellus, it's 6 billion cubic feet a day of our 10 billion cubic feet total that we process every day. It's our largest area. You saw utilization up towards 95% before we brought Harmon Creek II online earlier this year. That plant continues to ramp, temporarily drop utilization down. But we're at high utilization there and a lot of it is just driven by longer laterals, flatter declines on the new wells. And it's the heart in terms of NGLs and rich gas productivity. We're in a sweet spot there. So we'll continue to work with our customers. We work with them regularly in terms of understanding their needs and their forecasts. And there may be opportunities incrementally to build out, but this is a big project for us and certainly will help drive that volume forward on our processing and gathering as well as liquid fractionation.\nOperator: Next, we will hear from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.\nJeremy Tonet: You listed a quite good list of organic growth initiatives. And so realize that's probably going to be front and center. But as it relates to future growth, I was just curious, I guess, on you've done some bolt-ons recently and how you see the opportunity set for this organic, as you said, or even some of these other bolt-ons out there. And at the same time, we've seen some of your peers make some larger M&A moves there. Just wondering how you think about balancing all of that right now?\nMaryann Mannen: Yes, Jeremy, thanks. So here's what I would say with respect to our opportunity set. We continue to see organic growth opportunities that will allow us really to deliver mid-single-digit growth. We've shared a couple of smaller bolt-on JV types. As you know, those JVs are not part of our capital program. We've been spending about $1 billion a year, give or take, depending on how you look at that. Those opportunities to expand our JVs are not part of that capital program, and we'll continue to look for opportunities there. We did a recent one, as you know, first quarter of this year, Utica Summit bought out a JV partner, where we think provided us fairly quick EBITDA growth in a JV that we knew well. So we believe there are sufficient organic growth opportunities. We've been talking a bit about our wellhead-to-water strategy as well. That gives us some capabilities for the future. We've taken an incremental position in BANGL. You heard us talk about closing that as well. So our focus here is organic opportunities that will allow us to maintain that mid-single-digit growth that we are committing to.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful there. And then just wanted to kind of pivot a little bit towards, I guess, the L&G side or really Rio Bravo pipeline project more specifically in that joint venture. And now that the DC Circuit Court vacated FERC authorization, I guess how do you think about progression on this project steps forward at this point, given the -- this setback?\nMaryann Mannen: Yes. So first of all, the project is moving forward on schedule, while all of that DC activity is happening. There's been a request for a rehearing filed at the DC Circuit Court. This is not necessarily abnormal in terms of activities that happen. So as of right now, I would tell you, project moving forward. We'll continue to update as the results of that rehearing come to fruition, and we'll provide you incremental activity around that as well.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Manav Gupta with UBS.\nManav Gupta: In your opening comments, you mentioned that you do expect incremental demand for electricity driven by data centers and natural gas -- the role natural gas will play in it. Some of your peers have been more vocal about it. Can you help us understand multiple ways in which MPLX can win if suddenly -- by 2030, you do need to 5 to 6 Bcf incremental natural gas to support electricity generation in the U.S.?\nMaryann Mannen: Manav, thank you. I would say this, we stand ready to support our producer, customers as that demand comes to fruition. We think we're uniquely positioned to supply given you heard us speak about the level of capability that we have in the region. You see the amount of gas that we're processing, technically it's about 10%. We're ready to support the development plans of our producer customers, and we'll continue to monitor the activity around data centers, et cetera, we stand ready. I'll pass it to Greg and see if he's got any incremental thoughts for you on that.\nGregory Floerke: I would say that I'd support what Maryann says, we're very well positioned in the Northeast. It's 70% of our total processing, and we also gather dry and lean gas there. So if you look at all of the molecules we touch, we're the largest player by far there, and I think we're very well positioned, whether initially, the data center demand is further downstream on the residue lines or whether eventually or could even be co-location of generation facilities and data centers closer to some of our facilities in the rich gas area. So we're excited about the opportunity. We'll be prepared to follow our customers there as required.\nManav Gupta: Quick follow-up here is, can we get an update on the Texas City frac and the storage project?\nDavid Heppner: Manav, this is Dave. Yes, happy to give you an update there. And as we look at our NGL value chain, our wellhead water strategy, both from the G&P side through the long-haul pipes, the BANGL and all the way down to the Gulf Coast, we look at the Texas City frac and storage and terminal and dock as one of the options that we're evaluating to continue to build out that value chain. So that process is continuing. We want to make sure, as we do with any investments that is strict capital discipline, commercial flexibility and evaluating strategic alternatives. So as we continue that and have some more clarity, we'll update you when we can. So look forward to doing that in the future.\nOperator: Next you will hear from Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research.\nKeith Stanley: First, I just wanted to follow up on the commentary of continuing the 12.5% distribution growth in the future. Can you give any sense of what time period that comment would apply to or guidepost to look at for how long that's sustainable, whether it's coverage thresholds or leverage or anything else?\nMaryann Mannen: Yes, Keith, sure. So as you know, and we've been trying to convey, we think we've got quite a bit of financial flexibility. One, as we look at the strength of our balance sheet, we look at our commitment around debt-to-EBITDA ratios. We've said we're comfortable in and about 4x, we're below that. But probably most importantly, as we think about the duration of that distribution increase, we're looking at the ability to continue those cash flow growth. So as I mentioned over the last 3 years, right, you've seen that distributable cash flow just under 8%. As we look at the projects that we are putting to work, I mentioned to a few of them that will grow our EBITDA '25, '26, we see a period of time where 12.5% is very doable. It's tough to give you an extremely long horizon. You know that as well as I do. But we certainly are trying to convey to you that, that distribution at 12.5% has the potential, notwithstanding all of the things that we talked about to be durable for a period of time.\nKeith Stanley: Second question is just wanted to revisit the drop-down concept. So that Marathon's cash balance, if you take out the MPLX cash has come down a lot over the past year because buybacks have been obviously very robust. Should we think of the time line to consider drop-downs of MPC assets into MPLX is more driven by cash needs at Marathon for their capital return targets or is it more tied to MPLX needing acquisitions to help meet its growth targets?\nMaryann Mannen: Yes, Keith, first of all, what I would say to you with respect to the way that we MPLX think about capital allocation, we maintain strict capital discipline. So when we are evaluating where to put capital to work, we do that through our lens of strict capital discipline. We need to be sure that when we're putting capital to work, that capital is generating the returns that you all expect. As it relates specifically to your question around drop-downs, one of the things that we've said is they are certainly not a priority. We'll continue to look at them. And when and if they make sense versus the other organic opportunities that we have to continue to grow the EBITDA of MPLX, we will employ them. You made a comment about MPC cash. And you're right. Certainly, we have seen that cash balance over the last several quarters as we've continued to meet our commitment of returning all cash that is not otherwise required via share buyback. And we continue to be committed to do that. But the growth opportunities for MPLX will follow strict capital discipline and we'll evaluate whether or not a drop-down versus another alternative putting capital to work yields the returns that you all expect.\nOperator: Next, you will hear from Theresa Chen with Barclays.\nTheresa Chen: As a follow-up to the Permian NGL question, in terms of the Texas City frac, should we think about timing related to that project as that it should be in tandem of when your [ TNF ] contracts come up for renewal since your long gathering, processing have more long-haul transportation and clearly short frac right now and maybe it doesn't make sense for that facility to come up prior. And then in the same vein of thought, would you likely bring export up at the same time so as to keep that molecule along your own wellhead-to-water value chain or would it be more of a step process?\nMaryann Mannen: Theresa, thanks for your question. Let me try to start really with the wellhead-to-water strategy and try to give you some insight as to how we think about that. When we talk about our Texas City frac potential, we are really looking at a series of alternatives as we continue to progress around that strategy. Both the NGL and the nat gas wellhead-to-water approach really focuses on the integrated value chain strategies both for the -- in the Permian and they're a really important piece of what we are trying to accomplish in MPLX. So we are trying to maintain flexibility as we work through all of the opportunities that we see to complete that very important value chain and growth opportunity for MPLX. I'm going to ask Dave to give you a little more color as we're progressing through that strategy.\nDavid Heppner: Thanks, Maryann. So Theresa, we throw around the word wellhead-to-water integrated value chain strategies quite a bit. So maybe if I step back and talk about how we think about it at MPLX. And as you would expect, it all starts -- the value chains all starts back at the wellhead. So as you've heard, we've incrementally grown processing capacity over the last few years to serve some of the best producer customers in the Permian Basin. And with Secretariat plant coming online, which I touched on earlier in the second half of 2025, we expect to have a total of 1.4 Bcf a day of natural gas processing capacity. While this is the first step in serving our customers and process the gas, the also very integral part of that is the ability to clear the resid gas and the NGLs out of the basin. That leads us into the second piece of that value chain, which is our investment in long-haul pipelines, which, of course, is the move of volumes out of the basin to the Gulf Coast markets. So for NGLs, as we touched on earlier, BANGL is the key strategic asset to do that. And in third quarter, we increased, as we touched on earlier, our stake in that. So we increased it 45%. And progress continues on the expansion of 250,000 barrels a day, which you expect to be in service in first quarter 2025, so not too far down the road. So with that, we're seeing strong volumes, and we're confident in the growth profile of that asset. So on the NGL side, we're feeling very well. And the nat gas side, our strategy is really anchored around our Whistler JV platform. So in addition to the Whistler main line, which has been in service for a while, last quarter, we announced the FID of Blackcomb, which is that additional 42-inch pipeline that will connect the Permian Basin to the Gulf Coast. The final stage is what you touched on in your comments of the wellhead-to-water strategy is really down at the water. And that's focused on connecting the volumes to our customers while creating optionality for our shippers. So on the nat gas side, some examples of that strategy that we've already put in service are the ADCC pipeline, which came in service in July of last year -- I'm sorry, this year, I apologize. And the Rio Grande (sic) [ Bravo ] pipeline, which we expect to be in service second half of 2026, and Maryann touched on that a little bit. And as we touched on earlier on the NGL side, as we look at our Texas City fracs, docks and terminals. We continue to evaluate those options to bring that last link of that value chain of the NGL. So hopefully, from both a nat gas and NGL perspective, you can see how over the recent past, we've been building out those strong value chains from the Permian Basin to the Gulf Coast and access to the water. So hopefully, that gives you additional color.\nTheresa Chen: And turning to the West Coast, following Phillips' announced closure of its Southern California refinery later this year and into next year. I'm sure you will touch on the implications for MPC at your later call today. But for MPLX, does this change flows or utilization of your logistics assets either from a direct or indirect manner?\nShawn Lyon: Theresa, this is Shawn. I'll touch on your question there. Really, we don't see any near-term change out of the gate here. It's really -- we've got an integrated value chain all the way from water to the refinery and the logistics to get -- move it around the basin down there. So we don't see any near term there. And if you look at the demand and supply out there, it's all pretty tight out there. So we consider as we make those decisions and work with the refinery out there to make sure that we meet the supply that's needed in a timely manner, but don't see any near-term effect.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo.\nMichael Blum: I wanted to ask about Harmon Creek III. I noticed on the slide, you point to a 20% return there. So I'm wondering is that -- would you say -- is that like a higher return than normal? Or would you say that now on incremental investments, this is kind of a new hurdle rate?\nGregory Floerke: Michael, this is Greg. I would say we target that type of return rate on any of our new projects. We have strong relationships with our customers, strong contractual support when we make these incremental organic project decisions. So we feel strongly about the project, and we're excited about it.\nMichael Blum: Great. And then I just wanted to ask about CapEx in 2025 and beyond. Obviously, you're laying out a lot of new high-return projects. Just wondering if that -- the cadence you've been on, which is roughly $1 billion to $1.1 billion of total CapEx. Is that still kind of the right kind of run rate? Or do you think that's going to trend higher over time?\nMaryann Mannen: Michael, thanks for the question. You're right. Over the last few years, on average, we've been putting about $1 billion to work to grow the enterprise. As you continue to think about the size of EBITDA and what it would take for mid-single-digit growth beyond that, it's possible that our capital spend would need to increase above $1 billion in order to maintain mid-single-digit growth on a growing EBITDA. But we're a little early for 2025 yet. We'll give you good color as we head into the next earnings call. But certainly, when we see those organic opportunities, like the project you mentioned, Harmon Creek III. When you look at the return on that project, you look at the producer customer relationship, you look at our ability to have just in time and you look for that to continue to deliver the EBITDA growth that we're talking about, we think, again, maintaining strict capital discipline in putting that kind of capital to work will allow us to grow in mid-single-digit growth. But we'll give you greater insight into the amount of capital as we head into the '25 outlook. I hope that helps you, Michael.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities.\nNeal Dingmann: I've got my first question just on your Marcellus organic activity. Specifically, there was a number of public Appalachian E&Ps last week that just mentioned no surprise that they're going to defer a few more DUCs until things improve. And I'm just wondering with these type of minor adjustments, does this impact either existing or sort of your near-term future plans?\nGregory Floerke: Neal, this is Greg again. We don't see any current impact -- material impact on our volumes. The producers -- various producers, depending on whether it's lean gas or rich gas have different plans around -- and economics around their wells. So we don't see an issue there.\nNeal Dingmann: Great. Great response. And then just a quick follow-up on your Marcellus as well. Just wondering specifically on the Marcellus processing, I'm just wondering, have you all seen from the continue -- it seems like there's been a continued ramp as MVP continues to go forward. I'm just wondering, have you seen this continuing to help boost your -- the Mobley processing plan of yours?\nGregory Floerke: Yes. I think that MPC -- excuse me, MVP is a boost for the entire region. Anything that provides more residue gas takeaway is a boost. I think the other thing that we see is that there's a higher proportion of rich gas well pads that come online versus the higher volume lean gas, which is a sweet spot of ours because processing and fractionation in the Northeast is our sweet spot. You actually see lower residue gas production versus lean. That opens up capacity as well out of the basin on existing lines other than MVP.\nOperator: And our last question will come from Neel Mitra with Bank of America.\nIndraneel Mitra: You've been very active in your downstream NGL operations, expanding and talking about the Texas City frac. Can you talk about how your producers use Sweeny as an alternative to Mont Belvieu and just how you see the logistics there and the opportunity to continue to grow with fractionation and possibly an export facility?\nGregory Floerke: This is Greg. In terms of our producer customers, we started on that end when we built our first plant Southwest with solid customers and they've continued to rely on us to find outlets for them for the residue gas and for their NGLs. And we've continued to do that. And incrementally, as we've grown that capacity, we've used various options. Obviously, we'd like to have as much optionality as possible. So to get into -- down into the Galveston, the Houston area and have access to Belvieu and some of the storage there is just is going to provide that much more optionality and opportunity for our customers. So we continue to focus on all of the above.\nIndraneel Mitra: Okay. Perfect. And you've been very active in a short period of time in building out NGL and gas infrastructure. I was curious how you viewed crude infrastructure whether that be a drop down longer term from MPC with Gray Oak or LOOP or possibly a JV just with crude pipelines in the Permian. I wanted to understand how you view that business now that you have natural gas and NGLs?\nMaryann Mannen: Yes, Neel, thanks. It's Maryann. Just first and foremost, when we think about drop-downs, I think you were asking sort of how we think about that. We continue to believe that our growth opportunities organically have the opportunity to support our mid-single-digit growth. So they remain largely a lower priority than the other projects that we've got and are evaluating. But I'll pass it to Dave and let him give you some of the specifics that you're asking for.\nDavid Heppner: Neel, yes, you touched on -- we spent a lot of time talking about our nat gas and NGL value chains, and we don't want to forget about our crude value chains. And we have a pretty sizable platform in the Permian for crude gathering and blending benefits up there. And so -- and as you've seen in the space, there's been a lot of activity in the recent past on the M&A side of the equation. So very similar, we touched on earlier, we continue to look at opportunities to grow out that platform very similar to how we've grown out the nat gas and NGL. Sometimes is buying out JV partners, very low risk, but because we know the assets very well. Sometimes it's maybe buying single bolt-on assets and sometimes it may be looking at maybe a little more sizable M&A opportunity. So a lot of activity in that space. We continue to look at them, and I appreciate you bringing that up because we don't want to forget about the third leg of our value chain is the crude side of the equation. So I appreciate that.\nOperator: We are showing no further questions at this time.\nKristina Kazarian: Perfect. Well, thank you all for joining us today and for your interest in MPLX. Should you have any additional questions or like clarification on any of the topics discussed this morning, members of the IR team will be available today to help with your calls.\nOperator: That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "content": "Thanks, Kristina. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. We have grown MPLX adjusted EBITDA by over 7% through the first 9 months of the year when compared to last year, which supported the decision to increase the distribution 12.5% this quarter. While delivering on our commitment to safely operate our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees and support the communities in which we operate, in the third quarter, MPLX generated record adjusted EBITDA of $1.7 billion, a 7% increase compared to last year's third quarter. Distributable cash flow was $1.4 billion, which supported the return of nearly $950 million to unitholders. We are committed to returning capital to unitholders primarily through a growing distribution, but also through unit buybacks. And our growing portfolio is expected to support this level of annual distribution increases in the future. Turning to the macro. The United States continues to be a low-cost producer of energy fuels needed across the globe, and the outlook for hydrocarbons remains robust. Grid electrification, onshoring, near-shoring and data center development are driving natural gas demand growth forecast through the end of the decade. As demand increases for natural gas-powered electricity, we are well positioned to support the development plans of our producer customers. Globally, demand for transportation fuels is expected to grow, outpacing near-term capacity additions. The U.S. refining industry is expected to remain structurally advantaged over the rest of the world, and we believe Marathon's refining assets are the most competitive in each region in which they operate. Our operations within these refining value chains will provide future growth opportunities. MPLX advanced its strategic growth objectives with capital spending expected at over $1 billion for the year. Anchored in the Permian and Marcellus basins, our integrated footprint positions the partnership with opportunities to grow our natural gas and NGL assets. Within our gathering and processing businesses, producer activity remains robust across the Marcellus, Utica and Permian Basins. We are bringing new gas processing plants online to meet increasing customer demand in the Permian and Marcellus basins. In the Northeast, drilling efficiencies and longer laterals are allowing producers to hold costs steady while growing production volumes. In the Utica, producers are targeting economically advantaged liquids-rich acreage. Our year-to-date processing volumes have increased 50% versus the prior year. Producers' interest in working with MPLX remains strong. As new wells are placed online, we are positioned for throughput to increase in the Utica with minimal capital spending. In the Marcellus, we are building the Harmon Creek III processing plant and adding fractionation capacity as we work with our customers to align capacity expansion with their drilling plans. This project further enhances MPLX's position as the largest processor of natural gas and fractionator of NGLs in the Northeast. Once online in the second half of 2026, MPLX is expected to have Northeast processing capacity of 8.1 billion cubic feet per day and fractionation capacity of 800,000 barrels a day. Demonstrating our commitment to operational excellence, our Bluestone plant recently became the first natural gas facility in the country to achieve the U.S. EPA's ENERGY STAR. This requires reducing energy intensity by 10% within 5 years, and I am proud to share our team achieved an intensity reduction at Bluestone of approximately 12% in just 24 months. This accomplishment demonstrates our approach to continuous improvements and will reduce operating costs at the processing plant. Moving to the Permian, the Preakness II processing plant began operations in July and we are constructing the Secretariat processing plant. MPLX processing capacity in the Delaware Basin in the Permian is expected to be 1.4 Bcf per day once Secretariat is online in the second half of 2025. In the L&S segment, strong production in the Permian continues to create opportunities to execute on our wellhead-to-water strategy across crude, natural gas and NGLs. In the third quarter, we closed the acquisition of additional interest in the BANGL pipeline, bringing our ownership interest to 45%. The expansion of this pipeline to 250,000 barrels a day is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2025 as we progress the development of this strategic asset in our NGL value chain and wellhead-to-water strategy. Additionally, progress continues on the Blackcomb and Rio Bravo pipeline, which will connect Permian Basin supply to Gulf Coast domestic and export markets. Both pipelines are anticipated in service in the second half of 2026. The remainder of our capital plan is mostly comprised of smaller, higher-return investments targeted at expansion or debottlenecking of existing assets. For example, we have increased the size of our inland marine fleet to enhance product placement flexibility, expanded pipelines to serve regional demand growth and added storage to optimize crude blending for third parties. We have been able to execute our growth strategy using cash from operations, funding organic opportunities like the Preakness II, Secretariat and Harmon Creek II and III processing plants and inorganic growth opportunities like the Summit Utica acquisition and our acquisition of additional interest in the BANGL pipeline. We are confident in the potential of these growth opportunities to generate durable cash flow for MPLX supporting our commitment to return capital to unitholders. Now let me turn the call over to Kris to discuss our operational and financial results for the quarter. Thanks, Kris. We have delivered over 6% adjusted EBITDA growth and just under 8% DCF growth on a 3-year compound annual basis. We are executing our strategy and advancing growth opportunities across our value chain. In the Permian, we continue to see growth opportunities in our natural gas, NGL and crude value chains. In the Marcellus and Utica, producer activity remains robust, supporting growth of our gathering, processing and fractionation footprint. Advancing these high-return growth projects position us to grow our cash flow. MPLX is a strategic investment for Marathon. And with the distribution increase, MPC now expects to receive nearly $2.5 billion annually from MPLX, illustrating the strategic value of MPLX within MPC's portfolio. And as both pursue growth opportunities, the value of this strategic relationship is further enhanced. The growth and durability of our cash flows combined with strong coverage and low leverage provides MPLX considerable financial flexibility, driving the decision to increase the distribution by 12.5% this quarter. Our commitment to operational excellence, our growth opportunities and our financial flexibility position us to support this level of annual distribution increase in the future. Now let me turn the call back over to Kristina. John, thanks for the question. First, I'd say, look, the durability of our cash flows have really been the impetus for our decision to increase the distribution 12.5% versus the prior few years at 10%. We're executing our strategy. We're identifying and completing growth projects as we've talked about. We've announced a few of them here recently. I mentioned a few of them in my comments as well. We continue to reinvest in the business. And we're utilizing our portfolio of assets when you look at our capabilities in the Utica as an example. And then we think what we're trying to do here is really responsibly return capital to unitholders through this distribution and using share buyback appropriately as well. We think we've demonstrated over the last 3-year period distributable cash flows at just under 8%, EBITDA growth right in the range of 6%. We hope that you see our ability to continue to grow that. We've talked about our opportunities in the short term. We talked about our wellhead-to-water strategy. We've announced over the last couple of quarters, our commitment to build out our NGL and nat gas strategies as well. And so as we look out to the future, the strength of that mid-single-digit growth opportunity gives us the confidence to share that 12% distribution increase and give you some visibility for that into the future. Sure, John. As you know, one of the things we've been trying to convey is the advancing of the strategy, Permian, Marcellus and Utica. As I mentioned, we'll be completing the Secretariat gas processing plant. That was our seventh in the late 2025. And then Harmon Creek III, I think is another example of working with our producer customers to provide just-in-time. I'm going to pass this to Greg because I think he'll share with you a bit more as how he sees the opportunities unfolding in the Marcellus. Yes, Jeremy, thanks. So here's what I would say with respect to our opportunity set. We continue to see organic growth opportunities that will allow us really to deliver mid-single-digit growth. We've shared a couple of smaller bolt-on JV types. As you know, those JVs are not part of our capital program. We've been spending about $1 billion a year, give or take, depending on how you look at that. Those opportunities to expand our JVs are not part of that capital program, and we'll continue to look for opportunities there. We did a recent one, as you know, first quarter of this year, Utica Summit bought out a JV partner, where we think provided us fairly quick EBITDA growth in a JV that we knew well. So we believe there are sufficient organic growth opportunities. We've been talking a bit about our wellhead-to-water strategy as well. That gives us some capabilities for the future. We've taken an incremental position in BANGL. You heard us talk about closing that as well. So our focus here is organic opportunities that will allow us to maintain that mid-single-digit growth that we are committing to. Yes. So first of all, the project is moving forward on schedule, while all of that DC activity is happening. There's been a request for a rehearing filed at the DC Circuit Court. This is not necessarily abnormal in terms of activities that happen. So as of right now, I would tell you, project moving forward. We'll continue to update as the results of that rehearing come to fruition, and we'll provide you incremental activity around that as well. Manav, thank you. I would say this, we stand ready to support our producer, customers as that demand comes to fruition. We think we're uniquely positioned to supply given you heard us speak about the level of capability that we have in the region. You see the amount of gas that we're processing, technically it's about 10%. We're ready to support the development plans of our producer customers, and we'll continue to monitor the activity around data centers, et cetera, we stand ready. I'll pass it to Greg and see if he's got any incremental thoughts for you on that. Yes, Keith, sure. So as you know, and we've been trying to convey, we think we've got quite a bit of financial flexibility. One, as we look at the strength of our balance sheet, we look at our commitment around debt-to-EBITDA ratios. We've said we're comfortable in and about 4x, we're below that. But probably most importantly, as we think about the duration of that distribution increase, we're looking at the ability to continue those cash flow growth. So as I mentioned over the last 3 years, right, you've seen that distributable cash flow just under 8%. As we look at the projects that we are putting to work, I mentioned to a few of them that will grow our EBITDA '25, '26, we see a period of time where 12.5% is very doable. It's tough to give you an extremely long horizon. You know that as well as I do. But we certainly are trying to convey to you that, that distribution at 12.5% has the potential, notwithstanding all of the things that we talked about to be durable for a period of time. Yes, Keith, first of all, what I would say to you with respect to the way that we MPLX think about capital allocation, we maintain strict capital discipline. So when we are evaluating where to put capital to work, we do that through our lens of strict capital discipline. We need to be sure that when we're putting capital to work, that capital is generating the returns that you all expect. As it relates specifically to your question around drop-downs, one of the things that we've said is they are certainly not a priority. We'll continue to look at them. And when and if they make sense versus the other organic opportunities that we have to continue to grow the EBITDA of MPLX, we will employ them. You made a comment about MPC cash. And you're right. Certainly, we have seen that cash balance over the last several quarters as we've continued to meet our commitment of returning all cash that is not otherwise required via share buyback. And we continue to be committed to do that. But the growth opportunities for MPLX will follow strict capital discipline and we'll evaluate whether or not a drop-down versus another alternative putting capital to work yields the returns that you all expect. Theresa, thanks for your question. Let me try to start really with the wellhead-to-water strategy and try to give you some insight as to how we think about that. When we talk about our Texas City frac potential, we are really looking at a series of alternatives as we continue to progress around that strategy. Both the NGL and the nat gas wellhead-to-water approach really focuses on the integrated value chain strategies both for the -- in the Permian and they're a really important piece of what we are trying to accomplish in MPLX. So we are trying to maintain flexibility as we work through all of the opportunities that we see to complete that very important value chain and growth opportunity for MPLX. I'm going to ask Dave to give you a little more color as we're progressing through that strategy. Michael, thanks for the question. You're right. Over the last few years, on average, we've been putting about $1 billion to work to grow the enterprise. As you continue to think about the size of EBITDA and what it would take for mid-single-digit growth beyond that, it's possible that our capital spend would need to increase above $1 billion in order to maintain mid-single-digit growth on a growing EBITDA. But we're a little early for 2025 yet. We'll give you good color as we head into the next earnings call. But certainly, when we see those organic opportunities, like the project you mentioned, Harmon Creek III. When you look at the return on that project, you look at the producer customer relationship, you look at our ability to have just in time and you look for that to continue to deliver the EBITDA growth that we're talking about, we think, again, maintaining strict capital discipline in putting that kind of capital to work will allow us to grow in mid-single-digit growth. But we'll give you greater insight into the amount of capital as we head into the '25 outlook. I hope that helps you, Michael. Yes, Neel, thanks. It's Maryann. Just first and foremost, when we think about drop-downs, I think you were asking sort of how we think about that. We continue to believe that our growth opportunities organically have the opportunity to support our mid-single-digit growth. So they remain largely a lower priority than the other projects that we've got and are evaluating. But I'll pass it to Dave and let him give you some of the specifics that you're asking for."

            "content": "John, we look at the Marcellus, it's 6 billion cubic feet a day of our 10 billion cubic feet total that we process every day. It's our largest area. You saw utilization up towards 95% before we brought Harmon Creek II online earlier this year. That plant continues to ramp, temporarily drop utilization down. But we're at high utilization there and a lot of it is just driven by longer laterals, flatter declines on the new wells. And it's the heart in terms of NGLs and rich gas productivity. We're in a sweet spot there. So we'll continue to work with our customers. We work with them regularly in terms of understanding their needs and their forecasts. And there may be opportunities incrementally to build out, but this is a big project for us and certainly will help drive that volume forward on our processing and gathering as well as liquid fractionation. I would say that I'd support what Maryann says, we're very well positioned in the Northeast. It's 70% of our total processing, and we also gather dry and lean gas there. So if you look at all of the molecules we touch, we're the largest player by far there, and I think we're very well positioned, whether initially, the data center demand is further downstream on the residue lines or whether eventually or could even be co-location of generation facilities and data centers closer to some of our facilities in the rich gas area. So we're excited about the opportunity. We'll be prepared to follow our customers there as required. Michael, this is Greg. I would say we target that type of return rate on any of our new projects. We have strong relationships with our customers, strong contractual support when we make these incremental organic project decisions. So we feel strongly about the project, and we're excited about it. Neal, this is Greg again. We don't see any current impact -- material impact on our volumes. The producers -- various producers, depending on whether it's lean gas or rich gas have different plans around -- and economics around their wells. So we don't see an issue there. Yes. I think that MPC -- excuse me, MVP is a boost for the entire region. Anything that provides more residue gas takeaway is a boost. I think the other thing that we see is that there's a higher proportion of rich gas well pads that come online versus the higher volume lean gas, which is a sweet spot of ours because processing and fractionation in the Northeast is our sweet spot. You actually see lower residue gas production versus lean. That opens up capacity as well out of the basin on existing lines other than MVP. This is Greg. In terms of our producer customers, we started on that end when we built our first plant Southwest with solid customers and they've continued to rely on us to find outlets for them for the residue gas and for their NGLs. And we've continued to do that. And incrementally, as we've grown that capacity, we've used various options. Obviously, we'd like to have as much optionality as possible. So to get into -- down into the Galveston, the Houston area and have access to Belvieu and some of the storage there is just is going to provide that much more optionality and opportunity for our customers. So we continue to focus on all of the above."

            "content": "Thanks, Maryann. Slide 6 outlines the third quarter operational and financial performance highlights for the Logistics and Storage segment. L&S segment adjusted EBITDA set a new record, increasing $66 million when compared to third quarter 2023. This was driven by higher rates and throughputs, including growth from equity affiliates, offset by higher associated operating expenses. Pipeline volumes were up year-over-year, primarily due to lower volume impact from refinery maintenance and higher throughputs on the West Coast. Terminal volumes were also up year-over-year, primarily due to higher throughputs on the West Coast. Moving to our Gathering and Processing segment highlights on Slide 7. The G&P segment also established a new record to adjusted EBITDA -- increase -- as adjusted EBITDA increased $52 million compared to the third quarter of 2023. This was driven by increased volumes, including contributions from recently acquired assets in the Utica and Permian Basins. Total gathered volumes were up 8% year-over-year, primarily due to increased production in the Marcellus and the addition of dry gas volumes from Utica assets acquired earlier this year. Processing volumes were up 9% year-over-year, primarily from higher volumes in the Utica, Southwest and the Marcellus. Our recently placed in service processing plants, Harmon Creek II and Preakness II continue to see increased volumes and are expected to reach capacity within the next 12 months. In the Utica, volumes have increased 43% year-over-year, highlighting the value producers are seeing in the liquids-rich acreage. Total fractionation volumes grew 4% year-over-year, primarily due to higher volumes processed and ethane recoveries in the Marcellus and Utica. Focusing on the Marcellus, by far, our largest basin of G&P operations, we saw year-over-year volume increases of 11% for gathering and 4% for processing, driven by production growth. Marcellus processing utilization was 92% in the quarter, reflecting the continued ramp of our Harmon Creek II processing plant. Our Gathering and Processing business continues to grow, and today, MPLX handles over 10% of all natural gas produced in the United States, having recently processed a new daily record of over 10 Bcf per day. Moving to our third quarter financial highlights on Slide 8. Total adjusted EBITDA of $1.7 billion and distributable cash flow of $1.4 billion increased 7% and 5%, respectively from the prior year. MPLX returned $873 million in distributions and $76 million in unit repurchases to its unitholders this quarter. As Maryann discussed, based on our confidence in the growth of the business, we increased the distribution by 12.5% to approximately $3.83 per unit annualized, while maintaining strong distribution coverage of 1.5x. MPLX ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.4 billion. As a reminder, MPLX expects to retire $1.65 billion of senior notes maturing in December 2024 and February 2025. At the end of the quarter, our leverage was 3.4x. Now let me hand it back to Maryann for some final thoughts."

It's really -- we've got an integrated value chain all the way from water to the refinery and the logistics to get -- move it around the basin down there. So we don't see any near term there. And if you look at the demand and supply out there, it's all pretty tight out there. So we consider as we make those decisions and work with the refinery out there to make sure that we meet the supply that's needed in a timely manner, but don't see any near-term effect."

            "content": "Manav, this is Dave. Yes, happy to give you an update there. And as we look at our NGL value chain, our wellhead water strategy, both from the G&P side through the long-haul pipes, the BANGL and all the way down to the Gulf Coast, we look at the Texas City frac and storage and terminal and dock as one of the options that we're evaluating to continue to build out that value chain. So that process is continuing. We want to make sure, as we do with any investments that is strict capital discipline, commercial flexibility and evaluating strategic alternatives. So as we continue that and have some more clarity, we'll update you when we can. So look forward to doing that in the future. Thanks, Maryann. So Theresa, we throw around the word wellhead-to-water integrated value chain strategies quite a bit. So maybe if I step back and talk about how we think about it at MPLX. And as you would expect, it all starts -- the value chains all starts back at the wellhead. So as you've heard, we've incrementally grown processing capacity over the last few years to serve some of the best producer customers in the Permian Basin. And with Secretariat plant coming online, which I touched on earlier in the second half of 2025, we expect to have a total of 1.4 Bcf a day of natural gas processing capacity. While this is the first step in serving our customers and process the gas, the also very integral part of that is the ability to clear the resid gas and the NGLs out of the basin. That leads us into the second piece of that value chain, which is our investment in long-haul pipelines, which, of course, is the move of volumes out of the basin to the Gulf Coast markets. So for NGLs, as we touched on earlier, BANGL is the key strategic asset to do that. And in third quarter, we increased, as we touched on earlier, our stake in that. So we increased it 45%. And progress continues on the expansion of 250,000 barrels a day, which you expect to be in service in first quarter 2025, so not too far down the road. So with that, we're seeing strong volumes, and we're confident in the growth profile of that asset. So on the NGL side, we're feeling very well. And the nat gas side, our strategy is really anchored around our Whistler JV platform. So in addition to the Whistler main line, which has been in service for a while, last quarter, we announced the FID of Blackcomb, which is that additional 42-inch pipeline that will connect the Permian Basin to the Gulf Coast. The final stage is what you touched on in your comments of the wellhead-to-water strategy is really down at the water. And that's focused on connecting the volumes to our customers while creating optionality for our shippers. So on the nat gas side, some examples of that strategy that we've already put in service are the ADCC pipeline, which came in service in July of last year -- I'm sorry, this year, I apologize. And the Rio Grande (sic) [ Bravo ] pipeline, which we expect to be in service second half of 2026, and Maryann touched on that a little bit. And as we touched on earlier on the NGL side, as we look at our Texas City fracs, docks and terminals. We continue to evaluate those options to bring that last link of that value chain of the NGL. So hopefully, from both a nat gas and NGL perspective, you can see how over the recent past, we've been building out those strong value chains from the Permian Basin to the Gulf Coast and access to the water. So hopefully, that gives you additional color. Neel, yes, you touched on -- we spent a lot of time talking about our nat gas and NGL value chains, and we don't want to forget about our crude value chains. And we have a pretty sizable platform in the Permian for crude gathering and blending benefits up there. And so -- and as you've seen in the space, there's been a lot of activity in the recent past on the M&A side of the equation. So very similar, we touched on earlier, we continue to look at opportunities to grow out that platform very similar to how we've grown out the nat gas and NGL. Sometimes is buying out JV partners, very low risk, but because we know the assets very well. Sometimes it's maybe buying single bolt-on assets and sometimes it may be looking at maybe a little more sizable M&A opportunity. So a lot of activity in that space. We continue to look at them, and I appreciate you bringing that up because we don't want to forget about the third leg of our value chain is the crude side of the equation. So I appreciate that."

With that, I will turn the call over to Maryann.\nMaryann Mannen: Thanks, Kristina. Good morning and thank you for joining our call. I want to take a moment to recognize Mike Hennigan's leadership as CEO of MPLX for nearly five years. Mike's record of accomplishment in both the midstream and downstream industries has been a tremendous value to the partnership. During his tenure, we have delivered annual EBITDA and DCF growth of over $1 billion, positioning us with financial flexibility to execute our growth strategies and deliver on our commitment to return capital. We are fortunate to have Mike as our Executive Chairman of the MPLX board. In the second quarter, adjusted EBITDA grew 8% and distributable cash flow grew 7% year-over-year. The growth of MPLX's cash flow supported the return of $949 million to unitholders, reflecting our commitment to return to capital. Producer activity remains robust across the Marcellus, Utica and Permian basins. In the Northeast, longer laterals are resulting in higher volumes. Volume growth continues in both the Marcellus and Utica, where producers are targeting economically advantaged liquids rich acreage. The Permian basin has some of the lowest crude break evens in the country. Production growth in the region continues to create opportunities for our well head to water strategy across crude, Natural gas and NGLs. In the second quarter MPLX closed the Whistler Transaction. Last week, MPLX and its partners reach FID of the Blackcomb Natural gas pipeline, a 2.5 bcf pipeline connecting supply in the Permian to domestic and export markets along the Gulf Coast. This project offers a compelling value proposition while providing shippers with flexible market access. Blackcomb is expected to be in service in the second half of 2026. This is another step in leveraging this platform for growth. MPLX has also acquired additional interest in the BANGL NGL pipeline, bringing our ownership to 45% BANGL is a strategic asset within our NGL value chain. Progress continues on its expansion to 250,000 barrels per day which is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2025. We believe this transaction is immediately accretive and should generate a mid-teens return consistent with our capital deployment objectives. We are confident in the future growth potential of this value chain. We also acquired an additional interest in the Wink to Webster crude oil pipeline. These recent transactions are a continuation of our strategic approach to growing cash flows. Over the last three years, MPLX has led peers on return on invested capital. Distributions remain our primary method of return and we are a return on and a return of capital business. Now let me turn the call over to Kris to discuss our growth as well as operational and financial results for the quarter.\nKris Hagedorn: Thanks Maryann. MPLX is progressing its 2024 capital program with spending expected at $1.1 billion. Anchored in the Permian and Marcellus basins, our integrated footprint positions the partnership with opportunities to grow our natural gas and NGL assets. In the Permian, we are delivering growth through organic projects, investments in our Permian joint ventures and bolt on opportunities. In the L&S segment the ADCC natural gas pipeline was placed into service early in the third quarter. In the G&P segment, we are bringing new gas processing plants online to meet increasing customer demand. The Preakness II gas processing plant began operations in July and we are progressing the Secretariat processing plant, which is expected to be online in the second half of 2025. Once operational, our total processing capacity in the Delaware basin will be approximately 1.4 billion cubic feet per day. The remainder of our capital plan is mostly comprised of smaller higher return investments, targeted expansion or debottlenecking of existing assets and projects related to planned increases in producer activity. Slide five outlines the second quarter operational and financial performance highlights for logistics and storage segment. Segment adjusted EBITDA increased $107 million when compared to second quarter 2023, primarily driven by higher rates including growth from equity affiliates. Pipeline volumes were up year-over-year, primarily due to the effects of refinery maintenance in the prior year and growth projects contributing additional volumes in the current year. Moving to our Gathering & Processing segment highlights on slide six, the G&P segment adjusted EBITDA increased $15 million compared to second quarter 2023. The second quarter of 2023 included a $13 million gain on sale of assets. Taking this into account, G&P segment EBITDA increased 6% year-over-year. This is driven by increased volumes, including contributions from recent acquisitions, largely offset by higher operating expenses in the second quarter of 2024. Total gathered volumes were up 7% year-over-year, primarily due to increased drilling and production in the Marcellus and the addition of dry gas volumes from our recently acquired Utica assets. Processing volumes were up 7% year-over-year, primarily from higher volumes in the Marcellus and Utica as well as the Rockies. Southwest volumes declined as growth in the Permian was more than offset by lower volumes in Oklahoma due to recent reduced producer activity. In the Utica, processing volumes have increased 285 million cubic feet per day or 52% since the second quarter of 2023, highlighting the value producers are seeing in the liquids rich acreage. Volumes on the Harmon Creek II and Preakness II processing plants are increasing with an expected ramp profile of up to twelve months. Focusing on the Marcellus, by far our largest basin of GMP operations, we saw year-over-year volume increases of 15% for Gathering and 5% for Processing driven by increased drilling and production growth. Fractionation volumes grew 10% due to higher ethane recoveries and higher processed volumes. We are encouraged by strong in basin demand for ethane as well as the startup of the Mountain Valley pipeline. As the origin of MVP is connected to our mobile processing plant, its operations are positive for MPLX and its producer customers. We continue to monitor the development of data centers in the Northeast and Southwest. As demand increases for natural gas powered electricity, we will support the development plans of our producer customers. Moving to our second quarter financial highlights on slide seven, total adjusted EBITDA of $1.65 billion and distributable cash flow of $1.4 billion increased 8% and 7% respectively from the prior year. Similar to prior years in the second quarter, project related expenses were up approximately $30 million compared to the first quarter due to the seasonality of the spend. MPLX returned $949 million to unitholders through $874 million in distributions and $75 million in unit repurchases. During the second quarter, MPLX issued $1.65 billion in 10 [ph] year senior notes, the proceeds of which we expect to use to retire senior notes due in December 2024 and February 2025. MPLX ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.5 billion and leverage was 3.4 times. Net of cash leverage was 3.1 times. Now let me hand it back to Maryann for some final thoughts.\nMaryann Mannen: Thanks Kris. We have delivered over 7% DCF growth on a three year compound annual basis. We are executing our strategy and advancing growth opportunities across our value chains. In the Permian, we continue to see growth opportunities in our natural gas, NGL and crude value chains. In the Marcellus and Utica producer activity remains robust, supporting growth of our gathering and processing footprint. By advancing these high return growth projects, we expect to continue to grow our cash flow. MPLX is a strategic investment for MPC as they each pursue growth opportunities. The value of this strategic relationship is further enhanced. Based on the growth of our cash flows we have been able to increase our distribution by 10% in each of the last two years. Strong coverage, low leverage and growing cash flows provides MPLX financial flexibility, placing us in an excellent position to grow our distribution in the future. Now let me turn the call back over to Kristina.\nKristina Kazarian: Thanks Maryann. As we open the call for questions, we ask that you limit yourself to one question plus a follow up. We may re prompt for additional questions as time permits. With that, Sheila, we're ready for the questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from John Mackay with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJohn Mackay: Hey, thanks team. Good morning and congrats again Maryann. I wanted to start maybe high level on the strategic front, done [ph] a lot of bolt-ons over the last year. I was thinking if we put this in the context of a billion dollars of organic spend you do on average, how should we think about that level of inorganic spend going forward and how that fits into your general mid-single digit growth pace. Thanks.\nMaryann Mannen: Yes. Good morning John. Thanks. So, a couple of things as we think about our strategy going forward and as you shared here, about $1 billion annually in our capital programs. But for the last few years we've also been filling out underutilized capacity and investing in our JVs as well. We continue to see these as inorganic opportunities and organic opportunities for us to meet our goal of mid-single digit growth. If you look over the last year or so we've done transactions in the Permian with our Tor\u00f1ado transaction or Tor\u00f1ado. Excuse me, Utica the summit JV buyout are increased bangle ownership, expansion of the Whistler platform with Rio Bravo. So we continue to execute the growth strategy, reinvest in the business in what we think to be a capital efficient manner. We'll ensure that we are employing strict capital discipline, regardless of whether it's organic, inorganic, or focused on our JVs, with the full intent of being able to return capital to unitholders.\nJohn Mackay: All right, thanks for that. Maybe pivoting. You guys touched on this a little bit in the prepared remarks, but wondering if we can just go around the horn. Maybe you guys touch a bunch of different basins on the G&P side. Would love just to hear how volumes are trending, maybe versus your expectations earlier in the year. And if we look across the footprint more broadly in a maybe better gas macro in 2025, when you'd expect to see that more fulsome inflection start to pick up. Thanks.\nGreg Floerke: Good morning, John. This is Greg. If you look at the gas prices, low gas price, environment versus liquids, particularly crude and NGL, and that has led to some announced curtailments, particularly in the dry lean areas, northeast Marcellus in particular, and the Haynesville, the areas that we're in, we're really focused on processing in rich gas areas with some dry gas. But in the areas where dry and lean gas production is in our footprint, in the Utica, for example, producers tend to have takeaway commitments on the residue gas pipelines and also, in some cases, hedging strategies continue to drive production. So we're really in our footprint, not seeing that impact. What we are continuing to see is more rigs move from the dry gas areas into the rich gas and crude areas. And the crude production comes with associated gas. It's particularly rich in NGLs, so we really see high NGL content with that gas. And we're taking advantage in places like the Permian, as Kris mentioned, with growth and Maryann with Preakness II coming online, and also in the Marcellus super rich area, which is by far our largest, almost 6 bcf a day of processing there and we just added another plant. So we're seeing growth in those liquid rich areas, and that's great. But one area, it's not new because we built it out over ten years ago, but it has been overlooked a bit, is the Utica, and we're really excited about what's going on there now. Not only are we seeing existing customers move rigs over into the condensate rich gas, and even now the light oil window. And that is unique to the Utica beyond other areas with rich gas is that light oil window. So we're not only seeing existing customers move in there, but we're also seeing some new a handful of new producers move in and buy up acreage. So you have an untapped resource there, which is really a light crude oil resource. So it's unique to the northeast and it's really driving a lot of activity. And we're positioned with surplus prebuilt processing, gathering and fractionation capacity, both de-ethanization and C3+ fractionation capacity. So we're really excited about this opportunity to use that existing capacity. And overall, now we're seeing increasing rig counts in the Utica.\nJohn Mackay: I appreciate the details, Greg. Thanks, everyone.\nMaryann Mannen: Thanks, John.\nOperator: Thank you. Next we will hear from Manav Gupta with UBS. You may proceed.\nManav Gupta: Congrats, Maryann, on a very strong start on both MPLX and MPC side. My first question is, can we get a little more details on the Blackcomb pipeline? It looks like a very interesting project. So what are the benefits of it? How do you see this as developing? If you could give us some more details on this project.\nMaryann Mannen: Good morning, Manav. Thank you. Yes, happy to do that. I'll give Dave the opportunity to share some of the specifics around Blackcomb. But, as you know, our wellhead-to-water strategy continues to be an important piece of the long-term growth of MPLX. Over the last several quarters, we've been taking steps, the Whistler transaction gave us the access through the JV for the Rio Bravo pipeline. Blackcomb just announced FID. We think this is another important piece as it connects the Permian basin, Agua Dulce in South Texas. So again, hopefully, what we're demonstrating here is we are able to continue to put together key elements of this strategy that will allow us to continue this mid-single digit growth that we've done over the last few years and give us an outstanding platform for that wellhead-to-water strategy. I'm going to pass it to Dave and let him give you a little more color, specifically on Blackcomb.\nDave Heppner: Thanks, Maryann. When you think of Blackcomb and Maryann touched on it, I think the best way to think about Blackcomb, it's just the continued evolution of our nat gas wellhead-to-water strategy. And it's all foundationally built on the Whistler relationship. So you think of the whistler, the first of the pipes coming out of the basin. And as you can see, with the continued growth in the Permian, which we believe, along with everybody else, has got a lot of runway incremental capacity to come out of the basin was necessary, which is the Blackcomb. But Blackcomb is also just a foundation to get to the Gulf Coast. So whether you think the remaining links of those value chains, ADCC, which just came in service, the Rio Bravo pipeline, getting the LNG facilities. It's all part of our long-term strategy of that integrated value chain. And we're excited about Blackcomb because of not only the capacity and the value chain buildup, but the partners that we have in there. And so I think you'll continue to see those value chains grow as the basins continues, has capacity to export and, and the demand down in the Gulf Coast. So look forward to continue to give you updates.\nManav Gupta: Perfect. My quick follow up here is adjusted free cash flow after distribution was 574. So the cash is building. Anything you want to say on the uses of this cash as it continues to grow? And then I'll turn it over. Thank you.\nMaryann Mannen: Thanks, Manav. Yes, so one of the things that we think we've continued to build over the last several quarters is our financial flexibility. I talk about a return on and a return of capital business. As I mentioned, we increased our distribution 10% in the last two years, and that continues to be a primary source of our ability to return capital. Second, you've seen we did do share repurchase again this quarter. We believe this equity is undervalued and certainly another mechanism for the return of capital growth. As I, as we've been talking about here, putting that capital to work in these high return projects, particularly anchored in the Marcellus and the Permian, with the intent of growing those cash distributions in the future. And that's certainly another use there. So that financial flexibility, we think, is critically important to allow us to do that. I'm going to pass it to Kris and allow him to share a little bit more on some of the specifics of the cash balance.\nKris Hagedorn: Thanks, Maryann. Yes, Manav. What I would highlight to folks is at the end of the quarter, as you've seen, we have about $2.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet. So just reminding of that big number, we have maturities coming up in December of 2024 and February of 2025 that will pay off with that cash balance or some of that cash balance. As Maryann articulated, we are excited about the continued growth in our adjusted free cash flow after distributions. And as that cash builds, it is again returning it to our capital allocation framework of return of and return on capital.\nManav Gupta: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning. This is Roth [Indiscernible] on for Jeremy. I wanted to follow up on some of the previous comments and appreciate that that historical mid-single digit EBITDA growth is not future guidance, but given a number of the smaller accretive deals that MPLX has participated in. Could you frame up how we might think about future growth above that figure and just any potential there?\nMaryann Mannen: Certainly. Good morning. So, as you know, we've targeted and you've said that it is never necessarily been indicative of guidance. But if you look over the last three years, compound annual growth in our adjusted EBITDA, in excess of 6%, distributable cash flows, almost 8% in our quarterly distribution growth. So, it has certainly been our target. But if we are able to execute in similar fashion, I mentioned earlier some of the key transactions that we have worked on in the, in the last year or so, our goal obviously would be to continue to target that with the intent of seeing EBITDA growth. Beyond that, as we put our capital to work and execute some of these key projects that we've been sharing with you. So again, a goal which we think we've been able to achieve, but certainly opportunity that we see given the number of projects and again, our commitment to executing the growth strategy and ensuring that we return capital to unitholders in the manner in which we just shared.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. And then on that Permian to wellhead-to-water strategy, how do you think about, I guess, additional capital investment as you see it at this point where you might need to invest, whether that be upstream or downstream?\nMaryann Mannen: Yes. So there's a few areas, obviously, when we think about continuing to build that out that we are evaluating. And I'll let Dave give you a few thoughts there. But certainly over the next few years, given the strength of that basin and given the opportunities that we see in particular, getting that takeaway capacity and getting it to water, and then you look at the assets in particular, on the MPC side as well, we think there are opportunities for us to continue to effectively put capital to work.\nDave Heppner: Yes. Maybe I'll touch on two of the value chains, go back to nat gas. We think of the nat gas side. I kind of laid out that road map or the footprint. We think that what we're building out not only achieves our strategy of that wellhead-to-water, but also provides Permian shippers with optimal flexibility. So I think as you think about incremental capital investment, you can think about how we continue to ensure that flexibility for those potential shippers. When you think about the NGL value chain, especially with our BANGL expansion that we talked about and also our incremental ownership in BANGL, and we've talked about our Texas City frac project and the opportunities there. So I think when you think about capital and you think about how we evaluate that last leg of the value chain all the way from the Gathering, Processing, the BANGL long haul pipe into fractionation and the export terminal and tankage, we'll continue to evaluate that project through the lens of strict capital discipline and we'll evaluate versus other alternatives and options that are out there for us to achieve that strategy long-term. So those are just a couple of ways, I think as you look forward and we think about capital investments, whether it be at the NPLX level or down at the JV level, that we'll continue to build out those value chains.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thanks for the time.\nOperator: Next we will hear from Theresa Chen with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nTheresa Chen: Morning. First, wanted to also express congratulations to both Maryann and Mike. Following up on the Permian wellhead-to-water NGL strategy, would you be able to provide a little bit more detail on the economics related to your 20% incremental interest in BANGL? I'm not sure if you could share the purchase price and then also just the current progress on the Texas City frac. And as we think about that last piece to water, to Dave's earlier comments in terms of speech, market the timeline to bring online export infrastructure, assuming that it would be a Brownfield [ph] fill.\nMaryann Mannen: Good morning, Theresa, and thank you for your comment. So on BANGL, first look, we think that BANGL has been and continues to be a key strategic asset as we build out that NGL value chain. And again, longer term, we're really confident in the growth profile of BANGL and more importantly, our ability to compete effectively in that basin. The transaction gives us a total of 45% ownership and again, an important piece of the wellhead-to-water strategy. Also, that transaction we believe is immediately accretive and we expected to generate mid-teens return. We had a rofo on that transaction. As it relates to your question on Texas City, we're trying to ensure that we maintain optionality in our wellhead-to-water strategy there. We have evaluated other alternatives as well, continue to do so, and as we have any further conclusions around how we'll build that out, we'll continue to bring that to you as well.\nTheresa Chen: Got it. And then on Blackcomb, are you to share any economics related to the project, either build multiples or anticipated returns?\nMaryann Mannen: No, we've not shared any of the anticipated returns at this point. Early stages as we're continuing to put that together, but we've not at this point yet Theresa. Again, confident in the pipeline itself and in its critical contribution, really, to our strategy, but have not shared that at this point.\nTheresa Chen: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nKeith Stanley: Hi. Good morning. I wanted to follow up first on the 2.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet. So leverage is well below your 4 times target. EBITDA is growing nicely. You're generating a lot of excess free cash flow. So why use cash to repay, I think it's $1.6 billion six of maturing debt in December and February instead of refinancing. And at what point would you view a level of cash on the balance sheet as inefficient from a capital structure perspective?\nKris Hagedorn: No. Thank you, Keith, for the question. As we mentioned, we continually look to manage our liability towers. That's something that we do continually and try to make sure that we do that in an effective way. What I'd tell you about the 2.5, as you noted, cash is fungible, but indeed we do, as we've earmarked that, we have earmarked it for the December and the February notes. I will tell you as we sat at a net leverage ratio of 3.1. We do see, tremendous strength in our balance sheet. So we think that, you know, as we've communicated in the past, we, we have room up to 40 in our leverage. So as we evaluate our opportunities going forward, we've talked about the wellhead-to-water strategy for NGLs. We've talked about the expansion we're doing with Whistler. We'll continue to evaluate where our balance sheet sits and how we put that cash, potential cash to work.\nMaryann Mannen: Keith, it's Maryann. I just wanted to maybe follow up on a few of Kris's comments as well. One of the reasons why, as you appropriately state, that we've seen the improvement in our leverage, frankly, is because what we've seen is the growth in our EBITDA. So take your point that financial flexibility we think is important. We're not stepping away from our commitment, if you will, or our belief around the leverage target. That's an important piece of our financial flexibility going forward. So no change in that whatsoever.\nKeith Stanley: Thank you both for that. Second, just follow up question on the integrated NGL strategy and possibly moving into frac and exports. Some of your competitors have some chunky export capacity additions that they're working on. And then we've had the nighttime restrictions lifted, too. So how does that factor into your thinking on potentially entering the export business. It seems like your competitors are kind of building pretty aggressively there.\nDave Heppner: Yes, Keith, this is Dave. Let me kind of expand on that a little bit. So. Yes, you're exactly right. And I think the competitors that you're referencing, they're building out the export capacity is a signal, and we're aligned with it that we need more export capacity to be able to clear the volume to the international market. So it's a little bit back to Theresa's question, too, on timing. So as we're going through our strategy of finalizing the remaining links of that value chain from fractionation export facilities, I won't say time of us, in essence, but it's something that's top of our radar as we continue to evaluate that and other options to do it. So, very similar compared a little bit to the nat gas value chain strategy in the LNG facilities and the build out of the LNG to support the capacity of nat gas coming out of the Permian. It's a little bit of a chicken the egg. What part of the value chain do you build out first? And I think we've taken the approach of start with the GMP, move down the long haul pipes into the fracs and the docks versus going backwards. So I think it's a little bit of the market supports it and a little bit of how you want to build out your wellhead-to-water strategy. Hope that helps.\nKeith Stanley: Thank you very much.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Next we will hear from Michael Bloom with Wells Fargo. You may proceed.\nMichael Bloom: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to drill down on one of the comments and prepared remarks. Now that Mountain [ph] Valley pipeline has been in service for a little bit of time here, I'm curious if you're seeing any change in the producer behavior as a result around your system. And do you see this potentially providing any additional investment opportunities for you kind of upstream of the pipeline?\nGreg Floerke: This is Greg again. Michael. I think that if you look at current production out of the Northeast and the Marcellus Utica, it's like 34 billion cubic feet a day of the hundred billion total. And we're really excited about MVP and the incremental takeaway capacity that that will provide from the basin as it ramps towards, I believe, the stated nameplate of two Bcf. So it does make. It does make an incremental difference in terms of takeaway. And that's very much a positive, particularly as that ramps over the next few years. We already have 90%, a little over 90% utilization of our Marcellus plants, and so there's a little bit more room to grow. And we're focused on filling out that remaining piece up to 100 and also growing, as is the case with Harmon Creek II. So I think there's a lot of factors that go into how that capacity out of the basin is filled. One of the things I mentioned earlier was some of the dry lean gas production maybe being curtailed or dropped down. That opens up capacity out of the basin, too. So, in summary, any capacity helps anytime you look at a constrained basin. But there is room for us to grow and we're still very bullish on the Marcellus and now the Utica.\nMichael Bloom: Got it. Thanks for that. And then maybe just one other question on Blackcomb. I know you're not providing much, but maybe you could tell us, would you expect there to be project level debt financing for this project?\nGreg Floerke: Michael, thank you. We will continue to evaluate that, but with a project like this, project level financing usually makes sense.\nMichael Bloom: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Thank you. And our last question will come from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities.\nNeal Dingmann : Morning. Thanks for getting me. And my first question just on the Preakness II processing plant. Can you just remind me how quickly capacity will ramp there, the potential for further, maybe additional upsides?\nGreg Floerke: Yes, Neal, this. Greg, we expect, we continue to build out new capacity and we expect Secretariat, our next plant after Preakness II, to come into service in the second half of next year. So we try to pace these plants to where as we run out of capacity with one plant, we're sort of there with the next plant to move into. So hopefully that gives you some feel for the ramp timing of Preakness II.\nNeal Dingmann : It does love the upside there. And then my second question, maybe just broader on your Marcellus gathering volumes. After some earlier comments you made on the Utica, I'm just wondering, could you all talk about just, it looked like volumes continue to notably increase there? I think you all show that 15% year-over-year second quarter volumes. I'm just wondering, can we assume that volumes can continue to improve there as that play continues to expand as one of the upstream operators suggest?\nGreg Floerke: Yes, that's a great question. The Marcellus is one of the areas where we only gather, not even 50% of the gas that we actually process there. Other third parties gather the majority of the gas in the particular area where we're growing, which in this case is the Harmon Creek II plant that's come online and is ramping up. That happens to be an area where we're also gathering the production. So that's why you're seeing, that's actually rich gas production growth that you're seeing. So we expect that to, we'd expect that continue to grow along with the volume ramp up into Harmon Creek II.\nNeal Dingmann : Thanks much.\nKristina Kazarian: All right, Sheila, if we don't have any other further questions, thank you for joining us today. And thank you for your interest in MPLX. Should you have additional questions, or would you like clarifications on any of the topics discussed today? The investor relations team is available at any time to take your call. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Maryann Mannen",
            "content": "Thanks, Kristina. Good morning and thank you for joining our call. I want to take a moment to recognize Mike Hennigan's leadership as CEO of MPLX for nearly five years. Mike's record of accomplishment in both the midstream and downstream industries has been a tremendous value to the partnership. During his tenure, we have delivered annual EBITDA and DCF growth of over $1 billion, positioning us with financial flexibility to execute our growth strategies and deliver on our commitment to return capital. We are fortunate to have Mike as our Executive Chairman of the MPLX board. In the second quarter, adjusted EBITDA grew 8% and distributable cash flow grew 7% year-over-year. The growth of MPLX's cash flow supported the return of $949 million to unitholders, reflecting our commitment to return to capital. Producer activity remains robust across the Marcellus, Utica and Permian basins. In the Northeast, longer laterals are resulting in higher volumes. Volume growth continues in both the Marcellus and Utica, where producers are targeting economically advantaged liquids rich acreage. The Permian basin has some of the lowest crude break evens in the country. Production growth in the region continues to create opportunities for our well head to water strategy across crude, Natural gas and NGLs. In the second quarter MPLX closed the Whistler Transaction. Last week, MPLX and its partners reach FID of the Blackcomb Natural gas pipeline, a 2.5 bcf pipeline connecting supply in the Permian to domestic and export markets along the Gulf Coast. This project offers a compelling value proposition while providing shippers with flexible market access. Blackcomb is expected to be in service in the second half of 2026. This is another step in leveraging this platform for growth. MPLX has also acquired additional interest in the BANGL NGL pipeline, bringing our ownership to 45% BANGL is a strategic asset within our NGL value chain. Progress continues on its expansion to 250,000 barrels per day which is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2025. We believe this transaction is immediately accretive and should generate a mid-teens return consistent with our capital deployment objectives. We are confident in the future growth potential of this value chain. We also acquired an additional interest in the Wink to Webster crude oil pipeline. These recent transactions are a continuation of our strategic approach to growing cash flows. Over the last three years, MPLX has led peers on return on invested capital. Distributions remain our primary method of return and we are a return on and a return of capital business. Now let me turn the call over to Kris to discuss our growth as well as operational and financial results for the quarter. Thanks Kris. We have delivered over 7% DCF growth on a three year compound annual basis. We are executing our strategy and advancing growth opportunities across our value chains. In the Permian, we continue to see growth opportunities in our natural gas, NGL and crude value chains. In the Marcellus and Utica producer activity remains robust, supporting growth of our gathering and processing footprint. By advancing these high return growth projects, we expect to continue to grow our cash flow. MPLX is a strategic investment for MPC as they each pursue growth opportunities. The value of this strategic relationship is further enhanced. Based on the growth of our cash flows we have been able to increase our distribution by 10% in each of the last two years. Strong coverage, low leverage and growing cash flows provides MPLX financial flexibility, placing us in an excellent position to grow our distribution in the future. Now let me turn the call back over to Kristina. Yes. Good morning John. Thanks. So, a couple of things as we think about our strategy going forward and as you shared here, about $1 billion annually in our capital programs. But for the last few years we've also been filling out underutilized capacity and investing in our JVs as well. We continue to see these as inorganic opportunities and organic opportunities for us to meet our goal of mid-single digit growth. If you look over the last year or so we've done transactions in the Permian with our Torn\u0303ado transaction or Torn\u0303ado. Excuse me, Utica the summit JV buyout are increased bangle ownership, expansion of the Whistler platform with Rio Bravo. So we continue to execute the growth strategy, reinvest in the business in what we think to be a capital efficient manner. We'll ensure that we are employing strict capital discipline, regardless of whether it's organic, inorganic, or focused on our JVs, with the full intent of being able to return capital to unitholders. Thanks, John. Good morning, Manav. Thank you. Yes, happy to do that. I'll give Dave the opportunity to share some of the specifics around Blackcomb. But, as you know, our wellhead-to-water strategy continues to be an important piece of the long-term growth of MPLX. Over the last several quarters, we've been taking steps, the Whistler transaction gave us the access through the JV for the Rio Bravo pipeline. Blackcomb just announced FID. We think this is another important piece as it connects the Permian basin, Agua Dulce in South Texas. So again, hopefully, what we're demonstrating here is we are able to continue to put together key elements of this strategy that will allow us to continue this mid-single digit growth that we've done over the last few years and give us an outstanding platform for that wellhead-to-water strategy. I'm going to pass it to Dave and let him give you a little more color, specifically on Blackcomb. Thanks, Manav. Yes, so one of the things that we think we've continued to build over the last several quarters is our financial flexibility. I talk about a return on and a return of capital business. As I mentioned, we increased our distribution 10% in the last two years, and that continues to be a primary source of our ability to return capital. Second, you've seen we did do share repurchase again this quarter. We believe this equity is undervalued and certainly another mechanism for the return of capital growth. As I, as we've been talking about here, putting that capital to work in these high return projects, particularly anchored in the Marcellus and the Permian, with the intent of growing those cash distributions in the future. And that's certainly another use there. So that financial flexibility, we think, is critically important to allow us to do that. I'm going to pass it to Kris and allow him to share a little bit more on some of the specifics of the cash balance. Certainly. Good morning. So, as you know, we've targeted and you've said that it is never necessarily been indicative of guidance. But if you look over the last three years, compound annual growth in our adjusted EBITDA, in excess of 6%, distributable cash flows, almost 8% in our quarterly distribution growth. So, it has certainly been our target. But if we are able to execute in similar fashion, I mentioned earlier some of the key transactions that we have worked on in the, in the last year or so, our goal obviously would be to continue to target that with the intent of seeing EBITDA growth. Beyond that, as we put our capital to work and execute some of these key projects that we've been sharing with you. So again, a goal which we think we've been able to achieve, but certainly opportunity that we see given the number of projects and again, our commitment to executing the growth strategy and ensuring that we return capital to unitholders in the manner in which we just shared. Yes. So there's a few areas, obviously, when we think about continuing to build that out that we are evaluating. And I'll let Dave give you a few thoughts there. But certainly over the next few years, given the strength of that basin and given the opportunities that we see in particular, getting that takeaway capacity and getting it to water, and then you look at the assets in particular, on the MPC side as well, we think there are opportunities for us to continue to effectively put capital to work. Good morning, Theresa, and thank you for your comment. So on BANGL, first look, we think that BANGL has been and continues to be a key strategic asset as we build out that NGL value chain. And again, longer term, we're really confident in the growth profile of BANGL and more importantly, our ability to compete effectively in that basin. The transaction gives us a total of 45% ownership and again, an important piece of the wellhead-to-water strategy. Also, that transaction we believe is immediately accretive and we expected to generate mid-teens return. We had a rofo on that transaction. As it relates to your question on Texas City, we're trying to ensure that we maintain optionality in our wellhead-to-water strategy there. We have evaluated other alternatives as well, continue to do so, and as we have any further conclusions around how we'll build that out, we'll continue to bring that to you as well. No, we've not shared any of the anticipated returns at this point. Early stages as we're continuing to put that together, but we've not at this point yet Theresa. Again, confident in the pipeline itself and in its critical contribution, really, to our strategy, but have not shared that at this point. Keith, it's Maryann. I just wanted to maybe follow up on a few of Kris's comments as well. One of the reasons why, as you appropriately state, that we've seen the improvement in our leverage, frankly, is because what we've seen is the growth in our EBITDA. So take your point that financial flexibility we think is important. We're not stepping away from our commitment, if you will, or our belief around the leverage target. That's an important piece of our financial flexibility going forward. So no change in that whatsoever."

            "content": "Thanks Maryann. MPLX is progressing its 2024 capital program with spending expected at $1.1 billion. Anchored in the Permian and Marcellus basins, our integrated footprint positions the partnership with opportunities to grow our natural gas and NGL assets. In the Permian, we are delivering growth through organic projects, investments in our Permian joint ventures and bolt on opportunities. In the L&S segment the ADCC natural gas pipeline was placed into service early in the third quarter. In the G&P segment, we are bringing new gas processing plants online to meet increasing customer demand. The Preakness II gas processing plant began operations in July and we are progressing the Secretariat processing plant, which is expected to be online in the second half of 2025. Once operational, our total processing capacity in the Delaware basin will be approximately 1.4 billion cubic feet per day. The remainder of our capital plan is mostly comprised of smaller higher return investments, targeted expansion or debottlenecking of existing assets and projects related to planned increases in producer activity. Slide five outlines the second quarter operational and financial performance highlights for logistics and storage segment. Segment adjusted EBITDA increased $107 million when compared to second quarter 2023, primarily driven by higher rates including growth from equity affiliates. Pipeline volumes were up year-over-year, primarily due to the effects of refinery maintenance in the prior year and growth projects contributing additional volumes in the current year. Moving to our Gathering & Processing segment highlights on slide six, the G&P segment adjusted EBITDA increased $15 million compared to second quarter 2023. The second quarter of 2023 included a $13 million gain on sale of assets. Taking this into account, G&P segment EBITDA increased 6% year-over-year. This is driven by increased volumes, including contributions from recent acquisitions, largely offset by higher operating expenses in the second quarter of 2024. Total gathered volumes were up 7% year-over-year, primarily due to increased drilling and production in the Marcellus and the addition of dry gas volumes from our recently acquired Utica assets. Processing volumes were up 7% year-over-year, primarily from higher volumes in the Marcellus and Utica as well as the Rockies. Southwest volumes declined as growth in the Permian was more than offset by lower volumes in Oklahoma due to recent reduced producer activity. In the Utica, processing volumes have increased 285 million cubic feet per day or 52% since the second quarter of 2023, highlighting the value producers are seeing in the liquids rich acreage. Volumes on the Harmon Creek II and Preakness II processing plants are increasing with an expected ramp profile of up to twelve months. Focusing on the Marcellus, by far our largest basin of GMP operations, we saw year-over-year volume increases of 15% for Gathering and 5% for Processing driven by increased drilling and production growth. Fractionation volumes grew 10% due to higher ethane recoveries and higher processed volumes. We are encouraged by strong in basin demand for ethane as well as the startup of the Mountain Valley pipeline. As the origin of MVP is connected to our mobile processing plant, its operations are positive for MPLX and its producer customers. We continue to monitor the development of data centers in the Northeast and Southwest. As demand increases for natural gas powered electricity, we will support the development plans of our producer customers. Moving to our second quarter financial highlights on slide seven, total adjusted EBITDA of $1.65 billion and distributable cash flow of $1.4 billion increased 8% and 7% respectively from the prior year. Similar to prior years in the second quarter, project related expenses were up approximately $30 million compared to the first quarter due to the seasonality of the spend. MPLX returned $949 million to unitholders through $874 million in distributions and $75 million in unit repurchases. During the second quarter, MPLX issued $1.65 billion in 10 [ph] year senior notes, the proceeds of which we expect to use to retire senior notes due in December 2024 and February 2025. MPLX ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.5 billion and leverage was 3.4 times. Net of cash leverage was 3.1 times. Now let me hand it back to Maryann for some final thoughts. Thanks, Maryann. Yes, Manav. What I would highlight to folks is at the end of the quarter, as you've seen, we have about $2.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet. So just reminding of that big number, we have maturities coming up in December of 2024 and February of 2025 that will pay off with that cash balance or some of that cash balance. As Maryann articulated, we are excited about the continued growth in our adjusted free cash flow after distributions. And as that cash builds, it is again returning it to our capital allocation framework of return of and return on capital. No. Thank you, Keith, for the question. As we mentioned, we continually look to manage our liability towers. That's something that we do continually and try to make sure that we do that in an effective way. What I'd tell you about the 2.5, as you noted, cash is fungible, but indeed we do, as we've earmarked that, we have earmarked it for the December and the February notes. I will tell you as we sat at a net leverage ratio of 3.1. We do see, tremendous strength in our balance sheet. So we think that, you know, as we've communicated in the past, we, we have room up to 40 in our leverage. So as we evaluate our opportunities going forward, we've talked about the wellhead-to-water strategy for NGLs. We've talked about the expansion we're doing with Whistler. We'll continue to evaluate where our balance sheet sits and how we put that cash, potential cash to work."

            "name": "Greg Floerke",
            "content": "Good morning, John. This is Greg. If you look at the gas prices, low gas price, environment versus liquids, particularly crude and NGL, and that has led to some announced curtailments, particularly in the dry lean areas, northeast Marcellus in particular, and the Haynesville, the areas that we're in, we're really focused on processing in rich gas areas with some dry gas. But in the areas where dry and lean gas production is in our footprint, in the Utica, for example, producers tend to have takeaway commitments on the residue gas pipelines and also, in some cases, hedging strategies continue to drive production. So we're really in our footprint, not seeing that impact. What we are continuing to see is more rigs move from the dry gas areas into the rich gas and crude areas. And the crude production comes with associated gas. It's particularly rich in NGLs, so we really see high NGL content with that gas. And we're taking advantage in places like the Permian, as Kris mentioned, with growth and Maryann with Preakness II coming online, and also in the Marcellus super rich area, which is by far our largest, almost 6 bcf a day of processing there and we just added another plant. So we're seeing growth in those liquid rich areas, and that's great. But one area, it's not new because we built it out over ten years ago, but it has been overlooked a bit, is the Utica, and we're really excited about what's going on there now. Not only are we seeing existing customers move rigs over into the condensate rich gas, and even now the light oil window. And that is unique to the Utica beyond other areas with rich gas is that light oil window. So we're not only seeing existing customers move in there, but we're also seeing some new a handful of new producers move in and buy up acreage. So you have an untapped resource there, which is really a light crude oil resource. So it's unique to the northeast and it's really driving a lot of activity. And we're positioned with surplus prebuilt processing, gathering and fractionation capacity, both de-ethanization and C3+ fractionation capacity. So we're really excited about this opportunity to use that existing capacity. And overall, now we're seeing increasing rig counts in the Utica. This is Greg again. Michael. I think that if you look at current production out of the Northeast and the Marcellus Utica, it's like 34 billion cubic feet a day of the hundred billion total. And we're really excited about MVP and the incremental takeaway capacity that that will provide from the basin as it ramps towards, I believe, the stated nameplate of two Bcf. So it does make. It does make an incremental difference in terms of takeaway. And that's very much a positive, particularly as that ramps over the next few years. We already have 90%, a little over 90% utilization of our Marcellus plants, and so there's a little bit more room to grow. And we're focused on filling out that remaining piece up to 100 and also growing, as is the case with Harmon Creek II. So I think there's a lot of factors that go into how that capacity out of the basin is filled. One of the things I mentioned earlier was some of the dry lean gas production maybe being curtailed or dropped down. That opens up capacity out of the basin, too. So, in summary, any capacity helps anytime you look at a constrained basin. But there is room for us to grow and we're still very bullish on the Marcellus and now the Utica. Michael, thank you. We will continue to evaluate that, but with a project like this, project level financing usually makes sense. Yes, Neal, this. Greg, we expect, we continue to build out new capacity and we expect Secretariat, our next plant after Preakness II, to come into service in the second half of next year. So we try to pace these plants to where as we run out of capacity with one plant, we're sort of there with the next plant to move into. So hopefully that gives you some feel for the ramp timing of Preakness II. Yes, that's a great question. The Marcellus is one of the areas where we only gather, not even 50% of the gas that we actually process there. Other third parties gather the majority of the gas in the particular area where we're growing, which in this case is the Harmon Creek II plant that's come online and is ramping up. That happens to be an area where we're also gathering the production. So that's why you're seeing, that's actually rich gas production growth that you're seeing. So we expect that to, we'd expect that continue to grow along with the volume ramp up into Harmon Creek II."

            "name": "Dave Heppner",
            "content": "Thanks, Maryann. When you think of Blackcomb and Maryann touched on it, I think the best way to think about Blackcomb, it's just the continued evolution of our nat gas wellhead-to-water strategy. And it's all foundationally built on the Whistler relationship. So you think of the whistler, the first of the pipes coming out of the basin. And as you can see, with the continued growth in the Permian, which we believe, along with everybody else, has got a lot of runway incremental capacity to come out of the basin was necessary, which is the Blackcomb. But Blackcomb is also just a foundation to get to the Gulf Coast. So whether you think the remaining links of those value chains, ADCC, which just came in service, the Rio Bravo pipeline, getting the LNG facilities. It's all part of our long-term strategy of that integrated value chain. And we're excited about Blackcomb because of not only the capacity and the value chain buildup, but the partners that we have in there. And so I think you'll continue to see those value chains grow as the basins continues, has capacity to export and, and the demand down in the Gulf Coast. So look forward to continue to give you updates. Yes. Maybe I'll touch on two of the value chains, go back to nat gas. We think of the nat gas side. I kind of laid out that road map or the footprint. We think that what we're building out not only achieves our strategy of that wellhead-to-water, but also provides Permian shippers with optimal flexibility. So I think as you think about incremental capital investment, you can think about how we continue to ensure that flexibility for those potential shippers. When you think about the NGL value chain, especially with our BANGL expansion that we talked about and also our incremental ownership in BANGL, and we've talked about our Texas City frac project and the opportunities there. So I think when you think about capital and you think about how we evaluate that last leg of the value chain all the way from the Gathering, Processing, the BANGL long haul pipe into fractionation and the export terminal and tankage, we'll continue to evaluate that project through the lens of strict capital discipline and we'll evaluate versus other alternatives and options that are out there for us to achieve that strategy long-term. So those are just a couple of ways, I think as you look forward and we think about capital investments, whether it be at the NPLX level or down at the JV level, that we'll continue to build out those value chains. Yes, Keith, this is Dave. Let me kind of expand on that a little bit. So. Yes, you're exactly right. And I think the competitors that you're referencing, they're building out the export capacity is a signal, and we're aligned with it that we need more export capacity to be able to clear the volume to the international market. So it's a little bit back to Theresa's question, too, on timing. So as we're going through our strategy of finalizing the remaining links of that value chain from fractionation export facilities, I won't say time of us, in essence, but it's something that's top of our radar as we continue to evaluate that and other options to do it. So, very similar compared a little bit to the nat gas value chain strategy in the LNG facilities and the build out of the LNG to support the capacity of nat gas coming out of the Permian. It's a little bit of a chicken the egg. What part of the value chain do you build out first? And I think we've taken the approach of start with the GMP, move down the long haul pipes into the fracs and the docks versus going backwards. So I think it's a little bit of the market supports it and a little bit of how you want to build out your wellhead-to-water strategy. Hope that helps."

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin. \nKristina Kazarian: Good morning, and welcome to the MPLX First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at mplx.com under the Investor tab. Joining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan, Chairman and CEO; Kris Hagedorn, CFO; and other members of the executive team. We invite you to read the safe harbor statements and non-GAAP disclaimer on Slide 2. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the call and during the question-and-answer session that follows. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike. \nMichael Hennigan: Thanks, Kristina. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. Earlier today, we reported first quarter results. Our business continues to grow and delivered adjusted EBITDA of $1.6 billion and distributable cash flow of $1.4 billion, each an 8% increase year-over-year. In line with our commitment to return capital, the growth of MPLX's cash flow supported the return of $951 million to unitholders. Turning to the macro, the United States continues to be a low cost producer of energy fuels needed across the globe. Oil demand is at a record high globally. We expect oil demand to continue to set records into the foreseeable future. Forecasted outlooks for this year estimate 1.2 million to 2 million barrels per day of incremental demand over 2023, primarily driven by the growing need for transportation fuels. Our expectations on the long-term production outlook in our key basins remains unchanged. In the Northeast, longer laterals are resulting in higher volumes, highlighting the strength and opportunities we see across our footprint. We continue to expect volume growth in the Marcellus as well as the Utica, where producers are targeting economically advantaged liquids-rich acreage. In the Permian basin, crude prices remain attractive and associated gas production continues to grow as producers execute drilling and completion activities. In the first quarter, MPLX announced two strategic transactions. First, in the Utica, we enhanced our footprint through the acquisition of additional ownership interest in an existing joint venture and a dry gas gathering system. We have already seen growth in the rich gas window of the Utica and we see new producers moving into the region. Second, MPLX entered into a definitive agreement to combine the Whistler Pipeline and the Rio Bravo Pipeline project into a newly formed joint venture. The transaction expands MPLX's natural gas value chain, connects Permian supply to additional Gulf Coast demand, and positions MPLX for future growth opportunities. The transaction, subject to required regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, is expected to close in the second quarter. We remain committed to growing the partnership through our lens of strict capital discipline. In fact, over the last 3 years, MPLX holds a peer leading return on invested capital. The previously mentioned strategic transactions are a continuation of our approach as we seek to grow the cash flows of the partnership. We believe this is a return on and a return of capital business, and we'll continue to use our capital allocation framework to evaluate and optimize capital allocation decisions. We're confident in our ability to grow the partnership and are focused on executing the strategic priorities of strict capital discipline, fostering a low cost culture, and optimizing our asset portfolio, all of which are foundational to the growth of MPLX's cash flows. Now let me turn the call over to Kris to discuss our growth as well as our operational and financial results of the quarter. \nCarl Hagedorn: Thanks, Mike. MPLX's 2024 capital expenditure outlook of $1.1 billion is unchanged and includes $950 million of growth capital and $150 million of maintenance capital. Our 2024 growth capital outlook is anchored in the Marcellus and Permian basins. Our integrated footprint in these basins have positioned the partnership with a steady source of opportunities to expand, particularly around our natural gas and NGL asset. We continue growing these operations through organic projects, investments in our Permian joint ventures and bolt-on opportunities. In the L&S segment, progress continues on the Agua Dulce to Corpus Christi natural gas pipeline joint venture, which is expected to be in service in the third quarter of 2024. We're also progressing the expansion of the BANGL NGL pipeline joint venture to 200,000 barrels per day, which is expected to be completed in the first half of 2025. In the G&P segment, we're bringing new gas processing plants online to meet increasing customer demand. The Harmon Creek II gas processing plant was placed into service in late February, bringing our Marcellus processing capacity to 6.5 billion cubic feet per day. In the Permian basin, Preakness II is approaching startup and is expected to be online in May. Additionally, we are progressing the Secretariat processing plant, which is expected to be online in the second half of 2025. Once operational, our total processing capacity in the Delaware basin will be approximately 1.4 billion cubic feet per day. Outside of these strategic basins, the remainder of our capital plan is mostly comprised of smaller higher return investments, targeted expansion or start up of existing assets and projects related to planned increases and producer customer activity. Slide 6 outlines the first quarter operational and financial performance highlights for our logistics and storage segment. Adjusted EBITDA increased $72 million when compared to the first quarter of 2023, primarily driven by higher rates and growth from our equity affiliates. Crude and product pipelines and terminal volumes were down year-over-year, primarily due to start up planned turnaround activity in the first quarter of 2024. Due to the structure of our contracts with MPC, refinery volume changes had limited impact -- financial impact to MPLX. Moving to our Gathering and Processing segment on Slide 7. The G&P segment adjusted EBITDA increased $44 million compared to the first quarter of 2023, primarily driven by higher volumes. Total gathered volumes were down 2% year-over-year, primarily due to decreased dry gas production in the Utica and scheduled maintenance activities in the Southwest. Processing volumes were up 9% year-over-year, primarily from higher volumes in the Marcellus and Utica, driven by increased customer production. Focusing in on the Marcellus, by far our largest basin of G&P operations, we saw year-over-year volume increases of 10% for gathering and 7% for processing, driven by increased drilling and production growth. Marcellus processing utilization was 92% in the first quarter, reflecting the need for our Harmon Creek II processing plant, which was placed in service in late February. Fractionation volumes grew 4% due to higher ethane recoveries and higher processed volumes. Moving to our first quarter financial highlights on Slide 8. Total adjusted EBITDA of $1.6 billion and distributable cash flow of $1.4 billion, each increased 8% from prior year. During the quarter, MPLX acquired additional ownership interest in existing joint ventures and a dry gas gathering system located in Utica for $625 million and contributed $92 million for the repayment of our share of the Bakken pipeline JV debt due in April. MPLX also returned $951 million to unitholders through $876 million in distributions and $75 million in unit repurchases, ending the quarter with a cash balance of $385 million. As a reminder, the first quarter is typically our lowest quarter for project-related expenses. Like prior years, we anticipate these expenses will increase $30 million to $40 million sequentially in the second quarter, reflecting more favorable weather to undertake project-related work. Now let me hand it back to Mike for some final thoughts. \nMichael Hennigan: Thanks, Kris. In closing, MPLX has a strong history of growing the partnership's cash flows by executing its strategic priorities, all while maintaining strict capital discipline. We continue to aim for mid-single-digit growth rate over multiple year periods. And as you can see in our results, we have a strong start again to this year with adjusted EBITDA and DCF up 8% versus the first quarter of 2023. By deploying capital wisely, controlling our costs, and optimizing operations to get the most out of our assets, we've grown DCF by nearly 8% on a 3-year compound annual basis. MPLX is a strategic investment for MPC and as they each pursue growth opportunities, the value of this strategic relationship will be enhanced. By advancing our high return growth projects anchored in the Marcellus and Permian basins, along with our focus on cost and portfolio optimization, we intend to grow our cash flows, allowing us to reinvest in the business and continue to return capital to unitholders. In each of the last 2 years, we've increased our quarterly distribution 10%. The business is expected to continue to generate significant annual free cash flow after distribution, placing us in a strong position to continue to consistently grow our distribution. Now let me turn the call back over to Kristina. \nKristina Kazarian: Thanks, Mike. As we open the call for questions, we ask that you limit yourself to one question plus a follow up. We may re-prompt for additional questions as time permits. With that, operator, we're ready. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Mackay with Goldman Sachs. \nJohn Mackay: I wanted to start on the buyback. I think it was the first since '22. Maybe spend a minute or 2 just elaborating on whether or not this is a one-off or maybe a restart of a more normal cadence. And then also how you're thinking about balancing this with potential distribution increases in the future? \nMichael Hennigan: John, thanks for that question. Let me start because we get that question often. I'll try and be as clear as I can. First off, it starts with generating cash. I mean, you've heard in our prepared remarks that our 3-year CAGR is about 8%, and our first quarter results on DCF and EBITDA were about 8%. So it starts with generating cash. And then the uniqueness to that cash is we kind of color code the cash into 2 buckets. Those buckets that's continuing, we think is going to be there through all types of markets, and I've called that blue bar cash flows. The cash flows that are there, intermittent, that could be there sometimes, not sometimes, I call red bar cash flows. So, understanding the type of cash flows that we generated is really important to go into our capital allocation framework. And the way I think about the red bar, red bar may not be there all the time, but it is a source of equity. Blue bar, I think of it as an ongoing cash flow that's going to support our distribution growth. And we've said a bunch of times that our preferred method of returning capital is primarily distribution growth because we primarily drive blue bar cash flows in our system. But having the flexibility with red bar for buybacks is also important to us. So when we put that all together, the way we think of our capital allocation framework is: number one, we're going to take care of our assets; number two is we're going to continue to grow our distribution, and that's driven by those blue bar cash flows; number three is we're going to look to invest and continue to grow earnings. And hopefully, you've seen our track record on capital discipline and what it's done to earnings. We're very proud of growing this size partnership at about 8% per year over the last 3 years, and it continued into the first quarter. And then the last piece is our buyback. And although it's fourth in the capital allocation framework, it's still a tool that we have at our disposal, and we continue to think about when that makes the most sense versus when it doesn't. So if you think -- if you step all the way back, we color code the cash flows, we prioritize blue, that's the way we run our business, stable, continuing cash flows that will be there all the time. Those are more targeted towards distributions. You've heard us say we've done 10% distribution increases the last two years, you've heard us say we believe we have strong financial capabilities to continue to grow our distributions, but we also have the tool of buybacks when we think it makes sense. I hope that was helpful. \nJohn Mackay: Mike, I appreciate that. Maybe on just following up on the wanting to continue to invest to grow, we've obviously seeing you guys lean a little bit more towards the kind of bolt-on deals recently with the 3 announced so far this year. Can you maybe just spend a minute there on general strategy and then maybe how you think about those competing with organic opportunities? And maybe how much capital you're willing to allocate in that direction? \nMichael Hennigan: Yes. Thanks, John. It's another good question. Let me start off and then I'll let Greg talk about this recent activity. So, in general, over the last couple of years, you've seen us mainly driving organic growth. That's where we see good return projects. Again, I always say they're not sexy, they're not big headline projects, but they're good return projects. And we've been executing those well, and that's driven growth. But we're also constantly looking at M&A or organic -- inorganic activities. And during this quarter, we were able to make a strategic transaction in the Utica. And I'll let Greg talk a little bit about the details. \nGregory Floerke: Thanks, Mike. The Utica is interesting. We're really excited about what's going on there right now. We've had -- we've seen a lot of success over the last few years in the dry/lean part of the basin near the Ohio River and build out a substantial dry gas gathering system. But the rich gas area has not got as much attention, and that now is -- it's got a lot of great tailwinds behind it. We're really excited about it. The main things in the favor of the rich gas are the fact that there's a light oil window and a condensate window, the fact that right now we have a frac spread that favors liquids, whether in the crude oil producing regions or in the NGL heavy regions like we have in the Utica. We also have new drilling technology with long laterals, twice the length of laterals that we probably saw back in the day when the Utica was first developed. So you get essentially 2 or more wells in terms of lateral length for a proportionately less cost. We also have -- because of the early build out, we have existing infrastructure. It's fully integrated with our Marcellus system. It's connected to the same fractionation, all the same takeaway pipeline. So bottom line is, we're bullish about having a system with spare capacity in an area that now new producers are moving into and existing producers are moving their rigs to. So we're already seeing that growth. The Summit acquisition allowed us to further buy into this area where we're really bullish about. And we already -- we built the entire system and operated already, so we know it and we know the producers and the opportunities there. \nOperator: Next, we will hear from Manav Gupta with UBS. \nManav Gupta: Mike, my only question here relates to that this Whistler Pipeline thing you just recently got involved with the JV looks very interesting, looks like a very good growth opportunity. Help us understand this project a little more in detail and why would this be a strategic fit for MPLX? \nMichael Hennigan: Yes. Thanks, Manav. I appreciate that question. I'm going to let Dave give you a little more detail on it. I would tell you in general, though, as we've been saying, we're concentrating a lot of our activity in our key basins. And Greg just mentioned a lot of what's going up in the Northeast. And I'll let Dave talk a little bit about what's going on down in the Permian. \nDavid Heppner: Manav, so let me dig a little deeper. So, as Mike stated, the Permian is, in addition to our other basins, one of our key focus basins. And this JV partnership, which is with MPLX along with WhiteWater and I Squared, as part of the existing Whistler JV, entered in that definitive agreement with Enbridge to strategically combine that JV with the Rio Bravo Pipeline project into this newly formed JV. So that's step #1. And the justification for that, while we monetize a small portion of our equity ownership in Whistler at a low double-digit multiple, the real key, it enabled us to build out -- continue to build out our wellhead-to-water growth strategy and enhancing our value chain from the Permian to the U.S. Gulf Coast. So think of it this way, that the Rio Bravo Pipeline project provides Whistler with that value chain connectivity to the Rio Grande LNG export of facility in Brownsville, Texas, which is not a lot different to the strategy around the ADCC Pipeline project that is under construction right now at the Cheniere's LNG facility in Corpus Christi. So it's that last mile connectivity to the LNG pull. So, as we look forward, both from our Permian supply that Mike touched on earlier and the U.S. Gulf Coast LNG demand, which we all anticipate to grow, this strategic partnership provides a strong platform and positions Whistler under the new JV to participate in this growth and the development of incremental pipeline projects which again, of course, will further enhance NPL's wellhead-to-water strategy. Let me be clear with that, that any potential projects that we look at going forward must provide two things, acceptable financial returns and the right commercial terms through our lens of strict capital discipline as we look at all projects, whether it be bolt-on, organic or these growth projects. So, hopefully, that gives you a little more color. \nMichael Hennigan: And Manav, since Dave gave you a little bit of detail on that project, why don't you talk a little bit about NGLs as well since we're talking about natural gas and what we're doing in the Permian. \nDavid Heppner: Sure thing, Mike. So very similar nat gas. We've been pretty public about our plans to expand our value chains in the NGL platform. And again, it's all about strengthening our competitive position through Ford integration. So think of it, from wellhead to the consumers. So back on the wellhead, Greg and his team with all our gas processing plants, we got our BANGL pipeline expansion project going. And so whether we extend these value chains independently or with partners, extended the water and have an export optionality as part of that strategy. At this time, we don't have any major updates to provide on the Texas City NGL frac and storage projects, but that is a project we continued to -- continue to evaluate. So if you recall on that project back in December of last year, we submitted our air permit application to the TCEQ for the NGL Frac and storage facility in Texas City, Texas. I want to be clear that filing these permits is one of the many steps we take in evaluation of the potential projects, and we'll continue to evaluate any commercial framework around those. Again, very similar to our nat gas strategy, acceptable returns, the right commercial terms through the lens of strict capital test will help us determine if we go that alone or do with business partners going forward. So hopefully that gives you a little more color on our NGL strategy, which I would say very similar to our nat gas strategy is through -- for MPLX is wellhead-to-water, participate in the whole value chain, both from equity and from commercial optionality. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with J.P. Morgan. \nJeremy Tonet: I want to come back to the banks of the river, if I could, and just how MPLX seems to have achieved mid-single-digit EBITDA growth historically. And it seems like the prospects are there for continued growth. And if I think about the Summit acquisition kind of these bolt-on acquisitions, I think of it as kind of one of the components of staying in that range, and it would be larger acquisitions that would drive you above the range. And is that a fair way of thinking about things here? And how do you think about, I guess, other -- the potential acquisition environment out there? \nMichael Hennigan: Jeremy, that's a good question. First off, let me correct you. The M&A activity that we do, even if it's on the smaller side, is not included or would be additive to our goal of driving for mid-single-digit growth. So we think of the mid-single-digit growth as our organic program in general. And then when these other opportunities come up through inorganic opportunities like we just talked about, that would be additive. So our base is always things that we can control, trying to compete for growth, Harmon Creek II, Preakness II, Secretariat. You just heard Dave talk about our natural gas pipeline strategy down in the Permian and NGL growth. All those things come into our base feeling about growing the partnership, at least mid-single-digit cash flows. When we do something like the acquisition of the JV partner in Utica that Greg talked about, we think of that as additive to our goal. \nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful. And maybe just digging in on that acquisition, I think the seller put out certain numbers around there with -- that implied certain EBITDA for the asset. And I was just wondering if you could provide any thoughts with regards to how -- what type of economics you're seeing with this deal and how that could maybe improve over time? \nGregory Floerke: Jeremy, this is Greg. Yes, we really look at the Utica story as -- as I mentioned, we're very bullish about it. The rigs are there, the activity is coming up. We're already seeing growth. And we think this is a volume story, utilizing facilities that have existing capacity. So in an ideal situation, you would see new drilling off of -- even off of existing pads with no new investment. But even in the case of new pads, it's essentially well connects into our system and then we take advantage of existing truck pipelines compression in our processing and fractionation facilities that are already there with capacity. So we think there's upside in value related primarily to volume and not having to spend a lot of additional capital to capture that volume. \nMichael Hennigan: Jeremy, it's Mike. Just to add on to what Greg said, obviously we think the multiple is going to be better than what was put out there earlier. We're just cognizant of not putting our data out too soon. We just want to show it in the results and then we can talk about it later. \nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful. And maybe just kind of circling back to the point at the top there. You talked about as it relates to capital allocation, red bar, blue bar. I think there might have been some purple bar points in the past. But just wondering, as you think about, I guess, the potential red bar there and further, I guess, bolt-ons, would you look to retain more further to improve the balance sheet if there are future opportunities have materialized or is leverage low enough at this point, or is buybacks really kind focused for that? \nMichael Hennigan: Yes, Jeremy, we always say it's a good problem to have. We think we're in a great position on financial flexibility. Like you mentioned, the balance sheet is in good shape. We're generating excess cash beyond distributions and capital at this point. We also feel like we have different opportunities for us. And you're right. Thanks for that reference. Sometimes the cash flows are hard to debate and we sometimes call them purple. But in general, I'm hoping the takeaway is we're going to generate enough cash to put ourselves in a good financial flexibility position. That's where it all starts. And then we debate the color of the cash flows and how we think we can get the most shareholder value. We've been leaning more towards distribution because it's blue. And as you know, the way we run the business is to generate cash flows that we think will be there long term. So that's why they're mostly blue. I know people have been asking a little bit about our buyback strategy. And hopefully, when I answered John's question, I gave you a little bit more color around that. But -- so we'll have that flexibility. We have the financial flexibility for where we are. We're going to continue to look at our organic growth. We'll evaluate some organic as it comes along. And at the end of the day, all we're trying to do day in and day out is create more value for our unitholders. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Theresa Chen with Barclays. \nTheresa Chen: Going back to Dave's comments about the expansion in the Permian NGL platform, in relation to the Texas City frac and storage project, can you just help us think about how a long haul pipeline productivity solution could come about, and whether it would be independent or an extension of the, I believe, 42% UGI that BANGL has an EPIC NGL. And then also [ downstream ] from that, is there space in Texas City on MPC's Galveston Bay docks for LPG export opportunities if the Texas City frac and storage projects do come to fruition? And would it be the parent that would be marketing those volumes and taking the commodities risk? Just help think about how that value chain could play out. \nMichael Hennigan: Yes, Theresa, thanks for the question. I'll let Dave give a little more detail there. But you kind of laid out a lot of optionality that we have and we're going to continue to evaluate all the different options. But let me let Dave give a little more color. \nDavid Heppner: Yes, Theresa, I think Mike said it extremely well. There's a couple of key things to think about as we look at these large projects, multi-year value chain build out projects. One is how do we leverage the existing assets we have either in the ground or in the vicinity, number one. Number two, how do we leverage and incorporate existing partnerships and JVs we have such as BANGL. And then third is how do we leverage our parent company, MPC, back to Galveston Bay. And so as we look at all those and that's -- and we think through the scenarios and the options of both near-term build out and commercialization, but long-term value creation. Right now we're going through multiple scenarios. And as you can imagine, we want to make sure we look through all those both from a financial return perspective, near term, a commerciality and flexibility, and then also a long-term growth platform. So I think as you stated, there's a lot of pieces to that puzzle and we're in all the work of doing that right now. But we feel good about our options and our flexibility and now we're just trying to determine how we bring it to realization. Hopefully that helps a little bit. \nTheresa Chen: And maybe turning to the residue side, can you give us an update on the in-service timeline for Matterhorn? And given your partnership with Enbridge and WhiteWater and combining Whistler ADCC with Rio Bravo, would you be evaluating participation in another bullet residue pipe that is evidently necessary out of the basin come a couple of years? \nDavid Heppner: Yes. So I'll touch on Matterhorn and then I'll turn it over to Shawn. He can give a little more update. First of all, I think Matterhorn is planning to come on 3Q of this year. So I'll start with that. So as you think about clearing natural gas out of the Permian, you can think of Whistler, Whistler expansion, Matterhorn, you can think of ADCC, not that we're participating today, but you have Blackfin out there, and then you have Rio Bravo. So as you go forward, this is -- our view is that you've got 2 sides of the equation. You've got the pull coming from these LNG facilities down to the Gulf Coast, which are majority of them backstopped by 20-year take or pays, which is a nice long-term pull. And then you've got the growth platform that Mike touched on earlier out of the Permian. And you really look at those by the 2030 time frame, there's substantial growth profile. So to answer your question, whether it be continued expansions that we've done very similar to Whistler and Matterhorn or is it new pipes, I think you can maybe read the tea leaves that there is incremental capacity needed clearly with barrels out of the Permian to the Gulf Coast. \nMichael Hennigan: Teresa, it's Mike. I'll just add. The main drive between what Dave has mentioned as far as us doing these partnerships, et cetera, is to get to the very point that you just made. There's going to be more takeaway out of the basin. We want to participate in that, whether it's another residue pipe or not, and we're trying to position ourselves to be part of that. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. \nKeith Stanley: First, just wanted to ask, can you talk to the conversion of some of the preferreds? It looks like it was a lot in Q1. And I just want to make sure, did that factor at all into the decision to buyback stock in Q1 since you had new stock coming into the market? First, I just wanted to ask, can you talk to the conversion of some of the preferreds? It looks like there was a lot in Q1. And I just want to make sure, did that factor at all into the decision to buy back stock in Q1 since you had new stock coming into the market? \nGregory Floerke: You're correct. You did see some significant conversions happened during the quarter. I think with the investor base, in those units, they have that ability to do that, at their leisure quarterly. It did not have any impact on our unit buyback program. That -- kind of that capital allocation strategy is unchanged as Mike had hit on. \nKeith Stanley: Okay. Great. And sorry if I missed this, but for the JV buy-ins bolt-ons that you've done, can you say, Summit, it sounds like you were pretty excited about. Can you say if you initiated these transactions with partners or partners are looking to sell and came to you? I'm more curious just looking forward, are you optimistic there could be other opportunities? The company has a lot of JVs that potentially you could look at buying other partners' interests. Just any thoughts there? \nMichael Hennigan: Yes. Keith, I think you hit it on the head. We're excited about all of them. And we were able to kind of voice into the Summit, show some real numbers with first quarter activity. When it comes to the evaluation of additional opportunities, we're evaluating them all. The good thing with these types of acquisitions, we're very familiar with the assets and we're very familiar with the partners. With all of these opportunities though, we view them with the lens of strict capital discipline. So from our perspective, it has to be at the right value for us and our unitholders. \nOperator: And our last question will come from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities. \nNeal Dingmann: My question a little bit on what you've been talking about on just the return of capital framework post to SMLP. I'm just wondering, were you all suggesting that sort of post this, you would continue -- you would consider substantially boosting that DPU materially again or even more buybacks or would you consider even a sizable acquisition? I'm just wondering how you're sort of thinking about things post this. \nMichael Hennigan: Yes, it's all of the above. So, hopefully, we've been clear that we're going to continue to generate more cash, we're going to grow the cash flows. As a result of that, we're going to continue to increase the distribution as our primary return of capital. We're going to look at buybacks as part of our capital allocation framework. We're going to continue to invest organically and then we're going to look at the inorganic stuff that's available. I'm much more of a believer in the organic opportunities, because they get us to higher return, more efficient capital, et cetera, and that's what you've seen over the last couple of years in general. But like I said at the start of this, it all starts with growing cash flows and whether it's doing it organically or through some of these bolt-ons that we've talked about. At the end of the day, grow the cash flows, invest wisely. That's why I always say it's a return on and a return of business. And then I'm a big believer in return capital to our unitholders. So hopefully, we're going to continue to show you that we're going to grow that distribution continually over time meaningfully as you've seen over the last couple of years and that's certainly our goal. \nNeal Dingmann: No, that's very clear. Just a quick follow-up on the Marcellus gathering. It's really nice to see another significant year-over-year increase there on your last quarter. I'm just wondering what -- make sure I understand what's sort of the capacity situation there as it appears that area continues to be positively trending. I'm just wondering is there still potentially more upside as you've been seeing? \nGregory Floerke: Yes. We do have additional upside, but we run that system at very high utilization as you've seen. We're over -- we continue to be over 90% utilized on processing in the Marcellus and that really matches up with the -- with our Liberty Gathering System capacity. We don't -- we only gather for some customers in Marcellus. We process for a lot of customers. We don't necessarily gather for all of them. But -- so when you see gathering numbers, it's typically our Liberty System in Washington County and we do try to add capacity just in time, to match the processing growth \nMichael Hennigan: The only other thing that I would add Neal is we've anticipated the market has for a long time of MDP coming online up in the Northeast. We think that will be a significant change to the activity up there, 2 DCF pipeline coming on to what has been a constrained area for some time. And then as Greg mentioned, we're pretty excited about the renewed interest in the Utica, particularly the rich area, as liquids compared to the dry price is certainly pushing people more into the liquids rich area. So, it's one of our key growth areas, it has been, will continue to be. I think you've heard throughout the call today, Greg talked a lot about what's happening on the gas side of the business up in the Northeast. Dave talked a lot about what we're doing as far as natural gas expansion and NGL expansion down in the Permian. So we're pretty confident and optimistic that our plan is working, our strategy continues to be good and we're going to grow cash flows and return capital to unitholders. So that's how we feel at this point. \nKristina Kazarian: All right. With that, thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in MPLX. Should you have additional questions or would like clarification on any of the topics discussed today, members of our Investor Relations team will be available today to help you with your call. Thank you so much. \nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you once again for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "content": "Thanks, Mike. MPLX's 2024 capital expenditure outlook of $1.1 billion is unchanged and includes $950 million of growth capital and $150 million of maintenance capital. Our 2024 growth capital outlook is anchored in the Marcellus and Permian basins. Our integrated footprint in these basins have positioned the partnership with a steady source of opportunities to expand, particularly around our natural gas and NGL asset. We continue growing these operations through organic projects, investments in our Permian joint ventures and bolt-on opportunities. In the L&S segment, progress continues on the Agua Dulce to Corpus Christi natural gas pipeline joint venture, which is expected to be in service in the third quarter of 2024. We're also progressing the expansion of the BANGL NGL pipeline joint venture to 200,000 barrels per day, which is expected to be completed in the first half of 2025. In the G&P segment, we're bringing new gas processing plants online to meet increasing customer demand. The Harmon Creek II gas processing plant was placed into service in late February, bringing our Marcellus processing capacity to 6.5 billion cubic feet per day. In the Permian basin, Preakness II is approaching startup and is expected to be online in May. Additionally, we are progressing the Secretariat processing plant, which is expected to be online in the second half of 2025. Once operational, our total processing capacity in the Delaware basin will be approximately 1.4 billion cubic feet per day. Outside of these strategic basins, the remainder of our capital plan is mostly comprised of smaller higher return investments, targeted expansion or start up of existing assets and projects related to planned increases and producer customer activity. Slide 6 outlines the first quarter operational and financial performance highlights for our logistics and storage segment. Adjusted EBITDA increased $72 million when compared to the first quarter of 2023, primarily driven by higher rates and growth from our equity affiliates. Crude and product pipelines and terminal volumes were down year-over-year, primarily due to start up planned turnaround activity in the first quarter of 2024. Due to the structure of our contracts with MPC, refinery volume changes had limited impact -- financial impact to MPLX. Moving to our Gathering and Processing segment on Slide 7. The G&P segment adjusted EBITDA increased $44 million compared to the first quarter of 2023, primarily driven by higher volumes. Total gathered volumes were down 2% year-over-year, primarily due to decreased dry gas production in the Utica and scheduled maintenance activities in the Southwest. Processing volumes were up 9% year-over-year, primarily from higher volumes in the Marcellus and Utica, driven by increased customer production. Focusing in on the Marcellus, by far our largest basin of G&P operations, we saw year-over-year volume increases of 10% for gathering and 7% for processing, driven by increased drilling and production growth. Marcellus processing utilization was 92% in the first quarter, reflecting the need for our Harmon Creek II processing plant, which was placed in service in late February. Fractionation volumes grew 4% due to higher ethane recoveries and higher processed volumes. Moving to our first quarter financial highlights on Slide 8. Total adjusted EBITDA of $1.6 billion and distributable cash flow of $1.4 billion, each increased 8% from prior year. During the quarter, MPLX acquired additional ownership interest in existing joint ventures and a dry gas gathering system located in Utica for $625 million and contributed $92 million for the repayment of our share of the Bakken pipeline JV debt due in April. MPLX also returned $951 million to unitholders through $876 million in distributions and $75 million in unit repurchases, ending the quarter with a cash balance of $385 million. As a reminder, the first quarter is typically our lowest quarter for project-related expenses. Like prior years, we anticipate these expenses will increase $30 million to $40 million sequentially in the second quarter, reflecting more favorable weather to undertake project-related work. Now let me hand it back to Mike for some final thoughts."

            "name": "Gregory Floerke",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. The Utica is interesting. We're really excited about what's going on there right now.

            "name": "Michael Hennigan",
            "content": "Thanks, Kristina. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. Earlier today, we reported first quarter results. Our business continues to grow and delivered adjusted EBITDA of $1.6 billion and distributable cash flow of $1.4 billion, each an 8% increase year-over-year. In line with our commitment to return capital, the growth of MPLX's cash flow supported the return of $951 million to unitholders. Turning to the macro, the United States continues to be a low cost producer of energy fuels needed across the globe. Oil demand is at a record high globally. We expect oil demand to continue to set records into the foreseeable future. Forecasted outlooks for this year estimate 1.2 million to 2 million barrels per day of incremental demand over 2023, primarily driven by the growing need for transportation fuels. Our expectations on the long-term production outlook in our key basins remains unchanged. In the Northeast, longer laterals are resulting in higher volumes, highlighting the strength and opportunities we see across our footprint. We continue to expect volume growth in the Marcellus as well as the Utica, where producers are targeting economically advantaged liquids-rich acreage. In the Permian basin, crude prices remain attractive and associated gas production continues to grow as producers execute drilling and completion activities. In the first quarter, MPLX announced two strategic transactions. First, in the Utica, we enhanced our footprint through the acquisition of additional ownership interest in an existing joint venture and a dry gas gathering system. We have already seen growth in the rich gas window of the Utica and we see new producers moving into the region. Second, MPLX entered into a definitive agreement to combine the Whistler Pipeline and the Rio Bravo Pipeline project into a newly formed joint venture. The transaction expands MPLX's natural gas value chain, connects Permian supply to additional Gulf Coast demand, and positions MPLX for future growth opportunities. The transaction, subject to required regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, is expected to close in the second quarter. We remain committed to growing the partnership through our lens of strict capital discipline. In fact, over the last 3 years, MPLX holds a peer leading return on invested capital. The previously mentioned strategic transactions are a continuation of our approach as we seek to grow the cash flows of the partnership. We believe this is a return on and a return of capital business, and we'll continue to use our capital allocation framework to evaluate and optimize capital allocation decisions. We're confident in our ability to grow the partnership and are focused on executing the strategic priorities of strict capital discipline, fostering a low cost culture, and optimizing our asset portfolio, all of which are foundational to the growth of MPLX's cash flows. Now let me turn the call over to Kris to discuss our growth as well as our operational and financial results of the quarter. Thanks, Kris. In closing, MPLX has a strong history of growing the partnership's cash flows by executing its strategic priorities, all while maintaining strict capital discipline. We continue to aim for mid-single-digit growth rate over multiple year periods. And as you can see in our results, we have a strong start again to this year with adjusted EBITDA and DCF up 8% versus the first quarter of 2023. By deploying capital wisely, controlling our costs, and optimizing operations to get the most out of our assets, we've grown DCF by nearly 8% on a 3-year compound annual basis. MPLX is a strategic investment for MPC and as they each pursue growth opportunities, the value of this strategic relationship will be enhanced. By advancing our high return growth projects anchored in the Marcellus and Permian basins, along with our focus on cost and portfolio optimization, we intend to grow our cash flows, allowing us to reinvest in the business and continue to return capital to unitholders. In each of the last 2 years, we've increased our quarterly distribution 10%. The business is expected to continue to generate significant annual free cash flow after distribution, placing us in a strong position to continue to consistently grow our distribution. Now let me turn the call back over to Kristina. John, thanks for that question. Let me start because we get that question often. I'll try and be as clear as I can. First off, it starts with generating cash. I mean, you've heard in our prepared remarks that our 3-year CAGR is about 8%, and our first quarter results on DCF and EBITDA were about 8%. So it starts with generating cash. And then the uniqueness to that cash is we kind of color code the cash into 2 buckets. Those buckets that's continuing, we think is going to be there through all types of markets, and I've called that blue bar cash flows. The cash flows that are there, intermittent, that could be there sometimes, not sometimes, I call red bar cash flows. So, understanding the type of cash flows that we generated is really important to go into our capital allocation framework. And the way I think about the red bar, red bar may not be there all the time, but it is a source of equity. Blue bar, I think of it as an ongoing cash flow that's going to support our distribution growth. And we've said a bunch of times that our preferred method of returning capital is primarily distribution growth because we primarily drive blue bar cash flows in our system. But having the flexibility with red bar for buybacks is also important to us. So when we put that all together, the way we think of our capital allocation framework is: number one, we're going to take care of our assets; number two is we're going to continue to grow our distribution, and that's driven by those blue bar cash flows; number three is we're going to look to invest and continue to grow earnings. And hopefully, you've seen our track record on capital discipline and what it's done to earnings. We're very proud of growing this size partnership at about 8% per year over the last 3 years, and it continued into the first quarter. And then the last piece is our buyback. And although it's fourth in the capital allocation framework, it's still a tool that we have at our disposal, and we continue to think about when that makes the most sense versus when it doesn't. So if you think -- if you step all the way back, we color code the cash flows, we prioritize blue, that's the way we run our business, stable, continuing cash flows that will be there all the time. Those are more targeted towards distributions. You've heard us say we've done 10% distribution increases the last two years, you've heard us say we believe we have strong financial capabilities to continue to grow our distributions, but we also have the tool of buybacks when we think it makes sense. I hope that was helpful. Yes. Thanks, John. It's another good question. Let me start off and then I'll let Greg talk about this recent activity. So, in general, over the last couple of years, you've seen us mainly driving organic growth. That's where we see good return projects. Again, I always say they're not sexy, they're not big headline projects, but they're good return projects. And we've been executing those well, and that's driven growth. But we're also constantly looking at M&A or organic -- inorganic activities. And during this quarter, we were able to make a strategic transaction in the Utica. And I'll let Greg talk a little bit about the details. Yes. Thanks, Manav. I appreciate that question. I'm going to let Dave give you a little more detail on it. I would tell you in general, though, as we've been saying, we're concentrating a lot of our activity in our key basins. And Greg just mentioned a lot of what's going up in the Northeast. And I'll let Dave talk a little bit about what's going on down in the Permian. And Manav, since Dave gave you a little bit of detail on that project, why don't you talk a little bit about NGLs as well since we're talking about natural gas and what we're doing in the Permian. Jeremy, that's a good question. First off, let me correct you. The M&A activity that we do, even if it's on the smaller side, is not included or would be additive to our goal of driving for mid-single-digit growth. So we think of the mid-single-digit growth as our organic program in general. And then when these other opportunities come up through inorganic opportunities like we just talked about, that would be additive. So our base is always things that we can control, trying to compete for growth, Harmon Creek II, Preakness II, Secretariat. You just heard Dave talk about our natural gas pipeline strategy down in the Permian and NGL growth. All those things come into our base feeling about growing the partnership, at least mid-single-digit cash flows. When we do something like the acquisition of the JV partner in Utica that Greg talked about, we think of that as additive to our goal. Jeremy, it's Mike. Just to add on to what Greg said, obviously we think the multiple is going to be better than what was put out there earlier. We're just cognizant of not putting our data out too soon. We just want to show it in the results and then we can talk about it later. Yes, Jeremy, we always say it's a good problem to have. We think we're in a great position on financial flexibility. Like you mentioned, the balance sheet is in good shape. We're generating excess cash beyond distributions and capital at this point. We also feel like we have different opportunities for us. And you're right. Thanks for that reference. Sometimes the cash flows are hard to debate and we sometimes call them purple. But in general, I'm hoping the takeaway is we're going to generate enough cash to put ourselves in a good financial flexibility position. That's where it all starts. And then we debate the color of the cash flows and how we think we can get the most shareholder value. We've been leaning more towards distribution because it's blue. And as you know, the way we run the business is to generate cash flows that we think will be there long term. So that's why they're mostly blue. I know people have been asking a little bit about our buyback strategy. And hopefully, when I answered John's question, I gave you a little bit more color around that. But -- so we'll have that flexibility. We have the financial flexibility for where we are. We're going to continue to look at our organic growth. We'll evaluate some organic as it comes along. And at the end of the day, all we're trying to do day in and day out is create more value for our unitholders. Yes, Theresa, thanks for the question. I'll let Dave give a little more detail there. But you kind of laid out a lot of optionality that we have and we're going to continue to evaluate all the different options. But let me let Dave give a little more color. Teresa, it's Mike. I'll just add. The main drive between what Dave has mentioned as far as us doing these partnerships, et cetera, is to get to the very point that you just made. There's going to be more takeaway out of the basin. We want to participate in that, whether it's another residue pipe or not, and we're trying to position ourselves to be part of that. Yes. Keith, I think you hit it on the head. We're excited about all of them. And we were able to kind of voice into the Summit, show some real numbers with first quarter activity. When it comes to the evaluation of additional opportunities, we're evaluating them all. The good thing with these types of acquisitions, we're very familiar with the assets and we're very familiar with the partners. With all of these opportunities though, we view them with the lens of strict capital discipline. So from our perspective, it has to be at the right value for us and our unitholders. Yes, it's all of the above. So, hopefully, we've been clear that we're going to continue to generate more cash, we're going to grow the cash flows. As a result of that, we're going to continue to increase the distribution as our primary return of capital. We're going to look at buybacks as part of our capital allocation framework. We're going to continue to invest organically and then we're going to look at the inorganic stuff that's available. I'm much more of a believer in the organic opportunities, because they get us to higher return, more efficient capital, et cetera, and that's what you've seen over the last couple of years in general. But like I said at the start of this, it all starts with growing cash flows and whether it's doing it organically or through some of these bolt-ons that we've talked about. At the end of the day, grow the cash flows, invest wisely. That's why I always say it's a return on and a return of business. And then I'm a big believer in return capital to our unitholders. So hopefully, we're going to continue to show you that we're going to grow that distribution continually over time meaningfully as you've seen over the last couple of years and that's certainly our goal. The only other thing that I would add Neal is we've anticipated the market has for a long time of MDP coming online up in the Northeast. We think that will be a significant change to the activity up there, 2 DCF pipeline coming on to what has been a constrained area for some time. And then as Greg mentioned, we're pretty excited about the renewed interest in the Utica, particularly the rich area, as liquids compared to the dry price is certainly pushing people more into the liquids rich area. So, it's one of our key growth areas, it has been, will continue to be. I think you've heard throughout the call today, Greg talked a lot about what's happening on the gas side of the business up in the Northeast. Dave talked a lot about what we're doing as far as natural gas expansion and NGL expansion down in the Permian. So we're pretty confident and optimistic that our plan is working, our strategy continues to be good and we're going to grow cash flows and return capital to unitholders. So that's how we feel at this point."

            "name": "David Heppner",
            "content": "Manav, so let me dig a little deeper. So, as Mike stated, the Permian is, in addition to our other basins, one of our key focus basins. And this JV partnership, which is with MPLX along with WhiteWater and I Squared, as part of the existing Whistler JV, entered in that definitive agreement with Enbridge to strategically combine that JV with the Rio Bravo Pipeline project into this newly formed JV. So that's step #1. And the justification for that, while we monetize a small portion of our equity ownership in Whistler at a low double-digit multiple, the real key, it enabled us to build out -- continue to build out our wellhead-to-water growth strategy and enhancing our value chain from the Permian to the U.S. Gulf Coast. So think of it this way, that the Rio Bravo Pipeline project provides Whistler with that value chain connectivity to the Rio Grande LNG export of facility in Brownsville, Texas, which is not a lot different to the strategy around the ADCC Pipeline project that is under construction right now at the Cheniere's LNG facility in Corpus Christi. So it's that last mile connectivity to the LNG pull. So, as we look forward, both from our Permian supply that Mike touched on earlier and the U.S. Gulf Coast LNG demand, which we all anticipate to grow, this strategic partnership provides a strong platform and positions Whistler under the new JV to participate in this growth and the development of incremental pipeline projects which again, of course, will further enhance NPL's wellhead-to-water strategy. Let me be clear with that, that any potential projects that we look at going forward must provide two things, acceptable financial returns and the right commercial terms through our lens of strict capital discipline as we look at all projects, whether it be bolt-on, organic or these growth projects. So, hopefully, that gives you a little more color. Sure thing, Mike. So very similar nat gas. We've been pretty public about our plans to expand our value chains in the NGL platform. And again, it's all about strengthening our competitive position through Ford integration. So think of it, from wellhead to the consumers. So back on the wellhead, Greg and his team with all our gas processing plants, we got our BANGL pipeline expansion project going. And so whether we extend these value chains independently or with partners, extended the water and have an export optionality as part of that strategy. At this time, we don't have any major updates to provide on the Texas City NGL frac and storage projects, but that is a project we continued to -- continue to evaluate. So if you recall on that project back in December of last year, we submitted our air permit application to the TCEQ for the NGL Frac and storage facility in Texas City, Texas. I want to be clear that filing these permits is one of the many steps we take in evaluation of the potential projects, and we'll continue to evaluate any commercial framework around those. Again, very similar to our nat gas strategy, acceptable returns, the right commercial terms through the lens of strict capital test will help us determine if we go that alone or do with business partners going forward. So hopefully that gives you a little more color on our NGL strategy, which I would say very similar to our nat gas strategy is through -- for MPLX is wellhead-to-water, participate in the whole value chain, both from equity and from commercial optionality. Yes, Theresa, I think Mike said it extremely well. There's a couple of key things to think about as we look at these large projects, multi-year value chain build out projects. One is how do we leverage the existing assets we have either in the ground or in the vicinity, number one. Number two, how do we leverage and incorporate existing partnerships and JVs we have such as BANGL. And then third is how do we leverage our parent company, MPC, back to Galveston Bay. And so as we look at all those and that's -- and we think through the scenarios and the options of both near-term build out and commercialization, but long-term value creation. Right now we're going through multiple scenarios. And as you can imagine, we want to make sure we look through all those both from a financial return perspective, near term, a commerciality and flexibility, and then also a long-term growth platform. So I think as you stated, there's a lot of pieces to that puzzle and we're in all the work of doing that right now. But we feel good about our options and our flexibility and now we're just trying to determine how we bring it to realization. Hopefully that helps a little bit. Yes. So I'll touch on Matterhorn and then I'll turn it over to Shawn. He can give a little more update. First of all, I think Matterhorn is planning to come on 3Q of this year. So I'll start with that. So as you think about clearing natural gas out of the Permian, you can think of Whistler, Whistler expansion, Matterhorn, you can think of ADCC, not that we're participating today, but you have Blackfin out there, and then you have Rio Bravo. So as you go forward, this is -- our view is that you've got 2 sides of the equation. You've got the pull coming from these LNG facilities down to the Gulf Coast, which are majority of them backstopped by 20-year take or pays, which is a nice long-term pull. And then you've got the growth platform that Mike touched on earlier out of the Permian. And you really look at those by the 2030 time frame, there's substantial growth profile. So to answer your question, whether it be continued expansions that we've done very similar to Whistler and Matterhorn or is it new pipes, I think you can maybe read the tea leaves that there is incremental capacity needed clearly with barrels out of the Permian to the Gulf Coast."
