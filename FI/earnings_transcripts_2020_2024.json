[Operator Instructions] At this time, I would now like to turn the conference over to Peter Poillon, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Pfizer. \nPeter Poillon: Thank you, Ivy, and good afternoon, everyone. With me on the call today are Frank Bisignano, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and supplemental materials for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, expected operating and financial results, strategic initiatives and expected benefits and synergies from the First Data acquisition. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. You should refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. Please refer to our earnings release and supplemental materials for today's call for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call, along with the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. Unless stated otherwise, performance references are year-over-year comparisons, and all references to internal revenue growth are on a constant currency basis. Note that the full year 2019 non-GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and supplemental materials have been prepared by making certain adjustments to the sum of historical First Data and Fiserv GAAP financial information for periods prior to the acquisition date. And now I'll turn the call over to Frank.\nFrank J. Bisignano: Thank you, Peter, and good afternoon, everyone. 2020 was unprecedented on many levels. We started the year strong. And after entering the pandemic, we continued investing heavily in technology, innovation, our client franchise and our people. We've now entered 2021 with tremendous momentum. Your company performed very well given the circumstances across a number of facets of our business. Our 22% sales growth for the year demonstrates that we're clearly winning in the client's office. We strengthened our client franchise, raising our client satisfaction scores across all measures. We invest in our people platform, resulting in top quartile engagement scores among companies in the Fortune 500. We made outstanding progress on integration. We accelerated and increased synergy execution while ramping our investment in innovative products and solutions. We delivered 12% adjusted earnings-per-share growth for the year, marking our 35th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth, and we delivered record free cash flow. We are exiting the year stronger than we entered, and we're well positioned to capitalize on our momentum in 2021 and beyond. Let me provide a brief overview of our financial results in the quarter, and Bob will provide more detail later on the call. Total company internal revenue growth was 1%. That performance was led by our Merchant Acceptance segments, which was up 3%, a strong result in light of the global pandemic. Total company adjusted operating margin for the quarter was up 420 basis points and adjusted earnings per share increased 16%. Free cash flow was again excellent, coming in at $1.1 billion in the quarter, bringing free cash flow for the full year to more than $3.6 billion. Our sales momentum remains quite strong. Fourth quarter sales were up 19%, with terrific results in our credit processing, merchant acquiring and account processing businesses. Sales for the full year were up an impressive 22%. The combination of robust sales and excellent pipeline into 2021 is evidence that our formula of bringing the strength and breadth of Fiserv's offerings together with our integrated sales model is extremely well received in the client's office and bodes well for the future. Now I'd like to update you on how our leading digital-enabled merchant business is performing. Through Clover, our leading SMB platform; Carat, our enterprise omni-channel commerce solution; and Clover Connect, our rich ISV solution set, we continue to drive innovation, expand partnerships and deliver leading solutions to our merchant clients. The momentum within the digital-enabled segments of the merchant business continues to be excellent. Clover's gross payment volume grew 25% to $34 billion in the quarter or $135 billion annualized. We continue to extend the breadth of services to clover merchants with innovative solutions that enhance convenience, especially in the digital segment. For example, we recently introduced invoicing capabilities that allow Clover merchants, especially those in the services vertical, to build and collect payments from consumers electronically. Carat. So our continued growth with global e-commerce transaction is up about 25% both in the quarter and for the full year. We saw our omni-channel transactions, such as order-ahead and pick up in store, grow more than 125% year-over-year with some of our best-known quick service restaurant clients seeing excellent growth. We continue to capture market share winning 46 new enterprise-level e-comm clients in the fourth quarter, including digital acquiring for Overstock.com and Wingstop in North America. In Europe, we signed Total, one of the largest energy providers in the world to provide global digital payment acceptance services across more than 100 countries around the world. We also expanded employer relationships, delivering new products and services to key clients such as Lyft, where we are now powering disbursements to drivers. Clover Connect allows us to win new partnerships and drive growth in our partner solutions business. In the fourth quarter, we signed 44 new ISV partners, bringing us to 176 new ISVs signed for the year. Those new partner relationships are driving strong results in active merchants, up 43% in Q4. And strong revenue growth in the ISV channel. For example, during the quarter, Fiserv signed a strategic partnership agreement with RFMS, the largest provider of software services for floor installation professionals to provide omni-channel payment capabilities to their flooring customers. We also signed one of the largest providers of eye care products and technology to provide payment acceptance services to its more than 7,000 eye care professional customers. To further expand our value-added services for merchants, Fiserv and Citizens Financial Group have partnered to offer merchants a new suite of lending solutions at the point-of-sale through Citizens Pay, providing merchants with flexible payment options for customers to finance purchases at the point of sale. The program expands a partnership we've had with Citizen since 2015 to provide new financing options. And we expect it to drive adoption in the fast-growing buy now, pay later space. Moving to account processing business. We continue to expand the number of privileged relationships we have in our account processing business across financial institutions of all sizes and types. We signed 19 new core account processing clients in the quarter, including five on the DNA platform, bringing the total to 60 for the year with 25 on DNA. I'd like to highlight a few of our recent wins. Service First, a commercial bank with more than $11 billion in assets, signed on for a full suite of Fiserv products including core processing, card services and output solutions. Lakeside Bank, a full-service bank with more than $2 billion in assets, signed on for our core processing, along with a robust suite of solutions that includes CheckFree, debit card services and Zelle. I'm also pleased that just recently, Republic Bank has partnered with Fiserv for core processing plus a rich suite of digital and payment solutions. Republic is a $5 billion asset, full-service retail and commercial bank that was voted the #1 Bank in America for Service by Forbes in 2020. All of these illustrative wins were competitive takeaways with a common characteristic. They selected a leading core platform plus multiple surround digital solutions to support their goals of sustained growth and superior customer service. I'm also pleased to note that we signed three more de novo banks in the quarter. In our payment and network segment, we continue to see robust sales activity, including several notable card production and personalization wins. We gained a new agreement with Capital One to add Cap One's more than 1,500 ATMs to Fiserv's Money Pass ATM network, while offering their customers access to thousands of additional surcharge-free ATMs across the country. And I'm pleased to note that we expanded our long-standing partnership with PayPal, signing a deal in the quarter to integrate PayPal as a bill payment option for five share billers, a notable synergy sale. With that, let me update you on our integration efforts. At Investor Day, we discussed how our integration continues to go extraordinarily well and our synergy execution is far ahead of original schedule. Through December 31, we've already actioned over $1 billion of cost savings and are well on our way to fully action a $1.2 billion cost synergies by the end of this year. We entered 2021 with the majority of the integration work behind us and a focus on driving further growth and sustainable value in the years ahead. On the revenue side, we're pleased with the level of synergy sales, which accelerated in the fourth quarter. As of year-end, we've already actioned $215 million in annualized revenue synergies, and our synergy sales pipeline is growing robustly. Giving us confidence in meeting or exceeding our $600 million target. Our bank merchant program continues to be one of the larger synergy opportunity and offers financial institutions of all sizes and ability to offer their important merchant clients a modern suite of merchant acquiring capabilities including the innovative Clover platform, along with digital capabilities like loyalty programs and e-comm solutions. In the fourth quarter, we added 45 new bank merchant clients, bringing the total to 231 new clients since the merger, with more than half of those wins competitive takeaways. The pipeline into 2021 remains robust with over 500 financial institutions, prompting our continued confidence in achieving a sizable revenue synergy opportunity. One final point on our digital initiatives before turning it over to Bob. As you've heard us discuss in the past, one of the most important strategic initiatives is to redefine the client experience by utilizing the latest technology to drive innovation and offer digital capabilities across our payments ecosystem. We've taken two important steps in the last 60 days in this area. First, we acquired Ondot Systems, the leading digital card services platform for financial institutions of all sizes. We're committed to deploying capital, both organically and inorganically, to develop the digital and data next generational solutions that will drive growth long into the future. And second, further demonstrating our commitment to leadership in this area, we appointed a Chief Digital and Data Officer to lead these important strategic growth initiatives across all of Fiserv. Now let me pass the discussion to Bob for more detail on the financial results.\nRobert W. Hau: Thank you, Frank, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a strong fourth quarter in light of continued pressure from the pandemic across the globe. Total company internal revenue growth was 1% in the quarter, led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 3%. For the full year, internal revenue was flat versus last year, in line with our expectations that we communicated during our last earnings call. Growth from revenue synergies, which were $46 million in the quarter and $160 million for the year, helps mitigate the impact from continued pressure related to the pandemic. During our last earnings call, we shared that we saw transaction growth rates stabilize at or around July levels. In the fourth quarter, our transaction and payment volume growth rates remain relatively in line with what we saw in the third quarter. Fourth quarter adjusted operating income was up a strong 10% to $1.3 billion and adjusted operating margin increased by a very strong 420 basis points to 35.6%, driven by our rigorous cost synergy, execution, which produced $177 million of incremental cost synergies in the quarter as well as strong operating performance. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased by 2% to $4.4 billion, and adjusted operating margin increased 170 basis points to 31.4%, benefiting from $581 million of incremental cost synergies in the year and excellent operational performance. The fact that we improved our margin by 170 basis points to the worst economic cycle in memory is a strong validation of the robust quality and resilience of our business. And since most of the cost actions in 2020 were focused on permanent synergy achievement, not short-term cost savings, we believe our adjusted operating margin improvements are sustainable and expect continued strong improvements in 2021 and beyond. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 16% to $1.30 compared to $1.12 in the prior year, as adjusted for divestitures. Adjusted earnings per share for the full year increased 12% to $4.42, ahead of our prior expectations. Free cash flow in the quarter was once again very strong at $1.1 billion. For the full year, free cash flow increased 11% to more than $3.6 billion. Free cash flow conversion was also very strong at 119% for the fourth quarter and 121% for the full year. Turning to each of the segments. Internal revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was 3% in the quarter, an impressive result given the headwinds faced from economy that was hampered by the pandemic. Our results were once again driven by strong performances in our portfolio SMB clients, supported by our Clover platform, enterprise clients supported by Carat and another strong quarter from our ISV business. For the full year, internal revenue is in line with the prior year. As Frank discussed, our Clover GPV continues to grow very nicely, up 25% in the quarter despite the difficult macroeconomic environment for SMBs. We feel great about the strength of that portfolio in 2020 and even better about its performance in the months and quarters ahead as we get beyond the pandemic. Our integrated payments, or ISV business, continues to perform extremely well with continued strong revenue growth in the quarter. As we discussed at our Investor Day, we recently rolled out Clover Connect, a Clover integrated solution for ISVs. We believe that this solution will further extend our differentiation for ISVs and their merchant customers and continue to drive excellent growth in the future. Adjusted operating income in the aerospace -- excuse me, in the Acceptance segment increased 8% to $443 million in the quarter. Adjusted operating margin was up 280 basis points in the quarter to 30.7% and increased 150 basis points sequentially. On our Q2 earnings call, after reporting our COVID impact at low point for our Acceptance financial results, we said the segment's adjusted operating margin was expected to improve by more than 800 basis points in the second half of 2020 compared to the first half. We're pleased to achieve that with our second half acceptance margin of nearly 1,000 basis points, bringing our full year margin to 25.4%. The Fintech segment internal revenue declined 1% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year as growth in high-quality recurring revenue was again offset by much lower periodic revenue, most prominently, termination fees, which created approximately 350 basis points of headwind to internal revenue growth in the quarter. For the full year, internal revenue was in line with the prior year. The shift toward digital banking took a strong step forward in 2020 with lockdowns leading consumers and businesses alike to consider new ways of banking, and we continue to see strong demand for a broad array of digital solutions as a result. For example, total mobile subscribers across our leading digital platforms, mobility and architect, grew 15% in the quarter. Architect implementations continue at a strong pace. In fact, during the second half of the year, we completed more architect implementations than in all of 2019, an excellent indicator for future growth. Fiserv offerings such as remote data capture, have allowed our FI clients to offer safe, convenient and fast self-service check deposits for their consumer and commercial clients, while improving efficiency in their own results. Mobile deposits in Q4 grew 33% over prior year and were up more than 30% for the full year, while self-service ATM deposits grew more than 50% in both the quarter and full year. Adjusted operating income was up a strong 14% in the quarter to $271 million and grew 12% in the full year to $992 million. Adjusted operating margin in the segment increased a robust 590 basis points in the quarter to 36.5% on a combination of growth in processing revenue, operational effectiveness benefits and cost synergies. For the year, adjusted operating margin was up an impressive 510 basis points to 34.2%. And as the benefits of growth in processing revenue in our highly scaled business and the combination of both synergy and productivity gains more than offset the impact from lower periodic revenue. The payments and network segment saw internal revenue decline 1% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year as growth in our international issuer, card services and output solutions businesses, including the benefit of revenue synergies, was more than offset by COVID-driven impacts elsewhere in this segment. Internal revenue for the year was in line with the prior year. Debit transactions continue to show very stable levels of growth in the mid-single-digit range. We've seen this consistent mid- to high-single-digit transaction growth since June. And remain confident that this level is sustainable going forward. We continue to see excellent transaction growth in solutions, such as account-to-account and P2P. Zelle transactions in the quarter more than doubled compared to prior year and were up 18% sequentially. The number of clients live on Zelle has grown significantly this year, nearly tripling our client count compared to a year ago, and we expect continued strong growth in 2021 and beyond. Adjusted operating income for the segment was strong, up 5% to $660 million in the quarter, and was up 6% to $2.4 billion for the year. Adjusted operating margin was up 300 basis points to 46.4% in the quarter and was up 280 basis points to 43.3% for the year. The positive impact of both revenue and cost synergies drove our solid adjusted operating income results, both in the quarter and the full year. The adjusted corporate operating loss was $87 million in the fourth quarter and $404 million for the full year, a 5% improvement over last year. This improvement was driven by a combination of cost synergies and productivity as well as lower variable compensation, partially offset by incremental COVID costs. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 21.7% and 20.9% for the full year, down slightly from the prior year. For 2021, we expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate fairly consistent with the 2020 rate in the range of 21% to 22%. However, we do expect some variability in the rates by quarter, given different comparison points and the timing of discrete tax items. As such, we expect our Q1 2021 effective tax rate will be higher than Q1 last year. As previously communicated, our capital allocation priority for the second half of the year was to focus primarily on debt repayment. We repaid $740 million of debt in the quarter and $1.8 billion in the year. We also repurchased 1.8 million shares of stock for $200 million in the fourth quarter, bringing total capital allocated to share repurchase to $1.6 billion for the full year. We have 65.7 million shares authorized for repurchase as of December 31. In rounding out our top capital allocation priorities, as Frank mentioned earlier, in December, we announced the acquisition of the Ondot Systems and closed that acquisition in January. Total debt outstanding was $20.7 billion at December 31 and debt-to-adjusted EBITDA dropped to 3.6 times. We are well on track to achieve our targeted leverage in the second half of 2021 as we anticipate both strong adjusted EBITDA growth and some further debt repayment this year. As you heard us emphasize throughout our Investor Day in December, we are fully committed to our long-standing capital strategy, which includes maintaining a strong balance sheet, organic investment in innovative solutions and high-value acquisitions like Ondot. Importantly, share repurchase remains our benchmark for capital deployment. With that, let me turn the call back to Frank.\nFrank J. Bisignano: Thanks, Bob. We expect 2021 internal revenue growth to be 8% to 12% for the full year. This is modestly better at the bottom end of the range than our preliminary outlook we shared at our recent Investor Day. Given our current view of economic conditions, including the second stimulus in late December, and the prospect of a third stimulus package later this quarter, the significant growth rate acceleration relative to 2020 is driven by the multi-pronged impacts of our current expectations for an improving global economy, the overall continuing strength in our global Merchant Business, the cumulative impact of sales and implementation and continued achievement of in-year revenue synergies. We expect 2021 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $5.30 to $5.50, which is $0.05 above the range we provided at our Investor Day in December. The improvement is driven by the stronger exit rate from 2020 and the benefit of stimulus programs in the U.S. We expect adjusted operating margin to expand by at least 250 basis points. And free cash flow conversion will be greater than 108% for the year. Our internal revenue and adjusted EPS growth rate assumptions are grounded in our internal assumptions of when and how the economy will recover from the pandemic in 2021. The midpoint of our guidance generally assumes improvement of the pandemic and increased vaccinations throughout the first half of the year, leading to economic recovery in the second half. There are several factors that we believe will impact the quarterly cadence of the year-over-year growth rates, largely driven by lapping our 2020 performance, which included pre-pandemic performance for much of the first quarter, the depth of the impact in Q2 and then the start of improvement in the second half. Quarterly results may vary, including rates that may fall outside of the full year guidance range both on the low and high end for a particular quarter. We expect Q1 to be our toughest comparison and Q2, the most favorable comparison, then see more normalized comparisons for the second half of the year. Throughout this past year, every Fiserv associate was challenged to work differently, to reimagine how we do our jobs to serve our clients, who in turn were learning how to serve their customers. Faced with these challenges, I'm proud of our results. Across a number of measures, 2020 was a successful year. Our client satisfaction scores improved measurably during a time when our clients needed us the most. We saw our employee engagement scores improve even as we executed against a complex integration and through a pandemic. We meaningfully increased our synergy targets and accelerated the time to achieve those targets and then regress the integration of First Data to the verge of completion in 2021. And at the end of the day, your company achieved its 35th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Among the most important initiatives your company undertook was the creation of our Forward Together plan to be a force for positive change in our communities. Our Forward Together plan is a 4-part commitment to support and empower underrepresented associates, business owners and not-for-profits. A pillar of our Forward Together plan, the Back2Business program was launched last summer. As part of Back2Business, we committed to invest $10 million to support black and minority-owned business owners and entrepreneurs. We are well into that monetary commitment and are now meaningfully increasing it to $50 million. As a further indication of our commitment to continued progress in this important initiative, we recently appointed a senior executive as Head of Corporate Social responsibility to lead these efforts for Fiserv as well as oversee sustainability efforts for the organization. Fiserv was once again named a world's most admired company for the eighth consecutive year with excellent scores in people management, social responsibility and a host of other categories. This is well-deserved recognition of the more than 40,000 hardworking and caring Fiserv associates around the world. I will close by thanking all of them, for working relentlessly to serve our clients and you, our shareholders. With that, operator, let's open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nLisa Ellis: Hey, good afternoon. Good stuff guys. First question for me is on Carat. You called out 46 new enterprise wins in Merchant Acceptance this quarter. Can you describe how the launch of Carat is improving your value proposition in the enterprise space, and maybe give some color on some of the customer feedback you're getting on that offering?\nFrank J. Bisignano: Well, I think the strategic point around Carat is that we've integrated for ease of access globally, so although it could be utilized in many currencies in many countries, its multinational capabilities is resonating very, very well in the client's office. And that ease of access, its ability to optimize acceptance is really what's driving a very high win rate there. And the engineering underneath it was bringing to a single platform, a single instance and ability to execute globally. And as you've heard us talk about through the course of the year, the hundreds of wins that we've had institutionally, and those are in active, big names that are leaning into the commerce and economy. So it's resonated very well in the client's office, a lot of work done by the team to build it out and get it to be the platform that's winning in the market.\nLisa Ellis: Good stuff. My follow-up quick one is for Bob. Could you just give a little color on the segment level outlooks for 2021, and also what type of transaction growth or unit growth you're anticipating or is embedded in your outlook? Thank you.\nRobert W. Hau: Sure, Lisa. We don't give specific guidance by our individual segments, but let me try to give you a little bit of color to get you directionally. Obviously, if you look at our Merchant Acceptance segment, it represents about 40% of the overall company revenue. We had given during Investor Day, an expectation of mid-term or medium-term growth of about 9% to 12%. We certainly expect in 2021 to be above even the high end of that as we rebound/recover from what has certainly been a pretty difficult year and, in particular, in second quarter of 2020. Frank laid out a little bit of some of the key assumptions that we've got in our overall revenue and EPS growth for that matter. And it certainly plays a key part in the improvement, accelerated growth in the Merchant segment, things like having a large number of folks vaccinated, seeing some of the restrictions that are in place, particularly in Europe, but even across the United States, being lifted and seeing a recovery -- a general economic recovery in the second half of the year. If you look at the Fintech segment, very much impacted this year by periodic revenue. We've seen that really across the year, in particular, in the second half of the year, but even a little bit in the first half and overall impact this year. As we look to 2021, we see some of that persisting in Q1 and a bit into the second quarter. But by the time we get to the second half of the year, we see that headwind subsiding such that we would expect the Fintech segment, which has medium-term outlook of about 4% to 6%, to be in that range for the full year 2021. And we're not counting on a recovery or a rebound of a periodic revenue/termination fees. It's really that we lap the pretty significant decline we've had over the last several quarters, and it doesn't continue. And so we'll see benefit really in the second half of 2021. And then the final segment, the Payments segment, again, about the other 40% of the overall company. Medium-term guidance here was 5% to 8%. I would expect this segment to probably be at the upper end of that range in 2021, as we see transaction growth improve kind of post-COVID, in particular, in our bill pay business, some of our prepaids and, of course, as you know, we have a leading position in retail private label. And as those retailers improve, again, particularly in the second half of the year, we'll see some improvement. And of course, you certainly heard us talk about some very significant wins in our issuer processing business in this segment. The very large ones that we talked about during the last earnings call really won't provide much lift in 2021. But there are quite a few below those top three. It don't take quite as long to implement, and you'll see some of those come on into 2021, and again, provide some nice growth into that business, into that segment. And the last driver of that business, I'd probably point to is Zelle. As I mentioned on my prepared remarks, nearly a tripling number of FIs on Zelle through Fiserv and not only do we see that continuing to grow, but also more and more consumers choosing a bank-centric P2P network and seeing more transaction volume. So that gives us some confidence that we'll be kind of in the upper end of the mid-term range of 5% to 8%. And the last thing I'd point, Lisa, is we're going to see some probably unique variation in the growth rates by quarter. Again, Frank talked a little bit about this in his prepared remarks. Q1, as you recall, in 2020, was essentially COVID-free for, call it, roughly 10 of the 13 weeks of the first quarter. And we had, had a very strong first quarter until COVID hit really at the latter part of March and, obviously, very significantly in Q2. So I would expect Q1 to not only be our lowest point in the quarter in terms of growth rate year-over-year, but actually probably be below the guidance range with a rebound and the opposite take place in the second quarter when you have much easier comps, will be on the -- above the upper end of our guidance range. Such that by the time we exit the first half of the year, we're trading in that -- within the overall internal revenue growth and EPS guidance range on the first half basis and be set nicely for the second half.\nLisa Ellis: Fantastic color. Thank you very much.\nRobert W. Hau: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dave Koning from Baird. Your line is open.\nDave Koning: Hey, guys. Great year.\nRobert W. Hau: Thanks, David.\nDave Koning: Yeah. Yeah, I guess first of all, I guess, sort of a similar question just on margin expansion by segment. I know you don't give a lot of color on this, but the Merchant segment was the one that was actually still down year-over-year for margins in 2020, where the other two nicely expanded. So should we expect as revenues come back in that segment for that one probably to be the most benefited by margin expansion than the other two closer to the guidance range?\nRobert W. Hau: Yeah, you're probably not too far off in that thinking. You hit the issue right on the head. Obviously, we had an extremely difficult second quarter. Both in terms of revenue and margin in that segment, really nice recovery sequentially in the second half of the year. And so we head into 2021 in much better position than we did in the first half, so we'll see some nice improvement. Again, you'll get the benefit of the comparison point in second quarter of 2021. Overall, I would say, when we closed the books, 12 months from now, we're on this call, I would expect margin expansion in all three segments and probably a bigger lift out of Merchant Acceptance business.\nDave Koning: Got you. Thanks. And then just a follow-up, one thing you don't talk a lot about is the equity income line. It's about 5% of total profits. But I would imagine that got hit pretty hard this year, just the bank JVs and stuff and might correlate more with the Merchant segment, so it would probably be up more than just the average business. I don't know if that's a good way to think about it, but I just wonder if there's any context around the equity income line.\nRobert W. Hau: No, actually, I think that's exactly the way to think about it. And you're right, that's the largest portion of that is the Merchant joint ventures. And as we see the Merchant business overall recover, I'd expect to see the joint ventures participate in that and help with that equity line.\nDave Koning: Awesome. Thanks guys.\nRobert W. Hau: Thank you, David.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey from Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Hi. Good afternoon. Appreciate you taking the question. My question is really around a couple of, I guess, tech-enabled initiatives, generally in Merchant. I'm thinking about e-comm and the enterprise e-comm business and also omni generally, great KPIs in terms of volume. Bob, can you speak to yield contribution, and also maybe even Clover? I assume these are higher-yielding transactions. And given the growth rates should blend up acceptance organic revenue growth, all things considered, I'm just trying to think about order of magnitude and impact from your tech-enabled business generally.\nRobert W. Hau: Yes. Certainly, you're on the right track. Clover, with obviously heavy exposure in SMBs, generally has higher yield. And in general, tech-enabled does. Certainly, the thing to consider though is that was a big element of the growth in 2020. And so you don't necessarily see a massive acceleration of that because that was actually one of the things that helped the overall growth rate of the Merchant segment. As small businesses and retail broadly shut down again, particularly in the second quarter, people moved to tech-enabled e-commerce type transactions. And you heard us report very strong growth throughout the year in overall Clover volume. We'll obviously see that continue. But as a percent of the overall share of activity within the Merchant segment, you won't necessarily see a big change overall. So the margin improvement really is driven by continued productivity, scale business benefit as well as synergy benefits.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And just as a quick follow-up, Frank, you called out the bank channel, which is a part of your distribution network that I know you know very well, spent a lot of time on. Lots of new banks, do you feel like you can get adequate productivity out of that channel long term, especially as it relates to SMB merchant acquiring or acceptance?\nFrank J. Bisignano: Yeah. I think, yes. It's 100%, yes. And I would think about, it in multiple ways. One, I would think about the bank channel itself. The other I think about, distribution partners also. You've seen us announce Verizon, Paychex, Deluxe. So these are contact points where, in fact, they're touching SMBs. And they think they'll enhance their relationship with the SMB, through a Clover offering. I mean, you see Verizon, packaging us in their offering now. So, I'd like to take a broader perspective on the partnership. And then, we could drop down to what we're doing with our bank partners. And because we have these privileged relationships in the core, the ability to brand feels very, very good and very strong. Will it have the same margin as our fabulous Carat offering? The answer would be no. But if you think about our ability to deliver and grow merchants throughout the country, it's very, very high and very powerful. In some of the cases, it's just penetrating their base. It gives them a new offering into their base. Our ability to do it digitally is much higher than it would have been two or three years ago. So completely accretive and is fundamentally our responsibility with our bank partners to do this, to bring them the possibility. And it's actually a revenue generator for them also. So, from that perspective, it's good for our partnerships. It deepens it. We're building integrated stacks that caused them to have a better relationship with their client also.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nDarrin Peller: All right. Hey, guys. Thanks. I want to circle back to Clover for a minute, because we've done a lot of work on it recently. Again, it was up 25%, as you guys said. And combined with other KPIs, like the omni KPI, I think, 100%, it would seem that your market share position is up year-over-year. And so I'm curious if you can give us a sense of the -- like the growth, if there was growth in the number of mids -- or the number of the merchant count year-over-year, when you couple that in the SMB side together with the -- with both domestic and international and even the enterprise side sounded strong. So really just more than volume growth and revenue growth, I'd be curious to hear anything you can share about number of merchants and the experience in the SMB side versus enterprise.\nFrank J. Bisignano: Well, why don't I talk to you a little bit about the strategy behind it, and why that growth is happening? And it really is about market share gains. Its market share gains in the ISV space. Its market share gains in the e-comm space. And then, its market share gains on the SMB. And really, Clover has played a significant role in that. I mean, back to the question about bank partnerships and bank distributions, that's one avenue for us. So what we've seen is growth in all of those. And if you think about, what's happened and the question one might ask is, how has your business performed as it has. It's because of the fabulous client base we have, in general. And then secondarily, us having invested heavily before we got here, actually in '17, '18 and through '19, we had a good strong industry-leading growth rate through '19. And then the combination of the two companies allowed us to be able to grow all facets of this. And I would say, when you look at it, it's growth across all of it; across SMB in every manner, shape and form; across ISVs as we didn't have a big position, and we continue to grow that out, and that will continue that pipeline is strong; and then bringing us into really Carat offering to our large institutional clients. So it is about market share gains.\nDarrin Peller: Okay. And then just my quick follow-up is on the capital allocation. I know we left your Investor Day looking forward to maybe $5 billion potential or even $5 billion to $6 billion of potential capital allocation potential per year. When we think about your appetite right now, Frank or Bob, when we think about coming out of this blackout period pre earnings, should we expect that you guys see the stock as undervalued like many of your investors do that you'd be proactive about it now going forward from here? And just to remind us, is that right, the right way to think about it where there's maybe as much as $4 billion to $6 billion or $5 billion to $6 billion of potential? Or maybe just between buybacks and deleveraging? Thanks.\nRobert W. Hau: Yes, Darrin. I think the $5 billion to $6 billion, I assume you're getting we -- during Investor Day, talked about $30 billion of capital available over the next five years. We certainly expect very good free cash flow into 2021. We had a great 2020 and see that continuing this year. And certainly, we continue to focus on capital deployment through the eyes or through the lens of share repurchase. We certainly would tell you that where the share price is today. We're a buyer. And I don't think you'll find many CFOs that tell you otherwise, but we're certainly trading below 52-week high. And given where we see 2021's results and where valuations have moved, we think there's a real opportunity. And so you'll see us continue to be active. We pretty much are in the market every quarter. I think we have been, for the five years, I've been here other than when we suspended for a couple of quarters post announcing the merger with First Data, and we'll continue to do that. We do have some debt to pay down with the balance of this year. But I'm a big believer of \"the genius of the end.\" And like we did in 2020, we'll pay down some debt, we'll buy back some shares, and we'll do some acquisitions. And we'll continue to do that aggressively across the company. Frank, you want to add anything?\nFrank J. Bisignano: No. I think as we laid out in Investor Day, and even if you look at what we've done over the past year and changed, you see a very balanced approach. We'll buy back shares or pay down debt, and we'll strategically acquire assets.\nDarrin Peller: Got it. Thank you guys.\nRobert W. Hau: Thanks, Darrin.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Cantwell from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.\nJeff Cantwell: Hi. Good afternoon. And thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask you about the Ondot acquisition. Can you talk a little bit about the fit there now that Ondot is part of the team? It sounds like it's a very nice business, have some good scale to it. It sounds like it's a modern platform. So it seems like it's going to be a nice addition. Can you tell us a little bit more about that? And then how can Ondot be enhanced, if that's the right word for it, by becoming part of Fiserv full time? In other words, what are the future synergies or the future opportunities you see there on a combined basis now that it's onboard? Any color there would be great. Thanks very much.\nFrank J. Bisignano: Yes. First of all, we know Ondot very well for a long time, had a great relationship. And the -- one of the founders actually came over to our company earlier. And so we -- and then we had always had a deep relationship with management. So I'd consider this a company we knew very well. And we could strategically think about how to integrate platforms. I think we always view it as the leading card-enablement platform for virtual access. But when you bring it inside to the company, our excitement and the founder's excitement are that we can do something much larger than they could have done on their own. And if you think about the Clover acquisition and what it turned into, there's great similarities. Of course, this is a much larger enterprise. We definitely increased our digital DNA inside the company. It will be a complement to our Sunnyvale -- large Sunnyvale presence with Clover and then with us sitting up a Chief Digital and Data Officer, the ability to ultimately take debit, credit, core banking and give our financial institutions the opportunity to have one click for their clients to get to all of that data is really where we're taking it. We've already inked a first win as a new company, a large name institution. So we feel great about it. I think we knew it well, so it was easy to integrate, and we are deep in integration meetings weekly and driving the top-line. And I think you could look forward to us having large growth and digital presence through its acquisition.\nJeff Cantwell: Okay. I appreciate the color. I'm excited to see what you stating. Thanks very much.\nFrank J. Bisignano: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Togut from Evercore ISI.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. Looking at the $500 million innovation fund you announced at the time of acquiring First Data, could you address how much of that innovation spending you expect to occur this year? What's built into the adjusted operating margin expansion target of at least 250 basis points? And then are there any call-outs on specific new product innovations that we should watch out for in the next 12 months?\nFrank J. Bisignano: Well, thank you for that. And so we had talked about a year ago or so. We had created a number of working groups within the company to begin the generation of where these next ideas for innovation would come. And the output product of that actually was the ending up of creating a Chief Digital and Data Officer within the company. And that would have a structure to allow us to deploy the $500 million. Of course, we already have begun that, and begin to do it in a way that will accelerate growth as we go forward. Now if you go back to Investor Day, we had talked about the $500 million was in our outlook that we had given you. But there was nothing on the top line for it and we're already spending it. So I think what you can find today is a set of initiatives, a series of projects being deployed, a structure built inside the company with a Chief Digital and Data Officer to be able to help it move forward in a manner that is across the whole company. And so I would think as we get into the second half of this year and you move into next year, you'll start seeing these digital and data initiatives, which ultimately will roll into the P&L on the top. And so Ondot isn't viewed as part of the 500, but the capability it brings will allow us to move at a faster rate on many of the digital and data innovations. And what I'd say, connecting the white space between the four pillars of our business to allow us to unlock opportunity for our clients. Bob, anything you want to add?\nRobert W. Hau: Yeah, Dave, in terms of spending this year, certainly fully encompassed in our overall guidance and gets us still the 20% or 24% EPS growth and at least 250 basis point margin improvement. There will be some incremental spend this year, of course, recall this is a fair amount of development. And so a portion of this gets capitalized, drawn on the balance sheet and comes over time. And so it isn't necessarily a big increase year-over-year and, again, certainly fully encompassed in our overall guidance.\nDavid Togut: Thank you very much.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Thank you so much. Just one question on new sales. I know up 19% I think, in the fourth quarter, 22% for the year. I'm curious, how you feel about the new sales outlook? Or what kind of targets you set internally for fiscal 2021? Do you feel good about compounding at that SMO level?\nFrank J. Bisignano: Yeah. I mean we had talked about during the course of last year and through Investor Day that we see ourselves being close to a 20% sales growth company in terms of institutional sales because that's what we're really talking about there. So -- and January is off to a really good start. So I feel really good about January. So that's where I got to start thinking about it. And the pipeline of opportunities is robust. So I mean, it is a very well-received integrated model in the client's office. And so -- and then with our client stats going up, I think that bodes very well. Our employee engagement going up inside the company, while we protected them in this very tough time, so I think we feel very good about what's going to happen during the course of this year around that.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Excellent. Thank you.\nFrank J. Bisignano: Well, I'd like to thank everybody for joining us this afternoon. We tremendously appreciate your support. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to contact us, and have a great evening. Thank you for your time.\nOperator: [Operator Closing Remarks]",

            "name": "Frank J. Bisignano",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter, and good afternoon, everyone. 2020 was unprecedented on many levels. We started the year strong. And after entering the pandemic, we continued investing heavily in technology, innovation, our client franchise and our people. We've now entered 2021 with tremendous momentum. Your company performed very well given the circumstances across a number of facets of our business. Our 22% sales growth for the year demonstrates that we're clearly winning in the client's office. We strengthened our client franchise, raising our client satisfaction scores across all measures. We invest in our people platform, resulting in top quartile engagement scores among companies in the Fortune 500. We made outstanding progress on integration. We accelerated and increased synergy execution while ramping our investment in innovative products and solutions. We delivered 12% adjusted earnings-per-share growth for the year, marking our 35th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth, and we delivered record free cash flow. We are exiting the year stronger than we entered, and we're well positioned to capitalize on our momentum in 2021 and beyond. Let me provide a brief overview of our financial results in the quarter, and Bob will provide more detail later on the call. Total company internal revenue growth was 1%. That performance was led by our Merchant Acceptance segments, which was up 3%, a strong result in light of the global pandemic. Total company adjusted operating margin for the quarter was up 420 basis points and adjusted earnings per share increased 16%. Free cash flow was again excellent, coming in at $1.1 billion in the quarter, bringing free cash flow for the full year to more than $3.6 billion. Our sales momentum remains quite strong. Fourth quarter sales were up 19%, with terrific results in our credit processing, merchant acquiring and account processing businesses. Sales for the full year were up an impressive 22%. The combination of robust sales and excellent pipeline into 2021 is evidence that our formula of bringing the strength and breadth of Fiserv's offerings together with our integrated sales model is extremely well received in the client's office and bodes well for the future. Now I'd like to update you on how our leading digital-enabled merchant business is performing. Through Clover, our leading SMB platform; Carat, our enterprise omni-channel commerce solution; and Clover Connect, our rich ISV solution set, we continue to drive innovation, expand partnerships and deliver leading solutions to our merchant clients. The momentum within the digital-enabled segments of the merchant business continues to be excellent. Clover's gross payment volume grew 25% to $34 billion in the quarter or $135 billion annualized. We continue to extend the breadth of services to clover merchants with innovative solutions that enhance convenience, especially in the digital segment. For example, we recently introduced invoicing capabilities that allow Clover merchants, especially those in the services vertical, to build and collect payments from consumers electronically. Carat. So our continued growth with global e-commerce transaction is up about 25% both in the quarter and for the full year. We saw our omni-channel transactions, such as order-ahead and pick up in store, grow more than 125% year-over-year with some of our best-known quick service restaurant clients seeing excellent growth. We continue to capture market share winning 46 new enterprise-level e-comm clients in the fourth quarter, including digital acquiring for Overstock.com and Wingstop in North America. In Europe, we signed Total, one of the largest energy providers in the world to provide global digital payment acceptance services across more than 100 countries around the world. We also expanded employer relationships, delivering new products and services to key clients such as Lyft, where we are now powering disbursements to drivers. Clover Connect allows us to win new partnerships and drive growth in our partner solutions business. In the fourth quarter, we signed 44 new ISV partners, bringing us to 176 new ISVs signed for the year. Those new partner relationships are driving strong results in active merchants, up 43% in Q4. And strong revenue growth in the ISV channel. For example, during the quarter, Fiserv signed a strategic partnership agreement with RFMS, the largest provider of software services for floor installation professionals to provide omni-channel payment capabilities to their flooring customers. We also signed one of the largest providers of eye care products and technology to provide payment acceptance services to its more than 7,000 eye care professional customers. To further expand our value-added services for merchants, Fiserv and Citizens Financial Group have partnered to offer merchants a new suite of lending solutions at the point-of-sale through Citizens Pay, providing merchants with flexible payment options for customers to finance purchases at the point of sale. The program expands a partnership we've had with Citizen since 2015 to provide new financing options. And we expect it to drive adoption in the fast-growing buy now, pay later space. Moving to account processing business. We continue to expand the number of privileged relationships we have in our account processing business across financial institutions of all sizes and types. We signed 19 new core account processing clients in the quarter, including five on the DNA platform, bringing the total to 60 for the year with 25 on DNA. I'd like to highlight a few of our recent wins. Service First, a commercial bank with more than $11 billion in assets, signed on for a full suite of Fiserv products including core processing, card services and output solutions. Lakeside Bank, a full-service bank with more than $2 billion in assets, signed on for our core processing, along with a robust suite of solutions that includes CheckFree, debit card services and Zelle. I'm also pleased that just recently, Republic Bank has partnered with Fiserv for core processing plus a rich suite of digital and payment solutions. Republic is a $5 billion asset, full-service retail and commercial bank that was voted the #1 Bank in America for Service by Forbes in 2020. All of these illustrative wins were competitive takeaways with a common characteristic. They selected a leading core platform plus multiple surround digital solutions to support their goals of sustained growth and superior customer service. I'm also pleased to note that we signed three more de novo banks in the quarter. In our payment and network segment, we continue to see robust sales activity, including several notable card production and personalization wins. We gained a new agreement with Capital One to add Cap One's more than 1,500 ATMs to Fiserv's Money Pass ATM network, while offering their customers access to thousands of additional surcharge-free ATMs across the country. And I'm pleased to note that we expanded our long-standing partnership with PayPal, signing a deal in the quarter to integrate PayPal as a bill payment option for five share billers, a notable synergy sale. With that, let me update you on our integration efforts. At Investor Day, we discussed how our integration continues to go extraordinarily well and our synergy execution is far ahead of original schedule. Through December 31, we've already actioned over $1 billion of cost savings and are well on our way to fully action a $1.2 billion cost synergies by the end of this year. We entered 2021 with the majority of the integration work behind us and a focus on driving further growth and sustainable value in the years ahead. On the revenue side, we're pleased with the level of synergy sales, which accelerated in the fourth quarter. As of year-end, we've already actioned $215 million in annualized revenue synergies, and our synergy sales pipeline is growing robustly. Giving us confidence in meeting or exceeding our $600 million target. Our bank merchant program continues to be one of the larger synergy opportunity and offers financial institutions of all sizes and ability to offer their important merchant clients a modern suite of merchant acquiring capabilities including the innovative Clover platform, along with digital capabilities like loyalty programs and e-comm solutions. In the fourth quarter, we added 45 new bank merchant clients, bringing the total to 231 new clients since the merger, with more than half of those wins competitive takeaways. The pipeline into 2021 remains robust with over 500 financial institutions, prompting our continued confidence in achieving a sizable revenue synergy opportunity. One final point on our digital initiatives before turning it over to Bob. As you've heard us discuss in the past, one of the most important strategic initiatives is to redefine the client experience by utilizing the latest technology to drive innovation and offer digital capabilities across our payments ecosystem. We've taken two important steps in the last 60 days in this area. First, we acquired Ondot Systems, the leading digital card services platform for financial institutions of all sizes. We're committed to deploying capital, both organically and inorganically, to develop the digital and data next generational solutions that will drive growth long into the future. And second, further demonstrating our commitment to leadership in this area, we appointed a Chief Digital and Data Officer to lead these important strategic growth initiatives across all of Fiserv. Now let me pass the discussion to Bob for more detail on the financial results. Thanks, Bob. We expect 2021 internal revenue growth to be 8% to 12% for the full year. This is modestly better at the bottom end of the range than our preliminary outlook we shared at our recent Investor Day. Given our current view of economic conditions, including the second stimulus in late December, and the prospect of a third stimulus package later this quarter, the significant growth rate acceleration relative to 2020 is driven by the multi-pronged impacts of our current expectations for an improving global economy, the overall continuing strength in our global Merchant Business, the cumulative impact of sales and implementation and continued achievement of in-year revenue synergies. We expect 2021 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $5.30 to $5.50, which is $0.05 above the range we provided at our Investor Day in December. The improvement is driven by the stronger exit rate from 2020 and the benefit of stimulus programs in the U.S. We expect adjusted operating margin to expand by at least 250 basis points. And free cash flow conversion will be greater than 108% for the year. Our internal revenue and adjusted EPS growth rate assumptions are grounded in our internal assumptions of when and how the economy will recover from the pandemic in 2021. The midpoint of our guidance generally assumes improvement of the pandemic and increased vaccinations throughout the first half of the year, leading to economic recovery in the second half. There are several factors that we believe will impact the quarterly cadence of the year-over-year growth rates, largely driven by lapping our 2020 performance, which included pre-pandemic performance for much of the first quarter, the depth of the impact in Q2 and then the start of improvement in the second half. Quarterly results may vary, including rates that may fall outside of the full year guidance range both on the low and high end for a particular quarter. We expect Q1 to be our toughest comparison and Q2, the most favorable comparison, then see more normalized comparisons for the second half of the year. Throughout this past year, every Fiserv associate was challenged to work differently, to reimagine how we do our jobs to serve our clients, who in turn were learning how to serve their customers. Faced with these challenges, I'm proud of our results. Across a number of measures, 2020 was a successful year. Our client satisfaction scores improved measurably during a time when our clients needed us the most. We saw our employee engagement scores improve even as we executed against a complex integration and through a pandemic. We meaningfully increased our synergy targets and accelerated the time to achieve those targets and then regress the integration of First Data to the verge of completion in 2021. And at the end of the day, your company achieved its 35th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Among the most important initiatives your company undertook was the creation of our Forward Together plan to be a force for positive change in our communities. Our Forward Together plan is a 4-part commitment to support and empower underrepresented associates, business owners and not-for-profits. A pillar of our Forward Together plan, the Back2Business program was launched last summer. As part of Back2Business, we committed to invest $10 million to support black and minority-owned business owners and entrepreneurs. We are well into that monetary commitment and are now meaningfully increasing it to $50 million. As a further indication of our commitment to continued progress in this important initiative, we recently appointed a senior executive as Head of Corporate Social responsibility to lead these efforts for Fiserv as well as oversee sustainability efforts for the organization. Fiserv was once again named a world's most admired company for the eighth consecutive year with excellent scores in people management, social responsibility and a host of other categories. This is well-deserved recognition of the more than 40,000 hardworking and caring Fiserv associates around the world. I will close by thanking all of them, for working relentlessly to serve our clients and you, our shareholders. With that, operator, let's open the line for questions. Well, I think the strategic point around Carat is that we've integrated for ease of access globally, so although it could be utilized in many currencies in many countries, its multinational capabilities is resonating very, very well in the client's office. And that ease of access, its ability to optimize acceptance is really what's driving a very high win rate there. And the engineering underneath it was bringing to a single platform, a single instance and ability to execute globally. And as you've heard us talk about through the course of the year, the hundreds of wins that we've had institutionally, and those are in active, big names that are leaning into the commerce and economy. So it's resonated very well in the client's office, a lot of work done by the team to build it out and get it to be the platform that's winning in the market. Yeah. I think, yes. It's 100%, yes. And I would think about, it in multiple ways. One, I would think about the bank channel itself. The other I think about, distribution partners also. You've seen us announce Verizon, Paychex, Deluxe. So these are contact points where, in fact, they're touching SMBs. And they think they'll enhance their relationship with the SMB, through a Clover offering. I mean, you see Verizon, packaging us in their offering now. So, I'd like to take a broader perspective on the partnership. And then, we could drop down to what we're doing with our bank partners. And because we have these privileged relationships in the core, the ability to brand feels very, very good and very strong. Will it have the same margin as our fabulous Carat offering? The answer would be no. But if you think about our ability to deliver and grow merchants throughout the country, it's very, very high and very powerful. In some of the cases, it's just penetrating their base. It gives them a new offering into their base. Our ability to do it digitally is much higher than it would have been two or three years ago. So completely accretive and is fundamentally our responsibility with our bank partners to do this, to bring them the possibility. And it's actually a revenue generator for them also. So, from that perspective, it's good for our partnerships. It deepens it. We're building integrated stacks that caused them to have a better relationship with their client also. Well, why don't I talk to you a little bit about the strategy behind it, and why that growth is happening? And it really is about market share gains. Its market share gains in the ISV space. Its market share gains in the e-comm space. And then, its market share gains on the SMB. And really, Clover has played a significant role in that. I mean, back to the question about bank partnerships and bank distributions, that's one avenue for us. So what we've seen is growth in all of those.

So it is about market share gains. No. I think as we laid out in Investor Day, and even if you look at what we've done over the past year and changed, you see a very balanced approach. We'll buy back shares or pay down debt, and we'll strategically acquire assets. Yes. First of all, we know Ondot very well for a long time, had a great relationship. And the -- one of the founders actually came over to our company earlier. And so we -- and then we had always had a deep relationship with management. So I'd consider this a company we knew very well. And we could strategically think about how to integrate platforms.

I think we knew it well, so it was easy to integrate, and we are deep in integration meetings weekly and driving the top-line.

And what I'd say, connecting the white space between the four pillars of our business to allow us to unlock opportunity for our clients. Bob, anything you want to add? Yeah. I mean we had talked about during the course of last year and through Investor Day that we see ourselves being close to a 20% sales growth company in terms of institutional sales because that's what we're really talking about there. So -- and January is off to a really good start. So I feel really good about January. So that's where I got to start thinking about it. And the pipeline of opportunities is robust. So I mean, it is a very well-received integrated model in the client's office. And so -- and then with our client stats going up, I think that bodes very well. Our employee engagement going up inside the company, while we protected them in this very tough time, so I think we feel very good about what's going to happen during the course of this year around that. Well, I'd like to thank everybody for joining us this afternoon. We tremendously appreciate your support. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to contact us, and have a great evening. Thank you for your time."

            "name": "Robert W. Hau",
            "content": "Thank you, Frank, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a strong fourth quarter in light of continued pressure from the pandemic across the globe. Total company internal revenue growth was 1% in the quarter, led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 3%. For the full year, internal revenue was flat versus last year, in line with our expectations that we communicated during our last earnings call. Growth from revenue synergies, which were $46 million in the quarter and $160 million for the year, helps mitigate the impact from continued pressure related to the pandemic. During our last earnings call, we shared that we saw transaction growth rates stabilize at or around July levels. In the fourth quarter, our transaction and payment volume growth rates remain relatively in line with what we saw in the third quarter. Fourth quarter adjusted operating income was up a strong 10% to $1.3 billion and adjusted operating margin increased by a very strong 420 basis points to 35.6%, driven by our rigorous cost synergy, execution, which produced $177 million of incremental cost synergies in the quarter as well as strong operating performance. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased by 2% to $4.4 billion, and adjusted operating margin increased 170 basis points to 31.4%, benefiting from $581 million of incremental cost synergies in the year and excellent operational performance. The fact that we improved our margin by 170 basis points to the worst economic cycle in memory is a strong validation of the robust quality and resilience of our business. And since most of the cost actions in 2020 were focused on permanent synergy achievement, not short-term cost savings, we believe our adjusted operating margin improvements are sustainable and expect continued strong improvements in 2021 and beyond. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 16% to $1.30 compared to $1.12 in the prior year, as adjusted for divestitures. Adjusted earnings per share for the full year increased 12% to $4.42, ahead of our prior expectations. Free cash flow in the quarter was once again very strong at $1.1 billion. For the full year, free cash flow increased 11% to more than $3.6 billion. Free cash flow conversion was also very strong at 119% for the fourth quarter and 121% for the full year. Turning to each of the segments. Internal revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was 3% in the quarter, an impressive result given the headwinds faced from economy that was hampered by the pandemic. Our results were once again driven by strong performances in our portfolio SMB clients, supported by our Clover platform, enterprise clients supported by Carat and another strong quarter from our ISV business. For the full year, internal revenue is in line with the prior year. As Frank discussed, our Clover GPV continues to grow very nicely, up 25% in the quarter despite the difficult macroeconomic environment for SMBs. We feel great about the strength of that portfolio in 2020 and even better about its performance in the months and quarters ahead as we get beyond the pandemic. Our integrated payments, or ISV business, continues to perform extremely well with continued strong revenue growth in the quarter. As we discussed at our Investor Day, we recently rolled out Clover Connect, a Clover integrated solution for ISVs. We believe that this solution will further extend our differentiation for ISVs and their merchant customers and continue to drive excellent growth in the future. Adjusted operating income in the aerospace -- excuse me, in the Acceptance segment increased 8% to $443 million in the quarter. Adjusted operating margin was up 280 basis points in the quarter to 30.7% and increased 150 basis points sequentially. On our Q2 earnings call, after reporting our COVID impact at low point for our Acceptance financial results, we said the segment's adjusted operating margin was expected to improve by more than 800 basis points in the second half of 2020 compared to the first half. We're pleased to achieve that with our second half acceptance margin of nearly 1,000 basis points, bringing our full year margin to 25.4%. The Fintech segment internal revenue declined 1% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year as growth in high-quality recurring revenue was again offset by much lower periodic revenue, most prominently, termination fees, which created approximately 350 basis points of headwind to internal revenue growth in the quarter. For the full year, internal revenue was in line with the prior year. The shift toward digital banking took a strong step forward in 2020 with lockdowns leading consumers and businesses alike to consider new ways of banking, and we continue to see strong demand for a broad array of digital solutions as a result. For example, total mobile subscribers across our leading digital platforms, mobility and architect, grew 15% in the quarter. Architect implementations continue at a strong pace. In fact, during the second half of the year, we completed more architect implementations than in all of 2019, an excellent indicator for future growth. Fiserv offerings such as remote data capture, have allowed our FI clients to offer safe, convenient and fast self-service check deposits for their consumer and commercial clients, while improving efficiency in their own results. Mobile deposits in Q4 grew 33% over prior year and were up more than 30% for the full year, while self-service ATM deposits grew more than 50% in both the quarter and full year. Adjusted operating income was up a strong 14% in the quarter to $271 million and grew 12% in the full year to $992 million. Adjusted operating margin in the segment increased a robust 590 basis points in the quarter to 36.5% on a combination of growth in processing revenue, operational effectiveness benefits and cost synergies. For the year, adjusted operating margin was up an impressive 510 basis points to 34.2%. And as the benefits of growth in processing revenue in our highly scaled business and the combination of both synergy and productivity gains more than offset the impact from lower periodic revenue. The payments and network segment saw internal revenue decline 1% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year as growth in our international issuer, card services and output solutions businesses, including the benefit of revenue synergies, was more than offset by COVID-driven impacts elsewhere in this segment. Internal revenue for the year was in line with the prior year. Debit transactions continue to show very stable levels of growth in the mid-single-digit range. We've seen this consistent mid- to high-single-digit transaction growth since June. And remain confident that this level is sustainable going forward. We continue to see excellent transaction growth in solutions, such as account-to-account and P2P. Zelle transactions in the quarter more than doubled compared to prior year and were up 18% sequentially. The number of clients live on Zelle has grown significantly this year, nearly tripling our client count compared to a year ago, and we expect continued strong growth in 2021 and beyond. Adjusted operating income for the segment was strong, up 5% to $660 million in the quarter, and was up 6% to $2.4 billion for the year. Adjusted operating margin was up 300 basis points to 46.4% in the quarter and was up 280 basis points to 43.3% for the year. The positive impact of both revenue and cost synergies drove our solid adjusted operating income results, both in the quarter and the full year. The adjusted corporate operating loss was $87 million in the fourth quarter and $404 million for the full year, a 5% improvement over last year. This improvement was driven by a combination of cost synergies and productivity as well as lower variable compensation, partially offset by incremental COVID costs. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 21.7% and 20.9% for the full year, down slightly from the prior year. For 2021, we expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate fairly consistent with the 2020 rate in the range of 21% to 22%. However, we do expect some variability in the rates by quarter, given different comparison points and the timing of discrete tax items. As such, we expect our Q1 2021 effective tax rate will be higher than Q1 last year. As previously communicated, our capital allocation priority for the second half of the year was to focus primarily on debt repayment. We repaid $740 million of debt in the quarter and $1.8 billion in the year. We also repurchased 1.8 million shares of stock for $200 million in the fourth quarter, bringing total capital allocated to share repurchase to $1.6 billion for the full year. We have 65.7 million shares authorized for repurchase as of December 31. In rounding out our top capital allocation priorities, as Frank mentioned earlier, in December, we announced the acquisition of the Ondot Systems and closed that acquisition in January. Total debt outstanding was $20.7 billion at December 31 and debt-to-adjusted EBITDA dropped to 3.6 times. We are well on track to achieve our targeted leverage in the second half of 2021 as we anticipate both strong adjusted EBITDA growth and some further debt repayment this year. As you heard us emphasize throughout our Investor Day in December, we are fully committed to our long-standing capital strategy, which includes maintaining a strong balance sheet, organic investment in innovative solutions and high-value acquisitions like Ondot. Importantly, share repurchase remains our benchmark for capital deployment. With that, let me turn the call back to Frank. Sure, Lisa. We don't give specific guidance by our individual segments, but let me try to give you a little bit of color to get you directionally. Obviously, if you look at our Merchant Acceptance segment, it represents about 40% of the overall company revenue. We had given during Investor Day, an expectation of mid-term or medium-term growth of about 9% to 12%. We certainly expect in 2021 to be above even the high end of that as we rebound/recover from what has certainly been a pretty difficult year and, in particular, in second quarter of 2020. Frank laid out a little bit of some of the key assumptions that we've got in our overall revenue and EPS growth for that matter. And it certainly plays a key part in the improvement, accelerated growth in the Merchant segment, things like having a large number of folks vaccinated, seeing some of the restrictions that are in place, particularly in Europe, but even across the United States, being lifted and seeing a recovery -- a general economic recovery in the second half of the year. If you look at the Fintech segment, very much impacted this year by periodic revenue. We've seen that really across the year, in particular, in the second half of the year, but even a little bit in the first half and overall impact this year. As we look to 2021, we see some of that persisting in Q1 and a bit into the second quarter. But by the time we get to the second half of the year, we see that headwind subsiding such that we would expect the Fintech segment, which has medium-term outlook of about 4% to 6%, to be in that range for the full year 2021. And we're not counting on a recovery or a rebound of a periodic revenue/termination fees. It's really that we lap the pretty significant decline we've had over the last several quarters, and it doesn't continue. And so we'll see benefit really in the second half of 2021. And then the final segment, the Payments segment, again, about the other 40% of the overall company. Medium-term guidance here was 5% to 8%. I would expect this segment to probably be at the upper end of that range in 2021, as we see transaction growth improve kind of post-COVID, in particular, in our bill pay business, some of our prepaids and, of course, as you know, we have a leading position in retail private label. And as those retailers improve, again, particularly in the second half of the year, we'll see some improvement. And of course, you certainly heard us talk about some very significant wins in our issuer processing business in this segment. The very large ones that we talked about during the last earnings call really won't provide much lift in 2021. But there are quite a few below those top three. It don't take quite as long to implement, and you'll see some of those come on into 2021, and again, provide some nice growth into that business, into that segment. And the last driver of that business, I'd probably point to is Zelle. As I mentioned on my prepared remarks, nearly a tripling number of FIs on Zelle through Fiserv and not only do we see that continuing to grow, but also more and more consumers choosing a bank-centric P2P network and seeing more transaction volume. So that gives us some confidence that we'll be kind of in the upper end of the mid-term range of 5% to 8%. And the last thing I'd point, Lisa, is we're going to see some probably unique variation in the growth rates by quarter. Again, Frank talked a little bit about this in his prepared remarks. Q1, as you recall, in 2020, was essentially COVID-free for, call it, roughly 10 of the 13 weeks of the first quarter. And we had, had a very strong first quarter until COVID hit really at the latter part of March and, obviously, very significantly in Q2. So I would expect Q1 to not only be our lowest point in the quarter in terms of growth rate year-over-year, but actually probably be below the guidance range with a rebound and the opposite take place in the second quarter when you have much easier comps, will be on the -- above the upper end of our guidance range. Such that by the time we exit the first half of the year, we're trading in that -- within the overall internal revenue growth and EPS guidance range on the first half basis and be set nicely for the second half. Sure. Thanks, David. Yeah, you're probably not too far off in that thinking. You hit the issue right on the head. Obviously, we had an extremely difficult second quarter. Both in terms of revenue and margin in that segment, really nice recovery sequentially in the second half of the year. And so we head into 2021 in much better position than we did in the first half, so we'll see some nice improvement. Again, you'll get the benefit of the comparison point in second quarter of 2021. Overall, I would say, when we closed the books, 12 months from now, we're on this call, I would expect margin expansion in all three segments and probably a bigger lift out of Merchant Acceptance business. No, actually, I think that's exactly the way to think about it. And you're right, that's the largest portion of that is the Merchant joint ventures. And as we see the Merchant business overall recover, I'd expect to see the joint ventures participate in that and help with that equity line. Thank you, David. Yes. Certainly, you're on the right track. Clover, with obviously heavy exposure in SMBs, generally has higher yield. And in general, tech-enabled does. Certainly, the thing to consider though is that was a big element of the growth in 2020. And so you don't necessarily see a massive acceleration of that because that was actually one of the things that helped the overall growth rate of the Merchant segment. As small businesses and retail broadly shut down again, particularly in the second quarter, people moved to tech-enabled e-commerce type transactions. And you heard us report very strong growth throughout the year in overall Clover volume. We'll obviously see that continue. But as a percent of the overall share of activity within the Merchant segment, you won't necessarily see a big change overall. So the margin improvement really is driven by continued productivity, scale business benefit as well as synergy benefits. Yes, Darrin. I think the $5 billion to $6 billion, I assume you're getting we -- during Investor Day, talked about $30 billion of capital available over the next five years. We certainly expect very good free cash flow into 2021. We had a great 2020 and see that continuing this year. And certainly, we continue to focus on capital deployment through the eyes or through the lens of share repurchase. We certainly would tell you that where the share price is today. We're a buyer. And I don't think you'll find many CFOs that tell you otherwise, but we're certainly trading below 52-week high. And given where we see 2021's results and where valuations have moved, we think there's a real opportunity. And so you'll see us continue to be active. We pretty much are in the market every quarter. I think we have been, for the five years, I've been here other than when we suspended for a couple of quarters post announcing the merger with First Data, and we'll continue to do that. We do have some debt to pay down with the balance of this year. But I'm a big believer of \"the genius of the end.\" And like we did in 2020, we'll pay down some debt, we'll buy back some shares, and we'll do some acquisitions. And we'll continue to do that aggressively across the company. Frank, you want to add anything? Thanks, Darrin. Yeah, Dave, in terms of spending this year, certainly fully encompassed in our overall guidance and gets us still the 20% or 24% EPS growth and at least 250 basis point margin improvement. There will be some incremental spend this year, of course, recall this is a fair amount of development. And so a portion of this gets capitalized, drawn on the balance sheet and comes over time. And so it isn't necessarily a big increase year-over-year and, again, certainly fully encompassed in our overall guidance."

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I will turn the call over to Peter Poillon, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. You may begin.\nPeter Poillon: Thank you, Ivy, and good afternoon, everyone. With me on the call today are Jeff Yabuki, our Executive Chairman; Frank Bisignano, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and supplemental materials for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, expected operating and financial results, strategic initiatives and expected benefits and synergies from the First Data acquisition. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. You should refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. Please refer to our earnings release and supplemental materials for today's call for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this call, along with a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. Unless stated otherwise, performance references made throughout this call are year-over-year comparisons, and all references to internal revenue growth are on a constant currency basis. Also note that the 2019 non-GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and supplemental materials have been prepared by making certain adjustments to the sum of historical First Data and Fiserv GAAP financial information for periods prior to the acquisition date. Lastly, a reminder that we're holding an Investor Day on December 8. Given the current environment and to ensure the health and safety of attendees, we've made the difficult decision to host the event virtually. We look forward to sharing our strategic vision with you at this important event, and we'll share the details of our broadcast on the Investor Relations section of our website. And now I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeffery W. Yabuki: Thanks, Peter, and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see, we delivered excellent results this quarter and once again are setting the standard for performance in these difficult and uncertain times. Our strong performance is a testament to the collective power of the more than 40,000 Fiserv associates around the world who are committed to serving clients with passion and excellence. Your company has stepped up beautifully and is well down the path to achieving the promise of the transformational combination of Fiserv and First Data, which closed only 15 months ago. We have the strongest solutions, significant synergies, market momentum and a $500 million incremental commitment to innovation which have come together to propel market-leading results in these unprecedented times. The strength of our business has been front and center in the midst of a global economic turmoil. The model has proven far more resilient than many anticipated as we fully expect to achieve our 35th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings-per-share growth and are positioned for far stronger performance for years to come. I've been privileged to lead this company for nearly 15 years, and I'm proud of what the team has done to create a platform for future success. I can tell you unequivocally that where we sit today is the best we have ever been positioned to deliver sustained growth and value for our clients, associates and you, our shareholders. Frank and the entire leadership team are the right people at the right time to convert the opportunity ahead into our collective reality. We look forward to sharing much more with you on December 8. With that, let me turn the call over to Frank.\nFrank J. Bisignano: Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, when I said thanks to Jeff, it's for the friendship and partnership. It's also for the 15 years of great leadership and strategic vision for Fiserv. It also represents a thank you from all the constituents, our associates, our clients and our shareholders. Today is Jeff's last earnings call, but his landmark leadership of this great company will last forever. Once again, thank you, Jeff. When Jeff and I met back in late 2018, one of the benefits we saw in the merger would be the potential power and resiliency of the combined business and the advantages we could expect in the event of a challenging economic environment. Neither one of us contemplated a global pandemic and the resulting economic implications we have faced in 2020. And yet, for the first nine months of the year, amid one of the worst economic downturns in the past century, we've grown our adjusted EPS by double digits, sustained internal revenue, expanded our adjusted operating margin and generated very significant free cash flow. For the quarter, internal revenue growth was 3%, led by our Merchant Acceptance segment of a very strong 6%. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was up 310 basis points and more than 400 basis points sequentially. Adjusted earnings per share in the quarter increased 19% and is now up 11% through September 30. Free cash flow was again excellent, coming in at $939 million in the quarter and totaled $2.6 billion year-to-date. Over the trailing 12 months, we've generated $3.6 billion of free cash flow. To put that in perspective, this is equal to the pro forma combined free cash flow, which included the full run rate value of synergies delivered nearly four years earlier than expected. Our ability to both increase and accelerate synergies, along with the overall strength of the business, has combined to deliver these outstanding results. After a terrific second quarter, sales were strong again in the third quarter, up 27%, with great results in our credit processing, merchant acquiring and output solution businesses. Sales year-to-date were up 23%, and the pipeline remains strong going into Q4. Our sales teams have transitioned to the current reality of selling in a virtual environment, and the enhanced value proposition of the merger is resonating incredibly well where it matters the most: in the client's office. As you saw, we kicked off Q4 by signing a long-term agreement with Alliance Data, the fourth largest card issuer in the U.S. by accounts, to outsource processing for their co-branded and private label card programs. This important partnership further validates the differentiated value that we are delivering to the changing credit-issuing landscape across our broad suite of innovative technology solutions, digital leadership and commitment to client partnership. It is an absolute privilege to serve Alliance Data, and we look forward to working together for many years to come. As you've heard last quarter, we signed Genesis Financial and Atlanticus Holdings in July, both top 25 issuers. That, combined with Alliance Data, is a clear sign of the very strong momentum in our credit issuer business in the U.S. Globally, our leading VISION platform also continues to win around the world, signing Federal Bank in India, Bank of Queensland in Australia and Up Si Vale in Mexico. Integration continues to go very well. Although we will provide a full update at Investor Day, let me briefly update you on our synergy results, which are well ahead of original expectations. Through September 30, we've already actioned $875 million of our $1.2 billion cost synergy target. Importantly, we expect to enter 2021 with a run rate of more than $800 million of annual P&L savings. Comparatively, you will recall that we had originally targeted a total of $900 million over a 5-year period. We've also actioned more than $185 million in annualized revenue synergies through September and fully expect to achieve over our $600 million goal. Our network solutions have driven a meaningful percentage of our early success as we lay the groundwork for additional revenue growth over the next several years. The combination of ACCEL and STAR Networks makes us the clear number three debit network and, when connected to our other market leading solutions, should unlock new areas of growth and innovation for many years. Another of our top synergy opportunities is to deliver our world-class credit processing services to our core account processing clients. In the quarter, we were pleased that Golden One Credit Union, the seventh largest credit union in the U.S., went live with a cards payment bundle, including credit and debit processing, debit network and ATM-managed services, which provides its members a consistent and integrated cardholder experience. Our bank merchant synergy program also continues to make strong progress. In October, we signed out 200th financial institution since the merger. In the third quarter, we added 35 new bank merchant clients, bringing the total to more than 130 new clients this year, with about 60% of those as competitive takeaways. We have increased the pipeline to more than 500 financial institutions for one of the most important opportunities for the combined company. We are privileged to have both a direct and partner distribution model for our merchant solutions, which allows us to cover the sales landscape across all business types and sizes. Next month, Verizon will begin marketing our new merchant solutions to its large portfolio of SMB customers, utilizing an exclusive Clover Flex terminal integrated with Verizon wireless technology. We also expanded our strategic partnership with Paychex, a leading provider of human capital management solutions, including payroll services, to more than 680,000 businesses in the U.S. to deliver merchant capabilities to their base of clients. This partnership is a perfect complement to Clover as both services are widely used by SMBs. We continue to see stellar results through our Clover platform with gross payment volume in the quarter of 30% to $33 billion. Momentum continued to be excellent in the digital-enabled segments of our merchant business, which includes e-commerce and ISV solutions. We added 42 new global e-com clients in the quarter and 128 year-to-date, a 41% increase over the prior year. Additionally, we signed more than 130 new ISVs so far this year and have seen a nearly 40% increase in new active merchants through our ISV channel. Global e-commerce transactions were up about 25% both in the quarter and year-to-date. Our e-commerce solutions have continued to grow with a significant focus on our direct business. We will provide you with important insights into the size, scale and reach of our digital-acquiring business at our Investor Day, which we believe will provide important context on both our direct and overall position in the current market structure. We renewed a number of key client relationships in the quarter with household names who value the breadth and depth of our solutions across both physical and digital presence, including Costco, Dunkin' and McDonald's. We continue to expand the number of privileged relationships we have in our account processing business across financial institutions of all sizes and are seeing strong success with financial institutions with assets greater than $1 billion, de novo banks and fintechs. We signed 12 new core account processing clients in the quarter, bringing the total to 41 for the year, including 20 on DNA. We have signed six de novo banks this year, including signing First Women's Bank to our Premier platform in the quarter. We're particularly proud of this new relationship as First Women's Bank is a commercial bank with a primary strategic focus on lending to women-owned businesses. Lastly, even in these challenging times, we continue to invest for growth, including deploying some of the $500 million innovation commitment we made as part of our combination. We have already delivered solutions in areas such as advanced card fraud, digital disbursements and several unique innovations to support a touchless shopping experience across our digital merchant solutions. We look forward to sharing more on this important topic at our Investor Day. With that, let me pass the discussion to Bob for more detail on the financial results.\nRobert W. Hau: Thank you, Frank, and good afternoon, everyone. We turned in a very strong performance in the quarter even as COVID-19 continued to pressure the global economy, demonstrating the strength and resilience of our business. Total company internal revenue growth was a strong 3% in the quarter, with merchant acceptance leading the way at 6%. Year-to-date internal revenue was flat with the prior year pressured by multiple impacts of the COVID-19 on our business, partially offset by better-than-anticipated growth from revenue synergies, which were $49 million in the quarter and $114 million year-to-date. We now expect about $150 million growth from revenue synergies for the full year, up from nearly $100 million previously expected. During our last call, we shared the trends we were seeing at that time, including strong sequential improvement in transactions each month through the second quarter and into July from the April low. Since August, we've seen transaction growth rates generally stabilize at or around July levels. The current run rate of growth is aligned with our full year expectations for this challenging macroeconomic environment. Although we aren't providing formal internal revenue guidance, we continue to estimate internal revenue to be plus or minus flat for the full year, barring any incremental large-scale economic slowdown. Third quarter adjusted operating income was up a very strong 9% to $1.2 billion. Year-to-date adjusted operating income decreased by 2% to $3.1 billion impacted by divestitures and negative impact from COVID, partially offset by strong synergy performance. Adjusted operating margin increased 310 basis points to 32.9% in the quarter on the strength of $184 million of incremental cost synergies and excellent performance across each of our segments. Consistent with our comments last quarter, Q3 adjusted operating margin improved 410 basis points sequentially. Adjusted operating margin increased 80 basis points to 29.9% through September 30 driven by the strength of our business and excellent synergy execution, which we dramatically accelerated to help mitigate the impact of the pandemic. Our cost actions are largely focused on synergy acceleration and not on actions that deliver short-term benefits, which would bounce back in subsequent years. We expect that our margin improvements are sustainable and should continue into the future. Third quarter adjusted earnings per share was up 19% to $1.20 compared to $1.01 in the prior year as adjusted for the Investment Services transaction that closed in Q1. Adjusted earnings per share through September 30 has increased 11% to $3.12. Given where we are to date, we fully expect to achieve double-digit adjusted EPS growth for the 35th consecutive year. As you heard, free cash flow in the quarter was excellent, up 12% to $939 million and up 13% to $2.6 billion year-to-date. Free cash flow conversion for the quarter was 115% and is a strong 122% year-to-date. Looking into the segments. Internal revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was a strong 6% for the quarter. Our results were bolstered by strong performance from our flexible Clover platform, our global suite of e-commerce and omni-channel solutions and our leading suite of ISV solutions. Clover gross payment volume grew 30% to $33 billion in the quarter and more than $130 billion annualized, and active merchant outlets increased nearly 10% sequentially. While the growth rate is not fully recovered to pre-COVID levels, it is impressive given the economic environment and considering that Clover tends to serve small- and medium-sized merchants, which are later in the recovery cycle. We continue to extend the breadth of services to Clover merchants with innovative solutions that enhance convenience like scan-to-order, which was launched recently to allow consumers to scan a QR code to order and pay directly from their table. Our integrated payments, or ISV business, is performing very well with adjusted revenue growth of nearly 50% in the quarter and is approaching pre-COVID growth rates. Our differentiated solutions for both ISVs and their merchants are driving excellent results, and we expect this business to be a strong grower for many years. Adjusted operating income in the Acceptance segment increased 8% to $425 million in the quarter. Adjusted operating margin was up 180 basis points in the quarter to 29.2%. Year-to-date adjusted operating income was $931 million, and adjusted operating margin was down 370 basis points to 23.5% due to the revenue impact of COVID. On our second quarter earnings call, I shared our expectations that this segment margin would improve significantly in the second half of 2020 by more than 800 basis points sequentially, with the majority of that benefit expected to come in Q3. The adjusted operating margin in the quarter was up over 1,000 basis points, primarily driven by improved revenue, including the timing reversal of the network assessment fees compared to the first half of the year, which will not be as pronounced in the fourth quarter. Adjusted operating margin improvement was also driven by continued progress in cost synergies and BAMS cost benefits. The Fintech segment saw internal revenue in line with the prior year's quarters as growth in high-quality recurring revenue was offset by much lower periodic revenue and specifically, termination fees, which created about 300 basis points of headwind to internal revenue growth in the quarter. Importantly, processing revenue was up 5% in the quarter, which demonstrated the scale and leverage in the business. Year-to-date internal revenue is also in line with prior year. We continue to see strong demand for our broad array of digital solutions. Total mobile subscribers across our leading digital platforms, Mobiliti and Architect, grew 15% in the quarter to more than 11 million users. Despite the pandemic, we implemented more clients on Architect than in any previous quarter, which should help bolster growth into 2021. Adjusted operating income was up a very strong 19% in the quarter to $265 million and is up 11% year-to-date to $721 million. Adjusted operating margin increased 600 basis points in the quarter to 36.4% on a combination of growth in processing revenue, operational effectiveness benefits and cost synergies. Year-to-date adjusted operating margin was up 390 basis points to 33.4%. We continue to deliver client value across this highly scaled business with increasing efficiency and effectiveness, partially offset by the decline in periodic revenue. We're also pleased with the synergy benefits, which are positively impacting segment performance in areas such as technology infrastructure and procurement. The Payments and Network segment internal revenue growth was 1% in the quarter and up four percentage points sequentially. Growth in our card services and output solutions businesses, including the benefit of revenue synergies, was partially offset by COVID-driven weakness in our prepaid, credit processing and biller businesses globally. Internal revenue through September 30 is in line with prior year. The revenue improvements we saw throughout the second quarter continued in the third quarter. We were especially pleased to see a normalization in our debit business in the quarter as transaction growth was back to mid-single digits in the quarter and up significantly over the second quarter. We continue to see excellent transaction growth in solutions such as account transfers and P2P, which again were nearly doubled compared to the prior year's quarter and up 21% sequentially. The number of clients live on Zelle grew more than fourfold compared to a year ago, and we expect to see meaningful growth across our electronic money movement solutions as consumers move money in a more real-time world. Adjusted operating income for the segment was strong, up 8% to $608 million in the quarter and is up 6% to $1.7 billion through September 30. Adjusted operating margin was up 310 basis points to 43.5% in the quarter and was up 280 basis points to 42.3% year-to-date. The positive impact of revenue synergies, operational efficiency and cost synergy performance is driving our strong bottom line performance. The adjusted corporate operating loss was $117 million in the third quarter, with the year-over-year and sequential increase in the quarter driven primarily by timing of variable compensation and incremental COVID expenses. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter increased as expected to about 23% compared to 22% in prior year period. Our adjusted effective tax rate through September 30 is 20.5%, and we continue to expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate to be generally in line with the prior year. As we shared last quarter, our capital allocation focus for the second half of the year is debt repayment after repurchasing 14 million shares for $1.4 billion in the first half of the year. We repaid $769 million of debt in the quarter, $1 billion year-to-date, and expect to pay down at least $1.5 billion for the full year. Total debt outstanding was $21.3 billion at September 30, and debt-to-adjusted EBITDA dropped to 3.7 times. We are well on track to achieve our leverage target in the second half of 2021 on the basis of both strong adjusted EBITDA growth and debt repayment. We remain fully committed to our long-standing capital strategy, which includes maintaining a strong balance sheet, organic investment in innovation, high-value acquisitions and, most important, share repurchase remains our primary benchmark for capital deployment. With that, let me turn the call back to Frank for our financial outlook for the rest of the year.\nFrank J. Bisignano: Thanks, Bob. As we mentioned, we saw a solid rebound off the trough of April into early August and seeing that consistent level of performance through last week. Looking at the business environment, our client conversations continue to be quite encouraging and generally centered on helping them grow their business, reducing their operating costs and better serving their customers right in the wheelhouse of what we do. As we had discussed on the last quarterly call, our back-to-business program to help minority and specifically Black-owned small businesses is in full force as we advance our nationwide objective: distributing at least $10 million in grants to qualifying businesses. We continue to see an increased interest in all things digital. Whether it's around e-commerce, more card use at point-of-sale, touchless payments, including digital wallets, or accelerating P2P payments, we are well positioned to provide the capability our merchants, financial institutions and business clients need. As you have heard, we are pleased with our results to date. Given the current economic backdrop and our strong financial performance, we are raising our 2020 financial outlook for adjusted earnings per share. We now expect full year adjusted EPS growth of at least 11%, up from the prior guidance of at least 10%, over last year's adjusted level of $3.95 or at least $4.37 per share for the full year. As we've stated previously, our outlook does not contemplate the second wave of shelter orders or other circumstances which creates significant incremental economic duress in the last two months of the year. We put our strong financial performance for both the quarter and year-to-date as we navigate these unprecedented times. Our business is showing incredible strength and resilience, leading to what we fully expect will be our 35th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings-per-share growth, along with the foundation for even stronger results in 2021. Last, let me thank our more than 40,000 talented associates around the world for their commitment and courage as we stand together to deliver value for clients, our colleagues and you, our shareholders. With that, operator, let's open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dave Koning from Baird. Your line is open.\nDave Koning: Hey, guys. Remarkable quarter. Great job.\nRobert W. Hau: Thanks, Dave.\nFrank J. Bisignano: Thank you.\nDave Koning: Yes, a nice start, Frank. First of all, maybe as we kind of look at Q4, it seems like you hit easier comps, less periodic revenue headwinds I would imagine, across Payments and Fintech. And in Merchant, it seems like the months have gotten better in the card industry kind of in September, October. Is there any reason, kind of judging where we are today, where we wouldn't see acceleration in Q4 really across the segments?\nRobert W. Hau: Yes, Dave, a couple of things you pointed out there. One, as we indicated in our prepared remarks upfront, we saw very nice improvement off the bottoms, the low back in April through July and then saw some leveling off into August, September and even through October at this point. And our expectation right now is for that to continue. Obviously, a lot going on in the world, a fair amount of potential variability in that. From a periodic revenue standpoint, we actually do anticipate continued headwind into fourth quarter, both from the standpoint of terminations and licensing revenue, a combination of periodic revenue. It will be more pronounced in the Fintech segment but also we're seeing some of that in the Payments segment.\nDave Koning: Okay. Great. Thanks. And then just one follow-up. When we think about margins in Acceptance, Q3 was really strong. Was there some catch-up, kind of that assessment fees kind of catch up that would make margins go down sequentially? And then into next year, is the baseline level kind of that 28%, 29% from which to grow? Or should we think about the full 2019 as the baseline from which to grow margins next year?\nRobert W. Hau: So the brand assessment fees, we expected to rebound meaningfully in the second half of the year after we come off that difficult second quarter. We saw that absolutely come through in third quarter. And we expected that to bounce more meaningfully in the third quarter, a bit more to come to us in the fourth quarter. So sequentially, you'll see less of a ramp that we did, that we got the benefit of in the third quarter. In terms of kind of ongoing margin, I'm not quite ready to give you a guidance for 2021, but I will tell you that in the Merchant segment and, quite frankly, across the company, we feel very good about the cost actions we've taken, being permanent improvement. And as we get revenue growth across a very scaled business, we think these margin improvements can hold into the future.\nDave Koning: Great, thanks guys. Nice Job.\nRobert W. Hau: Thanks, Dave.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we'll take the question from Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nTien-tsin Huang: Yeah, thanks so much. Really solid results and really like the new sales growth discussion there. I'm curious if -- would you agree that card processing sales activity overall is up? And if so, I'm just -- could you share maybe why? I don't know if you're seeing more off-cycle deals or just clients looking to modernize their systems. And maybe just to add on to that, just the pricing for some of the newer deals like Alliance Data. Anything -- any call-outs on that? Thank you.\nFrank J. Bisignano: Yes. I mean we've had these three big wins. In a general year, having one of them, would probably be a big deal. I think we spend a lot of time building out our product set. And it's -- I mean ADS was as big a deal as you're going to find. You take by account size, the fourth largest processor issuer. So my view on all of this is we have a great technical stack. We have tremendous surrounds. We've demonstrated a world-class base system and then a bunch of digital around it, and it's very appealing to larger issuers right now. And I think ADS was a very competitive process. But those are very, very long-term, valuable relationships that we cherish. And I think to develop them as having long-term organic growth capabilities and the ability to, given what we have inside our house, have great, great ability to fit within the platforms we run. So competitive processes, we've been fortunate in the wins, really three top 25 issuers; one, the fourth largest issuer. And I think it has a lot to do with the investments we made in the business and our maniacal focus on the client.\nTien-tsin Huang: All right. No, that's great. I know it's -- three deals is a lot. That's why I wanted to ask the question. So just my quick follow-up, just on Acceptance. You're back to tracking the Visa, Mastercard volume here, just like you said it would. So I don't know, Frank and team, how would you rank sort of the drivers that have sort of gotten you to this point? Is it net merchant additions? Is it better sales activity, net of attrition? Is it Clover? I know ISV is a big contributor. But I don't know if there's a way to just rank what's sort of gotten you back to this point where you're seeing sort of good performance benchmarking-wise. Thank you.\nFrank J. Bisignano: Yes. I think one way to think about it is we grew 10% in 2019. We actually had an industry-leading position. We came into January and Feb, and we were low double digits. And then COVID hit and we hit to the trough. But when you look at the breadth of our clients, from the SMBs to the largest global enterprises, that diversity, both of client size and the vertical nature of our clients, we're not over-indexed to any one piece. And then we have a tremendous geographic diversity. So you put those, and then you put Clover growing at 30%, and we all recognize all SMBs aren't in business. And as Bob has said, probably more late cycle. So we feel very good, and the Clover platform is gaining tremendous investment in it. The e-com business, which is our own direct business that we're winning those deals in and that stack that we built, really is resonating. The global presence of it and the omni-channel presence, us having both physical and electronic capability like e-com given that omni-channel has really resonated in the client's office. And I think our distribution is unparalleled. If you think about even signing up 200 new bank merchants since the deal, the great vision Jeff had around this core processing integrating with bank merchant, is showing up in the client's office in a tremendous way. And then you got Verizon, Paychex, Deluxe, so we're a partner of choice. And we're not at the growth rate we were pre-COVID, but we're achieving the growth rate we are because of the massive scale distribution and multichannel capability and being a partner of choice. And so I think it showed up all three quarters of this year just relative to market conditions. I hope that answers it for you.\nTien-tsin Huang: It does. Glad to hear. Appreciate it, Frank. And Jeff, all the best again. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Chiodo from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nTim Chiodo: Thank you for taking the question. My question is around the e-commerce business, and fully appreciate that you mentioned we'll dig into this a little bit more at the Investor Day. But the business did quite well in the recent Forrester Wave Report, placing really just behind Stripe and Adyen, which were listed as the leaders, and really alongside Worldpay, you guys were both named strong performers. They gave you high scores in global acquiring and payouts in disbursement and a little bit weaker in APIs and architecture and updates and release cadence. I was just hoping you could dig into that ranking a little bit more and talk about the strengths and the weaknesses and some of the things maybe to improve some of the areas that weren't as strong but with an overall really strong showing.\nFrank J. Bisignano: Yes. Thank you. I mean, look, I guess the best way to think about it is the competitive wins we have. And we still are building technology. We'll be building it forever. We're iterating always on it. And we're using the power of our data and information and all the other assets we have inside the house. I think the best way for us to cover it all is at Investor Day where we'll walk you through the full stack, give you a full look at really where we sit in the market structure and understand really how strong the e-com product is that we have and why we're winning the business that we're winning. So I think that would do it the most justice. But we feel good, we go head-to-head every day and we win more than we lose by a lot.\nTim Chiodo: All right. Great. Thank you. And the quick follow-up, and I apologize if I missed it, but the 300 basis point headwind to margins in the Acceptance segment last quarter from the timing of the assessment fees, when that was, I assume, reversed to a tailwind in Q3, did you put a number on what that boost was to margins in Q3? And I'm assuming, to your point, we should see a little bit less of that boost in Q4.\nRobert W. Hau: Yes. We didn't actually cite it in the opening remarks. I would say we probably picked up about 2/3 of that in the third quarter.\nTim Chiodo: Okay. Really helpful. Okay, so roughly 200 basis points or so. All right thank you so much, I appreciate you taking the questions.\nRobert W. Hau: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we have David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. In the fourth quarter and in 2021, would you expect the gap between the mid-single-digit debit transaction growth and the 1% revenue growth in Payment and Network segment to start to close?\nFrank J. Bisignano: I wouldn't necessarily think about it that way. But if I think about -- remember, that has multiple businesses in it, right? So you also have businesses right this moment that are affected by foot traffic. You got the prepaids, like gift, you have our TeleCheck business, and you have elements of RPL that are affected, that are negatively affected, by COVID. If you look at sequentially, that business improved 400 basis points. And so I think we believe that our business is very strong. We love the network. We talked about all the characteristics of having a number 3 network. So I would think about it that, yes, we're going to grow more. And I think we're going to talk -- that's why when we get to Investor Day, we'll take you through '21 and medium-term outlook. And we feel very, very strong about the Payments segment and all the innovation we have going on in the Payments segment and why our clients on both the merchant and the issuer side are so motivated by it.\nDavid Togut: Got it. Looking at the 12 core wins in Q3 and that followed 17 core wins in Q2, for what percentage of those wins was payment capability a significant component of the decision for the client?\nFrank J. Bisignano: Yes. I think the clients are looking at the holistic nature now, the integrated nature. And we've moved to -- which was always there, but even driving it even further, how we deliver an integrated bundle and how that integrated bundle makes it easier for the client to service their clients and, in fact, how we serve our client better. So they really are completely integrated. It'd be very odd not to see that right now given the fact that no one else offers the modern core we have: Debit, credit, merchant solutions and the digital suite. Those digital products are huge in this offering.\nDavid Togut: Got it. Quick final question on Zelle. Just going forward, since Fiserv was an early innovator in the P2P space, do you see Zelle becoming more of an ecosystem over time as we've seen, let's say, with Venmo and CashApp?\nFrank J. Bisignano: 100%. I mean, look at, we have a very long tail of opportunity in Zelle and then how we bring Zelle into the ecosystem and giving the assets within this company, how we utilize them across the payment spectrum. And I think you'll hear some of these things at Investor Day and see how we put this together with our bank partners to deliver them best-in-class payment capability.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. All the best to you, Jeff.\nFrank J. Bisignano: Thank you -- oh, that's Jeff. I answered for him a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we have Matt O'Neill from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nMatt O'Neill: Yes. Hi, thanks everybody for taking my questions. I was just curious, when we think about the extremely impressive pace of cost synergy realization to date since the close of the deal, understanding you've already increased the target once, we're quickly closing in on the original target that was sort of slated for five years after, you guys pointed out, less than, I think, even a year and a half into the deal, so how do we think about that going forward? Are there longer-term incremental cost saves to be realized in the business vis-a-vis data center consolidation, incremental technology, etc? Or would that quantifiable synergy target raise of 1.2 somewhat of an upper bound before getting back to a more normalized level of operating margin expansion following the complete integration of the businesses? And I understand I might be jumping the gun a bit on Investor Day, so I apologize in advance.\nFrank J. Bisignano: That's OK. That's good.Investor Day would be part of the answer. But look at, we have -- that's 1.2 billion, of which transactions of 875. And you heard us talk about the effect of our synergies on the P&L next year. I think what you can go back to is think about both these companies premerger were very good at operational effectiveness. And there will be a moment where we will continue to drive operational effectiveness and it will -- it's part of the DNA, whether it's using artificial intelligence, whether it's using RPA, we continue to bring AI in through many of our service elements. And both companies had dimensions of it, and we've had the benefit to bring both together. I mean the standard work of closing data centers and consolidating, which we've done more than 20 so far, that will wind down in synergy, but we will always drive an operational effectiveness program. And you could count on us talking about that as a regular way, all right? That will be through -- and we have a deep belief that we are able to improve service, improve quality while, in fact, being more efficient. And that -- I think it resonates our client's office. They feel it, and it's the way that we'll run the company going forward.\nMatt O'Neill: Thanks frank. That's very helpful. I'll turn back in queue.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nDarrin Peller: Hey. Thanks, guys. So the top line result on Merchant was clearly stronger than expected. I guess just on the Fintech side, to be clear, when we back out, it's fair to back out 300 basis points from term fees, right? And so that would have been a 3% growth rate. You guys have all these wins coming on from new business in DNA and some other platforms. If you could just talk through the tech positioning in that segment since we get asked about that a fair amount, if you really see Fiserv of taking share from -- given all the digital banking initiatives. And with these wins and bookings, when should -- could we see that actually show further acceleration from the, I guess, normalized 3% run rate?\nFrank J. Bisignano: Yes. I mean you've got the issue of the periodic revenue, so we don't have to go through that again. But I think what you see us is winning in the client's office. And I think a good way to think about it is we had a third-party consultant, FedFis, come out and basically say -- if you look at where we sit, we have 40% share, in the mid- to lower end of the market, right, which we are very, very good at and committed to. Now we've had bigger wins. We just boarded NYCB, which is a huge client. But I think we view ourselves over the long haul as being a market-share gainer. And I think the company was a market-share gainer and is a market-share gainer in various segments. So I think -- and I want to go back to how we're winning. We're winning cause of the bundle. We're winning because of the integrated solution. We're winning because of the digital assets that come along with it. You heard Bob talking about the amount of Architect installs we did and the amount of Architect wins we're having, which all drive ultimately future revenue growth for us. So I think you're going to see a lot over the next few years. You'll see a lot on Investor Day of why these businesses are so strong in Fintech.\nDarrin Peller: All right. Thanks. And then just quickly on the Merchant side. Look, that obviously surprised folks, up 6%. And I know you touched on Clover, up 30%; and e-com, up 25%. Can you just touch on international? How did that do? And maybe if there's anything on integrated payments you can comment on. And really, Frank, the bigger question is, if you're seeing the top of the funnel filled with new businesses enough to offset the kinds of attrition that some might be seeing in this kind of market, I guess, in other words, if you're taking market share from the banks or anyone else despite some of the pandemic headwinds. Thanks, guys.\nFrank J. Bisignano: Yes, I mean, look at, international has a lot of countries in it, and every country is different. So I don't ever think about international. I always think about regions, and that's how we run it, and then down to countries. And different countries have different lockdown situations. But we're winning in the market outside the U.S., and we have strong growth in many cases and innovation both in the electronic space and in the physical space. And then if you look at Clover and you look at e-com, what you see is that they have had tremendous investments in their technology. We've had big changes in go-to-market strategy fundamentally in the client's office. We're running a very direct business now across the enterprise, and we are taking share.\nDarrin Peller: Alright, thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we have Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Your line is open.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Thanks. Hi, Jeff, Frank, Bob, congratulations on the quarter. Good to hear from all of you. So is Peter, not to have him left out. Jeff, it's been a pleasure and hope to stay in touch. My first question is with regards to -- when we look at Fintech, what are your bank clients telling you about their ability to incrementally invest in their business? In other words, as they pivot faster toward digital offerings, what do you get from the digital offerings? Is that going to be incrementally enough to have you accelerate meaningfully versus the traditional stuff that you might have done, like the other stuff that you might have done? And there's two parts to it as well. There's a sales part of it, which you talked about, but also the ramps. We hear mixed feedback about the pace of signed contracts actually ramping, so if you could comment on that as well.\nFrank J. Bisignano: I can tell you what I hear once or twice a day from a bank CEO or somebody who runs the retail division of a financial institution. Digital transformation speed is one of the most important things we have going on. And so I think from a market structure standpoint, we feel that our digital assets in our core coming together in a client's office and transforming them and bringing all the other -- bringing the debit capability, bringing the credit capabilities, I mean one of the great synergies that Jeff and I knew we had was the capability of bringing credit to smaller institutions, and we're seeing it happen. We're converting them every week. So I think it's a digital transformation on all products. It's bigger than just the core and fintech, but it's how do they integrate together. And to me, I don't think this is about banks deciding how much they're going to spend. It's banks figuring out with us how much they could transform how they operate with their clients, which is way more valuable for them to grow and compete than it is the cost of what they need to pay to us. And that's how they see it. This is no longer a luxury, the digital transformation, it's a way of life. And so I think we are in a fabulous position. Our clients feel good about it. We have the resource availability. We showed a fabulous conversion and implementation machine. And I think all my interactions with people who run financial institutions, which happen every day, is they're highly motivated to get as much as digital opportunity. And that's what I think about when you think about long-term growth in Fintech.\nRobert W. Hau: Just quickly, to add to that, this is an area that we're absolutely investing in: in digital matters, payments, risk, capabilities to bring to those financial institutions in our fintech space, and we continue to bring additional products and services, and that's helping us win those cores as well as win digital users that you had us talk about.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Got it. And you talked about your revenue and the economic assumptions in the near term for 4Q. What about the cost assumptions? At what pace are you bringing cost back? And the cost that you took out incrementally just like many other companies, have you taken a shot yet at determining how many of those and what percent of those costs or what dollar value of those costs are sort of now in the permanent bucket versus temporary that will come back?\nRobert W. Hau: Yes, absolutely. And I made comments about this upfront. The cost -- the margin improvement that we're seeing this year, including the 300 basis point expansion that we had in the third quarter, is absolutely driven by permanent cost-out. It's one of the things that we actually talked about a year ago when we frequently got the question of how will you perform in an economic downturn, never anticipating that it would be driven by a pandemic and show up in 2020. What we said was, look, you know what, if we're headed for an economic downturn in the near term, we will have, at the time, $900 million, now $1.2 billion worth of cost synergies. And we've been working since the beginning of the year, particularly as the pandemic hit and we saw the economic downturn coming, to accelerate those cost synergies. And in fact, back in mid-March is when we announced the increase from $900 million to $1.2 billion. So the cost actions that we're taking are permanent cost actions. They are not in reaction to the COVID dynamic that you are seeing from a number of places. So we're not doing pay cuts or furloughs or things like that, that naturally come back into the business when the economy comes back. That's why we believe the margin improvement is sustainable, and we have future opportunity ahead of us as we continue to drive our cost synergies and then move to operational effectiveness into the future.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Got it. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question comes from Dan Dolev from Mizuho. Your line is open.\nDan Dolev: Hey, thanks for taking my questions. So really nice results in Acceptance and definitely ahead of our expectations. Frank, I know this is something that might be for the Analyst Day, but can you maybe give us a very broad sense of sort of the run rates, organic run rates, by segment heading into next year for the three segments? Even ballpark numbers, just to help us model, would be great.\nFrank J. Bisignano: Yes. I mean, look, we are probably, I don't know -- it's good to talk to you, Dan. Thanks for being on the call. We're probably like, I don't know, how many days out, Bob, are we from Investors Day?\nRobert W. Hau: Probably about five, six weeks.\nFrank J. Bisignano: Five, six weeks, and we'll look at -- on Investor Day, we're going to take you through the inside and out, every business, the strength of our e-com business, right, how our segments operate, why our technology prowess is so strong, why we win in the client's office. We're going to talk to you about our long-established capital allocation strategy, with share repurchase as the primary benchmark for capital deployment. So I mean it's not -- I apologize because you know how well I think you guys, but this isn't the time to do segment guidance, if I may. But I'll answer another question if you got one.\nDan Dolev: Yes, I actually had another question, really quick one. We did some work on the BofA attrition. Can you maybe give us a very quick update on how it's trending? I think last quarter, about the majority of the decline was due to COVID, and then about $10 million of that adjustment was due to BofA. How is that trending now in terms of that $20 million-or-so decline year-over-year in the BofA adjustment in terms of the split?\nFrank J. Bisignano: Yes. I think if you COVID-adjust, which is a little hard not to say these days, we find our attrition rates to be fundamentally at an outperform against the industry right now given the stack of technology that we're providing for clients. So we feel really, really strong about what we're doing in the client's office and the product set and the stickiness of our clients.\nDan Dolev: Got it. Well, great quarter. Thanks guys, Appreciate it.\nFrank J. Bisignano: Good to talk to you, Dan. I'll see you soon. Thank you. And look, if I would like to take this moment to thank everyone for joining the call. I do look forward to us having a great virtual Investor Day with you, and Bob and I look tremendously forward. I would like one more time to -- I mean Jeff Yabuki has been a legend running this company, and I think you've all been fortunate to follow him, and I'm fortunate to follow him on his footsteps. So you guys have a fabulous, fabulous night. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Closing Remarks]",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Frank J. Bisignano",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, when I said thanks to Jeff, it's for the friendship and partnership. It's also for the 15 years of great leadership and strategic vision for Fiserv. It also represents a thank you from all the constituents, our associates, our clients and our shareholders. Today is Jeff's last earnings call, but his landmark leadership of this great company will last forever. Once again, thank you, Jeff. When Jeff and I met back in late 2018, one of the benefits we saw in the merger would be the potential power and resiliency of the combined business and the advantages we could expect in the event of a challenging economic environment. Neither one of us contemplated a global pandemic and the resulting economic implications we have faced in 2020. And yet, for the first nine months of the year, amid one of the worst economic downturns in the past century, we've grown our adjusted EPS by double digits, sustained internal revenue, expanded our adjusted operating margin and generated very significant free cash flow. For the quarter, internal revenue growth was 3%, led by our Merchant Acceptance segment of a very strong 6%. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was up 310 basis points and more than 400 basis points sequentially. Adjusted earnings per share in the quarter increased 19% and is now up 11% through September 30. Free cash flow was again excellent, coming in at $939 million in the quarter and totaled $2.6 billion year-to-date. Over the trailing 12 months, we've generated $3.6 billion of free cash flow. To put that in perspective, this is equal to the pro forma combined free cash flow, which included the full run rate value of synergies delivered nearly four years earlier than expected. Our ability to both increase and accelerate synergies, along with the overall strength of the business, has combined to deliver these outstanding results. After a terrific second quarter, sales were strong again in the third quarter, up 27%, with great results in our credit processing, merchant acquiring and output solution businesses. Sales year-to-date were up 23%, and the pipeline remains strong going into Q4. Our sales teams have transitioned to the current reality of selling in a virtual environment, and the enhanced value proposition of the merger is resonating incredibly well where it matters the most: in the client's office. As you saw, we kicked off Q4 by signing a long-term agreement with Alliance Data, the fourth largest card issuer in the U.S. by accounts, to outsource processing for their co-branded and private label card programs. This important partnership further validates the differentiated value that we are delivering to the changing credit-issuing landscape across our broad suite of innovative technology solutions, digital leadership and commitment to client partnership. It is an absolute privilege to serve Alliance Data, and we look forward to working together for many years to come. As you've heard last quarter, we signed Genesis Financial and Atlanticus Holdings in July, both top 25 issuers. That, combined with Alliance Data, is a clear sign of the very strong momentum in our credit issuer business in the U.S. Globally, our leading VISION platform also continues to win around the world, signing Federal Bank in India, Bank of Queensland in Australia and Up Si Vale in Mexico. Integration continues to go very well. Although we will provide a full update at Investor Day, let me briefly update you on our synergy results, which are well ahead of original expectations. Through September 30, we've already actioned $875 million of our $1.2 billion cost synergy target. Importantly, we expect to enter 2021 with a run rate of more than $800 million of annual P&L savings. Comparatively, you will recall that we had originally targeted a total of $900 million over a 5-year period. We've also actioned more than $185 million in annualized revenue synergies through September and fully expect to achieve over our $600 million goal. Our network solutions have driven a meaningful percentage of our early success as we lay the groundwork for additional revenue growth over the next several years. The combination of ACCEL and STAR Networks makes us the clear number three debit network and, when connected to our other market leading solutions, should unlock new areas of growth and innovation for many years. Another of our top synergy opportunities is to deliver our world-class credit processing services to our core account processing clients. In the quarter, we were pleased that Golden One Credit Union, the seventh largest credit union in the U.S., went live with a cards payment bundle, including credit and debit processing, debit network and ATM-managed services, which provides its members a consistent and integrated cardholder experience. Our bank merchant synergy program also continues to make strong progress. In October, we signed out 200th financial institution since the merger. In the third quarter, we added 35 new bank merchant clients, bringing the total to more than 130 new clients this year, with about 60% of those as competitive takeaways. We have increased the pipeline to more than 500 financial institutions for one of the most important opportunities for the combined company. We are privileged to have both a direct and partner distribution model for our merchant solutions, which allows us to cover the sales landscape across all business types and sizes. Next month, Verizon will begin marketing our new merchant solutions to its large portfolio of SMB customers, utilizing an exclusive Clover Flex terminal integrated with Verizon wireless technology. We also expanded our strategic partnership with Paychex, a leading provider of human capital management solutions, including payroll services, to more than 680,000 businesses in the U.S. to deliver merchant capabilities to their base of clients. This partnership is a perfect complement to Clover as both services are widely used by SMBs. We continue to see stellar results through our Clover platform with gross payment volume in the quarter of 30% to $33 billion. Momentum continued to be excellent in the digital-enabled segments of our merchant business, which includes e-commerce and ISV solutions. We added 42 new global e-com clients in the quarter and 128 year-to-date, a 41% increase over the prior year. Additionally, we signed more than 130 new ISVs so far this year and have seen a nearly 40% increase in new active merchants through our ISV channel. Global e-commerce transactions were up about 25% both in the quarter and year-to-date. Our e-commerce solutions have continued to grow with a significant focus on our direct business. We will provide you with important insights into the size, scale and reach of our digital-acquiring business at our Investor Day, which we believe will provide important context on both our direct and overall position in the current market structure. We renewed a number of key client relationships in the quarter with household names who value the breadth and depth of our solutions across both physical and digital presence, including Costco, Dunkin' and McDonald's. We continue to expand the number of privileged relationships we have in our account processing business across financial institutions of all sizes and are seeing strong success with financial institutions with assets greater than $1 billion, de novo banks and fintechs. We signed 12 new core account processing clients in the quarter, bringing the total to 41 for the year, including 20 on DNA. We have signed six de novo banks this year, including signing First Women's Bank to our Premier platform in the quarter. We're particularly proud of this new relationship as First Women's Bank is a commercial bank with a primary strategic focus on lending to women-owned businesses. Lastly, even in these challenging times, we continue to invest for growth, including deploying some of the $500 million innovation commitment we made as part of our combination. We have already delivered solutions in areas such as advanced card fraud, digital disbursements and several unique innovations to support a touchless shopping experience across our digital merchant solutions. We look forward to sharing more on this important topic at our Investor Day. With that, let me pass the discussion to Bob for more detail on the financial results. Thanks, Bob. As we mentioned, we saw a solid rebound off the trough of April into early August and seeing that consistent level of performance through last week. Looking at the business environment, our client conversations continue to be quite encouraging and generally centered on helping them grow their business, reducing their operating costs and better serving their customers right in the wheelhouse of what we do. As we had discussed on the last quarterly call, our back-to-business program to help minority and specifically Black-owned small businesses is in full force as we advance our nationwide objective: distributing at least $10 million in grants to qualifying businesses. We continue to see an increased interest in all things digital. Whether it's around e-commerce, more card use at point-of-sale, touchless payments, including digital wallets, or accelerating P2P payments, we are well positioned to provide the capability our merchants, financial institutions and business clients need. As you have heard, we are pleased with our results to date. Given the current economic backdrop and our strong financial performance, we are raising our 2020 financial outlook for adjusted earnings per share. We now expect full year adjusted EPS growth of at least 11%, up from the prior guidance of at least 10%, over last year's adjusted level of $3.95 or at least $4.37 per share for the full year. As we've stated previously, our outlook does not contemplate the second wave of shelter orders or other circumstances which creates significant incremental economic duress in the last two months of the year. We put our strong financial performance for both the quarter and year-to-date as we navigate these unprecedented times. Our business is showing incredible strength and resilience, leading to what we fully expect will be our 35th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings-per-share growth, along with the foundation for even stronger results in 2021. Last, let me thank our more than 40,000 talented associates around the world for their commitment and courage as we stand together to deliver value for clients, our colleagues and you, our shareholders. With that, operator, let's open the line for questions. Thank you. Yes. I mean we've had these three big wins. In a general year, having one of them, would probably be a big deal. I think we spend a lot of time building out our product set. And it's -- I mean ADS was as big a deal as you're going to find. You take by account size, the fourth largest processor issuer. So my view on all of this is we have a great technical stack. We have tremendous surrounds. We've demonstrated a world-class base system and then a bunch of digital around it, and it's very appealing to larger issuers right now. And I think ADS was a very competitive process. But those are very, very long-term, valuable relationships that we cherish. And I think to develop them as having long-term organic growth capabilities and the ability to, given what we have inside our house, have great, great ability to fit within the platforms we run. So competitive processes, we've been fortunate in the wins, really three top 25 issuers; one, the fourth largest issuer. And I think it has a lot to do with the investments we made in the business and our maniacal focus on the client. Yes. I think one way to think about it is we grew 10% in 2019. We actually had an industry-leading position. We came into January and Feb, and we were low double digits. And then COVID hit and we hit to the trough. But when you look at the breadth of our clients, from the SMBs to the largest global enterprises, that diversity, both of client size and the vertical nature of our clients, we're not over-indexed to any one piece. And then we have a tremendous geographic diversity. So you put those, and then you put Clover growing at 30%, and we all recognize all SMBs aren't in business. And as Bob has said, probably more late cycle. So we feel very good, and the Clover platform is gaining tremendous investment in it. The e-com business, which is our own direct business that we're winning those deals in and that stack that we built, really is resonating. The global presence of it and the omni-channel presence, us having both physical and electronic capability like e-com given that omni-channel has really resonated in the client's office. And I think our distribution is unparalleled. If you think about even signing up 200 new bank merchants since the deal, the great vision Jeff had around this core processing integrating with bank merchant, is showing up in the client's office in a tremendous way. And then you got Verizon, Paychex, Deluxe, so we're a partner of choice. And we're not at the growth rate we were pre-COVID, but we're achieving the growth rate we are because of the massive scale distribution and multichannel capability and being a partner of choice. And so I think it showed up all three quarters of this year just relative to market conditions. I hope that answers it for you. Yes. Thank you. I mean, look, I guess the best way to think about it is the competitive wins we have. And we still are building technology. We'll be building it forever. We're iterating always on it. And we're using the power of our data and information and all the other assets we have inside the house. I think the best way for us to cover it all is at Investor Day where we'll walk you through the full stack, give you a full look at really where we sit in the market structure and understand really how strong the e-com product is that we have and why we're winning the business that we're winning. So I think that would do it the most justice. But we feel good, we go head-to-head every day and we win more than we lose by a lot. I wouldn't necessarily think about it that way. But if I think about -- remember, that has multiple businesses in it, right? So you also have businesses right this moment that are affected by foot traffic. You got the prepaids, like gift, you have our TeleCheck business, and you have elements of RPL that are affected, that are negatively affected, by COVID. If you look at sequentially, that business improved 400 basis points. And so I think we believe that our business is very strong. We love the network. We talked about all the characteristics of having a number 3 network. So I would think about it that, yes, we're going to grow more. And I think we're going to talk -- that's why when we get to Investor Day, we'll take you through '21 and medium-term outlook. And we feel very, very strong about the Payments segment and all the innovation we have going on in the Payments segment and why our clients on both the merchant and the issuer side are so motivated by it. Yes. I think the clients are looking at the holistic nature now, the integrated nature. And we've moved to -- which was always there, but even driving it even further, how we deliver an integrated bundle and how that integrated bundle makes it easier for the client to service their clients and, in fact, how we serve our client better. So they really are completely integrated. It'd be very odd not to see that right now given the fact that no one else offers the modern core we have: Debit, credit, merchant solutions and the digital suite. Those digital products are huge in this offering. 100%. I mean, look at, we have a very long tail of opportunity in Zelle and then how we bring Zelle into the ecosystem and giving the assets within this company, how we utilize them across the payment spectrum. And I think you'll hear some of these things at Investor Day and see how we put this together with our bank partners to deliver them best-in-class payment capability. Thank you -- oh, that's Jeff. I answered for him a lot. That's OK. That's good.Investor Day would be part of the answer. But look at, we have -- that's 1.2 billion, of which transactions of 875. And you heard us talk about the effect of our synergies on the P&L next year. I think what you can go back to is think about both these companies premerger were very good at operational effectiveness. And there will be a moment where we will continue to drive operational effectiveness and it will -- it's part of the DNA, whether it's using artificial intelligence, whether it's using RPA, we continue to bring AI in through many of our service elements. And both companies had dimensions of it, and we've had the benefit to bring both together. I mean the standard work of closing data centers and consolidating, which we've done more than 20 so far, that will wind down in synergy, but we will always drive an operational effectiveness program. And you could count on us talking about that as a regular way, all right? That will be through -- and we have a deep belief that we are able to improve service, improve quality while, in fact, being more efficient. And that -- I think it resonates our client's office. They feel it, and it's the way that we'll run the company going forward. Yes. I mean you've got the issue of the periodic revenue, so we don't have to go through that again. But I think what you see us is winning in the client's office. And I think a good way to think about it is we had a third-party consultant, FedFis, come out and basically say -- if you look at where we sit, we have 40% share, in the mid- to lower end of the market, right, which we are very, very good at and committed to. Now we've had bigger wins. We just boarded NYCB, which is a huge client. But I think we view ourselves over the long haul as being a market-share gainer. And I think the company was a market-share gainer and is a market-share gainer in various segments. So I think -- and I want to go back to how we're winning. We're winning cause of the bundle. We're winning because of the integrated solution. We're winning because of the digital assets that come along with it. You heard Bob talking about the amount of Architect installs we did and the amount of Architect wins we're having, which all drive ultimately future revenue growth for us. So I think you're going to see a lot over the next few years. You'll see a lot on Investor Day of why these businesses are so strong in Fintech. Yes, I mean, look at, international has a lot of countries in it, and every country is different. So I don't ever think about international. I always think about regions, and that's how we run it, and then down to countries. And different countries have different lockdown situations. But we're winning in the market outside the U.S., and we have strong growth in many cases and innovation both in the electronic space and in the physical space. And then if you look at Clover and you look at e-com, what you see is that they have had tremendous investments in their technology. We've had big changes in go-to-market strategy fundamentally in the client's office. We're running a very direct business now across the enterprise, and we are taking share. I can tell you what I hear once or twice a day from a bank CEO or somebody who runs the retail division of a financial institution. Digital transformation speed is one of the most important things we have going on. And so I think from a market structure standpoint, we feel that our digital assets in our core coming together in a client's office and transforming them and bringing all the other -- bringing the debit capability, bringing the credit capabilities, I mean one of the great synergies that Jeff and I knew we had was the capability of bringing credit to smaller institutions, and we're seeing it happen. We're converting them every week. So I think it's a digital transformation on all products. It's bigger than just the core and fintech, but it's how do they integrate together. And to me, I don't think this is about banks deciding how much they're going to spend. It's banks figuring out with us how much they could transform how they operate with their clients, which is way more valuable for them to grow and compete than it is the cost of what they need to pay to us. And that's how they see it. This is no longer a luxury, the digital transformation, it's a way of life. And so I think we are in a fabulous position. Our clients feel good about it. We have the resource availability. We showed a fabulous conversion and implementation machine. And I think all my interactions with people who run financial institutions, which happen every day, is they're highly motivated to get as much as digital opportunity. And that's what I think about when you think about long-term growth in Fintech. Yes. I mean, look, we are probably, I don't know -- it's good to talk to you, Dan. Thanks for being on the call. We're probably like, I don't know, how many days out, Bob, are we from Investors Day? Five, six weeks, and we'll look at -- on Investor Day, we're going to take you through the inside and out, every business, the strength of our e-com business, right, how our segments operate, why our technology prowess is so strong, why we win in the client's office. We're going to talk to you about our long-established capital allocation strategy, with share repurchase as the primary benchmark for capital deployment. So I mean it's not -- I apologize because you know how well I think you guys, but this isn't the time to do segment guidance, if I may. But I'll answer another question if you got one. Yes. I think if you COVID-adjust, which is a little hard not to say these days, we find our attrition rates to be fundamentally at an outperform against the industry right now given the stack of technology that we're providing for clients. So we feel really, really strong about what we're doing in the client's office and the product set and the stickiness of our clients. Good to talk to you, Dan. I'll see you soon. Thank you. And look, if I would like to take this moment to thank everyone for joining the call. I do look forward to us having a great virtual Investor Day with you, and Bob and I look tremendously forward. I would like one more time to -- I mean Jeff Yabuki has been a legend running this company, and I think you've all been fortunate to follow him, and I'm fortunate to follow him on his footsteps. So you guys have a fabulous, fabulous night. Thank you."

            "name": "Jeffery W. Yabuki",
            "content": "Thanks, Peter, and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see, we delivered excellent results this quarter and once again are setting the standard for performance in these difficult and uncertain times. Our strong performance is a testament to the collective power of the more than 40,000 Fiserv associates around the world who are committed to serving clients with passion and excellence. Your company has stepped up beautifully and is well down the path to achieving the promise of the transformational combination of Fiserv and First Data, which closed only 15 months ago. We have the strongest solutions, significant synergies, market momentum and a $500 million incremental commitment to innovation which have come together to propel market-leading results in these unprecedented times. The strength of our business has been front and center in the midst of a global economic turmoil. The model has proven far more resilient than many anticipated as we fully expect to achieve our 35th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings-per-share growth and are positioned for far stronger performance for years to come. I've been privileged to lead this company for nearly 15 years, and I'm proud of what the team has done to create a platform for future success. I can tell you unequivocally that where we sit today is the best we have ever been positioned to deliver sustained growth and value for our clients, associates and you, our shareholders. Frank and the entire leadership team are the right people at the right time to convert the opportunity ahead into our collective reality. We look forward to sharing much more with you on December 8. With that, let me turn the call over to Frank."
        },
        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Robert W. Hau",
            "content": "Thank you, Frank, and good afternoon, everyone. We turned in a very strong performance in the quarter even as COVID-19 continued to pressure the global economy, demonstrating the strength and resilience of our business. Total company internal revenue growth was a strong 3% in the quarter, with merchant acceptance leading the way at 6%. Year-to-date internal revenue was flat with the prior year pressured by multiple impacts of the COVID-19 on our business, partially offset by better-than-anticipated growth from revenue synergies, which were $49 million in the quarter and $114 million year-to-date. We now expect about $150 million growth from revenue synergies for the full year, up from nearly $100 million previously expected. During our last call, we shared the trends we were seeing at that time, including strong sequential improvement in transactions each month through the second quarter and into July from the April low. Since August, we've seen transaction growth rates generally stabilize at or around July levels. The current run rate of growth is aligned with our full year expectations for this challenging macroeconomic environment. Although we aren't providing formal internal revenue guidance, we continue to estimate internal revenue to be plus or minus flat for the full year, barring any incremental large-scale economic slowdown. Third quarter adjusted operating income was up a very strong 9% to $1.2 billion. Year-to-date adjusted operating income decreased by 2% to $3.1 billion impacted by divestitures and negative impact from COVID, partially offset by strong synergy performance. Adjusted operating margin increased 310 basis points to 32.9% in the quarter on the strength of $184 million of incremental cost synergies and excellent performance across each of our segments. Consistent with our comments last quarter, Q3 adjusted operating margin improved 410 basis points sequentially. Adjusted operating margin increased 80 basis points to 29.9% through September 30 driven by the strength of our business and excellent synergy execution, which we dramatically accelerated to help mitigate the impact of the pandemic. Our cost actions are largely focused on synergy acceleration and not on actions that deliver short-term benefits, which would bounce back in subsequent years. We expect that our margin improvements are sustainable and should continue into the future. Third quarter adjusted earnings per share was up 19% to $1.20 compared to $1.01 in the prior year as adjusted for the Investment Services transaction that closed in Q1. Adjusted earnings per share through September 30 has increased 11% to $3.12. Given where we are to date, we fully expect to achieve double-digit adjusted EPS growth for the 35th consecutive year. As you heard, free cash flow in the quarter was excellent, up 12% to $939 million and up 13% to $2.6 billion year-to-date. Free cash flow conversion for the quarter was 115% and is a strong 122% year-to-date. Looking into the segments. Internal revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was a strong 6% for the quarter. Our results were bolstered by strong performance from our flexible Clover platform, our global suite of e-commerce and omni-channel solutions and our leading suite of ISV solutions. Clover gross payment volume grew 30% to $33 billion in the quarter and more than $130 billion annualized, and active merchant outlets increased nearly 10% sequentially. While the growth rate is not fully recovered to pre-COVID levels, it is impressive given the economic environment and considering that Clover tends to serve small- and medium-sized merchants, which are later in the recovery cycle. We continue to extend the breadth of services to Clover merchants with innovative solutions that enhance convenience like scan-to-order, which was launched recently to allow consumers to scan a QR code to order and pay directly from their table. Our integrated payments, or ISV business, is performing very well with adjusted revenue growth of nearly 50% in the quarter and is approaching pre-COVID growth rates. Our differentiated solutions for both ISVs and their merchants are driving excellent results, and we expect this business to be a strong grower for many years. Adjusted operating income in the Acceptance segment increased 8% to $425 million in the quarter. Adjusted operating margin was up 180 basis points in the quarter to 29.2%. Year-to-date adjusted operating income was $931 million, and adjusted operating margin was down 370 basis points to 23.5% due to the revenue impact of COVID. On our second quarter earnings call, I shared our expectations that this segment margin would improve significantly in the second half of 2020 by more than 800 basis points sequentially, with the majority of that benefit expected to come in Q3. The adjusted operating margin in the quarter was up over 1,000 basis points, primarily driven by improved revenue, including the timing reversal of the network assessment fees compared to the first half of the year, which will not be as pronounced in the fourth quarter. Adjusted operating margin improvement was also driven by continued progress in cost synergies and BAMS cost benefits. The Fintech segment saw internal revenue in line with the prior year's quarters as growth in high-quality recurring revenue was offset by much lower periodic revenue and specifically, termination fees, which created about 300 basis points of headwind to internal revenue growth in the quarter. Importantly, processing revenue was up 5% in the quarter, which demonstrated the scale and leverage in the business. Year-to-date internal revenue is also in line with prior year. We continue to see strong demand for our broad array of digital solutions. Total mobile subscribers across our leading digital platforms, Mobiliti and Architect, grew 15% in the quarter to more than 11 million users. Despite the pandemic, we implemented more clients on Architect than in any previous quarter, which should help bolster growth into 2021. Adjusted operating income was up a very strong 19% in the quarter to $265 million and is up 11% year-to-date to $721 million. Adjusted operating margin increased 600 basis points in the quarter to 36.4% on a combination of growth in processing revenue, operational effectiveness benefits and cost synergies. Year-to-date adjusted operating margin was up 390 basis points to 33.4%. We continue to deliver client value across this highly scaled business with increasing efficiency and effectiveness, partially offset by the decline in periodic revenue. We're also pleased with the synergy benefits, which are positively impacting segment performance in areas such as technology infrastructure and procurement. The Payments and Network segment internal revenue growth was 1% in the quarter and up four percentage points sequentially. Growth in our card services and output solutions businesses, including the benefit of revenue synergies, was partially offset by COVID-driven weakness in our prepaid, credit processing and biller businesses globally. Internal revenue through September 30 is in line with prior year. The revenue improvements we saw throughout the second quarter continued in the third quarter. We were especially pleased to see a normalization in our debit business in the quarter as transaction growth was back to mid-single digits in the quarter and up significantly over the second quarter. We continue to see excellent transaction growth in solutions such as account transfers and P2P, which again were nearly doubled compared to the prior year's quarter and up 21% sequentially. The number of clients live on Zelle grew more than fourfold compared to a year ago, and we expect to see meaningful growth across our electronic money movement solutions as consumers move money in a more real-time world. Adjusted operating income for the segment was strong, up 8% to $608 million in the quarter and is up 6% to $1.7 billion through September 30. Adjusted operating margin was up 310 basis points to 43.5% in the quarter and was up 280 basis points to 42.3% year-to-date. The positive impact of revenue synergies, operational efficiency and cost synergy performance is driving our strong bottom line performance. The adjusted corporate operating loss was $117 million in the third quarter, with the year-over-year and sequential increase in the quarter driven primarily by timing of variable compensation and incremental COVID expenses. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter increased as expected to about 23% compared to 22% in prior year period. Our adjusted effective tax rate through September 30 is 20.5%, and we continue to expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate to be generally in line with the prior year. As we shared last quarter, our capital allocation focus for the second half of the year is debt repayment after repurchasing 14 million shares for $1.4 billion in the first half of the year. We repaid $769 million of debt in the quarter, $1 billion year-to-date, and expect to pay down at least $1.5 billion for the full year. Total debt outstanding was $21.3 billion at September 30, and debt-to-adjusted EBITDA dropped to 3.7 times. We are well on track to achieve our leverage target in the second half of 2021 on the basis of both strong adjusted EBITDA growth and debt repayment. We remain fully committed to our long-standing capital strategy, which includes maintaining a strong balance sheet, organic investment in innovation, high-value acquisitions and, most important, share repurchase remains our primary benchmark for capital deployment. With that, let me turn the call back to Frank for our financial outlook for the rest of the year. Thanks, Dave. Yes, Dave, a couple of things you pointed out there. One, as we indicated in our prepared remarks upfront, we saw very nice improvement off the bottoms, the low back in April through July and then saw some leveling off into August, September and even through October at this point. And our expectation right now is for that to continue. Obviously, a lot going on in the world, a fair amount of potential variability in that. From a periodic revenue standpoint, we actually do anticipate continued headwind into fourth quarter, both from the standpoint of terminations and licensing revenue, a combination of periodic revenue. It will be more pronounced in the Fintech segment but also we're seeing some of that in the Payments segment. So the brand assessment fees, we expected to rebound meaningfully in the second half of the year after we come off that difficult second quarter. We saw that absolutely come through in third quarter. And we expected that to bounce more meaningfully in the third quarter, a bit more to come to us in the fourth quarter. So sequentially, you'll see less of a ramp that we did, that we got the benefit of in the third quarter. In terms of kind of ongoing margin, I'm not quite ready to give you a guidance for 2021, but I will tell you that in the Merchant segment and, quite frankly, across the company, we feel very good about the cost actions we've taken, being permanent improvement. And as we get revenue growth across a very scaled business, we think these margin improvements can hold into the future. Thanks, Dave. Yes. We didn't actually cite it in the opening remarks. I would say we probably picked up about 2/3 of that in the third quarter. Thank you. Just quickly, to add to that, this is an area that we're absolutely investing in: in digital matters, payments, risk, capabilities to bring to those financial institutions in our fintech space, and we continue to bring additional products and services, and that's helping us win those cores as well as win digital users that you had us talk about. Yes, absolutely. And I made comments about this upfront. The cost -- the margin improvement that we're seeing this year, including the 300 basis point expansion that we had in the third quarter, is absolutely driven by permanent cost-out. It's one of the things that we actually talked about a year ago when we frequently got the question of how will you perform in an economic downturn, never anticipating that it would be driven by a pandemic and show up in 2020. What we said was, look, you know what, if we're headed for an economic downturn in the near term, we will have, at the time, $900 million, now $1.2 billion worth of cost synergies. And we've been working since the beginning of the year, particularly as the pandemic hit and we saw the economic downturn coming, to accelerate those cost synergies. And in fact, back in mid-March is when we announced the increase from $900 million to $1.2 billion. So the cost actions that we're taking are permanent cost actions. They are not in reaction to the COVID dynamic that you are seeing from a number of places. So we're not doing pay cuts or furloughs or things like that, that naturally come back into the business when the economy comes back. That's why we believe the margin improvement is sustainable, and we have future opportunity ahead of us as we continue to drive our cost synergies and then move to operational effectiveness into the future. Probably about five, six weeks."

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I will turn the call over to Peter Poillon, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv.\nPeter Poillon: Thank you and good afternoon. With me on the call today are Jeff Yabuki our Executive Chairman; Frank Bisignano, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and supplemental materials for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about among other matters, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, expected operating and financial results, strategic initiatives and expected benefits and synergies from the First Data acquisition. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. You should refer to our earnings release for discussion of these risk factors. Please refer to our earnings release and supplemental materials for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this call along with the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures, unless stated otherwise performance references made throughout this call are year-over-year comparisons and all references to internal revenue growth are on a constant currency basis. Also, note that non-GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and supplemental materials include the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 results for First Data, which have been prepared by making certain adjustments to the sum of historical First Data and Fiserv GAAP financial information. Lastly, we're holding an Investor Day on December 8th in New York City to share our strategic vision, while we intend to host the event in person with appropriate protocols as circumstances allow, we'll also prepare to broadcast the content for those who prefer that approach. We look forward to seeing you at this important event. And now I will turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeffery W. Yabuki: Thanks, Peter, and good afternoon everyone. A lot has changed at Fiserv's since we announced Q1 results. Coming off, tremendous financial performance in January and February, we hit the COVID-19 cliff in the second half of March which further worsened in April. At our May 7th call, we shared our thesis that April would be the likely trough and we expected to see gradual improvement from there and that is exactly what has happened. Each month revenue has improved sequentially from the lows of April and culminated with a return to internal revenue growth in July. Clearly, the results are not what any of us expected prior to the pandemic. However, we are quite pleased with our overall performance, the resilience and strength to produce nearly $900 million of free cash flow in the quarter, and tremendous sales momentum, which reinforces our market-leading value propositions and further positions us for accelerated growth. We successfully completed the dissolution of the BAMS joint venture on July 1st. As part of this, we welcomed nearly 120,000 direct clients to Fiserv and inked the new processing agreement with the bank as their provider for Merchant Services. We are grateful to Bank of America for their partnership and are excited about our future. On July 29th we marked the one-year anniversary of closing our historic merger. We've made tremendous integration progress while continuing to invest in our future. We've also gained significant confidence in the size and scope of the opportunity and wrapped up a series of first year accomplishments including generating $3.5 billion of free cash flow. We allocated more than $1.7 billion to share repurchase, well ahead of schedule and also repaid $1.1 billion of debt. We raised our cost synergy target by a third to $1.2 billion and increased our revenue synergy goal by 20% to $600 million, and of that in the first 12 months we have actioned $750 million of cost synergies and $160 million of revenue synergies. Interest expense has been reduced by nearly $290 million annually, which when combined with synergies actioned is more than $1.1 billion of run-rate pre-tax earnings in the first 12 months of what was originally set as a five-year journey. And sales, as measured in annual contract value, grew 15% over the prior year, supporting the power of our combined value proposition. Overall, these proof points are representative of our commitment to delivering on the promise of Fiserv in the client's office, harnessing the power of the best associate team in the industry and delivering sustained above-market returns for our shareholders. And last, we effectuated a seamless CEO transition to Frank on July 1st, seamless because Frank and I have been working closely together since the transaction was announced as we are today. And seamless because Frank continues to bring his leadership and commitment to deliver superior results against our proven Fiserv shareholder value creation strategies. As both an advocate and large shareholder, I assure you that the company is in fantastic hands with Frank at the helm. With that, let me turn the call over to our new CEO.\nFrank J. Bisignano: Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon everyone. Let me start by thanking Jeff for his tremendous partnership since we started talking about merging our two great companies almost two years ago and working closely together the last 18 months on the integration. I'm excited to lead this great company, which Jeff has led brilliantly for the last 15 years. While we, all of us, have been navigating the global pandemic, Fiserv has faced those challenges with a clear mandate of serving our clients with excellence, while keeping our associated safe and healthy. The great progress we've made on those fronts is manifesting in accelerated integration, improving results and much stronger than anticipated sales. Importantly revenue has shown sequential improvement each month since April bow. In June, we saw just 1% decline in internal revenue and we returned to internal revenue growth in the month of July. As Jeff mentioned, we have made great progress in the first year actioning over $1.1 billion of incremental pre-tax earnings as new Fiserv and we are highly confident of the additional value ahead. In addition to our financial accomplishments, I'm thrilled with how our value proposition is coming together in the client's office. We closed a number of terrific deals in the second quarter, with sales up a very strong 38% over the prior year and 20% year-to-date. Our excellent momentum continued into July with two important competitive takeaways in our credit card processing business. We were selected to provide issuer processing solutions by Atlanticus Holdings and Genesis Financial Services, both leading providers of consumer credit solutions. And each on their own would rank among the top 25 largest card portfolios in the U.S. based on active accounts. Larger issuer's choose Fiserv for a variety of reasons, including our highly configurable processing platform, breadth of integrated digital solutions, and a client-centric approach. We expect both of these important clients to go live with our market-leading solutions next year. The resilience and diversity of our revenue was evident in our second quarter as we navigated a very difficult macro environment and generally delivered results above internal expectations across most key performance measures. Internal revenue declined 7% in the quarter and is down only 2% for the first half of the year. This performance is a strong testament to the great work by our people to deliver value for clients, regardless of the difficulty in the end market. Adjusted earnings per share in the quarter was down 4% to $0.93 driven primarily by COVID weakness. Adjusted EPS through June 30th is up 6% to $1.92 on excellent cost and revenue synergy performance and the strength and scale and breadth of our business. Importantly, we generated nearly $900 million of free cash flow in the quarter, up 23% over the comparable quarter and up 13% to $1.7 billion through June 30th. Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we repurchased 5.7 million shares for $550 million in the quarter and for the year-to-date, have repurchased 14.3 million shares for $1.4 billion. In dealing with these unchartered waters, we have put our energy and focus on sustainable actions, such as cost synergy acceleration, that we believe will make us stronger and more profitable for the long-term. We delivered $155 million of cost synergies in the second quarter results alone and now expect to book at least $550 million of cost synergy savings in 2020. We've actioned nearly $700 million, of our $1.2 billion target through the end of the second quarter and $750 million through the end of July. Revenue synergies are progressing equally well with continued strong performance in network innovation, bank merchant and cross-selling our market leading solutions across the company. For example, we were able to add our DNA account processing solution for a new clients digital bank, where we were initially awarded credit processing. Revenue synergies sales in annual contract value were more than $50 million in the second quarter. We saw continued strength in our bank merchant synergy program, even with the COVID slowed down, adding 42 new bank merchant clients in the quarter and nearly 70% were competitive takeaways. We signed more than 160 banks and credit unions in our first full year and have a very strong pipeline of nearly 400 institutions. Overall, we had actioned a $130 million in annualized revenue synergies through June and are in a great position to achieve $600 million revenue synergy grow. We signed 17 new core account processing clients in the quarter. 99 DNA including Northwest Federal Credit Union, one of the largest credit unions in Virginia with $3.4 billion in assets and United Federal Credit Union with $2.9 billion in assets. Another important highlight was South State Bank, an existing Fiserv Premier account processing client, which recently merged with CenterState Bank and selected Fiserv's core platform. And a number of additional solutions for their newly combined $38 billion institution. Even in these challenging times, our leading solutions continue to win in the market. Our industry-leading digital and electronic payment solutions such as Mobiliti, CardValet, Architect, TransferNow and Zelle have us incredibly well-positioned to support our clients in the digital transformation, which we believe is further accelerated by the pandemic. One excellent prove point on our digital momentum was in a recent competitive win with Northwest Bank, a long-term Fiserv's client who expanded our existing relationship to establish us as their strategic digital partner. Northwest added a number of new digital solutions led by Architect, our single digital platform, as well as a number of other customer-centric solutions, which will enable them to offer a more innovative and integrated solution for their clients. In our card-issuing business, we signed a important renewal with PNC, extending our long-term partnership with the seventh-largest bank in the U.S. for both credit and debit processing. Bank of Baroda, one of India's leading public sector banks awarded us their credit card processing in the quarter. When live, we will provide card processing services for four of the top six issuers in India. Prior to the onset of COVID, our merchant business had displayed it's emerging strength recording high single-digit internal revenue growth through all of 2019 and further accelerating to low-double digits in the first few months of this year. Even in the pandemic our merchant business has performed very well relative to the market and we believe is even better position going forward. That strength is attributable to a number of factors including the size and scale of our distribution network, geographic reach, diversity in diverse industry coverage, our Clover platform and rapidly growing and leading digital technologies, including e-commerce and ISV. Clover gross payment volume is recovering well from the weakness it experienced early in the quarter with GPV up 24% in June and was up 32% in July. GPV for the quarter was $23.4 billion or more than $90 billion annualized. Simply stated, our Clover strategy is to grow the number of clients using our platform asset is important. To extend the breadth of services offered to these clients. We're creating deeper client relationships through solutions such as virtual terminal and online ordering that were rolled out in Q2 and are seeing solid early adoption rates. We are pleased to see our digital merchant acquiring platforms riding the growing wave of digital transactions across a variety of industries and geographies. We are seeing accelerated sales momentum in e-commerce solutions, adding 50 new clients in the quarter, 86 year-to-date and a 144 over the last 12 months. As the pandemic spurs the need for innovation, we are seeing our investments in omnichannel merchant capabilities, such as order-ahead to pick up in-store gain even more traction. As a leader in this space, we provide omnichannel solutions to nine of the top 15 QSRs including McDonalds, Chick-fil-A, Taco Bell and Dunkin' Donuts. In Q2 alone these QSR transactions more than doubled to greater than $50 million per month. Given the demand we are expanding these capabilities into more verticals such as grocery as well as other geographic markets around the world. Our integrated payments continue to perform well, expanding our number of partners by more than 20% in the quarter. In spite of COVID, our ISV revenue was up double digits in the quarter. We remain focused on driving additional differentiation to capture additional market share in this space. Overall, we're very pleased with our first half performance in this challenging time. The combination of integration benefits the payoff from targeted investments and delivering new innovation that clients' needs, is translating to significant sales and market momentum, which we will expect will both support growth today and well instead of future. With that, let me pass the discussion to Bob for more detail on the financial results.\nRobert W. Hau: Thank you Frank and good afternoon everyone. We turned in a relatively strong performance in the face of a tumultuous impact COVID-19 had on business and consumer activity around the world, displaying the resilience and strength of our business. Total company internal revenue declined 7% in the quarter, driven by a significant impact of lower transactional volume associated with the global pandemic. Importantly, as Frank mentioned earlier, we saw internal revenue steadily improve as the quarter progressed with June internal revenue down just 1%. The monthly improvements continued into July with company internal revenue growth turning positive for the first time since February. Year to date, internal revenue has declined just 2% due to the strength of the business and better than anticipated progress on actual revenue synergies, which were $38 million in the quarter and are $65 million year-to-date. We now expect to be above the midpoint of our 2020 revenue synergy estimate of $75 million to $100 million. Although not in the category of formal guidance or outlook, based on what we can see today we estimate that our internal revenue is likely to be in the range of plus or minus flat for the year. Second quarter adjusted operating income decreased 14% to $927 million, which includes a 2 percentage point negative impact from dispositions and decreased 7% to $1.9 billion through June 30th. Adjusted operating margin of 28.8% in the quarter declined 90 basis points compared to the prior year but improved 100 basis points sequentially. Adjusted operating margin through June 30th declined 50 basis points to 28.3%. As anticipated, adjusted operating margin for both the quarter and the year were severely pressured by the COVID related decline in revenue and the associated expenses, timing of brand assessments and prior year dispositions, partially offset by $155 million of expense synergies achieved in the quarter. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share declined 4% to $0.93, compared to $0.97 in the prior year, as adjusted for the investment services transactions that closed in Q1. Adjusted earnings per share through June 30th has increased 6% to $1.92, setting the stage to achieve our 35th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings-per-share growth. Free cash flow in the quarter was excellent, up 23% to $895 million and up 13% to $1.7 billion year-to-date. Free cash flow conversion for the quarter was a stellar 142% and is 126% year-to-date. This performance was driven by strong working capital, timing of settlement activity in our merchant business and lower capital spending for the combined company. Our impressive free cash flow is the result of our resilient business, mission critical solutions and significant transaction synergies. We expect free cash flow for the second half of the year to remain strong, as cost synergies continue to ramp and we further capitalize on opportunities to drive efficiency across the company. Looking into the segments, internal revenue in the Merchant Acceptance segment, which has been the most impacted by the pandemic, declined 15% for the quarter and is down 5% through June 30th. As the world has begun to gradually reopen, we've seen improving transaction and volume metrics leading to improving revenue performance. In fact, we closed the quarter with acceptance internal revenue down just 2% in June, and in July returned to positive growth. As you've heard, we are seeing improving business trends in the segment. Clover GPV has improved steadily from April through July and Clover units shipped are back to positive territory ending June of 9% year-over-year. Total e-commerce transactions were up 26% in the quarter and omnichannel transactions gained even more steam. Some of the key deals in the quarter include sale of eCom solutions toward in store card processing for California DMV along with eCom solutions for six new regional grocers, including two more in the top-ten. Among the number of wins globally, we added both card present and card-not-present solutions for McDonald's in Germany and omnichannel solutions to Burger King in the U.K. Adjusted operating income in the Acceptance segment decreased 47% to $223 million in the quarter on an adjusted revenue decline of just over $300 million, and adjusted operating margin declined 950 basis points to 19.1%. Year-to-date adjusted operating income was $506 million and operating margin was down 700 basis points to 20.2%. A combination of sharp COVID revenue decline and associated expenses, negatively impacted second quarter margin by nearly 800 basis points. The timing of network assessment fees in the quarter, which is expected to reverse in the second half of the year was almost 300 basis point headwind. These two factors alone, which total roughly 1100 basis points of negative margin impact, more than offset the substantial and sustained positive impact of cost synergy actions in both the second quarter and year-to-date. You will also recall that Q2 is the anniversary of the BAMS deferred revenue item. So, we will no longer be a headwind in the second half of the year. We expect Acceptance segment adjusted operating margin to improve significantly over the remainder of the year to a level above last year's pre-COVID results, with the majority of the gain coming in Q3. This improvement is expected to be driven by improving merchant volumes in revenue, cost synergy actions ramping over the remainder of the year and the reversal of the network assessment timing headwind. We now expect Acceptance segment adjusted operating margin to be up sequentially at least 800 basis points to more than 28% for the second half of the year. As Jeff mentioned, the BAMS dissolution was successfully completed as of July 1st. We have realigned our cost structure as expected, which will reduce our expenses, run rate below the proportional level within the joint venture. Importantly, the dissolution moves a significant amount of scale and the resulting revenue to our small business, middle-market and enterprise client book. As a result, the size of our direct e-commerce and digitally oriented revenue has grown meaningfully and should lead to future growth and expansion, given the macro characteristics of these attractive markets. The Fintech segment internal revenue declined 1% for the quarter as growth in high quality recurring processing revenue was offset by lower periodic revenue, such as license and termination fees, largely due to the pandemic. Year-to-date Internal revenue was in line with prior year, revenue in this segment tends to be quite resilient due in large part to the mentioned critical nature of the solutions and as much less susceptible to variation due to macroeconomic impacts. In addition to the 17 new core comp processing wins in the quarter, we are seeing even more demand for our broad array of digital solutions. Mobiliti ASP subscribers increased 6% in the quarter to more than 9.3 million, and Architect, our single digital platform, had growth of 56% to 3 million users. Adjusted operating income was up a very strong 14% in the quarter to $252 million and is up 8% year-to-date to $456 million. Adjusted operating margin was up significantly in the quarter increasing 520 basis points to 35.4% and a combination of cost synergies and operational effectiveness, offset somewhat by lower periodic revenue. Year-to-date adjusted operating margin was up 280 basis points, as we deliver client-value across the scale business with increasing efficiency and effectiveness. The Payments and Network segment internal revenue declined by 3% in the quarter. COVID impacts pressure a global credit issuer processing, prepaid and biller businesses and were partially offset by growth in card services and output solutions in part, benefiting from revenue synergies. Internal revenue through June 30th is comparable to the prior year. Revenue in this segment tends to be driven by transactions and/or accounts, and tends to be fairly resilient in a typical recessionary periods. But this pandemic has been different, for example, debit oriented transactions, which have historically been very resilient were impacted much more than prior recessionary periods and have solidly improved, consistent with the reopening, since the trough in early April. Debit transactions were down in low-single digits in the quarter, improving from down 20% percent early in April to being up mid-single digits in the second half of June and through July. Conversely, we are seeing strong growth in solutions such as the account-to-account transfers and P2P, which is up nearly double the prior year's quarter, and up 20% sequentially. The number of clients live on Zelle has further accelerated, increasing more than five fold, compared to a year ago and is up 31% sequentially. We continue our bullishness on the role of electronic money movement and Zelle specifically, as the pandemic pressures legacy ways of moving money. Adjusted operating income for the segment improved 1% to $558 million in the quarter and is up 5% to $1.1 billion through June 30th. Adjusted operating margin was up a very strong 220 basis points to 42% in the quarter and is up 250 basis points, to 41.6% year-to-date. The positive impact of revenue synergies, operational efficiency and strong cost synergy performance is driving current results with continuing runway for future expansion. The adjusted corporate operating loss in the quarter improved 5% to $106 million in Q2 and a 7% better to $200 million year-to-date, primarily due to cost synergies. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter improved 20.5%, primarily due to the benefit of geographic mix of earnings and discrete tax items. Our adjusted effective tax rate is 19% through June 30th and we now expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate to be just below 22%, in line with the prior year and modestly better than previously expected. We continue to allocate capital to build shareholder value, repurchasing 5.7 million shares for $550 million in the quarter and 14.3 million shares for $1.4 billion year-to-date. As you will recall, we began repurchasing shares much earlier than originally anticipated, given the strength of free cash flow even while meeting our debt commitments. As of June 30th we had 670 million shares outstanding and about 7.5 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase. We repaid $100 million of debt in the quarter and total debt outstanding, which is now 85% fixed rate amounted to $21.9 billion. Debt to adjusted EBITDA was 3.9 times as of June 30th and we remain committed to achieving our leverage target by the second half of 2021. We expect to repay more than $1.5 billion in 2020 and therefore we'll allocate a large part -- percentage of our free cash flow to debt repayment for the balance of the year. Finally, let me call your attention to our Q2 earnings slides available in Investor Relations section of our website. Page 9 provides a summary of the financial integration milestones we have achieved in the first year as a combined company, some of which Jeff highlighted in his remarks. Even in the face of this global pandemic, we have taken actions that have locked in more than $1.1 billion of run rate pre-tax earnings, well ahead of our original objectives, and have much more opportunity ahead. While we are pleased with the integration performance to date, we remain committed to unlocking the potential we have in Fiserv to deliver even more differentiated value for our clients, as well as you, our shareholders. With that, let me call -- turn the call back to Frank.\nFrank J. Bisignano: Thanks, Bob. We believe one of the most important aspects of the transformational acquisition of First Data was the commitment to allocate an incremental $500 million to support innovation. This commitment is unique to Fiserv, and we expect this program to create differentiated value for clients, opportunity for our associates, and incremental growth for our shareholders. We will provide a detailed update on our priorities and progress at our December Investor Day. Based on our strong performance and sales momentum in the first half of the year, coupled with the trends we are seeing in our end markets, we are providing new 2020 financial outlook. For adjusted earnings per share to grow at least 10% over last year's level, adjusted for divestitures or at least $4.33 per share for the full year. Our 2020 outlook does not contemplate a sweeping second wave of shelter orders or other circumstances, which creates significant economic duress in the second half of the year. We are pleased with our financial performance in the midst of pandemic uncertainty. We returned to positive internal growth in July and expect to achieve our 35th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings-per-share growth. The combination of market momentum along with the $1.1 billion of actions we have already taken, give us increased confidence in delivering strong results in '21 and beyond. Diversity and inclusion have long been core principles of our award-winning people platform. At the same time, we are addressing the significant societal changes, which we believe will have a lasting impact on both life and business as we know it. Through listening and acting upon what we are learning, we are confident we will build a stronger and even more highly committed team. Back in June, we launched our back-to-business program, which supports minority and black-owned small businesses in the areas that have been hardest hit by the pandemic and social unrest. Working directly with local chambers of commerce, we have committed at least $10 million in grants, along with our best talent to help these businesses succeed and thrive. We are on the grounds in Brooklyn and Queens and we'll also expand to other markets such as Atlanta, Chicago, Miami, and Oakland. We have already brought business coaching and payment solutions to hundreds of businesses and expect to help multiples more as that program expands. Last, let me thank our more than 40,000 talented associates around the world for their commitment and courage each day as we stand together to deliver value for clients, our colleagues and you, our shareholders. With that, let's open the line up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. Good to hear your voices Jeff, Frank and Bob.\nJeffery W. Yabuki: Hey David.\nDavid Togut: Encouraging to see the return to internal growth in the merchant acceptance business in July. Could you talk about the sustainability of that organic growth continuing, specifically for Merchant in the back half of the year and any thoughts you have on underlying drivers would be helpful?\nFrank J. Bisignano: Yeah. So, we feel very strong about that sustainable growth. What you hear us talk about, if you look at that business in total, we think the investments that we've made over time have really paid off. You hear us talk about the wins we have in e-com. So that's a tailwind for us. You look at the double-digit growth we talked about in our ISV business, you look at the GPV running through Clover, right now, that we've talked about and the growth of it. And then we have talked about the 162 bank merchant synergy sales which actually have no economics in our numbers yet, but you should expect that to continue, and that's a very, very integrated solution that promise that we would bring together core processing clients and bank merchant and help them grow that business for their institutions. And then I think if you think about the diversity of our client base, you hear us talk about what went on in those omnichannel transactions for the QSRs where we have a leading position, and then you also think about the geographic diversity that we have, which really we think is somewhat unparalleled. So our client diversity, our geographic diversity, and then our integrated solutions, we think we have the broadest and best solution set in the industry, and with all of that, we see very, very strong opportunity is -- the trough was deep but to be back to IRG and the type of GPV, we talked about, what Clover really, really gives us is high confidence about the future.\nRobert W. Hau: And Dave...\nDavid Togut: Great and just a quick follow-up if I could, reinstating the 2020 guidance is very encouraging. Could you talk through dimensioning of expectations for Q3 versus Q4?\nRobert W. Hau: Yeah, David, it's Bob. Just real quick back on your other question too, I would point out that the return to growth was beyond our merchant business, total company return to growth. So we feel quite good about the progressive improvement we saw throughout the quarter. And in fact, to your second question, that leads us to get our confidence to give the guidance of at least 10% EPS growth. In particular, we will see a nice improvement as I mentioned in my prepared remarks in our merchant margin, the majority of that 800 basis point improvement, second half over first half is sequential improvement will come in third quarter. So we'll see a nice pickup from one of our largest segments in the business and as revenue comes back in those other two businesses, that's a nice scale of opportunities. So we're looking forward to really overall having a strong second half.\nDavid Togut: Got it. Just a quick final question on Virgin Atlantic, since that seems to be in the news quite a bit. Could you dimension your financial exposure to Virgin Atlantic as they go through their bankruptcy proceedings?\nRobert W. Hau: Yeah, I can't give you an overall number but I can tell you absolutely that we've been working closely with them, like all of our client partners in terms of supporting them as they restructure their business as one of their creditors and the filling -- the Chapter 15 filing, you saw yesterday was part of that overall process but bottom line is, we feel we're in good shape. I don't see any issue. We continue to process for them and I feel comfortable our position overall.\nDavid Togut: Understood, thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we have Dave Koning from Baird. Your line is open.\nDavid J. Koning: Yeah. Hey, guys great job.\nFrank J. Bisignano: Thanks, David.\nDavid J. Koning: Yeah. I guess my first question a little bit like David's question to how sustainable are the growth in the other two segments. It seems like if the total company return to growth and Merchant did it, seems like the other two, probably did too in July. And maybe along with that, how big was the periodic impact in the financial tech business, I know that's the highly sustainable and highly recurring business, maybe just so we can understand if that grew in Q2 on a core basis.\nFrank J. Bisignano: Yes. So I think when you look at the sales numbers we're talking about and how the company is coming together, it's beyond the expectations we had. We always viewed that we had this opportunity to come together and the client saw the same. And if you think about, we talked about, we've had more than 340 total synergy sales and then we also just have the general growth there. You hear about the Architect business up 56%. So in the totality of what we're dealing here, we actually believe that this company has very good growth in the second half relative to the trough that we saw. And so I think there you should feel that it's all, all elements of the company will be growing. You heard us talking about those credit wins and we had ones prior to that and the e-com wins, so across the board.\nJeffery W. Yabuki: And David, in terms of your question about the periodic revenue, the Fintech segment would have grown, had we not had the headwind from periodic revenue, call it, really high-single digit headwind and some of that was absolutely driven by what we think is COVID impact, particularly in the license side of that.\nDavid J. Koning: Got you. No, that's helpful. And I guess my follow up with the BAMS JV being disassembled now. How -- are you going to start, including those revenues back in your revenue or you going to continue to exclude them the way, just kind of understand your accounting behind it going forward.\nJeffery W. Yabuki: Yeah. So from a standpoint, first of all, they are in our numbers, they're not included in our growth rate or internal revenue growth rate. The adjustment that we started making as the dissolution took effect, we essentially will follow our standard practice for acquisitions and divestitures and excluded for one year forward and then pull it back in.\nDavid J. Koning: Got you. Great, well thanks and great job.\nJeffery W. Yabuki: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we have Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nDarrin Peller: All right, thanks guys. If we hit on the some of the digital areas that you're growing so well in Clover up 30% you mentioned, e-com I think you said over 20% or 26%. But when you combine that with omni and digital banking, can you talk to us about -- I mean if you could just hit on all the areas that you think are really performing well given the pandemic, maybe accelerated. And where you come out on the other side of this, what are the areas of your business that you're taking share and as a result. And then maybe just talk a little more about Clover firm, because the growth rate there 32% with I think in the $90 billion annualized GPV, was obviously a strong number. So, just I'm curious to hear what the strategy there is, and if you can sustain those kinds of growth rates?\nFrank J. Bisignano: Well, I think, first of all, if you look across the businesses and as we go across all of the, we have had a deep bent in digital. We've invested heavily in digital and that's why you see us when those type of deals like Atlantic is and Genesis, because of that you see Architect, really winning in the market in some ways. You see us being selected by many is their digital provider, right. And so, we believe the sustainability is high, relative to it. We think in some cases acceleration will occur given the amount of investment we've put into it. I think and we think about in global nature too we have a lot going on in Latin America, where you will see some classic innovative solutions where we take all of our capabilities and bring it to the client. I think if you look at the -- during this pandemic we have almost vested into it. So you don't see us doing anything other than adding resources in the areas like Clover and ISV and your watch that whole integrated solution come together, only adding resources in our credit processing group and not pulling back on anything. We use the synergy opportunity to save money and that acceleration's coming through well. But we consider COVID to have more growth opportunity, then you see right now, even at that set of numbers you heard. And we think our core banking platform has it as does our card processing. And then if you think about what we're going to do with the potential of this ecosystem, as we bring in Zelle and our other Mobiliti assets, our ability for the client's benefit is going to be very, very strong. And those are one of things Jeff and I talked about when we started and why we're playing the $500 million into innovation ultimately to be able to continue that sustained drive, Darrin.\nDarrin Peller: Okay. That's really helpful. I just wanted to actually ask one follow-up on the capital allocation strategy of the company. Just, during the pandemic, there is a lot of considerations, but you bought back some stock this quarter. Looking forward, obviously, especially with the transition from Jeff to you, Frank. Should we consider 2021-'22 still years where the legacy strategy for Pfizer, for who capital allocation and share buyback is similar still? Thank you.\nFrank J. Bisignano: Yeah, I don't want -- I wanted to limit it '21 and '22 maybe, is what I would say is, one of the things I signed up here and one of the great things I loved about what how Jeff had brilliantly led the company, was the capital allocation strategy. And I think we owe it to our shareholders to continue to put them as our first priority in every dollar we spend. And so I would consider that and tried and true strategy just flow throughout. I mean, 100% and I don't think it's a '21 issue or '22 issue, that's tried and true forever.\nDarrin Peller: Great.\nOperator: Thank you. Next we have Matt O'Neill from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nMatt O'Neill: Yeah, hi. Thank you guys for taking my call or my question. I asked a similar question about previously. So I think, it fair to ask you as well. I think there is an understanding that coming out of the pandemic, the secular acceleration on things like electronification of payments is well understood. However, part of the thesis that I think is equally compelling here is the newfound desire from your bank customers to potentially incrementally outsource to modernize their digital and mobile footprints and possibly reallocating investment dollars away from things like branches or ATMs or other items. So would you say that there is a newfound enthusiasm from your customer base for a lot of the incremental services that you're able to provide and any of the, the pipeline is maybe as robust as ever along those lines.\nFrank J. Bisignano: Yeah, well I think the pandemic accelerated everything people talk about digital. Maybe what people thought, would take five years, it I will take two years or less than that, I mean you've watched us build capability in digital much faster than maybe we would have thought, it would have taken before and our clients are fully engaged it in. So I think speed matters and clients are completely committed to being digital-first and we're committed to deliver in digital-first for them.\nMatt O'Neill: Thanks, Frank. And just as a quick follow-up point of clarification I believe what I heard on the capital allocation front for the remainder of the year was a focus on debt pay down, which is certainly reasonable, but could you just confirm that, that's correct. And then presumably once the leverage gets down to the targeted range next year, the share repurchases would really kick in in earnest.\nJeffery W. Yabuki: Yeah, Matt, I would say we've demonstrated an ability to do both. We've done that over the years, we've done that since the merger when we first announced the transaction we suspended share repurchase pending the deal closing, we made commitments on our ability to de-lever, we're well down that path. At the same time, repurchased $1.4 billion in shares and we are paying down some debt to get to our targeted leverage mid next year. There'll be some debt pay down absolutely and I mentioned that in my opening remarks. We'll also see EBITDA growth, that helps create that deleveraging point. So you should absolute expect us to continue to allocate capital both in terms of investing in our business and then free cash flow is split between M&A activity when appropriate, but all through the eyes of a share repurchase and that debt delevering, we've got a really nice quite path to achieve what we set out to achieve by second half of next year and share repurchase has been part of the transaction, since and will continue to be going forward.\nMatt O'Neill: Very fair. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Next we have Ramsey El Assal from Barclays. Your line is open.\nRamsey El Assal: Hi, thanks so much for taking my question today. I wanted to ask a little bit about the, about the BAMS JV dissolution and I guess first, can you sort of dimensionalize the magnitude and kind of cadence of the expense savings coming out of that, is that I didn't think I heard you mention that it was a contributor to large increase in margins and merchant next quarter and then also just in terms of the merchants you selected in that JV, are there any, is the tying with Bank of America and/or the pandemic creating any additional kind of like attrition or retention concerns around those merchants?\nFrank J. Bisignano: No, I'd go back to -- if you go back to last July, when we talked about how this will perform and where we are today, we feel great about our partnership with the bank, we feel great about, probably one of the dissolution, you've seen in industry with zero friction, then expanding, processing agreement for five years beyond our current processing for them and the bank has just been a great partner through it and we feel as good as we did ever. So I just, start with that and think ultimately both parties end up with a very, very strong good situation, but ultimately we do see cost take out and we do see growth opportunity as we talked about, maybe better than what we talked about last July. I will let Bob take you to a couple of more deeper details, it started at the highest level that this dissolution was hugely successful for both Institutions.\nJeffery W. Yabuki: Yeah, I'd -- Just to add, Ramsey to your specific question. I did point out that as of July 1st with the dissolution completed we do see our overall expenses below the level of proportionate share that we had back when the JV was in place. And so we will see a lift in margins because of that in the second half of this year. Not all of that is yet behind us, but a big chunk of it is with the effectiveness of dissolution on July 1.\nRamsey El Assal: Okay, and the second part of the question was just around any type of attrition characteristics around the merchants that you've basically pulled from the JV, whether there is anything that changes the -- any equation in terms of not having the Bank of American connection or maybe the pandemic or anything like that, are these merchants expected to perform on that metric, very similar to your other, the rest of your book effectively?\nFrank J. Bisignano: Yeah, No, we feel very good about it all. We feel very good about it all.\nJeffery W. Yabuki: I would certainly expect them to experience similar characteristics for the rest of our client base.\nRamsey El Assal: Okay, all right, perfect. I'll leave it there. Appreciate it. Thanks so much.\nFrank J. Bisignano: Thanks, Ramsey.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we have Tien-tsin Huang from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hey thanks, hope you can hear me cell service is really bad where I am at. Just a follow-up on Ramsey's question the BAMS merchants, anything to share in terms of type of merchant or the geographic mix of that. I'm just curious how that piece is different than maybe some of the other JV merchants, because I still think the market somewhat under appreciates the mix of what you have inside those JVs.\nFrank J. Bisignano: Well, I mean if you look at it there are some fabulous names, actually the fact of the matter is many of those names were contributed by the original company and we took those back and they're just fabulous household institutional names that we feel so good about as did the bank itself. And then the geographic dispersity would be exactly what, you remember this was a U.S. business, that was really fundamentally it was and at the SMB level, there is a large Clover base on both sides. So, remember these are large Clover consumers that generate very, very good returns and who we actually believe, we will do more with as we go forward, as we bring out even the functions you heard like virtual terminal and order-ahead and other capabilities. So I'd say great geographic dispersity, great reach from small to tall, some of the largest names you'll here and many of them were long-standing deep relationships with the predecessor company.\nJeffery W. Yabuki: Hey Tingen I'd say overall we're quite pleased with how that overall selection process went. We're very happy with the 120,000 merchants, so we picked up and also remember we're still the processor for Bank of America's clients going forward.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Yeah, caught that, with the five year extension, got it. And then just my quick follow up just, I know you'll share a lot more at Investor Day, I don't want to preview that too much, but just the $500 million, I'm curious, how much of that could we expect to allocate toward maybe modernizing some of the platforms I know there's a lot of discussion around modern versus traditional or older platforms and I'm just curious if that's going to be part of the roadmap of the $500 million?\nFrank J. Bisignano: Yeah, I mean we haven't thought on the $500 million in that manner. We actually have been doing that over the past year in a very deep and aggressive manner and been usually successful at it. On that $500 million, we're really talking about next-generation opportunities whether it'd be in deed, whether it'd be in fraud, whether it be in decisioning, so you should expect us to modernize the place away from the $500 million, as annual run rate today.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Got it. Okay, that's good to know. Thanks. And Jeff, hope to see you there in person.\nJeffery W. Yabuki: Me too, thanks.\nFrank J. Bisignano: Hey, man, he will.\nTien-Tsin Huang: 100%/\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we have Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Your line is open.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Thank you. Hi, Jeff, hi Frank and hi Bob good to hear from you, and good job in these circumstances, including free cash flow and sales. I was wondering if you could shed incremental color on sort of 3Q versus 4Q sort of by segment are there any specific, periodic or one-time impacts to watch out for, you, it's great that you are not expecting any periods of duress, like you mentioned, but are you incorporating periods of perhaps plateaued performance up and down, any incremental color would be great.\nJeffery W. Yabuki: Yeah, Ashwin I would say, of the top of my head there is no really big one-timer so to speak or items in the second half that would color Q3 versus Q4. I would expect to continue to see kind of the monthly progress that we've seen through the second quarter ended into July. So August gets a little bit better, September gets a little bit better, October, November, and hopefully, maybe by the end of the year, we get back to whatever normal used to be. I can't remember what that looked like it was so long ago, but we still have progress to go and at this point, we're kind of counting on, or expecting relatively steady progress through the balance of the year. So growth, a little bit stronger in the fourth quarter. But as we see the volume come back in Q3 as I have mentioned, we expect margins to bounce pretty nicely in third quarter.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Got it. And then a follow-up question is on bill payment where you guys obviously have sort of the leading franchise. Can you talk a little bit about the impact of the crisis on that segment given a lot of people find it difficult to pay bills and what not. What are you seeing in that segment, what's the volume dependency of any stimulus or anything like that, that one might expect there.\nFrank J. Bisignano: Yeah, I would treat it like it was a very small impact, not a large impact and stimulus has a little effect, but those clients and we have a fantastic franchise there and without financial institutions, also those clients are pretty -- have been very-very durable during this process.\nJeffery W. Yabuki: I would say, Ashwin that one of the things we saw particularly stimulus coming in movement in Zelle. We saw some nice lift, with that, some real growth come through in sustained. So, it wasn't a one-time sort of a thing. And as you heard us talk, Zelle has been quite positive, both in terms of number of transactions, number of clients signing up, number of clients going live that continues to be a very nice driver for us in our Payment segment.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Got it. Thank you. See you guys in December and maybe hopefully even in November.\nJeffery W. Yabuki: Thanks Ashwin.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Thanks.\nOperator: Thanks. Thank you. Next we have Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBryan Keane: Hi guys, just wanted to get clarification on the margins in Acceptance. The magnitude of the drop, I think, was kind of surprising in below expectations or at least our expectations, but I am almost equally surprised at the bounce back in the margins being that quick, so I get the network assessments plus and minus there, but just thinking about volume and what that means for margins, does that explain a lot of it and how much your synergy is involved here on this bounce back in the margin as well?\nJeffery W. Yabuki: Yeah. So, Bryan, the network assessment fee, as I mentioned is 300 basis points, overall volume being down 15% in a business that's got some good-sized fixed costs really does impact quite substantially. And as those volumes come back, you'll see that lift return, the advantage on the network assessment fees is not only does the headwind side, but actually becomes a tailwind, and so you see a nice recovery there. And then the last item that, kind of, is a or is a change first half to second half is the BAMS deferred revenue, the headwinds ceases because with that lapsed Q2 of last year. So, you don't have the compare in Q3. In terms of synergies, we will continue to generate cost synergies that segment has seen nice progress like the entire company and that will continue into the second half of the year, but I would definitely point to the network assessment fees and timing and as well as just overall volume being a real part of it.\nBryan Keane: Got it. And then just on the other segments, are synergies driving some of the massive improvement we're seeing and Fintech and Payments as well?\nJeffery W. Yabuki: More so in the Payments, but yes, all three of our segments, plus the corporate expenses are seeing some real benefit where we are driving cost out of our technology, largely through our vendor discussions, you see the benefit across all three of the business segments. Our Payment segment is the area where the business is overlapped the most and so you get the more natural takeout other than the corporate functions in that segment. Fintech definitely seeing some benefit on the technology side. They've also been quite successful in what we used to call operational effectiveness or general productivity and taking cost out of that business.\nBryan Keane: Okay, great. Congrats on the execution.\nJeffery W. Yabuki: So the key, here, Bryan, I think is these are permanent cost out. This is cost synergy, this is not temporary actions in response to COVID that will naturally snap back, you haven't heard us announce furloughs or employee pay cuts. This is our effort to to drive synergy a little bit faster, then maybe we would have otherwise maybe not, but definitely our permanent cost out, that won't snap back, as you have to put those cost back into business.\nBryan Keane: Got it. Helpful. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Next we have Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nLisa Ellis: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me in. I was hoping to get a little bit more color on the 38% increase in sales in the quarter, 20% year-to-date. Can you just talk a little bit about where you're seeing that uptick in demand through the pandemic and how sustainable and more secular is it versus some temporary things related to pandemic? Just a little bit more color there. Thank you.\nFrank J. Bisignano: Yeah. I think, first of all, where they're 38% sustainable, you can be quite clear that the year-to-date number has large sustainability to it and when Jeff and I put the Company together, one of the phrases we use is, how we would come together in a client's office. And we're seeing it in multiple ways, and remember that 38% does include those competitive takeaways like Atlantic is or in Genesis, those are July numbers. And we talked about the $50 million of synergy wins in the quarter, it's across the board. It's a full demand of suite. I mean, we -- this digital nature that people would like from us is very strong and that's why we talk about Architect and how we're delivering that I think you'll continue to see us as bank merchant really has yet to turn into anything in our P&L yet, although, you would see that in '21. But I mean the sustainability and the durability of our sales efforts are very-very high.\nLisa Ellis: Okay. And then my follow-up, we just come-- circle back again to the Clover number, as I think that was pretty fantastic number up 32% in July, 24% in June. Can you -- that must mean that you've got a whole bunch of new merchants coming onto Clover in the middle of the pandemic, is that right? Is that the right interpretation of that? And kind of how and why and where and what -- for what segments or through what channels are they coming in? Like what's driving that?\nFrank J. Bisignano: Yeah. I think, first of all, if you think about it, we always had growth, this has continued to grow. And now we have virtual terminal out there, we have order ahead out there. So, we believe when we're bringing eCom into Clover, when we're bringing virtual terminal, when we are bringing order ahead. Yes, we are selling more merchants also, but I want you to think also about how the acceptance levels of Clover are much higher than where we were at a different point in time. So it's more merchants, more functionality and more desires for the product by clients. I think that's how I think about it.\nJeffery W. Yabuki: And Lisa, I just add one of the data point, we mentioned was unit shipments were up 9% in June, so we are getting more units out there that are helping that.\nLisa Ellis: Yeah. Great, thank you. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Next we have Vasu Govil from KBW. Your line is open.\nVasundhara Govil: Thank you very much for taking my question. I think Bob touched on in for just a second, but maybe if you could talk a little bit more about your appetite for M&A in the near term and what type of assets would be most interesting to you here.\nFrank J. Bisignano: So, first of all, we feel very-very good. After we put these two companies together and how it's all coming together, both in the client's office and in our ability to invest and build ourselves. You hear a lot about things that we've built in terms of capabilities, right? And look at everything, we're going to do is going to be again share repurchase because of our capability. So, will there be a moment where there may be something that makes sense? But we feel that our hand is completely following capability and we have a deep belief in our technology prowess and the ability to build things and scale them up and in a tremendous way, things like Clover and things like Architect, what we're doing with Zelle. So -- but if you want to go to backdrop, the backdrop is filled in when against share repurchase.\nVasundhara Govil: Got it. And just a quick follow-up. Really good growth metrics on e-commerce in Clover and omnichannel type solutions. I'm just wondering if you could give us some color on how big these pieces of the business are today as a percentage of the total margin segment.\nFrank J. Bisignano: And first of all, eCom business has been thriving and winning and taking market share away, and when you look across the Company, we always thought that it was large, it was a fair amount. When you look at what we're doing in an omnichannel, that's new, but we're creating new total addressable market, was it? it wasn't like that was that all those order-ahead capabilities for QSRs existed before. But when you think about 50 million transactions, you are thinking about a tremendous growth engine that we're going to leverage across the world and across multiple verticals as order ahead has become a way of life for many. So I think when you think about it, these are pretty strong growth engines for us for a long time to create shareholder value for a long time, we've already built it and we've already demonstrated our prowess.\nJeffery W. Yabuki: Yeah, i think bottom line is they are good and growing every day and might be a topic of conversation for you at Investor Day coming up in December.\nLisa Ellis: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question is from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJason Kupferberg: Hey, guys, I appreciate the opportunity here. So I just want to come back to the comment around the internal revenue growth turning positive in July, I'm guessing that's maybe low single-digit up and so if that's the case, it sounds like you really don't need to see acceleration of those July levels to get to that rough target of flat for the full year. Am I thinking about that right?\nJeffery W. Yabuki: So, Jason, I mentioned this earlier I think we, as we said, we are positive. Yes, it's relatively small positive and we expect that to continue to step up into August, September, October into the balance of the year and that's certainly what we've seen over the last three months now, back in the depths of April successfully every month, in fact, every week has pretty much been a nice steady improvement. We'll see whether that continues. The cost synergy actions and getting some revenue growth over our fixed costs absolutely helps with this phase.[Phonetic]\nJason Kupferberg: Right, right. I guess, yeah. I guess the point I was trying to make is, almost it seems like you don't need to see the acceleration off July levels to still get to the neighborhood and flat and if you do see that you would probably be up a little bit for the year if I've got the math right there.\nJeffery W. Yabuki: I would expect to see a bit of acceleration or continued increase in order to get to that flat plus or minus that I've talked about in my earlier comments.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay, got it. And just one clarification to wrap up, I think, Frank, you had mentioned that the year-to-date bookings growth is sustainable. So just to put a finer point on that, does that mean it's something in the neighborhood of 20% is in your line of sight for the second half of the year?\nFrank J. Bisignano: Yeah, Yeah, I mean you heard us talking about some good wins in July and I expect those to continue we all think its a very strong pipeline and very, very, very, receptive client demands. I mean our clients have commented to us at the highest level relative to how we're serving them during this pandemic.\nJason Kupferberg: Well, great, I appreciate the comments.\nJeffery W. Yabuki: Great.\nFrank J. Bisignano: Okay. Well, I'd like to thank everybody for joining us this afternoon. We appreciate your support. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to contact our Investor Relations team. And you have a great evening. Thanks.\nOperator: [Operator Closing Remarks]",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Frank J. Bisignano",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon everyone. Let me start by thanking Jeff for his tremendous partnership since we started talking about merging our two great companies almost two years ago and working closely together the last 18 months on the integration. I'm excited to lead this great company, which Jeff has led brilliantly for the last 15 years. While we, all of us, have been navigating the global pandemic, Fiserv has faced those challenges with a clear mandate of serving our clients with excellence, while keeping our associated safe and healthy. The great progress we've made on those fronts is manifesting in accelerated integration, improving results and much stronger than anticipated sales. Importantly revenue has shown sequential improvement each month since April bow. In June, we saw just 1% decline in internal revenue and we returned to internal revenue growth in the month of July. As Jeff mentioned, we have made great progress in the first year actioning over $1.1 billion of incremental pre-tax earnings as new Fiserv and we are highly confident of the additional value ahead. In addition to our financial accomplishments, I'm thrilled with how our value proposition is coming together in the client's office. We closed a number of terrific deals in the second quarter, with sales up a very strong 38% over the prior year and 20% year-to-date. Our excellent momentum continued into July with two important competitive takeaways in our credit card processing business. We were selected to provide issuer processing solutions by Atlanticus Holdings and Genesis Financial Services, both leading providers of consumer credit solutions. And each on their own would rank among the top 25 largest card portfolios in the U.S. based on active accounts. Larger issuer's choose Fiserv for a variety of reasons, including our highly configurable processing platform, breadth of integrated digital solutions, and a client-centric approach. We expect both of these important clients to go live with our market-leading solutions next year. The resilience and diversity of our revenue was evident in our second quarter as we navigated a very difficult macro environment and generally delivered results above internal expectations across most key performance measures. Internal revenue declined 7% in the quarter and is down only 2% for the first half of the year. This performance is a strong testament to the great work by our people to deliver value for clients, regardless of the difficulty in the end market. Adjusted earnings per share in the quarter was down 4% to $0.93 driven primarily by COVID weakness. Adjusted EPS through June 30th is up 6% to $1.92 on excellent cost and revenue synergy performance and the strength and scale and breadth of our business. Importantly, we generated nearly $900 million of free cash flow in the quarter, up 23% over the comparable quarter and up 13% to $1.7 billion through June 30th. Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we repurchased 5.7 million shares for $550 million in the quarter and for the year-to-date, have repurchased 14.3 million shares for $1.4 billion. In dealing with these unchartered waters, we have put our energy and focus on sustainable actions, such as cost synergy acceleration, that we believe will make us stronger and more profitable for the long-term. We delivered $155 million of cost synergies in the second quarter results alone and now expect to book at least $550 million of cost synergy savings in 2020. We've actioned nearly $700 million, of our $1.2 billion target through the end of the second quarter and $750 million through the end of July. Revenue synergies are progressing equally well with continued strong performance in network innovation, bank merchant and cross-selling our market leading solutions across the company. For example, we were able to add our DNA account processing solution for a new clients digital bank, where we were initially awarded credit processing. Revenue synergies sales in annual contract value were more than $50 million in the second quarter. We saw continued strength in our bank merchant synergy program, even with the COVID slowed down, adding 42 new bank merchant clients in the quarter and nearly 70% were competitive takeaways. We signed more than 160 banks and credit unions in our first full year and have a very strong pipeline of nearly 400 institutions. Overall, we had actioned a $130 million in annualized revenue synergies through June and are in a great position to achieve $600 million revenue synergy grow. We signed 17 new core account processing clients in the quarter. 99 DNA including Northwest Federal Credit Union, one of the largest credit unions in Virginia with $3.4 billion in assets and United Federal Credit Union with $2.9 billion in assets. Another important highlight was South State Bank, an existing Fiserv Premier account processing client, which recently merged with CenterState Bank and selected Fiserv's core platform. And a number of additional solutions for their newly combined $38 billion institution. Even in these challenging times, our leading solutions continue to win in the market. Our industry-leading digital and electronic payment solutions such as Mobiliti, CardValet, Architect, TransferNow and Zelle have us incredibly well-positioned to support our clients in the digital transformation, which we believe is further accelerated by the pandemic. One excellent prove point on our digital momentum was in a recent competitive win with Northwest Bank, a long-term Fiserv's client who expanded our existing relationship to establish us as their strategic digital partner. Northwest added a number of new digital solutions led by Architect, our single digital platform, as well as a number of other customer-centric solutions, which will enable them to offer a more innovative and integrated solution for their clients. In our card-issuing business, we signed a important renewal with PNC, extending our long-term partnership with the seventh-largest bank in the U.S. for both credit and debit processing. Bank of Baroda, one of India's leading public sector banks awarded us their credit card processing in the quarter. When live, we will provide card processing services for four of the top six issuers in India. Prior to the onset of COVID, our merchant business had displayed it's emerging strength recording high single-digit internal revenue growth through all of 2019 and further accelerating to low-double digits in the first few months of this year. Even in the pandemic our merchant business has performed very well relative to the market and we believe is even better position going forward. That strength is attributable to a number of factors including the size and scale of our distribution network, geographic reach, diversity in diverse industry coverage, our Clover platform and rapidly growing and leading digital technologies, including e-commerce and ISV. Clover gross payment volume is recovering well from the weakness it experienced early in the quarter with GPV up 24% in June and was up 32% in July. GPV for the quarter was $23.4 billion or more than $90 billion annualized. Simply stated, our Clover strategy is to grow the number of clients using our platform asset is important. To extend the breadth of services offered to these clients. We're creating deeper client relationships through solutions such as virtual terminal and online ordering that were rolled out in Q2 and are seeing solid early adoption rates. We are pleased to see our digital merchant acquiring platforms riding the growing wave of digital transactions across a variety of industries and geographies. We are seeing accelerated sales momentum in e-commerce solutions, adding 50 new clients in the quarter, 86 year-to-date and a 144 over the last 12 months. As the pandemic spurs the need for innovation, we are seeing our investments in omnichannel merchant capabilities, such as order-ahead to pick up in-store gain even more traction. As a leader in this space, we provide omnichannel solutions to nine of the top 15 QSRs including McDonalds, Chick-fil-A, Taco Bell and Dunkin' Donuts. In Q2 alone these QSR transactions more than doubled to greater than $50 million per month. Given the demand we are expanding these capabilities into more verticals such as grocery as well as other geographic markets around the world. Our integrated payments continue to perform well, expanding our number of partners by more than 20% in the quarter. In spite of COVID, our ISV revenue was up double digits in the quarter. We remain focused on driving additional differentiation to capture additional market share in this space. Overall, we're very pleased with our first half performance in this challenging time. The combination of integration benefits the payoff from targeted investments and delivering new innovation that clients' needs, is translating to significant sales and market momentum, which we will expect will both support growth today and well instead of future. With that, let me pass the discussion to Bob for more detail on the financial results. Thanks, Bob. We believe one of the most important aspects of the transformational acquisition of First Data was the commitment to allocate an incremental $500 million to support innovation. This commitment is unique to Fiserv, and we expect this program to create differentiated value for clients, opportunity for our associates, and incremental growth for our shareholders. We will provide a detailed update on our priorities and progress at our December Investor Day. Based on our strong performance and sales momentum in the first half of the year, coupled with the trends we are seeing in our end markets, we are providing new 2020 financial outlook. For adjusted earnings per share to grow at least 10% over last year's level, adjusted for divestitures or at least $4.33 per share for the full year. Our 2020 outlook does not contemplate a sweeping second wave of shelter orders or other circumstances, which creates significant economic duress in the second half of the year. We are pleased with our financial performance in the midst of pandemic uncertainty. We returned to positive internal growth in July and expect to achieve our 35th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings-per-share growth. The combination of market momentum along with the $1.1 billion of actions we have already taken, give us increased confidence in delivering strong results in '21 and beyond. Diversity and inclusion have long been core principles of our award-winning people platform. At the same time, we are addressing the significant societal changes, which we believe will have a lasting impact on both life and business as we know it. Through listening and acting upon what we are learning, we are confident we will build a stronger and even more highly committed team. Back in June, we launched our back-to-business program, which supports minority and black-owned small businesses in the areas that have been hardest hit by the pandemic and social unrest. Working directly with local chambers of commerce, we have committed at least $10 million in grants, along with our best talent to help these businesses succeed and thrive. We are on the grounds in Brooklyn and Queens and we'll also expand to other markets such as Atlanta, Chicago, Miami, and Oakland. We have already brought business coaching and payment solutions to hundreds of businesses and expect to help multiples more as that program expands. Last, let me thank our more than 40,000 talented associates around the world for their commitment and courage each day as we stand together to deliver value for clients, our colleagues and you, our shareholders. With that, let's open the line up for questions. Yeah. So, we feel very strong about that sustainable growth. What you hear us talk about, if you look at that business in total, we think the investments that we've made over time have really paid off. You hear us talk about the wins we have in e-com. So that's a tailwind for us. You look at the double-digit growth we talked about in our ISV business, you look at the GPV running through Clover, right now, that we've talked about and the growth of it. And then we have talked about the 162 bank merchant synergy sales which actually have no economics in our numbers yet, but you should expect that to continue, and that's a very, very integrated solution that promise that we would bring together core processing clients and bank merchant and help them grow that business for their institutions. And then I think if you think about the diversity of our client base, you hear us talk about what went on in those omnichannel transactions for the QSRs where we have a leading position, and then you also think about the geographic diversity that we have, which really we think is somewhat unparalleled. So our client diversity, our geographic diversity, and then our integrated solutions, we think we have the broadest and best solution set in the industry, and with all of that, we see very, very strong opportunity is -- the trough was deep but to be back to IRG and the type of GPV, we talked about, what Clover really, really gives us is high confidence about the future. Thanks, David. Yes. So I think when you look at the sales numbers we're talking about and how the company is coming together, it's beyond the expectations we had. We always viewed that we had this opportunity to come together and the client saw the same. And if you think about, we talked about, we've had more than 340 total synergy sales and then we also just have the general growth there. You hear about the Architect business up 56%. So in the totality of what we're dealing here, we actually believe that this company has very good growth in the second half relative to the trough that we saw. And so I think there you should feel that it's all, all elements of the company will be growing. You heard us talking about those credit wins and we had ones prior to that and the e-com wins, so across the board. Well, I think, first of all, if you look across the businesses and as we go across all of the, we have had a deep bent in digital. We've invested heavily in digital and that's why you see us when those type of deals like Atlantic is and Genesis, because of that you see Architect, really winning in the market in some ways. You see us being selected by many is their digital provider, right. And so, we believe the sustainability is high, relative to it. We think in some cases acceleration will occur given the amount of investment we've put into it. I think and we think about in global nature too we have a lot going on in Latin America, where you will see some classic innovative solutions where we take all of our capabilities and bring it to the client. I think if you look at the -- during this pandemic we have almost vested into it. So you don't see us doing anything other than adding resources in the areas like Clover and ISV and your watch that whole integrated solution come together, only adding resources in our credit processing group and not pulling back on anything. We use the synergy opportunity to save money and that acceleration's coming through well. But we consider COVID to have more growth opportunity, then you see right now, even at that set of numbers you heard. And we think our core banking platform has it as does our card processing. And then if you think about what we're going to do with the potential of this ecosystem, as we bring in Zelle and our other Mobiliti assets, our ability for the client's benefit is going to be very, very strong. And those are one of things Jeff and I talked about when we started and why we're playing the $500 million into innovation ultimately to be able to continue that sustained drive, Darrin. Yeah, I don't want -- I wanted to limit it '21 and '22 maybe, is what I would say is, one of the things I signed up here and one of the great things I loved about what how Jeff had brilliantly led the company, was the capital allocation strategy. And I think we owe it to our shareholders to continue to put them as our first priority in every dollar we spend. And so I would consider that and tried and true strategy just flow throughout. I mean, 100% and I don't think it's a '21 issue or '22 issue, that's tried and true forever. Yeah, well I think the pandemic accelerated everything people talk about digital. Maybe what people thought, would take five years, it I will take two years or less than that, I mean you've watched us build capability in digital much faster than maybe we would have thought, it would have taken before and our clients are fully engaged it in. So I think speed matters and clients are completely committed to being digital-first and we're committed to deliver in digital-first for them. No, I'd go back to -- if you go back to last July, when we talked about how this will perform and where we are today, we feel great about our partnership with the bank, we feel great about, probably one of the dissolution, you've seen in industry with zero friction, then expanding, processing agreement for five years beyond our current processing for them and the bank has just been a great partner through it and we feel as good as we did ever. So I just, start with that and think ultimately both parties end up with a very, very strong good situation, but ultimately we do see cost take out and we do see growth opportunity as we talked about, maybe better than what we talked about last July. I will let Bob take you to a couple of more deeper details, it started at the highest level that this dissolution was hugely successful for both Institutions. Yeah, No, we feel very good about it all. We feel very good about it all. Thanks, Ramsey. Well, I mean if you look at it there are some fabulous names, actually the fact of the matter is many of those names were contributed by the original company and we took those back and they're just fabulous household institutional names that we feel so good about as did the bank itself. And then the geographic dispersity would be exactly what, you remember this was a U.S. business, that was really fundamentally it was and at the SMB level, there is a large Clover base on both sides. So, remember these are large Clover consumers that generate very, very good returns and who we actually believe, we will do more with as we go forward, as we bring out even the functions you heard like virtual terminal and order-ahead and other capabilities. So I'd say great geographic dispersity, great reach from small to tall, some of the largest names you'll here and many of them were long-standing deep relationships with the predecessor company. Yeah, I mean we haven't thought on the $500 million in that manner. We actually have been doing that over the past year in a very deep and aggressive manner and been usually successful at it. On that $500 million, we're really talking about next-generation opportunities whether it'd be in deed, whether it'd be in fraud, whether it be in decisioning, so you should expect us to modernize the place away from the $500 million, as annual run rate today. Hey, man, he will. Yeah, I would treat it like it was a very small impact, not a large impact and stimulus has a little effect, but those clients and we have a fantastic franchise there and without financial institutions, also those clients are pretty -- have been very-very durable during this process. Yeah. I think, first of all, where they're 38% sustainable, you can be quite clear that the year-to-date number has large sustainability to it and when Jeff and I put the Company together, one of the phrases we use is, how we would come together in a client's office. And we're seeing it in multiple ways, and remember that 38% does include those competitive takeaways like Atlantic is or in Genesis, those are July numbers. And we talked about the $50 million of synergy wins in the quarter, it's across the board. It's a full demand of suite. I mean, we -- this digital nature that people would like from us is very strong and that's why we talk about Architect and how we're delivering that I think you'll continue to see us as bank merchant really has yet to turn into anything in our P&L yet, although, you would see that in '21. But I mean the sustainability and the durability of our sales efforts are very-very high. Yeah. I think, first of all, if you think about it, we always had growth, this has continued to grow. And now we have virtual terminal out there, we have order ahead out there. So, we believe when we're bringing eCom into Clover, when we're bringing virtual terminal, when we are bringing order ahead. Yes, we are selling more merchants also, but I want you to think also about how the acceptance levels of Clover are much higher than where we were at a different point in time. So it's more merchants, more functionality and more desires for the product by clients. I think that's how I think about it. So, first of all, we feel very-very good. After we put these two companies together and how it's all coming together, both in the client's office and in our ability to invest and build ourselves. You hear a lot about things that we've built in terms of capabilities, right? And look at everything, we're going to do is going to be again share repurchase because of our capability. So, will there be a moment where there may be something that makes sense? But we feel that our hand is completely following capability and we have a deep belief in our technology prowess and the ability to build things and scale them up and in a tremendous way, things like Clover and things like Architect, what we're doing with Zelle. So -- but if you want to go to backdrop, the backdrop is filled in when against share repurchase. And first of all, eCom business has been thriving and winning and taking market share away, and when you look across the Company, we always thought that it was large, it was a fair amount. When you look at what we're doing in an omnichannel, that's new, but we're creating new total addressable market, was it? it wasn't like that was that all those order-ahead capabilities for QSRs existed before. But when you think about 50 million transactions, you are thinking about a tremendous growth engine that we're going to leverage across the world and across multiple verticals as order ahead has become a way of life for many. So I think when you think about it, these are pretty strong growth engines for us for a long time to create shareholder value for a long time, we've already built it and we've already demonstrated our prowess. Yeah, Yeah, I mean you heard us talking about some good wins in July and I expect those to continue we all think its a very strong pipeline and very, very, very, receptive client demands. I mean our clients have commented to us at the highest level relative to how we're serving them during this pandemic. Okay. Well, I'd like to thank everybody for joining us this afternoon. We appreciate your support. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to contact our Investor Relations team. And you have a great evening. Thanks."

            "name": "Jeffery W. Yabuki",
            "content": "Thanks, Peter, and good afternoon everyone. A lot has changed at Fiserv's since we announced Q1 results. Coming off, tremendous financial performance in January and February, we hit the COVID-19 cliff in the second half of March which further worsened in April. At our May 7th call, we shared our thesis that April would be the likely trough and we expected to see gradual improvement from there and that is exactly what has happened. Each month revenue has improved sequentially from the lows of April and culminated with a return to internal revenue growth in July. Clearly, the results are not what any of us expected prior to the pandemic. However, we are quite pleased with our overall performance, the resilience and strength to produce nearly $900 million of free cash flow in the quarter, and tremendous sales momentum, which reinforces our market-leading value propositions and further positions us for accelerated growth. We successfully completed the dissolution of the BAMS joint venture on July 1st. As part of this, we welcomed nearly 120,000 direct clients to Fiserv and inked the new processing agreement with the bank as their provider for Merchant Services. We are grateful to Bank of America for their partnership and are excited about our future. On July 29th we marked the one-year anniversary of closing our historic merger. We've made tremendous integration progress while continuing to invest in our future. We've also gained significant confidence in the size and scope of the opportunity and wrapped up a series of first year accomplishments including generating $3.5 billion of free cash flow. We allocated more than $1.7 billion to share repurchase, well ahead of schedule and also repaid $1.1 billion of debt. We raised our cost synergy target by a third to $1.2 billion and increased our revenue synergy goal by 20% to $600 million, and of that in the first 12 months we have actioned $750 million of cost synergies and $160 million of revenue synergies. Interest expense has been reduced by nearly $290 million annually, which when combined with synergies actioned is more than $1.1 billion of run-rate pre-tax earnings in the first 12 months of what was originally set as a five-year journey. And sales, as measured in annual contract value, grew 15% over the prior year, supporting the power of our combined value proposition. Overall, these proof points are representative of our commitment to delivering on the promise of Fiserv in the client's office, harnessing the power of the best associate team in the industry and delivering sustained above-market returns for our shareholders. And last, we effectuated a seamless CEO transition to Frank on July 1st, seamless because Frank and I have been working closely together since the transaction was announced as we are today. And seamless because Frank continues to bring his leadership and commitment to deliver superior results against our proven Fiserv shareholder value creation strategies. As both an advocate and large shareholder, I assure you that the company is in fantastic hands with Frank at the helm. With that, let me turn the call over to our new CEO. Hey David. And David, in terms of your question about the periodic revenue, the Fintech segment would have grown, had we not had the headwind from periodic revenue, call it, really high-single digit headwind and some of that was absolutely driven by what we think is COVID impact, particularly in the license side of that. Yeah. So from a standpoint, first of all, they are in our numbers, they're not included in our growth rate or internal revenue growth rate. The adjustment that we started making as the dissolution took effect, we essentially will follow our standard practice for acquisitions and divestitures and excluded for one year forward and then pull it back in. Thanks. Yeah, Matt, I would say we've demonstrated an ability to do both. We've done that over the years, we've done that since the merger when we first announced the transaction we suspended share repurchase pending the deal closing, we made commitments on our ability to de-lever, we're well down that path. At the same time, repurchased $1.4 billion in shares and we are paying down some debt to get to our targeted leverage mid next year. There'll be some debt pay down absolutely and I mentioned that in my opening remarks. We'll also see EBITDA growth, that helps create that deleveraging point. So you should absolute expect us to continue to allocate capital both in terms of investing in our business and then free cash flow is split between M&A activity when appropriate, but all through the eyes of a share repurchase and that debt delevering, we've got a really nice quite path to achieve what we set out to achieve by second half of next year and share repurchase has been part of the transaction, since and will continue to be going forward. Yeah, I'd -- Just to add, Ramsey to your specific question. I did point out that as of July 1st with the dissolution completed we do see our overall expenses below the level of proportionate share that we had back when the JV was in place. And so we will see a lift in margins because of that in the second half of this year. Not all of that is yet behind us, but a big chunk of it is with the effectiveness of dissolution on July 1. I would certainly expect them to experience similar characteristics for the rest of our client base. Hey Tingen I'd say overall we're quite pleased with how that overall selection process went. We're very happy with the 120,000 merchants, so we picked up and also remember we're still the processor for Bank of America's clients going forward. Me too, thanks. Yeah, Ashwin I would say, of the top of my head there is no really big one-timer so to speak or items in the second half that would color Q3 versus Q4. I would expect to continue to see kind of the monthly progress that we've seen through the second quarter ended into July. So August gets a little bit better, September gets a little bit better, October, November, and hopefully, maybe by the end of the year, we get back to whatever normal used to be. I can't remember what that looked like it was so long ago, but we still have progress to go and at this point, we're kind of counting on, or expecting relatively steady progress through the balance of the year. So growth, a little bit stronger in the fourth quarter. But as we see the volume come back in Q3 as I have mentioned, we expect margins to bounce pretty nicely in third quarter. I would say, Ashwin that one of the things we saw particularly stimulus coming in movement in Zelle. We saw some nice lift, with that, some real growth come through in sustained. So, it wasn't a one-time sort of a thing. And as you heard us talk, Zelle has been quite positive, both in terms of number of transactions, number of clients signing up, number of clients going live that continues to be a very nice driver for us in our Payment segment. Thanks Ashwin. Yeah. So, Bryan, the network assessment fee, as I mentioned is 300 basis points, overall volume being down 15% in a business that's got some good-sized fixed costs really does impact quite substantially. And as those volumes come back, you'll see that lift return, the advantage on the network assessment fees is not only does the headwind side, but actually becomes a tailwind, and so you see a nice recovery there. And then the last item that, kind of, is a or is a change first half to second half is the BAMS deferred revenue, the headwinds ceases because with that lapsed Q2 of last year. So, you don't have the compare in Q3. In terms of synergies, we will continue to generate cost synergies that segment has seen nice progress like the entire company and that will continue into the second half of the year, but I would definitely point to the network assessment fees and timing and as well as just overall volume being a real part of it. More so in the Payments, but yes, all three of our segments, plus the corporate expenses are seeing some real benefit where we are driving cost out of our technology, largely through our vendor discussions, you see the benefit across all three of the business segments. Our Payment segment is the area where the business is overlapped the most and so you get the more natural takeout other than the corporate functions in that segment. Fintech definitely seeing some benefit on the technology side. They've also been quite successful in what we used to call operational effectiveness or general productivity and taking cost out of that business. So the key, here, Bryan, I think is these are permanent cost out. This is cost synergy, this is not temporary actions in response to COVID that will naturally snap back, you haven't heard us announce furloughs or employee pay cuts. This is our effort to to drive synergy a little bit faster, then maybe we would have otherwise maybe not, but definitely our permanent cost out, that won't snap back, as you have to put those cost back into business. And Lisa, I just add one of the data point, we mentioned was unit shipments were up 9% in June, so we are getting more units out there that are helping that. Yeah, i think bottom line is they are good and growing every day and might be a topic of conversation for you at Investor Day coming up in December. So, Jason, I mentioned this earlier I think we, as we said, we are positive. Yes, it's relatively small positive and we expect that to continue to step up into August, September, October into the balance of the year and that's certainly what we've seen over the last three months now, back in the depths of April successfully every month, in fact, every week has pretty much been a nice steady improvement. We'll see whether that continues. The cost synergy actions and getting some revenue growth over our fixed costs absolutely helps with this phase.[Phonetic] I would expect to see a bit of acceleration or continued increase in order to get to that flat plus or minus that I've talked about in my earlier comments. Great."

            "name": "Robert W. Hau",
            "content": "Thank you Frank and good afternoon everyone. We turned in a relatively strong performance in the face of a tumultuous impact COVID-19 had on business and consumer activity around the world, displaying the resilience and strength of our business. Total company internal revenue declined 7% in the quarter, driven by a significant impact of lower transactional volume associated with the global pandemic. Importantly, as Frank mentioned earlier, we saw internal revenue steadily improve as the quarter progressed with June internal revenue down just 1%. The monthly improvements continued into July with company internal revenue growth turning positive for the first time since February. Year to date, internal revenue has declined just 2% due to the strength of the business and better than anticipated progress on actual revenue synergies, which were $38 million in the quarter and are $65 million year-to-date. We now expect to be above the midpoint of our 2020 revenue synergy estimate of $75 million to $100 million. Although not in the category of formal guidance or outlook, based on what we can see today we estimate that our internal revenue is likely to be in the range of plus or minus flat for the year. Second quarter adjusted operating income decreased 14% to $927 million, which includes a 2 percentage point negative impact from dispositions and decreased 7% to $1.9 billion through June 30th. Adjusted operating margin of 28.8% in the quarter declined 90 basis points compared to the prior year but improved 100 basis points sequentially. Adjusted operating margin through June 30th declined 50 basis points to 28.3%. As anticipated, adjusted operating margin for both the quarter and the year were severely pressured by the COVID related decline in revenue and the associated expenses, timing of brand assessments and prior year dispositions, partially offset by $155 million of expense synergies achieved in the quarter. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share declined 4% to $0.93, compared to $0.97 in the prior year, as adjusted for the investment services transactions that closed in Q1. Adjusted earnings per share through June 30th has increased 6% to $1.92, setting the stage to achieve our 35th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings-per-share growth. Free cash flow in the quarter was excellent, up 23% to $895 million and up 13% to $1.7 billion year-to-date. Free cash flow conversion for the quarter was a stellar 142% and is 126% year-to-date. This performance was driven by strong working capital, timing of settlement activity in our merchant business and lower capital spending for the combined company. Our impressive free cash flow is the result of our resilient business, mission critical solutions and significant transaction synergies. We expect free cash flow for the second half of the year to remain strong, as cost synergies continue to ramp and we further capitalize on opportunities to drive efficiency across the company. Looking into the segments, internal revenue in the Merchant Acceptance segment, which has been the most impacted by the pandemic, declined 15% for the quarter and is down 5% through June 30th. As the world has begun to gradually reopen, we've seen improving transaction and volume metrics leading to improving revenue performance. In fact, we closed the quarter with acceptance internal revenue down just 2% in June, and in July returned to positive growth. As you've heard, we are seeing improving business trends in the segment. Clover GPV has improved steadily from April through July and Clover units shipped are back to positive territory ending June of 9% year-over-year. Total e-commerce transactions were up 26% in the quarter and omnichannel transactions gained even more steam. Some of the key deals in the quarter include sale of eCom solutions toward in store card processing for California DMV along with eCom solutions for six new regional grocers, including two more in the top-ten. Among the number of wins globally, we added both card present and card-not-present solutions for McDonald's in Germany and omnichannel solutions to Burger King in the U.K. Adjusted operating income in the Acceptance segment decreased 47% to $223 million in the quarter on an adjusted revenue decline of just over $300 million, and adjusted operating margin declined 950 basis points to 19.1%. Year-to-date adjusted operating income was $506 million and operating margin was down 700 basis points to 20.2%. A combination of sharp COVID revenue decline and associated expenses, negatively impacted second quarter margin by nearly 800 basis points. The timing of network assessment fees in the quarter, which is expected to reverse in the second half of the year was almost 300 basis point headwind. These two factors alone, which total roughly 1100 basis points of negative margin impact, more than offset the substantial and sustained positive impact of cost synergy actions in both the second quarter and year-to-date. You will also recall that Q2 is the anniversary of the BAMS deferred revenue item. So, we will no longer be a headwind in the second half of the year. We expect Acceptance segment adjusted operating margin to improve significantly over the remainder of the year to a level above last year's pre-COVID results, with the majority of the gain coming in Q3. This improvement is expected to be driven by improving merchant volumes in revenue, cost synergy actions ramping over the remainder of the year and the reversal of the network assessment timing headwind. We now expect Acceptance segment adjusted operating margin to be up sequentially at least 800 basis points to more than 28% for the second half of the year. As Jeff mentioned, the BAMS dissolution was successfully completed as of July 1st. We have realigned our cost structure as expected, which will reduce our expenses, run rate below the proportional level within the joint venture. Importantly, the dissolution moves a significant amount of scale and the resulting revenue to our small business, middle-market and enterprise client book. As a result, the size of our direct e-commerce and digitally oriented revenue has grown meaningfully and should lead to future growth and expansion, given the macro characteristics of these attractive markets. The Fintech segment internal revenue declined 1% for the quarter as growth in high quality recurring processing revenue was offset by lower periodic revenue, such as license and termination fees, largely due to the pandemic. Year-to-date Internal revenue was in line with prior year, revenue in this segment tends to be quite resilient due in large part to the mentioned critical nature of the solutions and as much less susceptible to variation due to macroeconomic impacts. In addition to the 17 new core comp processing wins in the quarter, we are seeing even more demand for our broad array of digital solutions. Mobiliti ASP subscribers increased 6% in the quarter to more than 9.3 million, and Architect, our single digital platform, had growth of 56% to 3 million users. Adjusted operating income was up a very strong 14% in the quarter to $252 million and is up 8% year-to-date to $456 million. Adjusted operating margin was up significantly in the quarter increasing 520 basis points to 35.4% and a combination of cost synergies and operational effectiveness, offset somewhat by lower periodic revenue. Year-to-date adjusted operating margin was up 280 basis points, as we deliver client-value across the scale business with increasing efficiency and effectiveness. The Payments and Network segment internal revenue declined by 3% in the quarter. COVID impacts pressure a global credit issuer processing, prepaid and biller businesses and were partially offset by growth in card services and output solutions in part, benefiting from revenue synergies. Internal revenue through June 30th is comparable to the prior year. Revenue in this segment tends to be driven by transactions and/or accounts, and tends to be fairly resilient in a typical recessionary periods. But this pandemic has been different, for example, debit oriented transactions, which have historically been very resilient were impacted much more than prior recessionary periods and have solidly improved, consistent with the reopening, since the trough in early April. Debit transactions were down in low-single digits in the quarter, improving from down 20% percent early in April to being up mid-single digits in the second half of June and through July. Conversely, we are seeing strong growth in solutions such as the account-to-account transfers and P2P, which is up nearly double the prior year's quarter, and up 20% sequentially. The number of clients live on Zelle has further accelerated, increasing more than five fold, compared to a year ago and is up 31% sequentially. We continue our bullishness on the role of electronic money movement and Zelle specifically, as the pandemic pressures legacy ways of moving money. Adjusted operating income for the segment improved 1% to $558 million in the quarter and is up 5% to $1.1 billion through June 30th. Adjusted operating margin was up a very strong 220 basis points to 42% in the quarter and is up 250 basis points, to 41.6% year-to-date. The positive impact of revenue synergies, operational efficiency and strong cost synergy performance is driving current results with continuing runway for future expansion. The adjusted corporate operating loss in the quarter improved 5% to $106 million in Q2 and a 7% better to $200 million year-to-date, primarily due to cost synergies. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter improved 20.5%, primarily due to the benefit of geographic mix of earnings and discrete tax items. Our adjusted effective tax rate is 19% through June 30th and we now expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate to be just below 22%, in line with the prior year and modestly better than previously expected. We continue to allocate capital to build shareholder value, repurchasing 5.7 million shares for $550 million in the quarter and 14.3 million shares for $1.4 billion year-to-date. As you will recall, we began repurchasing shares much earlier than originally anticipated, given the strength of free cash flow even while meeting our debt commitments. As of June 30th we had 670 million shares outstanding and about 7.5 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase. We repaid $100 million of debt in the quarter and total debt outstanding, which is now 85% fixed rate amounted to $21.9 billion. Debt to adjusted EBITDA was 3.9 times as of June 30th and we remain committed to achieving our leverage target by the second half of 2021. We expect to repay more than $1.5 billion in 2020 and therefore we'll allocate a large part -- percentage of our free cash flow to debt repayment for the balance of the year. Finally, let me call your attention to our Q2 earnings slides available in Investor Relations section of our website. Page 9 provides a summary of the financial integration milestones we have achieved in the first year as a combined company, some of which Jeff highlighted in his remarks. Even in the face of this global pandemic, we have taken actions that have locked in more than $1.1 billion of run rate pre-tax earnings, well ahead of our original objectives, and have much more opportunity ahead. While we are pleased with the integration performance to date, we remain committed to unlocking the potential we have in Fiserv to deliver even more differentiated value for our clients, as well as you, our shareholders. With that, let me call -- turn the call back to Frank. And Dave... Yeah, David, it's Bob. Just real quick back on your other question too, I would point out that the return to growth was beyond our merchant business, total company return to growth. So we feel quite good about the progressive improvement we saw throughout the quarter. And in fact, to your second question, that leads us to get our confidence to give the guidance of at least 10% EPS growth. In particular, we will see a nice improvement as I mentioned in my prepared remarks in our merchant margin, the majority of that 800 basis point improvement, second half over first half is sequential improvement will come in third quarter. So we'll see a nice pickup from one of our largest segments in the business and as revenue comes back in those other two businesses, that's a nice scale of opportunities. So we're looking forward to really overall having a strong second half. Yeah, I can't give you an overall number but I can tell you absolutely that we've been working closely with them, like all of our client partners in terms of supporting them as they restructure their business as one of their creditors and the filling -- the Chapter 15 filing, you saw yesterday was part of that overall process but bottom line is, we feel we're in good shape. I don't see any issue. We continue to process for them and I feel comfortable our position overall."

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I will turn the call over to Peter Poillon, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. Thank you. You may begin.\nPeter Poillon: Thank you, Ivy, and good afternoon, everyone. With me on the call today are Jeff Yabuki, our Chairman and Chief Executive; Frank Bisignano, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and supplemental presentation for the quarter, which includes slides on our updated revenue and cost synergy targets announced in March, are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, expected operating and financial results, strategic initiatives and expected benefits and synergies from the First Data acquisition. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. You should refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. Please refer to our materials for today's call for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this call, along with a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. Unless stated otherwise, performance references made throughout this call are year-over-year comparisons, and all references to internal revenue growth are on a constant currency basis. Also note that non-GAAP financial measures included in our earnings release and supplemental materials include the first quarter of 2019 results for First Data, which have been prepared by making certain adjustments to the sum of historical First Data and Fiserv GAAP financial information. And now I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeffery W. Yabuki: Thanks, Peter, and good afternoon, everyone. To say we are living in interesting times is an understatement. As an example, Bob and I are here in Milwaukee, appropriately social distanced; Frank and Peter are joining from separate locations in New York; and many of you are likely at home. We are all adapting to this transitory time as we approach a new normal. We're incredibly proud of how the Fiserv team has responded, protecting your company while executing on our number one priority, keeping associates and clients safe. We activated our business continuity plan quickly, starting in Asia and continued around the world. Today, about 85% of our associates are working remotely, and the remainder are following rigorous safety protocols to protect the health of the team. Additionally, hourly associates whose jobs cannot be performed remotely have received a 25% increase in pay while we navigate the COVID crisis. We are supporting clients by providing them with the leading-edge solutions they need to serve their customers. Our account sales and service teams are adjusting the changes required in this new world, including travel by tech, connecting with clients through individual and team-based video capabilities. The substantial majority of our implementations are progressing as scheduled, and sales in the quarter held up reasonably well, coming in just shy of the prior year. We entered Q2 with a solid pipeline. And in fact, our preliminary sales results for April were up more than 20% over the prior year. We have a strong, resilient business model, which is buttressed by the delivery of mission-critical solutions to financial institutions, corporate clients and merchants around the world. We also believe leadership matters. And having more than our fair share of experienced executives who have successfully navigated the global financial and economic events of the last 30 years will contribute to even stronger results as we navigate these changing economic times. In early March, we communicated meaningful increases to our five year synergy targets, including a 20% increase in revenue to at least $600 million. And on the cost side, we increased our target by $300 million to a total of $1.2 billion which, as you will recall, does not include our sizable interest expense benefits. From day one, we believe that our significant synergies would help mitigate the potential adverse impacts of a recession. In addition to the quantum, we are intently focused on the speed to attain those synergies, all of which Frank will discuss later. The financial results for the first 10 weeks of the year were quite strong, even with some limited weakness outside the U.S. The last two weeks of the quarter got progressively worse as shelter-in-place and other restrictions ramped up around the world. The majority of the business displayed resilience with the largest negative impact in the merchant business, along with pressure in our debit-oriented transaction businesses not seen in previous downturns. The circumstances also spurred some incremental growth across several areas, including payments and digital. Global merchant transactions are generally on the upswing with some variability by country but with meaningful improvements from the lows seen in late March and early April. In the U.S., we've seen early signs of recovery in later April and May to date with comparative transactions down in the low double digits after declining nearly 30% in the last week of March. Since then, we've been seeing continuing, gradual improvement in merchant transaction recovery including into May. U.S. debit transactions were pressured but also showed improvement in the second half of April, finishing the month with low double-digit declines, a substantial improvement from the approximately 20% drop we saw in the last week of March and into early April. Overall, we are quite optimistic about the improvement we are seeing in the current trends and believe we will see further acceleration as shelter-in-place restrictions are eased in the U.S. and around the world. Given the uncertainty around COVID-19, we are withdrawing our previously communicated 2020 financial outlook. Consistent with the trends we have seen, we expect meaningful pressure on Q2's results and anticipate improvements throughout the second half of the year. Given the strength and resilience of our business model, including the significant synergy opportunities, we see a solid, actionable path to achieve double-digit adjusted earnings-per-share growth again this year. You will recall that we had expected our first quarter's results to be the weakest of the year due to a difficult compare and the ramping of synergies throughout the year. Given that, along with the impact of COVID-19, we produced solid results, including internal revenue growth of 4%, adjusted earnings-per-share growth of 16% and free cash flow increasing to $760 million for the quarter. Our capital allocation strategy was in full force, including closing the sale of a 60% interest in Investment Services, adding to our merchant capabilities through two small acquisitions and repurchasing 8.6 million shares in the quarter. Importantly, we are making excellent progress on integration with a focus on value creation across strategic, operational and financial fronts. The privileged relationships we have in our account processing businesses continue to expand, adding 12 new clients in the quarter, including five on DNA, such as Jeanne D'Arc Credit Union in Massachusetts with $1.5 billion in assets; and Nelnet, an existing output solutions client that selected DNA to support its mission of helping students make their educational dreams possible. Clover gross payment volume started strong, up 40% through February and despite the COVID hit, still ended up 29% for the quarter. Clover devices shipped was up about 25%. And the adoption of add-on software services such as virtual terminal and our new order ahead functionality continues to expand rapidly across the base. We saw important momentum in e-commerce, adding 36 new direct clients globally, including Total Wine & More, the country's largest independent retailer of fine wine; the U.S. Army Installation Management Command; USA Technologies; and Regis Salons, the largest hair salon chain in the world. We also added the German grocery chain Tegut; and MediaMarktSaturn Retail Group, Europe's largest consumer electronics retail chain with over 1,000 stores in 14 countries. E-commerce transactions remained strong in the quarter, up 26% in the U.S. and 20% globally, reflecting our market position and opportunity in digital commerce. Our integrated payments value proposition also continued to expand, growing partners more than 20% in the quarter. Impressively, ISV revenue grew more than 55% even in the face of late March weakness. We continue to see strong opportunities to grow in this important space. Overall, total contracted merchant locations globally grew 12% in the quarter. We also had very strong Zelle results, implementing eight times more clients in Q1 compared to the prior year and payment volumes skyrocketed, up nearly 90% in the quarter, and we saw even stronger growth in the second half of April as people look for new ways to pay in this new environment. We continue to see a significant value creation opportunity at the intersection of cards, DDA-based payments and our merchant scale around the world. Importantly, we remain fully committed to deploying our $500 million innovation investment. We've identified important opportunities in areas such as enterprise digital, card, merchant e-commerce, ISV and Clover. We also see expanded opportunities across the data horizon, including risk fraud and decisioning with a specific emphasis on authorization rates, network innovation and next-generation integration. We will continue to invest in 2020 and over the next several years to ensure that we are focused on where the market is going and what we need to do to win. Lastly, as you have seen, we announced our CEO succession plan earlier today, which elects Frank Bisignano to succeed me on July 1. I will serve as Executive Chairman for the remainder of the year, working closely with Frank to ensure a smooth transition. We will also work closely together to continue advancing our longer-term strategy, which will be heavily based on the well-honed capital allocation discipline which is embedded in the DNA of the company. Given my 15-year tenure, the Board and I have been engaged in deep succession planning conversations for a number of years. It has been my long-held belief that organizations benefit from changes in leadership and have used that principle to maintain a fresh approach over my time at Fiserv including, most recently, through the First Data acquisition. My conviction has gotten even stronger given the current pandemic and resultant need to manage and lead differently. Frank will bring new energy and perspective to the company while fully embracing the strategic foundation of Fiserv's value creation playbook. I've had the pleasure of working closely with Frank over the last 18 months, and it will be two years since the announcement when I ultimately depart. In addition to the things that you know such as Frank being an accomplished executive with vast experience in large, complex organizations, including doing a fantastic job as CEO of First Data, he's further established himself with our team, leading our businesses and integration, exceeding goals on our synergies and working closely with me to establish the foundation for our future success. The Board and I feel great about Frank, and he has our unanimous support as Fiserv's next CEO, only the first fourth person in our 36-year history. I'm incredibly happy for Frank and his family and offer my heartfelt congratulations to him as a business partner and my friend. It has been an honor and privilege to lead your company for what now amounts to one-four of my life. Over that time, we have transformed Fiserv into a global leader in payments and fintech and have been named the world's most admired company for seven consecutive years, all while building a sustaining culture of delivering differentiated value for clients, associates and you, our shareholders. My primary objective has been to leave the company stronger than when I found it. And while some might say we accomplished that objective, I firmly believe that the best days for Fiserv lie ahead. With that, let me turn the call to Frank.\nFrank J. Bisignano: Thank you, Jeff. Good afternoon. And I can't tell you how much I've enjoyed these 18 months and how much I look forward to all the things we're going to do right here in the future. So first of all, let me say how honored I am to be elected the next CEO at Fiserv, a company with a great history and a bright future. My thanks to Jeff for his partnership and leadership to create one of the world's most admired companies. Jeff's vision for a company which invests for the future growth and allocates capital for the benefit of shareholders is the platform from which the company will continue to execute. This strategy will continue to serve our shareholders, associates and clients extremely well for the long term. We have jointly assembled a world-class team that will continue to drive innovation and excellence, allowing us to be known as the greatest fintech on the planet. I greatly appreciate Jeff and the Board's confidence in me leading the company. I feel privileged and tremendously humbled to serve our clients, our communities, our shareholders and this great company. Now on to business. A lot has changed since our last call. And while we've made great progress on integration, we have put even more focus on ensuring business continuity, protecting the health and safety of our associates and delivering on client commitments in light of the COVID-19 crisis. The team has come together beautifully. And I am incredibly proud of the company. As Jeff mentioned, Fiserv was well prepared to serve our clients through a well-tested and robust business continuity plan and an experienced and seasoned leadership team. A crisis waits for no one, whether moving 40,000 people to remote work environments, securing over 200 global locations, proactively managing credit risk or introducing alternative ways for merchant acceptance. Urgency, certainty and expertise are critical ingredients to a successful outcome. Delivering value to our clients is why we exist. Over the past several weeks, COVID has presented a number of unique opportunities to serve clients with speed, agility and innovation. Let me provide a few examples of how our solutions are helping our clients navigate these uncharted waters. Through both our Clover platform and our financial institution clients, we've processed tens of thousands of loans to enable small businesses to share in PPP funding. We are enabling a variety of expedited use cases through our MoneyNetwork prepaid card solution, including supporting the National Institute of Health's C19 research project and enabling not-for-profits to provide funds for those in need. In Argentina, we're working closely with government-owned banks to enable the distribution of benefit and subsidy payments. We've partnered with NIC to offer a walk-in bill payment services across 28 states to enable payments outside of government offices. Through our SpendTrend solution, we are providing proprietary data and insights to merchants, financial institutions and governments to enhance the understanding of economic implications across business segments and geographies. At Clover, we expedited the delivery of our new order-ahead capability which, since launch in early April, is already being used by nearly 1,800 restaurants. As Jeff mentioned, implementations have generally continued as scheduled as technology agendas for our clients remain very important. One terrific example, using a virtual team's approach. MONETA Money Bank in the Czech Republic recently completed a full migration of the bank's credit and debit card portfolios to our outsourced FirstVision service during a full quarantine period. MONETA Money Bank highlights the new ways to deliver great service, which are emerging in this challenging time. Our focus now, more than ever, is to consistently deliver high-value services. Our engagement model is at an all-time high with an enhanced focus on daily client service requests and prioritizing resources. In March, we communicated significant increases of our synergy targets, moving the cost side up by one-three from $900 million to $1.2 billion or roughly 12% of our total cost base. We also took our revenue synergy target up 20% by $100 million to $600 million over the five year period. While we are pleased with the progress to date, the synergy work is not complete. We remain fully committed to unlocking additional opportunity where possible, across both revenue and cost pools as we work toward being the best fintech and payment company on the planet. The enhanced cost synergies include additional opportunities in vendor efficiencies, contractor replacements, infrastructure and operational leverage. First, we've had great results working with our vendor partners to identify cost efficiencies for the combined company as well as acquiring new capabilities, which will have the dual benefit of avoiding internal investment and reducing capex. As a result, we have increased our expectations on procurement, primarily in technology, by about $200 million. Second, we expect to achieve additional synergy benefits from shifting original First Data's outsourced offshore operations to original Fiserv's captive. The primary savings are from converting third-party contractors, which generates cost arbitrage, improve operational efficiency and most important, no loss of knowledge as we rebadge existing third-party resources. Last, we're identifying even more savings from the consolidation of real estate, data centers and back-office systems. We've also had success extending the sophisticated call center operations of original First Data, including an AI-based virtual agent and enhanced self-service capabilities, all geared to meaningfully improve the overall experience. We have also packaged these capabilities to help supplement our clients while delivering revenue for us. We are moving more quickly to accelerate cost synergy timing as a way to offset some of the coronavirus revenue pressure. Our original expectation was more than $300 million this year. We now expect $500 million of full year synergy savings with an annualized exit rate of more than $700 million entering 2021. We feel great about our progress, and we'll continue to look for ways to add even more value. As we mentioned, on the revenue side, we raised our initial target 20% or $100 million, based primarily on anticipated outperformance in bank merchant and new opportunities in areas such as digital disbursements, payment innovation and much stronger momentum outside the U.S. than we expected. We are seeing continued strength in linking the account processing privilege relationships with our market-leading Clover solution to create unique value for our clients. To that end, we signed 55 new bank merchant clients in the quarter, with 42 of those wins through the end of February. We've now signed 109 new FI clients since the start of the program with competitive takeaways at about 40% and an even higher percentage in the larger bank space. Although sales activity has slowed due to the COVID disruption, interest remains very high with nearly 400 institutions in the pipeline. While we expect the current environment will moderate the pace of near-term revenue realization, we have raised our current expectation 15% to $230 million. In addition, we also signed another 16 institutions to our bank merchant program outside of our synergy efforts over the period, not including the expansion of nonbank partners. Although we have recalibrated the expected timing of our revenue synergies given the current economic situation, we are still expecting $75 million to $100 million of revenue synergy in 2020. Our integration is building an organization that will sustainably provide unique value. This is a critical time for the market. And we believe Fiserv, with highly differentiated market-leading solutions, is the best place for clients, associates and you, our shareholders. Now let me pass the call to Bob for a review of our financial results.\nRobert W. Hau: Thank you, Frank, and good afternoon, everyone. I will discuss our results utilizing our new reportable segment structure included on the 8-K filed on April 1. We have three business segments. Merchant Acceptance, which we may refer to as acceptance or merchant, is primarily the global merchant acquiring business of original First Data. Financial Technology, or fintech, comprises original Fiserv's core account processing businesses, along with digital banking, financial and risk management and other software-oriented solutions. And finally, Payments and Network, or payments, is the most blended segment between the original companies and is primarily global debit, credit and prepaid card issuer processing, print and card production services and electronic payment services such as bill payment, biller and Zelle. As you heard, the company had a very strong performance through mid-March, well above our original expectations, and even with the significant decline in the last two weeks, still achieved 4% internal revenue growth. The results are even better when considering that result was against our most difficult quarterly comparison as Q1 2019 included a high level of nonrecurring and periodic revenue. Revenue synergies were a strong $27 million in the quarter. Adjusted operating income, which includes the grow over impact of the Investment Services Transaction, increased 1% to $968 million in the quarter with adjusted operating margin up 10 basis points to 27.8%. Operating margin was lower than anticipated due to the sharp decline in revenue in the second half of March and expected lower onetime and periodic revenue, partially offset by about $90 million of expense synergies in the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share was up 16% to $0.99 compared to the $0.85 in the prior year as adjusted for the Investment Services Transaction that closed this quarter. Internal revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was a very solid 6% for the quarter. These results were buoyed by our geographical breadth, diverse industry verticals and broad payment capabilities. North America internal revenue growth was 5% for the quarter after being up double digits through February. Our international business grew 7% on a constant currency basis, even as COVID impacts were seen in Asia and Europe earlier in Q1. We continue to make great progress on the dissolution of the BAMS joint venture. Consistent with our internal revenue growth methodology, beginning this quarter, we are excluding the 51% share of BAMS acquiring revenue from our internal revenue growth calculation due to the planned dissolution at the end of June. We will incorporate our new direct BAMS revenue as we would in any acquired business beginning one year post the close of the transaction. We look forward to continuing to serve this important client. Adjusted operating income in the acceptance segment decreased 17% to $283 million in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin declined 440 basis points to 21.2%. Two issues drove the unusual margin decline, led by roughly 270 basis point headwind, primarily related to the very sharp COVID volume decline at quarter's end, with roughly two-three of that amount from our higher growth international business. Next, the comparative negative impact of brand assessment fees, along with the expiration of a 10-year deferred revenue item in BAMS, which ended in Q2 last year, pushed margin down by another 200 basis points. Although we were able to outgrow the revenue decline in March, the resulting mix changed, served to compress operating performance in the quarter. We anticipate the segment operating margin to remain under pressure in Q2 due to the COVID-19 impacts. The Payments and Network segment delivered internal revenue growth of 3% in the quarter. Growth was led by card services and output solutions, including revenue synergy benefits, partially offset by lower growth in biller solutions and prepaid as well as the negative impact of the COVID-19 at the end of the quarter. Transactional businesses performed well in the first 10 weeks of the quarter but saw a significant falloff at the finish. Debit transactions were up mid-single digits for the quarter, which includes the impact of double-digit declines in late March which also carried into early April. As you heard, we've seen improvements through April as some markets reopen and stimulus payments hit in the U.S. P2P transactions, which include both Popmoney and Zelle, continued their rapid growth, nearly doubling versus Q1 last year and up 14% sequentially. The number of clients using Zelle has increased nearly tenfold compared to a year ago and is up 44% from Q4 2019. We've also been seeing even stronger performance in Zelle and TransferNow over the last couple of weeks as we believe consumers are expanding their use of safe and secure digital money movement. Adjusted operating income for the segment was excellent, growing 10% to $575 million in the quarter, and operating margin was up 280 basis points to 41.2%. The increase was primarily from growth in high-quality revenue, synergy benefits and productivity gains. The fintech segment saw internal revenue growth of 1% as gains in high-quality recurring revenue was partially offset by the expected decline in periodic revenue. Revenue in this segment tends to be quite resilient and less subject to variation due to the macroeconomics. We saw strong interest in demand for a broad array of digital solutions in the quarter. Mobiliti ASP subscribers increased 9% in the quarter to more than 9.2 million. And Architect, our single digital platform, had year-over-year growth of 34% to four million users. We also saw a measurable increase in digital interactions, along with a greater use of underlying functionality. Adjusted operating income was flat in the quarter at $204 million, and adjusted operating margin was up 30 basis points to 28.3%. The underlying results are stronger than they appear given a meaningful decline in license and termination fee revenue in the quarter. Core performance was driven primarily by higher recurring revenue, along with cost and operational efficiencies. The adjusted corporate operating loss in the quarter improved 10% to $94 million due to the benefits of cost synergies. The adjusted effective tax rate was up 80 basis points to 17.5% due to the combination of lower discrete tax items and reduced stock-based compensation benefits in the current year resulting from the First Data transaction. We continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate of 22% to 23% for the full year. Free cash flow was up 3% to $760 million in the quarter, driven by strong operating results despite an approximate $100 million year-over-year headwind associated with merchant settlement timing. Free cash flow conversion was 111% in the quarter. We repurchased 8.6 million shares for $885 million in the quarter, which included redeploying just over $500 million of net proceeds from the majority sale of Investment Services. We bought more shares than anticipated under our 10b5-1 plan due to the volatility in the quarter and do not anticipate repurchasing shares at the first quarter's level for the remainder of the year. As of March 31, we had 674 million shares outstanding and over 13 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase. Total debt outstanding, which is about 75% fixed rate, was $22 billion, and debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was 3.8 times as of March 31. We are on track to return to our historic level of leverage within 18 to 24 months post First Data merger through a combination of debt repayment and EBITDA growth. Additionally, we anticipate refinancing some of our current debt as we have an $850 million bond maturing this quarter. Our balance sheet and liquidity positions are very strong, and we continue to expect we will generate significant free cash flow even in this economic downturn. We repaid $123 million of bank debt in the quarter and expect to repay more than $1 billion over the remainder of the year. While we are uncertain of the full impact of COVID-19 on our near-term business results, the combination of a resilient business model, a well-honed capital allocation strategy, $1.2 billion of anticipated cost synergies and a very experienced management team provides us with confidence that we will create sustained value for clients and shareholders through any economic cycle. With that, let me turn the call back to Jeff.\nJeffery W. Yabuki: Thanks, Bob. Given the crisis, we are pleased with our sales results for the quarter, down only about 1% to the prior year as travel limitations and pandemic actions took center stage. We are seeing very few deals being canceled but did see a bit more deal slippage than normal. We are pleased to see how quickly our sales and account teams have adopted virtual selling and how well market engagement has held up in this unique time. Our pipeline is solid with good visibility into Q2, including a number of recent COVID-related opportunities. We are also seeing our larger deals in the pipeline continue to progress as clients remain completely committed to their technology agendas. For example, on April 30, we expanded our relationship with OXXO, the largest and fastest-growing chain of convenience stores in the Americas, with presence in Mexico, Colombia, Chile and Peru. In Mexico, OXXO is, by far, the convenience store leader with more than 19,000 locations, and these stores also offer bill payment, money transfers and a financial inclusion product used by millions of people. Our significantly expanded relationship will begin with their Mexico-based fintech business providing account and card processing services through our first API and FirstVision solutions. We are very excited to partner with OXXO to help them even better serve their customers. As mentioned, we are withdrawing our 2020 outlook given the uncertainty in the environment. And although we don't provide quarterly guidance, we expect meaningful pressure on Q2 revenue and earnings results compared to the prior year. However, given our strong business model and accelerated cost synergies, we see a solid path to achieve our 35th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings-per-share growth. This path generally incorporates two COVID-19 macroeconomic assumptions: first, that April and, therefore, Q2 are the transaction and volume low points, followed by a measured recovery through the balance of the year; and that we are not subject to a sweeping second wave of social distancing and shelter orders, which create further economic duress. While we don't have enough clarity to call this formal outlook, we expect far more visibility at our second quarter call, and we'll provide further directional clarity on our full year financial outlook. Your company is performing well in the midst of this once-in-a-century event. We are enhancing our already resilient business by accelerating integration, enhancing services for clients and developing strategies that will allow us to lead the industry regardless of the economic environment. We will also invest to ensure that we not only win now but emerge from this transformational time stronger and better positioned to deliver value for many, many years to come. Let me also say thank you to the 44,000 people of Fiserv, who have made us all so Fiserv proud, navigating this unprecedented time with a single focus, to serve clients with excellence and commitment each and every day. It's an honor for all of us to work with you. With that, let's open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from David Koning from Baird.\nDavid Koning: Hey Jeff, sad to see you go, but congrats to everybody.\nJeffery W. Yabuki: Thanks, Dave. Really appreciate it.\nDavid Koning: Are you thinking of running for President? I'd vote for you.\nJeffery W. Yabuki: Dave, right now, I just want to I want to do a great job on this quarterly call.\nDavid Koning: There we go. All right. Well, I guess my first question, just on the merchant segment. When we think about some you gave a lot of really good metrics, clearly doing well. It felt like you were saying maybe low double digits were kind of the trend in the last couple of weeks in revenue. Is that kind of what you're saying?\nJeffery W. Yabuki: In transaction volume, we're seeing an improvement from kind of think about it in the 30s and has improved by about two-three. And we've continued to see improvement really that started toward the end of April but really since then has continued up to and including yesterday. And we're kind of seeing that gradual improvement happening.\nDavid Koning: Great. Okay. And then I guess just my follow-up. Maybe if you could talk a little more about in the merchant segment, revenue was flattish year-over-year, just on a pure reported basis. Obviously, you grew better than that, organic. But EBIT was down, I think, $60 million. You talked a little about periodic revenue. There's also probably a lot of benefits from synergies. So maybe you could just parse out why EBIT was down $60 million or so.\nRobert W. Hau: Yes. Dave, it's Bob. I think we try to give some color in the prepared remarks around that. From a synergy standpoint, recall that the Merchant Acceptance segment is largely is comprised of the original First Data merchant business. And so you're not seeing a lot of straight natural synergies, of overlap that you might first of all, in the corporate segment as well as in our Payments and Network business, where you see more of the synergies particularly in the early stages post merger.\nDavid Koning: Thank you, very much\nOperator: Next, we have Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research.\nDarrin Peller: Hi, Glad to hear you doing OK, and congrats also, Frank and Jeff to both of you.\nJeffery W. Yabuki: Thanks, Darrin.\nFrank J. Bisignano: Yes, thanks.\nDarrin Peller: Listen, I wanted to just hone in for a minute on the merchant segment because it clearly outperformed what we've been seeing across the industry. And curious if you could just give us a little bit more color on the mix. When we think about the trends, 6% for the quarter, it clearly shows like the end of the quarter was better-for-you guys than others. And then you're talking about reaccelerating to some degree as well. Clover, I know you commented on. And then, I guess, the mix on discretionary versus non. Any further color you can give us would be great.\nJeffery W. Yabuki: I would Darrin, let me take a shot at it, and then Frank and Bob will add as needed. I would say that one of the things that's most interesting in all of this crisis is there are macro factors that really matter. So where are you what geographies are you operating in and what is going on in those countries. And then probably at least as important, what are the industries in which you are serving and where may you have concentrations. And so if you are highly concentrated in industry verticals like travel, right, airlines, things like that, you're obviously going to see a different mix than if you are, say, serving retail, grocery, those kinds of things. And the same thing applies even in e-commerce, right? E-commerce, the idea, it still depends on where it is you are laid out. And I think one of the things that's important is because of where we sit geographically, even in some of the early stages of this that we were seeing around the world when it was starting in Asia and moving around, we our concentrations are such that we weren't getting beat up as bad early as we were seeing in some other places. I think the second thing is our vertical coverage in the most impacted areas is probably more favorable for us. And so we don't have those high concentrations. And then the third piece that I would throw in there is we've continued to grow in ISV, continue to grow in e-commerce in some of the digital areas. We talked about the wins that we had. And last year, we had 80-or-so wins. And that all creates an aggregate benefit. And then lastly, some of our larger merchants, if you look at our top merchants, they tend to be more resilient or maybe less impacted on a relative basis than others. And so all of that, I think, has added up to us having better results. By the same token, we obviously have SMB exposure in Clover that we were impacted in ways that were similar to others. I think based on some of what we were hearing, we might be seeing slightly better improvements over the last few weeks. And we're looking at it very closely every day to see how it's coming together. But it's all speculation, not knowing what's inside of other people's books. We're pretty certain about what's in our book. We like the way it's trending. And we are seeing absolutely when states or countries open up, you can literally see the lights come back on in places where they were not on before, and that's a benefit to our numbers. And again, we're tracking that very closely, sometimes it feels like every minute of every day.\nDarrin Peller: Yes. All right. That makes a lot of sense. When we and just my quick follow-up is really structural. I mean I think when we look at Clover, e-com, integrated or even on the fintech, on the core banking side, I mean, where do you think you come out of this pandemic where you gained market share because of your technology differentiation? And maybe just touch on the inbound demand for some of those fintech offerings versus what you would have seen before the pandemic.\nJeffery W. Yabuki: Sure. Thanks, Darrin. I would say that one of the things that we think is most differentiating about Fiserv versus some of the other companies is we are not just a merchant business, we are not just a fintech, and we are not just a payments. We happen to have leading market positions in each of those verticals as well as a very well-structured geographic presence that, prior to this crisis, was growing very significantly. And we believe and we're continuing to invest because we believe that's going to come back on that basis. But we were seeing toward the end of April, we were seeing a pickup in Zelle. We were seeing a pickup in TransferNow. We were seeing a pickup in RDC. So all of these things that are digitally oriented, we have found to be quite valuable. The other thing that's interesting, and this is not meant to cast aspersions on fintechs because we love the fact that innovators are continuing to create what's going on, but there's been very little discussion about fintech lately and much more discussion about scale, about certainty, about making sure we're there for the customers of our clients when it's needed most. I would say that other that idea, that idea of scale, if you take a microcosm like the merchant business, which is a very fragmented business with companies like us and others of our peers, all the way through independent service organizations, smaller providers, and in those cases, whether they are long-established ISOs or brand-new innovators, scale matters, the ability to make good decisions on onboarding, how do you manage risk in a time like this, that's all very important. And we think that the team that we've assembled, combined with the assets, is going to leave us in a place where we will be a share gainer, or we should be a share gainer, in this time, and we're certainly focused on making sure that happens. That's one of the reasons why we remain committed to $500 million of innovation, including spending money this year, which we think is very important when maybe others are putting the money back on the shelf.\nDarrin Peller: Got it thanks\nOperator: Next, we have David Togut from Evercore ISI.\nDavid Togut: Thank you, and Congratulations, Jeff, on a great 15-year run.\nJeffery W. Yabuki: Thank you, David.\nDavid Togut: And congrats to you as well, Frank, on the big promotion. I'd just like to start there, if I could. Obviously, you've worked together for 18 months or so. Frank, what do you think you would do differently as you take leadership of the company from what Jeff has done historically?\nFrank J. Bisignano: Well, it sunk in that I'm the fourth CEO in a storied history. And I think if you look, we've been the world's most admired company most of 90% of this decade and before that, too. And what I've seen here and learned is a whole bunch of things. So I don't see us veering from any item that we were strategically driving. The innovation, we're very committed to that $500 million. Our capital allocation strategy, which is tried and true, is aspirational for most companies and was something that I saw when I came here and fully subscribed to it. Jeff and I have worked really, really closely together. I think we brought the team together very well. And I think really it's about continuing the client initiatives, being in the client's office and continue to innovate. Our innovation really is coming from our clients. So I don't there's look, this has been an honor and is a bittersweet moment to not be doing it with Jeff, to be honest with you. And so I don't sit here and say and never once said, said to each other, well, we're going to do that different. It's more about how we're just going to continue. And this team has really come together fabulously. So I think it's going to kind of really our best days are in front of us. So I don't there's no big changes happening here.\nDavid Togut: Just as a follow-up, could you put some guardrails around the growth trends you're seeing in Financial Technology, Payments and Network Q2 to date? I think these segments historically would be seen as being more defensive in a downturn. How should we think about the range of possible outcomes around revenue for these two segments going forward?\nJeffery W. Yabuki: So David, I would say that the big difference in this economic dislocation versus anything that at least I've seen in my career is the manner in which the economic dislocation occurred, right? It wasn't a slant a slanted line, it was a cliff. And what we have never seen is an ability or an inability for people to use their cards or use their phones to pay for things. So we did see more impact in the debit and credit space than we would have expected. And had this been \"normal\", which is probably an unfair way to say it, normal recession, not that there's any such thing as that, I think we would have seen the normal hold up there that we had seen previously. And again, we're seeing that same recovery that we were talking about earlier happening in this area, but that's primarily because if you most of us here have been working at home largely for the last six or seven weeks. I don't fill my gas tank up very much when I don't drive it. And so it's just things like that, that people don't have the opportunities to use their debit cards and maybe their credit cards a little bit less. So you have that. In the financial segment, you or the Financial Technology segment, we're seeing exactly what we've always seen, David, and that is that's a transactionally oriented business. People are still using their they're still processing transactions, things still getting posted to the GL. I think interestingly, I think we just did a quick scan, and there are literally hundreds of thousands of PPP loans have been boarded in our core systems, and that those are new accounts. That will be part of the ecosystem. So all of those things will continue to create the stability, debit will come back. So we feel very comfortable that we still have a business of which the substantial majority of the business is highly resilient, think back to the '08, '09 days.\nDavid Togut: Understood. Congrats again.\nJeffery W. Yabuki: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we have Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank.\nBryan Keane: Thanks for taking question just want to ask about cost controls. Any additional controls you guys are putting in place to manage the margins, especially in this second quarter where the impact will probably be the greatest?\nFrank J. Bisignano: Yes. I mean we've talked a lot about what we're doing on synergies and acceleration of synergies. But we obviously have taken other measures inside the company. And I think you'll see them come through as we go forward. I mean we stopped the 401(k) match, as an example, which was a significant effort in the company. And you probably saw us still filing on the stock plan. But more importantly, it's I think during this horrible crisis, we've been able to have tremendous focus on every element of the company. So we're continuing to spend to innovate. I think we'll or we see more development hours, not less, going on, but them going on in a very, very measured way, delivering for the client in a different manner. So as you know, both Jeff and I have always had a good eye on the cost, and we'll continue that. The synergies are forever, and we're very, very committed to those. And we as you hear us talk about them, you could see how confidence continue to build. So I think you'll see us continue to do both very well. And stay, number one, focused on our clients and revenue.\nJeffery W. Yabuki: And Bryan, I would say that we evaluated, should we take steps that would try to better align against Q2, because to your point, Q2 is going to be a rough quarter. But we believe that as the economy opens back up, we will see that kind of slower but a gradual improvement. And doing things that damage the business for a quarter, we don't think makes sense. I'm sure you don't think they make sense. But there is a lot of discretionary opportunity to, as Frank said, reallocate effort, make sure that we are only doing things that are needed right now and potentially redirect to places that we may have a better opportunity in the future. Again, on balance, we see a very solid actionable path to double-digit adjusted earnings-per-share growth this year. And so we're taking the steps to kind of center on that and being ready for the economic recovery.\nRobert W. Hau: And Bryan, the one thing I would add to kind of follow on and echo Frank's comment. One of the things we've talked about the last six months is should we end up in a recession, having now $1.2 billion of cost synergies ahead of us gives us an opportunity to pull levers harder. And you heard us talk about original expectation of $300 million of cost synergies, now grown to $500 million with an exit run rate of $700 million, that's permanent cost-out. That is not damaging the business. That is executing an integration plan a little bit faster than we had initially planned, given the opportunity that we have to do that, and reallocate resources. So we feel quite good about our ability to mitigate the downside during the COVID crisis but, more importantly, come up much stronger on the other side as we exit 2020 and exit 2021 and beyond.\nBryan Keane: Got it. And just a follow-up to that is on the merchant segment. Just thinking about the cadence of improving margins. Is that as simple as just as volumes come back, we can get to more stable to potentially improving margins in the future?\nJeffery W. Yabuki: The short, easy answer is yes. It's this business is a very intriguingly fixed cost business where you there are little, nano economics to costs to process that next transaction. But when you need to add a mainframe or you need to take down more bytes in a cloud or whatever, whatever technology metaphor that you want to use, you're buying that in bulk. And so from that perspective, we've got to make sure that I'm sorry, so from our perspective, as the revenue comes back on, it will flow through at a very high level. I think Bob talked about 270 basis points of impact in the quarter from that last very, very sharp off-the-cliff decline. And the other thing is the first quarter had the onetime kind of these onetime assessment items and other things that aren't we won't have to grow over. When we had given guidance, Bryan, we knew that, that was an issue. It's one of the reasons why we said, \"Hey, Q1 is going to be weaker.\" So we knew that was there. We knew it was coming. And so as things come back, we will absolutely see the benefit. I would just throw one other thing in there. We have had lots and lots of conversation around what can we do systemically to better manage, not in a short-term way, but what are the transformational things that we can do to get better leverage and flexibility in the cost structure, right? The beauty of this of not wasting a crisis is what can you learn. And we are seeing ways in which we think we can switch some of the cost structure from more fixed to variable, do different things so that when the revenue comes back, that, over time this is not a 2020 thing, but over time, we'll see an even bigger pickup in long-term margin accretion, which, as you know, is something that Fiserv has been famous for, for a long, long time.\nBryan Keane: Thanks appreciate it\nOperator: Next, we have George Mihalos from Cowen & Company.\nGeorge Mihalos: Thank you, and congrats to both of you, Jeff and Frank.\nJeffery W. Yabuki: Thank you, George.\nFrank J. Bisignano: Thank you.\nGeorge Mihalos: I guess, to start off, Bob, if we can go back to that commentary in merchant around the transaction volume now down, I think, sort of low double digits, so a big improvement there. Is the right way to think about that from a revenue impact that revenue will be down somewhat higher than that given that, I would think, there's more of a shift to sort of larger merchants versus SMBs? Is that the appropriate way to be thinking about it?\nRobert W. Hau: Yes. I would say nominally higher, relatively close. And of course, the other impact is relative Q1 to Q2. Q1, we saw that rapid decline in just the last two weeks where we're dealing with the improvement over a longer period of time. So we didn't bounce right back after just two weeks. Although we've seen some nice improvement, we're still down that low double digits in the quarter.\nJeffery W. Yabuki: George, I think where you might see more impact is less on the differential between transaction and volume. And I think you'd see that maybe play out more at the margin line only because these very large merchants are going to be priced in a different way. But again, that's all accounted for when we think about how the recovery is structured and what the puts and takes are in that as we think about what do we need to do to achieve double-digit EPS growth.\nGeorge Mihalos: Okay. That's very helpful and very impressive, frankly. One more question, if I may, just on the old issuer processing business within First Data. I'm just curious, are you guys seeing any sort of a push or early signs of any of your FI partners kind of pushing an account or card purge going on? Or are things just sort of steady as they go?\nJeffery W. Yabuki: Yes. George, we have seen purges going on in different places. As you would expect, I mean, banks and FIs are managing their cost structure just as tightly, if not more tightly, than we are. But again, I mean, bankers are usually pretty good at this. I think the increment is not substantial, at least not for what we've seen so far. And we expect that as we start to see a little bit more stability, that you're going to see less of that because the last thing you want to do right now is purge away for an FI to make money.\nGeorge Mihalos: Thanks very helpful\nOperator: Next, we have Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America.\nJason Kupferberg: Hey, Hope you're doing well. Congratulations to both of you. I wanted to just come back to the commentary around the line of sight to the double-digit EPS growth this year. Maybe we can just talk a little bit about the algorithm, the rough algorithm to get us there. In other words, how much top line pressure can this absorb and still get to those levels? I guess it kind of comes back to those base case macro assumptions that you laid out near the end of the prepared remarks. And try and give us a sense of what sort of rough revenue growth range that would yield.\nJeffery W. Yabuki: Yes. It would be difficult to do that. I'm even though I'm appropriately social distanced from Bob, I think he would throw something at me or slap me if we gave that kind of detail in the algorithm. I think we'll be in a better place in July when we announced Q2 to provide that data. But I will give you some qualitative. So we have been looking at scenarios since very early April. And the scenarios have stayed fairly constant up until the last probably 10, 15 days probably 15 days, where you started to everyone was a little tentative as you started to see improvements, and you'd see up and down and up and down. But now we're seeing that trend come together. And one of the reasons why we pushed our call out, in fact, the primary reason why we pushed our call out, was we wanted to have April data by the time we got together. And I would say that April outperformed where we thought it was going to be even as recent as two weeks ago. And so from our perspective, we feel like we are taking a realistic trend to how the revenue will come in. But I would also caution us all to say we are living in unpredictable times. So we think we have a fair level of assumptions that are not incredibly aggressive, but they don't imply that we stay where we are right now for the remainder of the year, right? It's that kind of moderate, gradual improvement that gets us nowhere near where we were in the first 10 weeks of the year and nowhere near where we were last year in terms of growth rates, right? So we've taken that way down. We think it's fair and conservative. But the real reason why we're able to do this is, as Bob mentioned and Frank mentioned, we took our synergy targets up $300 million in March. And we had been working on that for quite a while, that was not new. And for us to, on a nontemporary basis, take our cost synergies up from more than $300 million to $500 million, with an exit rate of $700 million, while that took a lot of hard work at the team and it's going to continue to take hard work at the team, we did not recreate the wheel. All we did was accelerate our synergy plans, make sure we were doing the things that we need to do. And as Frank mentioned, we have another layer of things that we're looking at. We're not done. We snapped the line. We took a picture. But we will continue to do that. And as the world evolves, we'll do everything in our power to make sure that we are moderating our cost structure to the extent that revenues do things that maybe we don't think they should be doing, or we'd like them to be doing. So I apologize, Jason, for the longer answer. But that's at least the way we're thinking about it philosophically. And again, we wouldn't have made the statement if we didn't feel like we had a good, solid path and an actionable path to get there.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay. That's a good, thoughtful answer. Just a quick follow-up on Clover. Wondering if you're seeing any significant uptick in terms of chargeback risk as you think about the prospects for churn at the very low end, any qualitative or quantitative observations there would be great.\nFrank J. Bisignano: No, we don't. I mean relative to Clover, we won't see chargeback risk. And I think you heard us talk about what we did in terms of using technical expertise to get that restaurant app out there pretty quick. I mean, we've also had tremendous growth right prior to what you saw at the end of March. But I think what you'll see in Clover is us continuing to invest in it. And you should expect us to have that continue to grow very nicely and the clients with a high satisfaction level. So a full commitment, we don't see look at small businesses struggling, and we're continuing to bring functionality that helped them through this difficult period.\nJeffery W. Yabuki: And Jason, I think we would also add, from our perspective, and you heard this a little bit in the prepared remarks, we have people who have been through all kinds of cycles. And one of the things that was so incredibly heartening to me is not only do we have people who work for us today, but Frank, through his very powerful Rolodex I'm probably too old to use that word but through his powerful Rolodex, brought back people who have incredible G2 incredible experience, and we were able to very quickly get our arms around the exposures in the company. And we have been paying a lot of attention to what's going on, whether they be around industry verticals, refund levels, chargebacks, those kinds of things. And we feel like we are very appropriately reserved for where we are today, especially in Clover. In terms of the kind of exposures you have in areas like that are not nearly as meaningful as you would in merchant acquiring for industries that are on a deferred delivery basis. And most of what Clover does is a kind of right now or very near-end kind of service delivery.\nJason Kupferberg: Thank you,\nOperator: Next, we have Brett Huff from Stephens Inc.\nBrett Huff: Hey Frank, we're looking forward to your leadership. And Jeff, you'll be missed.\nJeffery W. Yabuki: Thank you, Brett.\nBrett Huff: Two questions. One is, Jeff, you kind of alluded to this, and I kind of think about it as an arms race, the $500 million pot of gold that you have that only a select few of fintechs have. You mentioned some priorities in terms of investments, and I think we're all familiar with those. But has anything really changed? Or has anything really popped up where you said, you and Frank talking about this said, in this new environment, we're going to press our advantage in X and really throw some more time and effort and money after this vertical, this product, whatever, because that's the thing where we can move the needle most coming out of this? Is there a big change? Or is it just kind of more of the same?\nJeffery W. Yabuki: I would say, at least right now, we have not seen new innovations this may be a little bit unfair, but new innovations yet that we would say, let's shift our focus from this basket to this basket. However, I would say that there are several things that we have been working on that we are quite excited about that we had planned to talk a little bit about at Investor Day, but areas that we think there's really significant opportunity. And we at some point, we'll be able to talk about it, but we don't necessarily think it would be prudent to do that right this second. But Brett, there are some really interesting opportunities out there, overall, probably in shades of the things that we've talked about before but could have a real impact on revenue, margin growth but, most importantly, client value.\nBrett Huff: That's helpful. And then follow-up, and I'm not sure if this is answerable, but as you stand now, you talked about last 10 days outperforming in April versus what you thought just 10 days ago. So pretty remarkable changes between then and now. Knowing what we know now, and you have a lot of great data from Clover to big clients and etc., where do you guys fall on the V versus U versus W versus swoosh? Do you if you had to describe your base case, where would that fall in that kind of range of recovery?\nJeffery W. Yabuki: I would say it probably not exactly sure what the economic variability is in a swoosh model. But if it stands for kind of a slow, gradual, moderate recovery over time, I would say we're more there than we would be any of the others. However, the difference is I think it likely is going to be more stair stepped. I think you're going to see jurisdictions open. You'll see kind of a small amount of lift-up. It will feel like a V, and then it will plateau, and then it'll feel like a V, and it will plateau. And it will feel more stair-oriented than any of the other examples. And I don't think any of us yet know this was a comment about a second wave. I just don't think we understand yet how might that impact us and how will this fall out. But we do believe that we will ultimately get back to a place where people are going to work, right? And if people are going to work, they'll probably eat something, they'll probably stop at the convenience store, they might even buy gasoline, and maybe one day, they'll take vacations. So we think over time, we're going to get back, but none of us know yet what that new normal is going to be.\nBrett Huff: Thanks for color\nOperator: Next, we have Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Thanks appreciate you squeezing me in here toward the end. Frank, you bring up you brought up Clover a few times, and I the world, at the point of sale, seems to be changing pretty quickly. Can you talk about some of the ways perhaps you're driving revenue beyond merchant discount, thinking about other sort of software solutions and stickier offerings that you may be able to bring to bear, given the advantage of owning the technology?\nFrank J. Bisignano: Well, I think one of the ways to think about it is specifically what we talked about. As we bring in software apps to do things like dine ahead, that's a perfect example, and you see such a great pickup in it, I think we've been very, very successful in adding apps and SaaS fees. So I think there's a great desire. We hone that skill over time, and we've built a lot more there. But what you also find is the power of our data and information and clients' ability to use it, very, very powerful. So I think that Clover was always designed to be much more of a platform than be a point-of-sale only. So we feel very good about it. We've invested more there, and we see the application take-up rate, very, very high. I think you're watching a change. And I think that change is pretty powerful. You see our virtual terminal expansion, very, very high. You're seeing our ability to move more businesses to be online and physical than ever before. And I think you'll see that conversion continue. And we've seen very, very good strength on it.\nJeffery W. Yabuki: I would say the other thing we're doing is I mean, we one of the things that we are quite interested is, given the assets that we have and the partnerships that we have, we see real opportunities to create ecosystems that create more value for the Clover merchant. So expanding, kind of going beyond point-of-sale and starting to create the idea of a control panel for the SMB or the business owner to better run their overall business. So we see, as we have proprietary access to solutions that allow customers to move money, to transfer, pay bills, all kinds of things, we think there's an interesting ecosystem opportunity there, which, over time, we expect to grow. It's one of the reasons why we went direct to Clover to Clover users to help them apply for PPP, the PPP program and things like that. So just think about it as an ecosystem. We think there could be real value there both in retention as well as incremental revenue on a per terminal basis.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Okay. That's helpful. And if I may, as we see also what might be an accelerating transition to fintechs, especially around stimulus and PPP, do you have a sense of urgency feeling a sense of urgency from your bank customers to perhaps accelerate their investments in technology?\nJeffery W. Yabuki: Yes. It's a good question, Andrew. I think the answer is yes. We do see people, especially over the last few weeks, if you think back to it's hard to gauge time anymore. If you think back to mid-March or the third, call it, the third and a half week in March when things really started to hit, there was a lot of focus on the digital experiences, right, no matter what size institution, everyone was very focused on that. And we've seen that continue. We've seen more usage of mobile deposit, we've seen more usage of digital transfer, we see more usage of Zelle. So all of that, I think, stokes the desire for institutions to do more. At this stage, we are being a little bit more measured in believing that will turn that demand will necessarily turn into incremental revenue this year because if you look at interest rates, you can see that there's real pressure at the FIs, and so there's a balance. And so on one hand, we aren't seeing people abandon their technology agendas; on the other hand, I am hard-pressed to see people really decide to substantially increase their level of investment. So we're watching. We like the fact that projects are going. We're able to implement things virtually. We're actually learning a lot there. That could be quite an interesting way for us to change our expense structure but, more importantly, get technologies installed faster. So we'll just keep watching and monitoring what's going on.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Thank you, for your time\nOperator: And our last question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Hi, Jeff and Frank, congratulations to both of you. Maybe I can state both my questions upfront. The first one is, as we exit this sort of bottom here, that's for me, what does normalized growth look like in each segment? And then the other question I had was, as you look at the various synergies, and I kind of like the categorization that you've kind of given, are there things that kind of hit nearer term versus further out in terms of just the timing as you think of what hits this year versus, say, later on in that five year time frame?\nJeffery W. Yabuki: So Ashwin, let me take the normalized growth question, and then Frank and Bob can add on to that, and then we'll have Frank and Bob take the synergy timing question. On the normalized growth, I think the probably the short answer to that is when will things be normal, and I think it's way premature to call what normal is going to be. I don't think we have any belief that normal this year is going to feel like the growth rates that we saw last year on balance. I think given what we've already seen in Q2, I think it's not at all likely that, that will happen. I think it's going to depend on things that are out of our control from a macro standpoint. Do we have good antibody testing? Do we have a vaccine? I mean until we see those kinds of protections in place that allow people to be more knowledgeable, I just think it's going to be hard to call normal. From our perspective, we expect we do expect to be able to, over time, see continue to win share and continue to execute better than or I'll just say, execute well. And I think that will turn into a good solid growth for us as a company. Frank, why don't you take the synergy timing question?\nFrank J. Bisignano: Yes. Thank you. I think, first of all, maybe we should start with the we Jeff and I saw the path to 900, very, very clearly and even more opportunity, and we probably made that clear as we were talking through it to you all over time. And as we peel the onion, and the teams came together, and I'd really say our ability to get stuff done from a team approach here has been very, very large, and I think the team saw the path to many more opportunities than Jeff and I actually saw with the initial group of players. And that was how we were also going to bring the best of both companies together. And people say that many times, but this is really where we're bringing that capability together. You heard it around the captive. And Jeff and I knew that one early. We didn't really know that it would go quite as well as it is. We also think about the tools we have to manage the company. You heard about the call centers. You even look at other tools. And they've allowed us to accelerate and to also allow us to be able to increase and recognize, as you could hear in our voice, that there's more opportunity as the team keeps digging in. So we feel very, very good about that. I think it's important to recognize the revenue side of it because as you see on the bank merchant, you have to look at that and see us as the partner of choice, one that gets generally picked in most situations and that people see Clover as a tremendous opportunity. But what we're seeing there is the teams, once again, are digging in, is bringing the cross-section of the company together to even get more opportunity. And I would think about us continuing to expand on that. So time is getting compressed because our leadership is able to do that, and our teams are very committed. The opportunities have gone larger. And we see a very, very good set of opportunities in front of us going forward.\nRobert W. Hau: Yes. I think the only thing I would add is we've seen, as you saw in our results and in our projections, move from $900 million to $1.2 billion over the five year period, quite quickly ratcheted up the revenue synergies back in early March when we announced both the improvements. And you see in the Q1 results, for example, corporate expense is down 10% year-over-year. We assumed all along that the duplicative corporate structure would be kind of the \"easiest\" to get at. And we've certainly seen that. We've seen nice improvement and acceleration in technology as well as in the operational efficiencies. If you look at our slides that we included in the release today, we've already executed, actioned $565 million of cost synergies. So almost half of the $1.2 billion is actioned, and that's really across all three buckets, getting that quickly. The leadership team grabbing hold of the opportunity and driving hard, particularly in light of the COVID crisis, to Jeff's earlier comment, not wasting the crisis, getting at the opportunity as quickly as we can.\nJeffery W. Yabuki: Well, thank you, Ashwin, for the final question. Thank you, everyone. I know this call went a little bit long. There's obviously lots to talk about with the world and the place that it is in. Be safe and healthy. Thanks for your support, and we look forward to talking to you soon. Have a good evening.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Thank you, good evening\nOperator: [Operator Closing Remarks]",

            "name": "Frank J. Bisignano",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeff. Good afternoon. And I can't tell you how much I've enjoyed these 18 months and how much I look forward to all the things we're going to do right here in the future. So first of all, let me say how honored I am to be elected the next CEO at Fiserv, a company with a great history and a bright future. My thanks to Jeff for his partnership and leadership to create one of the world's most admired companies. Jeff's vision for a company which invests for the future growth and allocates capital for the benefit of shareholders is the platform from which the company will continue to execute. This strategy will continue to serve our shareholders, associates and clients extremely well for the long term. We have jointly assembled a world-class team that will continue to drive innovation and excellence, allowing us to be known as the greatest fintech on the planet. I greatly appreciate Jeff and the Board's confidence in me leading the company. I feel privileged and tremendously humbled to serve our clients, our communities, our shareholders and this great company. Now on to business. A lot has changed since our last call. And while we've made great progress on integration, we have put even more focus on ensuring business continuity, protecting the health and safety of our associates and delivering on client commitments in light of the COVID-19 crisis. The team has come together beautifully. And I am incredibly proud of the company. As Jeff mentioned, Fiserv was well prepared to serve our clients through a well-tested and robust business continuity plan and an experienced and seasoned leadership team. A crisis waits for no one, whether moving 40,000 people to remote work environments, securing over 200 global locations, proactively managing credit risk or introducing alternative ways for merchant acceptance. Urgency, certainty and expertise are critical ingredients to a successful outcome. Delivering value to our clients is why we exist. Over the past several weeks, COVID has presented a number of unique opportunities to serve clients with speed, agility and innovation. Let me provide a few examples of how our solutions are helping our clients navigate these uncharted waters. Through both our Clover platform and our financial institution clients, we've processed tens of thousands of loans to enable small businesses to share in PPP funding. We are enabling a variety of expedited use cases through our MoneyNetwork prepaid card solution, including supporting the National Institute of Health's C19 research project and enabling not-for-profits to provide funds for those in need. In Argentina, we're working closely with government-owned banks to enable the distribution of benefit and subsidy payments. We've partnered with NIC to offer a walk-in bill payment services across 28 states to enable payments outside of government offices. Through our SpendTrend solution, we are providing proprietary data and insights to merchants, financial institutions and governments to enhance the understanding of economic implications across business segments and geographies. At Clover, we expedited the delivery of our new order-ahead capability which, since launch in early April, is already being used by nearly 1,800 restaurants. As Jeff mentioned, implementations have generally continued as scheduled as technology agendas for our clients remain very important. One terrific example, using a virtual team's approach. MONETA Money Bank in the Czech Republic recently completed a full migration of the bank's credit and debit card portfolios to our outsourced FirstVision service during a full quarantine period. MONETA Money Bank highlights the new ways to deliver great service, which are emerging in this challenging time. Our focus now, more than ever, is to consistently deliver high-value services. Our engagement model is at an all-time high with an enhanced focus on daily client service requests and prioritizing resources. In March, we communicated significant increases of our synergy targets, moving the cost side up by one-three from $900 million to $1.2 billion or roughly 12% of our total cost base. We also took our revenue synergy target up 20% by $100 million to $600 million over the five year period. While we are pleased with the progress to date, the synergy work is not complete. We remain fully committed to unlocking additional opportunity where possible, across both revenue and cost pools as we work toward being the best fintech and payment company on the planet. The enhanced cost synergies include additional opportunities in vendor efficiencies, contractor replacements, infrastructure and operational leverage. First, we've had great results working with our vendor partners to identify cost efficiencies for the combined company as well as acquiring new capabilities, which will have the dual benefit of avoiding internal investment and reducing capex. As a result, we have increased our expectations on procurement, primarily in technology, by about $200 million. Second, we expect to achieve additional synergy benefits from shifting original First Data's outsourced offshore operations to original Fiserv's captive. The primary savings are from converting third-party contractors, which generates cost arbitrage, improve operational efficiency and most important, no loss of knowledge as we rebadge existing third-party resources. Last, we're identifying even more savings from the consolidation of real estate, data centers and back-office systems. We've also had success extending the sophisticated call center operations of original First Data, including an AI-based virtual agent and enhanced self-service capabilities, all geared to meaningfully improve the overall experience. We have also packaged these capabilities to help supplement our clients while delivering revenue for us. We are moving more quickly to accelerate cost synergy timing as a way to offset some of the coronavirus revenue pressure. Our original expectation was more than $300 million this year. We now expect $500 million of full year synergy savings with an annualized exit rate of more than $700 million entering 2021. We feel great about our progress, and we'll continue to look for ways to add even more value. As we mentioned, on the revenue side, we raised our initial target 20% or $100 million, based primarily on anticipated outperformance in bank merchant and new opportunities in areas such as digital disbursements, payment innovation and much stronger momentum outside the U.S. than we expected. We are seeing continued strength in linking the account processing privilege relationships with our market-leading Clover solution to create unique value for our clients. To that end, we signed 55 new bank merchant clients in the quarter, with 42 of those wins through the end of February. We've now signed 109 new FI clients since the start of the program with competitive takeaways at about 40% and an even higher percentage in the larger bank space. Although sales activity has slowed due to the COVID disruption, interest remains very high with nearly 400 institutions in the pipeline. While we expect the current environment will moderate the pace of near-term revenue realization, we have raised our current expectation 15% to $230 million. In addition, we also signed another 16 institutions to our bank merchant program outside of our synergy efforts over the period, not including the expansion of nonbank partners. Although we have recalibrated the expected timing of our revenue synergies given the current economic situation, we are still expecting $75 million to $100 million of revenue synergy in 2020. Our integration is building an organization that will sustainably provide unique value. This is a critical time for the market. And we believe Fiserv, with highly differentiated market-leading solutions, is the best place for clients, associates and you, our shareholders. Now let me pass the call to Bob for a review of our financial results. Yes, thanks. Well, it sunk in that I'm the fourth CEO in a storied history. And I think if you look, we've been the world's most admired company most of 90% of this decade and before that, too. And what I've seen here and learned is a whole bunch of things. So I don't see us veering from any item that we were strategically driving. The innovation, we're very committed to that $500 million. Our capital allocation strategy, which is tried and true, is aspirational for most companies and was something that I saw when I came here and fully subscribed to it. Jeff and I have worked really, really closely together. I think we brought the team together very well. And I think really it's about continuing the client initiatives, being in the client's office and continue to innovate. Our innovation really is coming from our clients. So I don't there's look, this has been an honor and is a bittersweet moment to not be doing it with Jeff, to be honest with you. And so I don't sit here and say and never once said, said to each other, well, we're going to do that different. It's more about how we're just going to continue. And this team has really come together fabulously. So I think it's going to kind of really our best days are in front of us. So I don't there's no big changes happening here. Yes. I mean we've talked a lot about what we're doing on synergies and acceleration of synergies. But we obviously have taken other measures inside the company. And I think you'll see them come through as we go forward. I mean we stopped the 401(k) match, as an example, which was a significant effort in the company. And you probably saw us still filing on the stock plan. But more importantly, it's I think during this horrible crisis, we've been able to have tremendous focus on every element of the company. So we're continuing to spend to innovate. I think we'll or we see more development hours, not less, going on, but them going on in a very, very measured way, delivering for the client in a different manner. So as you know, both Jeff and I have always had a good eye on the cost, and we'll continue that. The synergies are forever, and we're very, very committed to those. And we as you hear us talk about them, you could see how confidence continue to build. So I think you'll see us continue to do both very well. And stay, number one, focused on our clients and revenue. Thank you. No, we don't. I mean relative to Clover, we won't see chargeback risk. And I think you heard us talk about what we did in terms of using technical expertise to get that restaurant app out there pretty quick. I mean, we've also had tremendous growth right prior to what you saw at the end of March. But I think what you'll see in Clover is us continuing to invest in it. And you should expect us to have that continue to grow very nicely and the clients with a high satisfaction level. So a full commitment, we don't see look at small businesses struggling, and we're continuing to bring functionality that helped them through this difficult period. Well, I think one of the ways to think about it is specifically what we talked about. As we bring in software apps to do things like dine ahead, that's a perfect example, and you see such a great pickup in it, I think we've been very, very successful in adding apps and SaaS fees. So I think there's a great desire. We hone that skill over time, and we've built a lot more there. But what you also find is the power of our data and information and clients' ability to use it, very, very powerful. So I think that Clover was always designed to be much more of a platform than be a point-of-sale only. So we feel very good about it. We've invested more there, and we see the application take-up rate, very, very high. I think you're watching a change. And I think that change is pretty powerful. You see our virtual terminal expansion, very, very high. You're seeing our ability to move more businesses to be online and physical than ever before. And I think you'll see that conversion continue. And we've seen very, very good strength on it. Yes. Thank you. I think, first of all, maybe we should start with the we Jeff and I saw the path to 900, very, very clearly and even more opportunity, and we probably made that clear as we were talking through it to you all over time. And as we peel the onion, and the teams came together, and I'd really say our ability to get stuff done from a team approach here has been very, very large, and I think the team saw the path to many more opportunities than Jeff and I actually saw with the initial group of players. And that was how we were also going to bring the best of both companies together. And people say that many times, but this is really where we're bringing that capability together. You heard it around the captive. And Jeff and I knew that one early. We didn't really know that it would go quite as well as it is. We also think about the tools we have to manage the company. You heard about the call centers. You even look at other tools. And they've allowed us to accelerate and to also allow us to be able to increase and recognize, as you could hear in our voice, that there's more opportunity as the team keeps digging in. So we feel very, very good about that. I think it's important to recognize the revenue side of it because as you see on the bank merchant, you have to look at that and see us as the partner of choice, one that gets generally picked in most situations and that people see Clover as a tremendous opportunity. But what we're seeing there is the teams, once again, are digging in, is bringing the cross-section of the company together to even get more opportunity. And I would think about us continuing to expand on that. So time is getting compressed because our leadership is able to do that, and our teams are very committed. The opportunities have gone larger. And we see a very, very good set of opportunities in front of us going forward."

            "name": "Jeffery W. Yabuki",
            "content": "Thanks, Peter, and good afternoon, everyone. To say we are living in interesting times is an understatement. As an example, Bob and I are here in Milwaukee, appropriately social distanced; Frank and Peter are joining from separate locations in New York; and many of you are likely at home. We are all adapting to this transitory time as we approach a new normal. We're incredibly proud of how the Fiserv team has responded, protecting your company while executing on our number one priority, keeping associates and clients safe. We activated our business continuity plan quickly, starting in Asia and continued around the world. Today, about 85% of our associates are working remotely, and the remainder are following rigorous safety protocols to protect the health of the team. Additionally, hourly associates whose jobs cannot be performed remotely have received a 25% increase in pay while we navigate the COVID crisis. We are supporting clients by providing them with the leading-edge solutions they need to serve their customers. Our account sales and service teams are adjusting the changes required in this new world, including travel by tech, connecting with clients through individual and team-based video capabilities. The substantial majority of our implementations are progressing as scheduled, and sales in the quarter held up reasonably well, coming in just shy of the prior year. We entered Q2 with a solid pipeline. And in fact, our preliminary sales results for April were up more than 20% over the prior year. We have a strong, resilient business model, which is buttressed by the delivery of mission-critical solutions to financial institutions, corporate clients and merchants around the world. We also believe leadership matters. And having more than our fair share of experienced executives who have successfully navigated the global financial and economic events of the last 30 years will contribute to even stronger results as we navigate these changing economic times. In early March, we communicated meaningful increases to our five year synergy targets, including a 20% increase in revenue to at least $600 million. And on the cost side, we increased our target by $300 million to a total of $1.2 billion which, as you will recall, does not include our sizable interest expense benefits. From day one, we believe that our significant synergies would help mitigate the potential adverse impacts of a recession. In addition to the quantum, we are intently focused on the speed to attain those synergies, all of which Frank will discuss later. The financial results for the first 10 weeks of the year were quite strong, even with some limited weakness outside the U.S. The last two weeks of the quarter got progressively worse as shelter-in-place and other restrictions ramped up around the world. The majority of the business displayed resilience with the largest negative impact in the merchant business, along with pressure in our debit-oriented transaction businesses not seen in previous downturns. The circumstances also spurred some incremental growth across several areas, including payments and digital. Global merchant transactions are generally on the upswing with some variability by country but with meaningful improvements from the lows seen in late March and early April. In the U.S., we've seen early signs of recovery in later April and May to date with comparative transactions down in the low double digits after declining nearly 30% in the last week of March. Since then, we've been seeing continuing, gradual improvement in merchant transaction recovery including into May. U.S. debit transactions were pressured but also showed improvement in the second half of April, finishing the month with low double-digit declines, a substantial improvement from the approximately 20% drop we saw in the last week of March and into early April. Overall, we are quite optimistic about the improvement we are seeing in the current trends and believe we will see further acceleration as shelter-in-place restrictions are eased in the U.S. and around the world. Given the uncertainty around COVID-19, we are withdrawing our previously communicated 2020 financial outlook. Consistent with the trends we have seen, we expect meaningful pressure on Q2's results and anticipate improvements throughout the second half of the year. Given the strength and resilience of our business model, including the significant synergy opportunities, we see a solid, actionable path to achieve double-digit adjusted earnings-per-share growth again this year. You will recall that we had expected our first quarter's results to be the weakest of the year due to a difficult compare and the ramping of synergies throughout the year. Given that, along with the impact of COVID-19, we produced solid results, including internal revenue growth of 4%, adjusted earnings-per-share growth of 16% and free cash flow increasing to $760 million for the quarter. Our capital allocation strategy was in full force, including closing the sale of a 60% interest in Investment Services, adding to our merchant capabilities through two small acquisitions and repurchasing 8.6 million shares in the quarter. Importantly, we are making excellent progress on integration with a focus on value creation across strategic, operational and financial fronts. The privileged relationships we have in our account processing businesses continue to expand, adding 12 new clients in the quarter, including five on DNA, such as Jeanne D'Arc Credit Union in Massachusetts with $1.5 billion in assets; and Nelnet, an existing output solutions client that selected DNA to support its mission of helping students make their educational dreams possible. Clover gross payment volume started strong, up 40% through February and despite the COVID hit, still ended up 29% for the quarter. Clover devices shipped was up about 25%. And the adoption of add-on software services such as virtual terminal and our new order ahead functionality continues to expand rapidly across the base. We saw important momentum in e-commerce, adding 36 new direct clients globally, including Total Wine & More, the country's largest independent retailer of fine wine; the U.S. Army Installation Management Command; USA Technologies; and Regis Salons, the largest hair salon chain in the world. We also added the German grocery chain Tegut; and MediaMarktSaturn Retail Group, Europe's largest consumer electronics retail chain with over 1,000 stores in 14 countries. E-commerce transactions remained strong in the quarter, up 26% in the U.S. and 20% globally, reflecting our market position and opportunity in digital commerce. Our integrated payments value proposition also continued to expand, growing partners more than 20% in the quarter. Impressively, ISV revenue grew more than 55% even in the face of late March weakness. We continue to see strong opportunities to grow in this important space. Overall, total contracted merchant locations globally grew 12% in the quarter. We also had very strong Zelle results, implementing eight times more clients in Q1 compared to the prior year and payment volumes skyrocketed, up nearly 90% in the quarter, and we saw even stronger growth in the second half of April as people look for new ways to pay in this new environment. We continue to see a significant value creation opportunity at the intersection of cards, DDA-based payments and our merchant scale around the world. Importantly, we remain fully committed to deploying our $500 million innovation investment. We've identified important opportunities in areas such as enterprise digital, card, merchant e-commerce, ISV and Clover. We also see expanded opportunities across the data horizon, including risk fraud and decisioning with a specific emphasis on authorization rates, network innovation and next-generation integration. We will continue to invest in 2020 and over the next several years to ensure that we are focused on where the market is going and what we need to do to win. Lastly, as you have seen, we announced our CEO succession plan earlier today, which elects Frank Bisignano to succeed me on July 1. I will serve as Executive Chairman for the remainder of the year, working closely with Frank to ensure a smooth transition. We will also work closely together to continue advancing our longer-term strategy, which will be heavily based on the well-honed capital allocation discipline which is embedded in the DNA of the company. Given my 15-year tenure, the Board and I have been engaged in deep succession planning conversations for a number of years. It has been my long-held belief that organizations benefit from changes in leadership and have used that principle to maintain a fresh approach over my time at Fiserv including, most recently, through the First Data acquisition. My conviction has gotten even stronger given the current pandemic and resultant need to manage and lead differently. Frank will bring new energy and perspective to the company while fully embracing the strategic foundation of Fiserv's value creation playbook. I've had the pleasure of working closely with Frank over the last 18 months, and it will be two years since the announcement when I ultimately depart. In addition to the things that you know such as Frank being an accomplished executive with vast experience in large, complex organizations, including doing a fantastic job as CEO of First Data, he's further established himself with our team, leading our businesses and integration, exceeding goals on our synergies and working closely with me to establish the foundation for our future success. The Board and I feel great about Frank, and he has our unanimous support as Fiserv's next CEO, only the first fourth person in our 36-year history. I'm incredibly happy for Frank and his family and offer my heartfelt congratulations to him as a business partner and my friend. It has been an honor and privilege to lead your company for what now amounts to one-four of my life. Over that time, we have transformed Fiserv into a global leader in payments and fintech and have been named the world's most admired company for seven consecutive years, all while building a sustaining culture of delivering differentiated value for clients, associates and you, our shareholders. My primary objective has been to leave the company stronger than when I found it. And while some might say we accomplished that objective, I firmly believe that the best days for Fiserv lie ahead. With that, let me turn the call to Frank. Thanks, Bob. Given the crisis, we are pleased with our sales results for the quarter, down only about 1% to the prior year as travel limitations and pandemic actions took center stage. We are seeing very few deals being canceled but did see a bit more deal slippage than normal. We are pleased to see how quickly our sales and account teams have adopted virtual selling and how well market engagement has held up in this unique time. Our pipeline is solid with good visibility into Q2, including a number of recent COVID-related opportunities. We are also seeing our larger deals in the pipeline continue to progress as clients remain completely committed to their technology agendas. For example, on April 30, we expanded our relationship with OXXO, the largest and fastest-growing chain of convenience stores in the Americas, with presence in Mexico, Colombia, Chile and Peru. In Mexico, OXXO is, by far, the convenience store leader with more than 19,000 locations, and these stores also offer bill payment, money transfers and a financial inclusion product used by millions of people. Our significantly expanded relationship will begin with their Mexico-based fintech business providing account and card processing services through our first API and FirstVision solutions. We are very excited to partner with OXXO to help them even better serve their customers. As mentioned, we are withdrawing our 2020 outlook given the uncertainty in the environment. And although we don't provide quarterly guidance, we expect meaningful pressure on Q2 revenue and earnings results compared to the prior year. However, given our strong business model and accelerated cost synergies, we see a solid path to achieve our 35th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings-per-share growth. This path generally incorporates two COVID-19 macroeconomic assumptions: first, that April and, therefore, Q2 are the transaction and volume low points, followed by a measured recovery through the balance of the year; and that we are not subject to a sweeping second wave of social distancing and shelter orders, which create further economic duress. While we don't have enough clarity to call this formal outlook, we expect far more visibility at our second quarter call, and we'll provide further directional clarity on our full year financial outlook. Your company is performing well in the midst of this once-in-a-century event. We are enhancing our already resilient business by accelerating integration, enhancing services for clients and developing strategies that will allow us to lead the industry regardless of the economic environment. We will also invest to ensure that we not only win now but emerge from this transformational time stronger and better positioned to deliver value for many, many years to come. Let me also say thank you to the 44,000 people of Fiserv, who have made us all so Fiserv proud, navigating this unprecedented time with a single focus, to serve clients with excellence and commitment each and every day. It's an honor for all of us to work with you. With that, let's open the line for questions. Thanks, Dave. Really appreciate it. Dave, right now, I just want to I want to do a great job on this quarterly call. In transaction volume, we're seeing an improvement from kind of think about it in the 30s and has improved by about two-three. And we've continued to see improvement really that started toward the end of April but really since then has continued up to and including yesterday. And we're kind of seeing that gradual improvement happening. Thanks, Darrin. I would Darrin, let me take a shot at it, and then Frank and Bob will add as needed. I would say that one of the things that's most interesting in all of this crisis is there are macro factors that really matter. So where are you what geographies are you operating in and what is going on in those countries. And then probably at least as important, what are the industries in which you are serving and where may you have concentrations. And so if you are highly concentrated in industry verticals like travel, right, airlines, things like that, you're obviously going to see a different mix than if you are, say, serving retail, grocery, those kinds of things. And the same thing applies even in e-commerce, right? E-commerce, the idea, it still depends on where it is you are laid out. And I think one of the things that's important is because of where we sit geographically, even in some of the early stages of this that we were seeing around the world when it was starting in Asia and moving around, we our concentrations are such that we weren't getting beat up as bad early as we were seeing in some other places. I think the second thing is our vertical coverage in the most impacted areas is probably more favorable for us. And so we don't have those high concentrations. And then the third piece that I would throw in there is we've continued to grow in ISV, continue to grow in e-commerce in some of the digital areas. We talked about the wins that we had. And last year, we had 80-or-so wins. And that all creates an aggregate benefit. And then lastly, some of our larger merchants, if you look at our top merchants, they tend to be more resilient or maybe less impacted on a relative basis than others. And so all of that, I think, has added up to us having better results. By the same token, we obviously have SMB exposure in Clover that we were impacted in ways that were similar to others. I think based on some of what we were hearing, we might be seeing slightly better improvements over the last few weeks. And we're looking at it very closely every day to see how it's coming together. But it's all speculation, not knowing what's inside of other people's books. We're pretty certain about what's in our book. We like the way it's trending. And we are seeing absolutely when states or countries open up, you can literally see the lights come back on in places where they were not on before, and that's a benefit to our numbers. And again, we're tracking that very closely, sometimes it feels like every minute of every day. Sure. Thanks, Darrin. I would say that one of the things that we think is most differentiating about Fiserv versus some of the other companies is we are not just a merchant business, we are not just a fintech, and we are not just a payments. We happen to have leading market positions in each of those verticals as well as a very well-structured geographic presence that, prior to this crisis, was growing very significantly. And we believe and we're continuing to invest because we believe that's going to come back on that basis. But we were seeing toward the end of April, we were seeing a pickup in Zelle. We were seeing a pickup in TransferNow. We were seeing a pickup in RDC. So all of these things that are digitally oriented, we have found to be quite valuable. The other thing that's interesting, and this is not meant to cast aspersions on fintechs because we love the fact that innovators are continuing to create what's going on, but there's been very little discussion about fintech lately and much more discussion about scale, about certainty, about making sure we're there for the customers of our clients when it's needed most. I would say that other that idea, that idea of scale, if you take a microcosm like the merchant business, which is a very fragmented business with companies like us and others of our peers, all the way through independent service organizations, smaller providers, and in those cases, whether they are long-established ISOs or brand-new innovators, scale matters, the ability to make good decisions on onboarding, how do you manage risk in a time like this, that's all very important. And we think that the team that we've assembled, combined with the assets, is going to leave us in a place where we will be a share gainer, or we should be a share gainer, in this time, and we're certainly focused on making sure that happens. That's one of the reasons why we remain committed to $500 million of innovation, including spending money this year, which we think is very important when maybe others are putting the money back on the shelf. Thank you, David. So David, I would say that the big difference in this economic dislocation versus anything that at least I've seen in my career is the manner in which the economic dislocation occurred, right? It wasn't a slant a slanted line, it was a cliff. And what we have never seen is an ability or an inability for people to use their cards or use their phones to pay for things. So we did see more impact in the debit and credit space than we would have expected. And had this been \"normal\", which is probably an unfair way to say it, normal recession, not that there's any such thing as that, I think we would have seen the normal hold up there that we had seen previously. And again, we're seeing that same recovery that we were talking about earlier happening in this area, but that's primarily because if you most of us here have been working at home largely for the last six or seven weeks. I don't fill my gas tank up very much when I don't drive it. And so it's just things like that, that people don't have the opportunities to use their debit cards and maybe their credit cards a little bit less. So you have that. In the financial segment, you or the Financial Technology segment, we're seeing exactly what we've always seen, David, and that is that's a transactionally oriented business. People are still using their they're still processing transactions, things still getting posted to the GL. I think interestingly, I think we just did a quick scan, and there are literally hundreds of thousands of PPP loans have been boarded in our core systems, and that those are new accounts. That will be part of the ecosystem. So all of those things will continue to create the stability, debit will come back. So we feel very comfortable that we still have a business of which the substantial majority of the business is highly resilient, think back to the '08, '09 days. Thank you. And Bryan, I would say that we evaluated, should we take steps that would try to better align against Q2, because to your point, Q2 is going to be a rough quarter. But we believe that as the economy opens back up, we will see that kind of slower but a gradual improvement. And doing things that damage the business for a quarter, we don't think makes sense. I'm sure you don't think they make sense. But there is a lot of discretionary opportunity to, as Frank said, reallocate effort, make sure that we are only doing things that are needed right now and potentially redirect to places that we may have a better opportunity in the future. Again, on balance, we see a very solid actionable path to double-digit adjusted earnings-per-share growth this year. And so we're taking the steps to kind of center on that and being ready for the economic recovery. The short, easy answer is yes. It's this business is a very intriguingly fixed cost business where you there are little, nano economics to costs to process that next transaction. But when you need to add a mainframe or you need to take down more bytes in a cloud or whatever, whatever technology metaphor that you want to use, you're buying that in bulk. And so from that perspective, we've got to make sure that I'm sorry, so from our perspective, as the revenue comes back on, it will flow through at a very high level. I think Bob talked about 270 basis points of impact in the quarter from that last very, very sharp off-the-cliff decline. And the other thing is the first quarter had the onetime kind of these onetime assessment items and other things that aren't we won't have to grow over. When we had given guidance, Bryan, we knew that, that was an issue. It's one of the reasons why we said, \"Hey, Q1 is going to be weaker.\" So we knew that was there. We knew it was coming. And so as things come back, we will absolutely see the benefit. I would just throw one other thing in there. We have had lots and lots of conversation around what can we do systemically to better manage, not in a short-term way, but what are the transformational things that we can do to get better leverage and flexibility in the cost structure, right? The beauty of this of not wasting a crisis is what can you learn. And we are seeing ways in which we think we can switch some of the cost structure from more fixed to variable, do different things so that when the revenue comes back, that, over time this is not a 2020 thing, but over time, we'll see an even bigger pickup in long-term margin accretion, which, as you know, is something that Fiserv has been famous for, for a long, long time. Thank you, George. George, I think where you might see more impact is less on the differential between transaction and volume. And I think you'd see that maybe play out more at the margin line only because these very large merchants are going to be priced in a different way. But again, that's all accounted for when we think about how the recovery is structured and what the puts and takes are in that as we think about what do we need to do to achieve double-digit EPS growth. Yes. George, we have seen purges going on in different places. As you would expect, I mean, banks and FIs are managing their cost structure just as tightly, if not more tightly, than we are. But again, I mean, bankers are usually pretty good at this. I think the increment is not substantial, at least not for what we've seen so far. And we expect that as we start to see a little bit more stability, that you're going to see less of that because the last thing you want to do right now is purge away for an FI to make money. Yes. It would be difficult to do that. I'm even though I'm appropriately social distanced from Bob, I think he would throw something at me or slap me if we gave that kind of detail in the algorithm. I think we'll be in a better place in July when we announced Q2 to provide that data. But I will give you some qualitative. So we have been looking at scenarios since very early April. And the scenarios have stayed fairly constant up until the last probably 10, 15 days probably 15 days, where you started to everyone was a little tentative as you started to see improvements, and you'd see up and down and up and down. But now we're seeing that trend come together. And one of the reasons why we pushed our call out, in fact, the primary reason why we pushed our call out, was we wanted to have April data by the time we got together. And I would say that April outperformed where we thought it was going to be even as recent as two weeks ago. And so from our perspective, we feel like we are taking a realistic trend to how the revenue will come in. But I would also caution us all to say we are living in unpredictable times. So we think we have a fair level of assumptions that are not incredibly aggressive, but they don't imply that we stay where we are right now for the remainder of the year, right? It's that kind of moderate, gradual improvement that gets us nowhere near where we were in the first 10 weeks of the year and nowhere near where we were last year in terms of growth rates, right? So we've taken that way down. We think it's fair and conservative. But the real reason why we're able to do this is, as Bob mentioned and Frank mentioned, we took our synergy targets up $300 million in March. And we had been working on that for quite a while, that was not new. And for us to, on a nontemporary basis, take our cost synergies up from more than $300 million to $500 million, with an exit rate of $700 million, while that took a lot of hard work at the team and it's going to continue to take hard work at the team, we did not recreate the wheel. All we did was accelerate our synergy plans, make sure we were doing the things that we need to do. And as Frank mentioned, we have another layer of things that we're looking at. We're not done. We snapped the line. We took a picture. But we will continue to do that. And as the world evolves, we'll do everything in our power to make sure that we are moderating our cost structure to the extent that revenues do things that maybe we don't think they should be doing, or we'd like them to be doing. So I apologize, Jason, for the longer answer. But that's at least the way we're thinking about it philosophically. And again, we wouldn't have made the statement if we didn't feel like we had a good, solid path and an actionable path to get there. And Jason, I think we would also add, from our perspective, and you heard this a little bit in the prepared remarks, we have people who have been through all kinds of cycles. And one of the things that was so incredibly heartening to me is not only do we have people who work for us today, but Frank, through his very powerful Rolodex I'm probably too old to use that word but through his powerful Rolodex, brought back people who have incredible G2 incredible experience, and we were able to very quickly get our arms around the exposures in the company. And we have been paying a lot of attention to what's going on, whether they be around industry verticals, refund levels, chargebacks, those kinds of things. And we feel like we are very appropriately reserved for where we are today, especially in Clover. In terms of the kind of exposures you have in areas like that are not nearly as meaningful as you would in merchant acquiring for industries that are on a deferred delivery basis. And most of what Clover does is a kind of right now or very near-end kind of service delivery. Thank you, Brett. I would say, at least right now, we have not seen new innovations this may be a little bit unfair, but new innovations yet that we would say, let's shift our focus from this basket to this basket. However, I would say that there are several things that we have been working on that we are quite excited about that we had planned to talk a little bit about at Investor Day, but areas that we think there's really significant opportunity. And we at some point, we'll be able to talk about it, but we don't necessarily think it would be prudent to do that right this second. But Brett, there are some really interesting opportunities out there, overall, probably in shades of the things that we've talked about before but could have a real impact on revenue, margin growth but, most importantly, client value. I would say it probably not exactly sure what the economic variability is in a swoosh model. But if it stands for kind of a slow, gradual, moderate recovery over time, I would say we're more there than we would be any of the others. However, the difference is I think it likely is going to be more stair stepped. I think you're going to see jurisdictions open. You'll see kind of a small amount of lift-up. It will feel like a V, and then it will plateau, and then it'll feel like a V, and it will plateau. And it will feel more stair-oriented than any of the other examples. And I don't think any of us yet know this was a comment about a second wave. I just don't think we understand yet how might that impact us and how will this fall out. But we do believe that we will ultimately get back to a place where people are going to work, right? And if people are going to work, they'll probably eat something, they'll probably stop at the convenience store, they might even buy gasoline, and maybe one day, they'll take vacations. So we think over time, we're going to get back, but none of us know yet what that new normal is going to be. I would say the other thing we're doing is I mean, we one of the things that we are quite interested is, given the assets that we have and the partnerships that we have, we see real opportunities to create ecosystems that create more value for the Clover merchant. So expanding, kind of going beyond point-of-sale and starting to create the idea of a control panel for the SMB or the business owner to better run their overall business. So we see, as we have proprietary access to solutions that allow customers to move money, to transfer, pay bills, all kinds of things, we think there's an interesting ecosystem opportunity there, which, over time, we expect to grow. It's one of the reasons why we went direct to Clover to Clover users to help them apply for PPP, the PPP program and things like that. So just think about it as an ecosystem. We think there could be real value there both in retention as well as incremental revenue on a per terminal basis. Yes. It's a good question, Andrew. I think the answer is yes. We do see people, especially over the last few weeks, if you think back to it's hard to gauge time anymore. If you think back to mid-March or the third, call it, the third and a half week in March when things really started to hit, there was a lot of focus on the digital experiences, right, no matter what size institution, everyone was very focused on that. And we've seen that continue. We've seen more usage of mobile deposit, we've seen more usage of digital transfer, we see more usage of Zelle. So all of that, I think, stokes the desire for institutions to do more. At this stage, we are being a little bit more measured in believing that will turn that demand will necessarily turn into incremental revenue this year because if you look at interest rates, you can see that there's real pressure at the FIs, and so there's a balance. And so on one hand, we aren't seeing people abandon their technology agendas; on the other hand, I am hard-pressed to see people really decide to substantially increase their level of investment. So we're watching. We like the fact that projects are going. We're able to implement things virtually. We're actually learning a lot there. That could be quite an interesting way for us to change our expense structure but, more importantly, get technologies installed faster. So we'll just keep watching and monitoring what's going on. So Ashwin, let me take the normalized growth question, and then Frank and Bob can add on to that, and then we'll have Frank and Bob take the synergy timing question. On the normalized growth, I think the probably the short answer to that is when will things be normal, and I think it's way premature to call what normal is going to be. I don't think we have any belief that normal this year is going to feel like the growth rates that we saw last year on balance. I think given what we've already seen in Q2, I think it's not at all likely that, that will happen. I think it's going to depend on things that are out of our control from a macro standpoint. Do we have good antibody testing? Do we have a vaccine? I mean until we see those kinds of protections in place that allow people to be more knowledgeable, I just think it's going to be hard to call normal. From our perspective, we expect we do expect to be able to, over time, see continue to win share and continue to execute better than or I'll just say, execute well. And I think that will turn into a good solid growth for us as a company. Frank, why don't you take the synergy timing question? Well, thank you, Ashwin, for the final question. Thank you, everyone. I know this call went a little bit long. There's obviously lots to talk about with the world and the place that it is in. Be safe and healthy. Thanks for your support, and we look forward to talking to you soon. Have a good evening."

            "name": "Robert W. Hau",
            "content": "Thank you, Frank, and good afternoon, everyone. I will discuss our results utilizing our new reportable segment structure included on the 8-K filed on April 1. We have three business segments. Merchant Acceptance, which we may refer to as acceptance or merchant, is primarily the global merchant acquiring business of original First Data. Financial Technology, or fintech, comprises original Fiserv's core account processing businesses, along with digital banking, financial and risk management and other software-oriented solutions. And finally, Payments and Network, or payments, is the most blended segment between the original companies and is primarily global debit, credit and prepaid card issuer processing, print and card production services and electronic payment services such as bill payment, biller and Zelle. As you heard, the company had a very strong performance through mid-March, well above our original expectations, and even with the significant decline in the last two weeks, still achieved 4% internal revenue growth. The results are even better when considering that result was against our most difficult quarterly comparison as Q1 2019 included a high level of nonrecurring and periodic revenue. Revenue synergies were a strong $27 million in the quarter. Adjusted operating income, which includes the grow over impact of the Investment Services Transaction, increased 1% to $968 million in the quarter with adjusted operating margin up 10 basis points to 27.8%. Operating margin was lower than anticipated due to the sharp decline in revenue in the second half of March and expected lower onetime and periodic revenue, partially offset by about $90 million of expense synergies in the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share was up 16% to $0.99 compared to the $0.85 in the prior year as adjusted for the Investment Services Transaction that closed this quarter. Internal revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was a very solid 6% for the quarter. These results were buoyed by our geographical breadth, diverse industry verticals and broad payment capabilities. North America internal revenue growth was 5% for the quarter after being up double digits through February. Our international business grew 7% on a constant currency basis, even as COVID impacts were seen in Asia and Europe earlier in Q1. We continue to make great progress on the dissolution of the BAMS joint venture. Consistent with our internal revenue growth methodology, beginning this quarter, we are excluding the 51% share of BAMS acquiring revenue from our internal revenue growth calculation due to the planned dissolution at the end of June. We will incorporate our new direct BAMS revenue as we would in any acquired business beginning one year post the close of the transaction. We look forward to continuing to serve this important client. Adjusted operating income in the acceptance segment decreased 17% to $283 million in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin declined 440 basis points to 21.2%. Two issues drove the unusual margin decline, led by roughly 270 basis point headwind, primarily related to the very sharp COVID volume decline at quarter's end, with roughly two-three of that amount from our higher growth international business. Next, the comparative negative impact of brand assessment fees, along with the expiration of a 10-year deferred revenue item in BAMS, which ended in Q2 last year, pushed margin down by another 200 basis points. Although we were able to outgrow the revenue decline in March, the resulting mix changed, served to compress operating performance in the quarter. We anticipate the segment operating margin to remain under pressure in Q2 due to the COVID-19 impacts. The Payments and Network segment delivered internal revenue growth of 3% in the quarter. Growth was led by card services and output solutions, including revenue synergy benefits, partially offset by lower growth in biller solutions and prepaid as well as the negative impact of the COVID-19 at the end of the quarter. Transactional businesses performed well in the first 10 weeks of the quarter but saw a significant falloff at the finish. Debit transactions were up mid-single digits for the quarter, which includes the impact of double-digit declines in late March which also carried into early April. As you heard, we've seen improvements through April as some markets reopen and stimulus payments hit in the U.S. P2P transactions, which include both Popmoney and Zelle, continued their rapid growth, nearly doubling versus Q1 last year and up 14% sequentially. The number of clients using Zelle has increased nearly tenfold compared to a year ago and is up 44% from Q4 2019. We've also been seeing even stronger performance in Zelle and TransferNow over the last couple of weeks as we believe consumers are expanding their use of safe and secure digital money movement. Adjusted operating income for the segment was excellent, growing 10% to $575 million in the quarter, and operating margin was up 280 basis points to 41.2%. The increase was primarily from growth in high-quality revenue, synergy benefits and productivity gains. The fintech segment saw internal revenue growth of 1% as gains in high-quality recurring revenue was partially offset by the expected decline in periodic revenue. Revenue in this segment tends to be quite resilient and less subject to variation due to the macroeconomics. We saw strong interest in demand for a broad array of digital solutions in the quarter. Mobiliti ASP subscribers increased 9% in the quarter to more than 9.2 million. And Architect, our single digital platform, had year-over-year growth of 34% to four million users. We also saw a measurable increase in digital interactions, along with a greater use of underlying functionality. Adjusted operating income was flat in the quarter at $204 million, and adjusted operating margin was up 30 basis points to 28.3%. The underlying results are stronger than they appear given a meaningful decline in license and termination fee revenue in the quarter. Core performance was driven primarily by higher recurring revenue, along with cost and operational efficiencies. The adjusted corporate operating loss in the quarter improved 10% to $94 million due to the benefits of cost synergies. The adjusted effective tax rate was up 80 basis points to 17.5% due to the combination of lower discrete tax items and reduced stock-based compensation benefits in the current year resulting from the First Data transaction. We continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate of 22% to 23% for the full year. Free cash flow was up 3% to $760 million in the quarter, driven by strong operating results despite an approximate $100 million year-over-year headwind associated with merchant settlement timing. Free cash flow conversion was 111% in the quarter. We repurchased 8.6 million shares for $885 million in the quarter, which included redeploying just over $500 million of net proceeds from the majority sale of Investment Services. We bought more shares than anticipated under our 10b5-1 plan due to the volatility in the quarter and do not anticipate repurchasing shares at the first quarter's level for the remainder of the year. As of March 31, we had 674 million shares outstanding and over 13 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase. Total debt outstanding, which is about 75% fixed rate, was $22 billion, and debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was 3.8 times as of March 31. We are on track to return to our historic level of leverage within 18 to 24 months post First Data merger through a combination of debt repayment and EBITDA growth. Additionally, we anticipate refinancing some of our current debt as we have an $850 million bond maturing this quarter. Our balance sheet and liquidity positions are very strong, and we continue to expect we will generate significant free cash flow even in this economic downturn. We repaid $123 million of bank debt in the quarter and expect to repay more than $1 billion over the remainder of the year. While we are uncertain of the full impact of COVID-19 on our near-term business results, the combination of a resilient business model, a well-honed capital allocation strategy, $1.2 billion of anticipated cost synergies and a very experienced management team provides us with confidence that we will create sustained value for clients and shareholders through any economic cycle. With that, let me turn the call back to Jeff. Yes. Dave, it's Bob. I think we try to give some color in the prepared remarks around that. From a synergy standpoint, recall that the Merchant Acceptance segment is largely is comprised of the original First Data merchant business. And so you're not seeing a lot of straight natural synergies, of overlap that you might first of all, in the corporate segment as well as in our Payments and Network business, where you see more of the synergies particularly in the early stages post merger. And Bryan, the one thing I would add to kind of follow on and echo Frank's comment. One of the things we've talked about the last six months is should we end up in a recession, having now $1.2 billion of cost synergies ahead of us gives us an opportunity to pull levers harder. And you heard us talk about original expectation of $300 million of cost synergies, now grown to $500 million with an exit run rate of $700 million, that's permanent cost-out. That is not damaging the business. That is executing an integration plan a little bit faster than we had initially planned, given the opportunity that we have to do that, and reallocate resources. So we feel quite good about our ability to mitigate the downside during the COVID crisis but, more importantly, come up much stronger on the other side as we exit 2020 and exit 2021 and beyond. Yes. I would say nominally higher, relatively close. And of course, the other impact is relative Q1 to Q2. Q1, we saw that rapid decline in just the last two weeks where we're dealing with the improvement over a longer period of time. So we didn't bounce right back after just two weeks. Although we've seen some nice improvement, we're still down that low double digits in the quarter. Yes. I think the only thing I would add is we've seen, as you saw in our results and in our projections, move from $900 million to $1.2 billion over the five year period, quite quickly ratcheted up the revenue synergies back in early March when we announced both the improvements. And you see in the Q1 results, for example, corporate expense is down 10% year-over-year. We assumed all along that the duplicative corporate structure would be kind of the \"easiest\" to get at. And we've certainly seen that. We've seen nice improvement and acceleration in technology as well as in the operational efficiencies. If you look at our slides that we included in the release today, we've already executed, actioned $565 million of cost synergies. So almost half of the $1.2 billion is actioned, and that's really across all three buckets, getting that quickly. The leadership team grabbing hold of the opportunity and driving hard, particularly in light of the COVID crisis, to Jeff's earlier comment, not wasting the crisis, getting at the opportunity as quickly as we can."

        "content": "Operator: Welcome to the Fiserv 2021 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] \n As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Shub Mukherjee, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. \nShub Mukherjee: Thank you, and good morning. With me on the call today are Frank Bisignano, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and supplemental materials for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Please refer to these materials for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this call, along with the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. Unless otherwise noted, performance references are year-over-year comparisons. \n Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results and strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. You should refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. As a reminder from our last earnings call, we will now be using the term organic revenue, which has replaced internal revenue and is still calculated on a constant currency basis. \n And now over to Frank. \nFrank Bisignano: Thank you, Shub, and thank you all for joining us this morning. As you know, we serve as the operating system for commerce and money movement across our client base of banks, credit unions, fintechs, and businesses ranging from SMBs to mid-market or large enterprises. We help our clients grow by extending our platform to capture new services and new money flows. \n As we exit the second year of pandemic, we had another successful year of delivering on our growth agenda. We delivered 11% organic revenue growth for both the fourth quarter and full year at the high end of our 7% to 12% outlook that we originally provided at our December 2020 Investor Day. \n We expanded full year adjusted operating margins by 250 basis points. We also achieved 26% growth year-over-year in adjusted earnings per share to $5.58, well above our original outlook of $5.25 to $5.45. Our merchant platforms, Clover and Clover Connect for small- and medium-sized businesses and Carat for enterprises are showing very strong growth. \n We are winning in omnichannel and seeing strong growth in value-added services such as Clover software, fraud, risk, lending and payment flows, including disbursements and cross-border. Our acquisitions of BentoBox and NetPay give us the assets to enhance self-service offerings in verticals like restaurants and allow us to power new flows via paybacks. \n We are successfully meeting our FI clients' goal of driving digital engagement through our best-in-class online and mobile banking platform ability as well as integrated mobile-first surround solutions such as CardHub, featuring Ondot for retail customers and SpendLabs for small business customers. Recall that we bought Ondot and SpendLabs in 2021 and are already seeing great traction with them. We expect these solutions will have a positive effect, strengthening our client value proposition across core banking, payment processing and the network business. \n We made outstanding progress on the integration of Fiserv and First Data. The fourth quarter marks the completion of our cost synergy program. We achieved our target of $1.2 billion, $300 million above our original commitment and 2 years ahead of schedule. We actioned $480 million of revenue synergies and are now at 80% of the increased commitment of $600 million. \n We anticipate obtaining the full $600 million of revenue synergies by the end of this year, 18 months ahead of schedule. Strengthening our leadership as our clients' partner of choice yesterday, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire the remaining ownership interest in Finxact. We were an initial investor in Finxact, a leading developer of cloud-native banking solutions that is powering digital transformation across financial services. This is an investment in the next-generation financial technology that supports our strategy to continuously innovate for our clients and broaden our total addressable market. \n Finxact will not only augment our ability to enrich and accelerate the delivery of digital solutions we offer to our existing clients, but also broaden our solutions to include large financial institutions, fintechs, banking as a service and embedded finance opportunities. We've worked closely with the Finxact team and look forward to welcoming Frank Sanchez, his leadership team and the entire Finxact organization to Fiserv when the deal closes later this year. \n Our business momentum and investments thus far position us very well for the future. Accordingly, we have good visibility into accelerating our organic growth to a rate of 7% to 9%, above our average for the last 3 years and in line with our medium-term outlook. We expect 2022 adjusted EPS to be $6.40 to $6.55, which is a growth of 15% to 17%. This, when combined with the 26% growth we delivered in 2021 will generate a 2-year compounded annual growth of 21%, above the high end of our medium-term outlook range of 15% to 20%. \n Turning to the business segments. Let me start with merchant acceptance. We continue to focus on investing in our leading merchant operating systems, Clover and Carat, to provide products and services that expand our addressable market and to drive growth for our clients in the SMB and enterprise space. These operating systems continue to perform well and were key drivers of merchant acceptance organic revenue growth of 19% and 20% for the quarter and year, respectively.\n Clover continues to be the commerce and business management platform of choice for SMBs in the U.S. and around the world. In 2021, as small business recovery took hold, merchants turned to Clover for leading in-store payment solutions, online commerce capabilities and new vertical services to grow their business. We completed our acquisition of BentoBox, a leading digital ordering and delivering management platform to help out close to 200,000 restaurant owners on our platform reach more customers. \n In addition to BentoBox, we signed a variety of strategic partnerships to enhance the tools restaurants need to be successful. One such example is our new partnership with Google to enable customers to more easily find and order from Clover restaurant locations. \n As we roll out these holistic SaaS-based solutions, we see notable increases in the average revenue per merchant. We are very excited about continuing this success and replicating it across other verticals. Closing out 2021, Clover is better positioned than ever as the leading operating system for SMBs. \n Carat, our omnichannel ecosystem serving enterprise clients continues to grow across the board. We saw particular strength in omnichannel transactions, which were up 51% in 2021. As the demand for omnichannel solutions persisted through 2021, demand for our integrated solutions such as disbursements, payback enablement, EBT and other digital capabilities rose to an all-time high. \n Disbursements have become an important part of the consumer experience in many verticals through the pandemic. Consumers and businesses want simple, fast access to their money digitally. Carat is well positioned to drive growth in disbursements as evidenced in its expanded relationships with a number of companies within the insurance and ride-sharing sectors as well as digital wallet companies, including marquee brands such as Coinbase.\n Turning to our cross-border capabilities, we continue to see strength from the recovery with double-digit cross-border transaction growth in 2021. Looking forward into 2022, we will continue to push deeper into key priority areas, including omnichannel disbursements and cross-border to expand the breadth and depth of services for our enterprise clients.  \n Moving to the Payments and Network segment. Organic revenue grew 8% in the quarter and 6% for the full year. Within the issuer business, we saw notable strength in general purpose active accounts, now ahead of pre-pandemic levels. Our card business continues to provide growth above the segment average from strength in digital risk solutions, debit network volumes and debit transaction growth. \n Market-leading innovative solutions like CardHub and SpendLabs are both enhancing revenue and reducing churn. In fact, SpendLabs' product market fit is stronger than we had originally anticipated and this offering, along with CardHub, are notably contributing to our expanded presence with mid-market FIs for card processing solutions. \n These surrounds not only greatly enhance the competitiveness of our credit and debit card processing offerings, but also serve to drive more cards into our debit network and more opportunities for Fiserv to offer risk and fraud, digital banking and account processing solutions, yet again, demonstrating our ability to harness the power of our unmatched distribution platform. Looking to 2022, we expect to see continued momentum from the ramp of our large credit issuer wins in 2020 and 2021, including Alliance Data, Atlanticus and Genesis, 3 top 25 issuers, strengthen our digital offerings with CardHub and SpendLabs and strengthen Zelle. \n Moving to the Financial Technology segment. The fourth quarter was in line with our expectations, posting organic revenue growth of 4%, closing out the year up 4%. We finished 2021 strong on sales with 48 new core wins, including competitive takeaways with marquee names such as Valley Bank and Dollar Bank. Not only are we winning in core account processing, but also seeing success in cross-selling pan-Fiserv capabilities to clients. This is demonstrated in our competitive takeaway of Great Southern Bank, an institution with more than $5 billion in assets. With this agreement, Great Southern Bank will be moving to a complete suite of Fiserv offerings across core account processing, digital banking surrounds, card processing and output solutions. \n We are continuing to win in the higher-growth $1 billion to $50 billion asset segment. Clients continue to choose Fiserv as their strategic technology partner to power combined entities into the future. Key wins in 2021 include NYCB's merger with Flagstar and First Interstate Bank's merger with Great Western. Sales of digital surround solutions grew strong double digits in 2021, driven by the increased digital focus of our financial institution clients and the success of Abiliti, our modern online mobile banking platform. \n We finished the year with 434 sales to existing and new logos. Sales to existing clients helped deepen the penetration of our fully integrated digital surrounds such as CardHub, Zelle and SpendLabs. It is clear that our solutions are already winning in the market. We will accelerate this momentum through our announced agreement to acquire Finxact, which will enable clients to quickly deploy modular banking services, including deposits, loans, cards as well as launch new banking solutions, including a digital bank, bank-as-a-service and embedded finance. \n We have already made strides in the category of API development, and the market is recognizing our leadership. In 2021, we are proud to accept an award for the Best in Finance APIs for our Communicator Advantage API platform at the API World Awards and for AllData Connect, our data aggregation portal at the Business Intelligent Group's 2022 BIG Innovation Awards. \n Looking into 2022 and beyond, the powerful combination of our market-leading banking cores, along with Finxact, which enables clients to launch modern, flexible and highly personalized digital banking experience and ability, our industry-leading online and mobile banking platform will position us to better serve our existing clients and a broader array of customers. \n Now let me pass the discussion to Bob for more detail on our financial results. \nRobert Hau: Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. I'll cover some detail on each of our segments. If you're following along on our slides, I'm starting with Slide 5. \n We feel great about our performance for both the quarter and the full year, and we are well positioned to achieve a strong 2022 and beyond with sustained value for our clients and our shareholders. As Frank said, we are projecting 7% to 9% revenue growth for 2022, which is 150 to 350 basis points above our average growth over the last 3 years. Total company organic revenue was up 11% in the quarter with growth across all segments, led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 19%. \n For the full year, total company organic revenue grew 11%, also led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 20%. Total company adjusted revenue also grew 11% to over $4 billion in the quarter. And for the full year, adjusted revenue grew 11% to $15.4 billion. \n Fourth quarter adjusted operating income was up 11% to $1.4 billion, and adjusted operating margin was in line with the prior year at a very strong 35.6%. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 19% to $5.2 billion, and adjusted operating margin expanded 250 basis points to 33.9%. \n We expect 2022 margin to expand an incremental 150 basis points or more above last year. This is driven by strong organic revenue growth of 7% to 9% on a scaled business and a continued focus on productivity, all while we continue to make meaningful investments for organic growth. \n In addition, as you heard earlier from Frank, we are proud to announce that we reached our $1.2 billion action cost synergy goal in the quarter, which is a result of our disciplined execution to drive value. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 21% to $1.57. And through December 31, adjusted earnings per share grew 26% to $5.58. \n Free cash flow was $1.2 billion for the quarter, up 18% from fourth quarter last year, resulting in a conversion of 119%. For the full year, free cash flow was $3.5 billion with a conversion to net income of 94%, driven by strong revenue growth and increases in working capital as well as capital investment and organic innovation for our clients, integration of our acquisitions and investment in technology infrastructure and real estate to create world-class collaboration space for our associates as we return to offices. \n For 2022, we expect free cash flow conversion to be between 95% and 100% of net income, investments in products and services to accelerate growth and the tail end of technology infrastructure and real estate investments, particularly our new technology and innovation hub in North Central New Jersey, which we will occupy later this year. \n Now looking to our segment results starting on Slide 7. Organic revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was a very strong 19% in the quarter and 20% for 2021. Global transactions and volume grew 13% and 16% in the quarter and 13% and 19% for the year, respectively. Excluding the impact of the exit of a processing client we discussed last quarter, Global Transactions volume grew 18% and 22% in the quarter and 17% and 24% in the year, respectively. Building off one of the best years for merchant location growth, we ended the fourth quarter with 10% higher global merchant locations versus the comparable quarter a year ago. \n Clover continues to build upon the momentum and strength of our product offering as opposed to a very strong 50% GPV growth year-over-year or $201 billion on an annualized basis. We've seen exciting opportunities for Clover this quarter, including our partnership with the University of Notre Dame and the UBS Arena in New York. These wins further strengthen our positioning with sports arenas globally and highlight our success in integrating the Money Pass mobile business we acquired in 2020. \n Carat, our platform for enterprise clients, saw omnichannel transaction growth of 26% in the quarter, driven by 59 client wins, including notable wins such as Papaya gaming and expanded relationships with Wegmans, a regional supermarket chain with 106 stores and with a leading home improvement client to serve their clients end to end. Our ISV volume this quarter through Clover Connect grew 64% year-over-year and 53% on a 2-year CAGR. We signed 45 ISVs this quarter, bringing our total signs to 187 for the year, and we are winning both ISVs that are new to payments as well as competitive takeaways. \n We had several notable international wins in the quarter, including an expanded partnership with UnionPay International, one of the world's largest payment networks to broaden the acceptance of UnionPay cards across Fiserv's global footprint, and with FirstCaribbean International Bank for merchant processing across its banking footprint in the Caribbean region. \n Additionally, we executed on an agreement with National Australia Bank for merchant processing in Australia. Adjusted operating income in the Acceptance segment increased 20% to $533 million in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was up 60 basis points to 31.3%, driven by continued top line strength. Through December 31, adjusted operating income improved 45% to $2 billion and adjusted operating margin grew 540 basis points to 30.8%. \n Before I leave the Merchant segment, as you may have noticed in our third quarter 10-Q filing, we anticipate the sale of a portion of our back book to a merchant alliance partner. This is fully contemplated in our outlook, and will have less than a 50 basis point impact on adjusted revenue for the company in 2022. We expect the transaction to close in the current quarter. \n Turning to Slide 8. The Payments and Network segment posted organic revenue growth of 8% in the quarter, resulting in a full year growth of 6%. For the quarter, card services and digital payments outperformed the segment organic revenue growth rate. Credit came in slightly under the segment average and bill pay continued as a headwind. \n Within card services, debit transactions grew 14% in the quarter. The strength of our credit offering for financial institutions was manifested in a notable win in the fourth quarter, an agreement with Randolph-Brooks Federal Credit Union, an institution with over $14 billion in assets and over 1 million members to provide our credit processing capabilities. \n Within issuer solutions, we are well underway with our onboarding the $120 million of new business we announced at our December 2020 Investor Day as well as other mandates awarded since. We have completed the onboarding of Atlanticus, a competitive takeaway; and BBVA, an M&A consolidation win. Onboarding is well underway for Genesis, another competitive takeaway, and for Alliance Data. This momentum continues. \n In addition to the merchant processing wins I mentioned earlier, we also signed long-term card issuing agreements with both National Australia Bank and UnionPay International. These wins demonstrate our ability to serve our clients on multiple fronts. Consumer demand for content count and P2P offerings continued with Zelle transactions up 71% and the number of clients live on Zelle was up 57% in the quarter. \n Finally, within bill pay, we have 2 notable fourth quarter wins in the health care vertical, demonstrating our strength in this high-growth segment of the market and broadening our client base from what has traditionally been the utilities and telecom focused offering. Blue Shield of California, a leading health plan in California, has chosen to extend the relationship with Fiserv as part of their enterprise-wide process of digital transformation. Additionally, CareSource, a nationally recognized nonprofit health care plan competitively selected Fiserv to improve their member experience through our robust technology platform. \n Adjusted operating income for the segment was up 8% to $713 million, and adjusted operating margin was down 20 basis points to 46.2% in the quarter, given tough comps. Q4 operating margin was the second highest margin recorded for the segment, second only to Q4 of last year. For the full year, adjusted operating income was up 8% to $2.6 billion and adjusted operating margin was up 80 basis points to 44.1%. \n Turning to Slide 9. The Financial Technology segment organic revenue grew at 4% in the fourth quarter and for the full year within our medium-term outlook for this segment. Our digital banking capabilities and digital solution offerings continue to win in the marketplace. In the fourth quarter, we added 14 new core account processing clients, bringing us to 48 core wins in the year, more than half of which were takeaways. Mobile deposits in Q4 grew 9% over the prior year, while self-service ATM deposits grew 52% over last year. \n Adjusted operating income was up 6% in the quarter to $287 million and up 9% year-to-date to $1.1 billion. Adjusted operating margin in the segment increased 80 basis points in the quarter to 37.3%. For the full year, adjusted operating margin expanded 160 basis points to 35.8%. The adjusted corporate operating loss was $102 million in the quarter, in line with our expectations. \n The adjusted effective tax rate for both the quarter and full year was 20% and in line with our expectations. We expect 2022's effective tax rate to be approximately 21%, up slightly as 2021 benefited from a few discrete tax planning items. 2021 was another demonstration of our disciplined capital allocation strategy, which includes fortifying our strong balance sheet, returning value to shareholders through share repurchases, driving organic growth through investment and pursuing high-value acquisitions. \n We invested approximately $850 million in M&A to acquire capabilities that we are best positioned to deploy across our scaled platform. We completed our acquisitions of BentoBox, NetPay and Integrity Payments, bringing our total transactions to 7 in 2021. And as Frank mentioned, we further strengthened our portfolio through the announced acquisition of Finxact, a developer of cloud-native banking solutions. \n Additionally, we returned $2.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchase this year, including $1 billion in the fourth quarter for 9.9 million shares. We have more than 42 million shares of repurchase authorization remaining. And finally, total debt outstanding was $21 billion on December 31. The debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio decreased to 3.1x, down nearly a full turn since we merged. \n With that, let me turn the call back to Frank. \nFrank Bisignano: Thanks, Bob. I'm very proud of the goals we've accomplished with another quarter of double-digit adjusted revenue growth and double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Given the breadth and depth of our portfolio, as well as our history of strong operational performance, we believe we will deliver 7% to 9% organic revenue growth and 15% to 17% adjusted earnings per share growth to a range of $6.40 to $6.55. We expect each of our business segments to deliver organic revenue growth within the range of our medium-term outlook. \n Finally, I invite you to participate in an investor call we will be hosting in the next several weeks focused on our merchant acceptance business with a particular emphasis on Clover as a key driver of growth for the segment and the company. \n In addition to delivering on our financial results, we continue to focus on our associates and our communities. Our approach to corporate social responsibility is designed to incorporate a philanthropic, associate and community engagement to deliver thoughtful, strategic decisions where we invest our time and talent. \n Diversity and inclusion remains on the top of our ESG agenda and the results of our efforts speak for themselves. In January of the current year, Fiserv was named to the 2022 Bloomberg Gender Equality Index, marking our sixth consecutive year for this recognition. For the second consecutive year, Fiserv has been designated a best place to work for LGBTQ+ equality in the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's 2022 Corporate Equality Index. Now in its 20th year, the CEI is the national benchmarking tool on corporate policies, practices and benefits pertinent to LGBTQ+ employees. \n Since 2020, we have allocated $35 million of the $50 million commitment designed to help small minority-owned businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and associated initiatives. In Q4, Fiserv was ranked #4 on Military Times Best for Vets Employers list, the fifth year in a row in the top 5 and #1 ranked in our category. \n Continuing our initiatives to support better and affiliated businesses, this quarter, we announced an extension of our partnership with the Institute for Veterans and Military Families at Syracuse University. And during our fourth quarter season of giving campaign, associate donations along with corporate matching donations from Fiserv contributed to over 1,200 community groups globally. I am proud of the positive impact of philanthropic and community programs have had in 2021, and I look forward to us doing more in 2022 to help businesses and communities thrive. \n I will close by thanking all 40,000-plus hard-working Fiserv associates around the world for working relentlessly to serve our clients and you, our shareholders. \n With that, operator, please open the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. \nLisa Dejong Ellis: Good stuff here. I had a question with just hoping to drill in a little bit on your outlook for Merchant Acceptance for 2022. I know you mentioned you're expecting it to return to the medium-term range. I think that's 9% to 12%. So are you expecting Merchant Acceptance to get back to double-digit growth? And then could you drill in a little bit on 2 of the big drivers in there, what you're looking for out of Clover and then maybe what you're looking for out of your international business as you look out into 2022 to give you confidence in that outlook? \nFrank Bisignano: So first of all, yes, 9% to 12%. And yes, we're driving business to double digit. I think there's a multipronged effort here. And obviously, we have a lot of assets in the portfolio that are performing very, very well, whether it be our ISV business, whether it be in Carat. \n But specifically, the growth in Clover, we believe, will happen both in the U.S. and then in our global expansion on it also. And we continue to see that have very, very strong visibility and how deployment will happen outside the U.S. during the course of this year. And then you layer on top of that the Caixa partnership, the [ Deutsche ] partnership, and you can see us extending out in all regions, really. \n So you should expect to see Clover growth. You should expect to see geographic expansion. But you should also expect to see strong e-comm trajectory along with ISV trajectory as we continue to invest in Clover and Carat and the ISV business and continue to fuel our international growth. \nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. \nTien-Tsin Huang: Yes. Really happy to see the 7% to 9% organic revenue growth for this year. I want to ask just on the margin outlook to get there for the segments. Where are you investing more aggressively? I know you have some integrations and implementations to do as well plus productivity. So any color there would be terrific. \nRobert Hau: Yes, Tien-Tsin, I'll start and Frank can jump in. I think you'll see continued investments in all 3 of our segments. Obviously, each one of them have a slightly different growth trajectory. As Frank just talked in answering Lisa's comment about the 9% to 12% merchant growth, we expect all 3 of our segments to perform in the medium-term outlook range, 4% to 6% for the Fintech segment and 5% to 8% for payments.\n And you're seeing us focus on bringing new solutions to our clients on where they want us to meet, obviously, really across the board, the continued drive for digital, for mobile expanding out our capabilities to integrate all of our solutions. You heard me in my prepared remarks talk about the new wins with UnionPay and with National Australia Bank, 2 individual contracts that both had merchant and payments incorporated in them. \n And so we'll continue to invest in building out those capabilities. We continue to invest in our digital capability around our CardHub acquisition with Ondot, with SpendLabs. Our Abiliti solution, our bank -- digital banking solution that we launched earlier this year, a cloud-native online banking solution will continue to expand in the marketplace. And obviously, once we close with Finxact, it will be a focus of ours as we build out that capability. \nFrank Bisignano: Maybe I'd say 1 or 2 other things. We have tremendous visibility due to the amount of wins you've heard us talk about. You could see that we have had very, very good momentum in the sales cycle, and that's all about future growth. \n I also think the investments we are making are for future growth. So the 7% to 9% we're talking about here in the medium term is what's right in front of us, and we have good visibility to it. But we also are integrating a lot of products building for the future, being very offensive towards how we're going to build. And so when you think about our spending, it's really not against this year's revenue, it's for future years' revenue. \nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. \nJason Kupferberg: Wanted to see what color you might give us just on Omicron impacts you may have felt in December and January, particularly in Merchant, but maybe a little bit on the issuer processing side, too. And then just how that translates into how we should be thinking about first quarter revenue growth by segment. I know you generally have some pretty easy comps there in Q1. \nFrank Bisignano: I'll start, Bob could fill in. I mean it definitely had an effect. We saw it as we came through December. You definitely felt it, and outside the U.S., more than even inside the U.S., I'd say. But -- and it has spilled into January across basically dividend credit when you think about it and affect the spending in general. But I view that as a short-term issue, nothing systemic there. .\n Bob, anything you want to add? \nRobert Hau: No, Jason, I think January, consistent to how we kind of closed out December, a little bit light. Obviously, the U.S., Europe, the globe is dealing with Omicron. We're starting to see the restrictions in Europe lifted, particularly in U.K., Ireland. Germany has still got a number of restrictions in various regions. It's not a country-wide program, it's region by region, and we're starting to see those lift. And so we expect things to improve as we progress through the quarter. \n I do expect each of the 4 quarters to be within that 7% to 9% range. So I don't think we have any quarter that's well below that and another quarter well above that. But with January being a little bit lighter, there could be some impact to Q1 there. \nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Dave Koning from Baird. \nDavid Koning: Nice year. So I guess a couple of questions. First of all, on payments, 2021, it looked like full year about 5.5% organic, and you're kind of saying 5% to 8% would be 2022. So I'm just kind of thinking through the accelerating and decelerating factors, like I would think debit probably decelerates. But then what should accelerate to kind of propel growth in '22 to offset the debit deceleration? \nFrank Bisignano: Yes. We have seen some of that deceleration in debit. Again, it was part of the December to January dynamic. We certainly see some nice lift from the credit issuer wins that started going live really the second half of 2021. So we've got good lift from those in the full year of 2022. And with Atlanticus and ADS yet to onboard here in early 2021, that will give us some nice lift. So I think our credit issuing business will perform nicely. \n The improvement or the new contract wins that we talked about in bill pay will help stem some of that headwind that we dealt with in 2021. And broadly, the contract wins and the implementations and new services, CardHub is certainly having an impact on both our debit and credit business as we bring a more fulsome solution, very digital, state-of-the-art capability into our clients. And we see some real opportunity there. \nDavid Koning: Got you. And just secondly, the Acceptance segment, I was kind of looking back. It looks like the last few years mostly were down kind of 3% to 5% sequentially in Q1. You also mentioned selling the back book. I don't know how much impact that has. But is -- are we in kind of a pretty normalized like maybe down 3%, 5% sequentially? \nFrank Bisignano: Yes. So first, the sale of the back book will -- we expect to take place this quarter. We're almost halfway through the quarter. It isn't closed yet, but we do expect it soon. So it will be a modest -- it's a modest impact to the year, less than 50 basis points to the adjusted revenue for the company for the year. So a pretty small impact to Q1, particularly given that it's not yet closed. But I think you're largely in line. I don't expect any difference in terms of the seasonality as you go from Q1 -- Q4 to Q1. \nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. \nJames Faucette: I wanted to ask quickly on capital allocation, and you seem to have stepped up the pace of acquisitions recently. And I'm wondering with the slowing in valuations that we've seen at least in public markets, is that creating incremental opportunities for acquisitions, do you think? And how dynamic or flexible can you be on capital allocation, especially between acquisitions, buybacks and debt reduction? Just love to get kind of your sense and color around those topics. \nFrank Bisignano: Yes. I mean we talked about $850 million, and then we have Finxact here. Also, I mean we feel very, very, very confident in our ability to deploy capital where appropriate and all of that is to further accelerate growth rate. And I accentuate further accelerate. \n Two, we think we're darn good at integrating these properties. And the properties that we've acquired, we've also had invested. We invest in properties early, watch them, grow with them, nurture them and integrate them. So I think you should expect that these things are all strategically thought about ahead of time, whether it was a restaurant segment, whether it's our ability to bring a complementary product across our core. Our ability is without scale to be able to acquire some of these founder-led companies and then utilize them across us. I mean you look at an Ondot, and that's already completely deployed, integrated and succeeding in the clients' office. \n So we feel good about our ability to deploy the capital. We feel good about the platform's ability to scale the use. And they're all to us, middle of the fairway of where our business model is. And that's how you should think about us deploying the capital or against acquisitions. Obviously, we added a very strong year in repurchasing also because we thought it was appropriate to return money to shareholders in that fashion, $2.6 billion. So I think it's a very balanced approach. \nRobert Hau: James, just to kind of put an emphasis on that last point from Frank, it isn't an either/or it isn't an M&A or a share repurchase. In 2021, we deployed capital across the board. We spent $850 million on M&A. We repurchased $2.6 billion, so returned $2.6 billion to shareholders. That's the highest we've done as Fiserv, including $1 billion in the fourth quarter.\n We continue to invest organically. And all that done at the same time, we lowered leverage to 3.1x, down half a turn in the year and really, a full turn since our merger. So our ability is about deploying what is significant free cash flow across the portfolio and in a variety of different ways. \nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Timothy Chiodo from Credit Suisse. \nTimothy Chiodo: I want to talk about inflationary impacts to the top line across a few of the segments. Within the Acceptance segment, obviously, there's a little bit of hardware revenue. But with the rest of the revenue, maybe you could just remind us all on the proportion of that, that comes via ad valorem fees or basis points, how much of that is on a cents per transaction or other? And then also within Fintech, maybe you could just touch on the CPI-based pricing escalators worked into the contracts there for core banking. \nRobert Hau: Sure, Tim. So you had a lot of elements to that question, make sure I hit all of them. First and foremost, as you point out, we have a variety of different methods for revenue generation in our Merchant business, certainly a mix of volume driven as well as transaction driven. And of course, the other element of that is a variety of different distribution channels, whether it's a direct channel or through our partners or through a joint venture. So lots of different ways that, that revenue comes to us. \n Ultimately, we feel good about the pricing dynamic of the market. Inflation in 2022 will give us a natural lift on the activity that is volume based as volume goes up on higher volume transactions, which can be higher volume activity, we'll get a lift on that. And roughly, in the Merchant business, about 65% of our revenue is volume-based pricing and about 35% is transaction-based. \n If you turn to the Fintech segment, it's the segment that we probably have the highest level of CPI clauses in our contracts and certainly will be a lift for us in 2022 as those CPI increases go in. I don't have a percentage for you off the top of my head, but it's a good portion of the Fintech or the core account processing portions of Fintech that have a CPI index in it. \nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. \nDarrin Peller: Can we just touch on the investments and the capital intensity you're putting into the business? Obviously, it's -- with the strong growth you have, it probably begs the question of whether or not your free cash conversion should stay in this 95% to 100% range versus the historic median term, which I think we kind of anticipated. But I'd just love to hear a little more color on what your thought process is on that. And then also whether or not we still feel good about the $25 billion of free cash over the next few years, $30 billion of capital deployment capabilities. .\n And then just really one quick follow-up. I thought it was interesting that you guys are hosting this call in the next few weeks on Merchant and Clover. Any kind of preview on what the goal is for that? Is it just to give us more comfort and color on sustainability and the breakdown of the business given how strong growth has been? \nFrank Bisignano: Yes. Why don't we start with that first? The concept on that is to really get you all to better understand the value being created for each client, that when you think about average revenue per merchant, Clover's impact to give you a real good look at the growth rate. And we talked to you about the e-comm business, too. We said [ covered them both ]. So when you look at it, you could see what that long-term ramp we have in here and the power of both of those platforms. So that would be answering the last part first. \n We had talked about $30 billion of capital to deploy. That number hasn't changed for us at all, in our changing in a conversion rate here. And if you want to think about what we're doing, I just -- I think it's about delivering integrated solutions as we acquire products, it's about delivering a changed experience ultimately in the client's office, all designed at long-term accelerated growth. So in many cases, we're also building functionality, which has given us a greater total addressable market as we approach it. \n So it's completely offensive in terms of us leaning into the opportunity. The beauty of this platform is its size and scale and its client base, and that size and scale in that client base avails us more opportunity than we actually imagine when we put the 2 companies together and the complementary nature of the assets and the ability to invest is really about growth. Bob? \nRobert Hau: Yes, Darrin, the 2 pieces I'd add, I guess is, one, that the $95 to $100 that we have for 2022 and the $94 million we did in '21 is in part driven by our increased spending on really 3 things. One is we are moving with a faster speed than we traditionally have around integrating new acquisitions. \n So a classic example is we acquired Ondot in the first part of 2021. And within a few months, we had that integrated in some of our mobile banking capability and started selling it as a truly integrated solution where traditionally, we might have taken a bit longer to actually integrate. We might sell it as a bundle, but really integrate it into the software, into the software offering. We're moving at a much faster speed. \n Secondly, you heard us talk in this -- on the prepared remarks about technology infrastructure spending. It's really associated with the merger of Fiserv First Data and finishing the swing on that. That's capital spending we're doing across our technology infrastructure. \n And then the third piece is building up some real estate. As we bring our organization back into the office after what's been a couple of years of working from home, we're building out what we think are world-class collaboration spaces to respond to what employees want and need now to enhance that collaboration. \n You heard us earlier in the year announce our new technology hub, innovation and technology hub in North Central New Jersey. That will be built out and occupied later this year. So that technology infrastructure associated with the Fiserv First Data merger and some of this real estate spend, you'll see kind of tail off at the end of this year, and then we'll see a shift in free cash flow going forward. \nOperator: And our last question comes from David Togut from Evercore ISI. \nDavid Togut: Just bridging to the earlier question on inflationary impacts on revenue. Could you walk through the impact of inflation on your cost structure and what's built into the adjusted operating margin expansion guidance for 2022? \nFrank Bisignano: Yes. Well, I would say, first of all, there's definitely a war on talent, and there's definitely an inflation. And when you look in our model, we've accounted for the world we live in within that guide. We are very maniacally focused on how to create these work environments that attract the best talent, retain the best talent and continue driving innovation in a manner that gives us the outcomes that we've been getting and continue to drive forward. You know, Bob, maybe... \nRobert Hau: Yes. I would punctuate saying, number one, with 7% to 9% top line growth on our scale business that provides some nice operating leverage, that will improve operating margin but also allows us to continue to invest in the company. We also have a long track record of good, strong productivity. \n The last couple of years that's been called integration savings or synergy. But we continue to have real opportunities for productivity. As such, we feel comfortable that we'll have at least that 150 basis points of margin improvement in 2022. \nDavid Togut: Understood. And then is the 95% to 100% free cash flow conversion target for 2022 the new normal going forward as opposed to the 105% plus, which we saw historically? \nRobert Hau: No, I would not say that. Obviously, at this point, we're not ready to update 2023. But given some of that technology infrastructure spend and the real estate spend that I talk about -- that I talked about earlier, I expect that to drift down as we exit 2022 and beyond. \nFrank Bisignano: I'd like to thank everyone for their attention today. Please feel free to reach out to our IR team with any questions, and have a great day. Thanks for your time today. \nRobert Hau: Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you all for participating in the Fiserv 2021 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. That concludes today's conference. Please disconnect at this time, and have a great rest of your day.",

            "name": "Frank Bisignano",
            "content": "Thank you, Shub, and thank you all for joining us this morning. As you know, we serve as the operating system for commerce and money movement across our client base of banks, credit unions, fintechs, and businesses ranging from SMBs to mid-market or large enterprises. We help our clients grow by extending our platform to capture new services and new money flows. \n As we exit the second year of pandemic, we had another successful year of delivering on our growth agenda. We delivered 11% organic revenue growth for both the fourth quarter and full year at the high end of our 7% to 12% outlook that we originally provided at our December 2020 Investor Day. \n We expanded full year adjusted operating margins by 250 basis points. We also achieved 26% growth year-over-year in adjusted earnings per share to $5.58, well above our original outlook of $5.25 to $5.45. Our merchant platforms, Clover and Clover Connect for small- and medium-sized businesses and Carat for enterprises are showing very strong growth. \n We are winning in omnichannel and seeing strong growth in value-added services such as Clover software, fraud, risk, lending and payment flows, including disbursements and cross-border. Our acquisitions of BentoBox and NetPay give us the assets to enhance self-service offerings in verticals like restaurants and allow us to power new flows via paybacks. \n We are successfully meeting our FI clients' goal of driving digital engagement through our best-in-class online and mobile banking platform ability as well as integrated mobile-first surround solutions such as CardHub, featuring Ondot for retail customers and SpendLabs for small business customers. Recall that we bought Ondot and SpendLabs in 2021 and are already seeing great traction with them. We expect these solutions will have a positive effect, strengthening our client value proposition across core banking, payment processing and the network business. \n We made outstanding progress on the integration of Fiserv and First Data. The fourth quarter marks the completion of our cost synergy program. We achieved our target of $1.2 billion, $300 million above our original commitment and 2 years ahead of schedule. We actioned $480 million of revenue synergies and are now at 80% of the increased commitment of $600 million. \n We anticipate obtaining the full $600 million of revenue synergies by the end of this year, 18 months ahead of schedule. Strengthening our leadership as our clients' partner of choice yesterday, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire the remaining ownership interest in Finxact. We were an initial investor in Finxact, a leading developer of cloud-native banking solutions that is powering digital transformation across financial services. This is an investment in the next-generation financial technology that supports our strategy to continuously innovate for our clients and broaden our total addressable market. \n Finxact will not only augment our ability to enrich and accelerate the delivery of digital solutions we offer to our existing clients, but also broaden our solutions to include large financial institutions, fintechs, banking as a service and embedded finance opportunities. We've worked closely with the Finxact team and look forward to welcoming Frank Sanchez, his leadership team and the entire Finxact organization to Fiserv when the deal closes later this year. \n Our business momentum and investments thus far position us very well for the future. Accordingly, we have good visibility into accelerating our organic growth to a rate of 7% to 9%, above our average for the last 3 years and in line with our medium-term outlook. We expect 2022 adjusted EPS to be $6.40 to $6.55, which is a growth of 15% to 17%. This, when combined with the 26% growth we delivered in 2021 will generate a 2-year compounded annual growth of 21%, above the high end of our medium-term outlook range of 15% to 20%. \n Turning to the business segments. Let me start with merchant acceptance. We continue to focus on investing in our leading merchant operating systems, Clover and Carat, to provide products and services that expand our addressable market and to drive growth for our clients in the SMB and enterprise space. These operating systems continue to perform well and were key drivers of merchant acceptance organic revenue growth of 19% and 20% for the quarter and year, respectively.\n Clover continues to be the commerce and business management platform of choice for SMBs in the U.S. and around the world. In 2021, as small business recovery took hold, merchants turned to Clover for leading in-store payment solutions, online commerce capabilities and new vertical services to grow their business. We completed our acquisition of BentoBox, a leading digital ordering and delivering management platform to help out close to 200,000 restaurant owners on our platform reach more customers. \n In addition to BentoBox, we signed a variety of strategic partnerships to enhance the tools restaurants need to be successful. One such example is our new partnership with Google to enable customers to more easily find and order from Clover restaurant locations. \n As we roll out these holistic SaaS-based solutions, we see notable increases in the average revenue per merchant. We are very excited about continuing this success and replicating it across other verticals. Closing out 2021, Clover is better positioned than ever as the leading operating system for SMBs. \n Carat, our omnichannel ecosystem serving enterprise clients continues to grow across the board. We saw particular strength in omnichannel transactions, which were up 51% in 2021. As the demand for omnichannel solutions persisted through 2021, demand for our integrated solutions such as disbursements, payback enablement, EBT and other digital capabilities rose to an all-time high. \n Disbursements have become an important part of the consumer experience in many verticals through the pandemic. Consumers and businesses want simple, fast access to their money digitally. Carat is well positioned to drive growth in disbursements as evidenced in its expanded relationships with a number of companies within the insurance and ride-sharing sectors as well as digital wallet companies, including marquee brands such as Coinbase.\n Turning to our cross-border capabilities, we continue to see strength from the recovery with double-digit cross-border transaction growth in 2021. Looking forward into 2022, we will continue to push deeper into key priority areas, including omnichannel disbursements and cross-border to expand the breadth and depth of services for our enterprise clients.  \n Moving to the Payments and Network segment. Organic revenue grew 8% in the quarter and 6% for the full year. Within the issuer business, we saw notable strength in general purpose active accounts, now ahead of pre-pandemic levels. Our card business continues to provide growth above the segment average from strength in digital risk solutions, debit network volumes and debit transaction growth. \n Market-leading innovative solutions like CardHub and SpendLabs are both enhancing revenue and reducing churn. In fact, SpendLabs' product market fit is stronger than we had originally anticipated and this offering, along with CardHub, are notably contributing to our expanded presence with mid-market FIs for card processing solutions. \n These surrounds not only greatly enhance the competitiveness of our credit and debit card processing offerings, but also serve to drive more cards into our debit network and more opportunities for Fiserv to offer risk and fraud, digital banking and account processing solutions, yet again, demonstrating our ability to harness the power of our unmatched distribution platform. Looking to 2022, we expect to see continued momentum from the ramp of our large credit issuer wins in 2020 and 2021, including Alliance Data, Atlanticus and Genesis, 3 top 25 issuers, strengthen our digital offerings with CardHub and SpendLabs and strengthen Zelle. \n Moving to the Financial Technology segment. The fourth quarter was in line with our expectations, posting organic revenue growth of 4%, closing out the year up 4%. We finished 2021 strong on sales with 48 new core wins, including competitive takeaways with marquee names such as Valley Bank and Dollar Bank. Not only are we winning in core account processing, but also seeing success in cross-selling pan-Fiserv capabilities to clients. This is demonstrated in our competitive takeaway of Great Southern Bank, an institution with more than $5 billion in assets. With this agreement, Great Southern Bank will be moving to a complete suite of Fiserv offerings across core account processing, digital banking surrounds, card processing and output solutions. \n We are continuing to win in the higher-growth $1 billion to $50 billion asset segment. Clients continue to choose Fiserv as their strategic technology partner to power combined entities into the future. Key wins in 2021 include NYCB's merger with Flagstar and First Interstate Bank's merger with Great Western. Sales of digital surround solutions grew strong double digits in 2021, driven by the increased digital focus of our financial institution clients and the success of Abiliti, our modern online mobile banking platform. \n We finished the year with 434 sales to existing and new logos. Sales to existing clients helped deepen the penetration of our fully integrated digital surrounds such as CardHub, Zelle and SpendLabs. It is clear that our solutions are already winning in the market. We will accelerate this momentum through our announced agreement to acquire Finxact, which will enable clients to quickly deploy modular banking services, including deposits, loans, cards as well as launch new banking solutions, including a digital bank, bank-as-a-service and embedded finance. \n We have already made strides in the category of API development, and the market is recognizing our leadership. In 2021, we are proud to accept an award for the Best in Finance APIs for our Communicator Advantage API platform at the API World Awards and for AllData Connect, our data aggregation portal at the Business Intelligent Group's 2022 BIG Innovation Awards. \n Looking into 2022 and beyond, the powerful combination of our market-leading banking cores, along with Finxact, which enables clients to launch modern, flexible and highly personalized digital banking experience and ability, our industry-leading online and mobile banking platform will position us to better serve our existing clients and a broader array of customers. \n Now let me pass the discussion to Bob for more detail on our financial results. Thanks, Bob. I'm very proud of the goals we've accomplished with another quarter of double-digit adjusted revenue growth and double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Given the breadth and depth of our portfolio, as well as our history of strong operational performance, we believe we will deliver 7% to 9% organic revenue growth and 15% to 17% adjusted earnings per share growth to a range of $6.40 to $6.55. We expect each of our business segments to deliver organic revenue growth within the range of our medium-term outlook. \n Finally, I invite you to participate in an investor call we will be hosting in the next several weeks focused on our merchant acceptance business with a particular emphasis on Clover as a key driver of growth for the segment and the company. \n In addition to delivering on our financial results, we continue to focus on our associates and our communities. Our approach to corporate social responsibility is designed to incorporate a philanthropic, associate and community engagement to deliver thoughtful, strategic decisions where we invest our time and talent. \n Diversity and inclusion remains on the top of our ESG agenda and the results of our efforts speak for themselves. In January of the current year, Fiserv was named to the 2022 Bloomberg Gender Equality Index, marking our sixth consecutive year for this recognition. For the second consecutive year, Fiserv has been designated a best place to work for LGBTQ+ equality in the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's 2022 Corporate Equality Index. Now in its 20th year, the CEI is the national benchmarking tool on corporate policies, practices and benefits pertinent to LGBTQ+ employees. \n Since 2020, we have allocated $35 million of the $50 million commitment designed to help small minority-owned businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and associated initiatives. In Q4, Fiserv was ranked #4 on Military Times Best for Vets Employers list, the fifth year in a row in the top 5 and #1 ranked in our category. \n Continuing our initiatives to support better and affiliated businesses, this quarter, we announced an extension of our partnership with the Institute for Veterans and Military Families at Syracuse University. And during our fourth quarter season of giving campaign, associate donations along with corporate matching donations from Fiserv contributed to over 1,200 community groups globally. I am proud of the positive impact of philanthropic and community programs have had in 2021, and I look forward to us doing more in 2022 to help businesses and communities thrive. \n I will close by thanking all 40,000-plus hard-working Fiserv associates around the world for working relentlessly to serve our clients and you, our shareholders. \n With that, operator, please open the line for questions. So first of all, yes, 9% to 12%. And yes, we're driving business to double digit. I think there's a multipronged effort here. And obviously, we have a lot of assets in the portfolio that are performing very, very well, whether it be our ISV business, whether it be in Carat. \n But specifically, the growth in Clover, we believe, will happen both in the U.S. and then in our global expansion on it also. And we continue to see that have very, very strong visibility and how deployment will happen outside the U.S. during the course of this year. And then you layer on top of that the Caixa partnership, the [ Deutsche ] partnership, and you can see us extending out in all regions, really. \n So you should expect to see Clover growth. You should expect to see geographic expansion. But you should also expect to see strong e-comm trajectory along with ISV trajectory as we continue to invest in Clover and Carat and the ISV business and continue to fuel our international growth. Maybe I'd say 1 or 2 other things. We have tremendous visibility due to the amount of wins you've heard us talk about. You could see that we have had very, very good momentum in the sales cycle, and that's all about future growth. \n I also think the investments we are making are for future growth. So the 7% to 9% we're talking about here in the medium term is what's right in front of us, and we have good visibility to it. But we also are integrating a lot of products building for the future, being very offensive towards how we're going to build. And so when you think about our spending, it's really not against this year's revenue, it's for future years' revenue. I'll start, Bob could fill in. I mean it definitely had an effect. We saw it as we came through December. You definitely felt it, and outside the U.S., more than even inside the U.S., I'd say. But -- and it has spilled into January across basically dividend credit when you think about it and affect the spending in general. But I view that as a short-term issue, nothing systemic there. .\n Bob, anything you want to add? Yes. We have seen some of that deceleration in debit. Again, it was part of the December to January dynamic. We certainly see some nice lift from the credit issuer wins that started going live really the second half of 2021. So we've got good lift from those in the full year of 2022. And with Atlanticus and ADS yet to onboard here in early 2021, that will give us some nice lift. So I think our credit issuing business will perform nicely. \n The improvement or the new contract wins that we talked about in bill pay will help stem some of that headwind that we dealt with in 2021. And broadly, the contract wins and the implementations and new services, CardHub is certainly having an impact on both our debit and credit business as we bring a more fulsome solution, very digital, state-of-the-art capability into our clients. And we see some real opportunity there. Yes. So first, the sale of the back book will -- we expect to take place this quarter. We're almost halfway through the quarter. It isn't closed yet, but we do expect it soon. So it will be a modest -- it's a modest impact to the year, less than 50 basis points to the adjusted revenue for the company for the year. So a pretty small impact to Q1, particularly given that it's not yet closed. But I think you're largely in line. I don't expect any difference in terms of the seasonality as you go from Q1 -- Q4 to Q1. Yes. I mean we talked about $850 million, and then we have Finxact here. Also, I mean we feel very, very, very confident in our ability to deploy capital where appropriate and all of that is to further accelerate growth rate. And I accentuate further accelerate. \n Two, we think we're darn good at integrating these properties. And the properties that we've acquired, we've also had invested. We invest in properties early, watch them, grow with them, nurture them and integrate them. So I think you should expect that these things are all strategically thought about ahead of time, whether it was a restaurant segment, whether it's our ability to bring a complementary product across our core. Our ability is without scale to be able to acquire some of these founder-led companies and then utilize them across us. I mean you look at an Ondot, and that's already completely deployed, integrated and succeeding in the clients' office. \n So we feel good about our ability to deploy the capital. We feel good about the platform's ability to scale the use. And they're all to us, middle of the fairway of where our business model is. And that's how you should think about us deploying the capital or against acquisitions. Obviously, we added a very strong year in repurchasing also because we thought it was appropriate to return money to shareholders in that fashion, $2.6 billion. So I think it's a very balanced approach. Yes. Why don't we start with that first? The concept on that is to really get you all to better understand the value being created for each client, that when you think about average revenue per merchant, Clover's impact to give you a real good look at the growth rate. And we talked to you about the e-comm business, too. We said [ covered them both ]. So when you look at it, you could see what that long-term ramp we have in here and the power of both of those platforms. So that would be answering the last part first. \n We had talked about $30 billion of capital to deploy. That number hasn't changed for us at all, in our changing in a conversion rate here. And if you want to think about what we're doing, I just -- I think it's about delivering integrated solutions as we acquire products, it's about delivering a changed experience ultimately in the client's office, all designed at long-term accelerated growth. So in many cases, we're also building functionality, which has given us a greater total addressable market as we approach it. \n So it's completely offensive in terms of us leaning into the opportunity. The beauty of this platform is its size and scale and its client base, and that size and scale in that client base avails us more opportunity than we actually imagine when we put the 2 companies together and the complementary nature of the assets and the ability to invest is really about growth. Bob? Yes. Well, I would say, first of all, there's definitely a war on talent, and there's definitely an inflation. And when you look in our model, we've accounted for the world we live in within that guide. We are very maniacally focused on how to create these work environments that attract the best talent, retain the best talent and continue driving innovation in a manner that gives us the outcomes that we've been getting and continue to drive forward. You know, Bob, maybe... I'd like to thank everyone for their attention today. Please feel free to reach out to our IR team with any questions, and have a great day. Thanks for your time today."

            "name": "Robert Hau",
            "content": "Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. I'll cover some detail on each of our segments. If you're following along on our slides, I'm starting with Slide 5. \n We feel great about our performance for both the quarter and the full year, and we are well positioned to achieve a strong 2022 and beyond with sustained value for our clients and our shareholders. As Frank said, we are projecting 7% to 9% revenue growth for 2022, which is 150 to 350 basis points above our average growth over the last 3 years. Total company organic revenue was up 11% in the quarter with growth across all segments, led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 19%. \n For the full year, total company organic revenue grew 11%, also led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 20%. Total company adjusted revenue also grew 11% to over $4 billion in the quarter. And for the full year, adjusted revenue grew 11% to $15.4 billion. \n Fourth quarter adjusted operating income was up 11% to $1.4 billion, and adjusted operating margin was in line with the prior year at a very strong 35.6%. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 19% to $5.2 billion, and adjusted operating margin expanded 250 basis points to 33.9%. \n We expect 2022 margin to expand an incremental 150 basis points or more above last year. This is driven by strong organic revenue growth of 7% to 9% on a scaled business and a continued focus on productivity, all while we continue to make meaningful investments for organic growth. \n In addition, as you heard earlier from Frank, we are proud to announce that we reached our $1.2 billion action cost synergy goal in the quarter, which is a result of our disciplined execution to drive value. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 21% to $1.57. And through December 31, adjusted earnings per share grew 26% to $5.58. \n Free cash flow was $1.2 billion for the quarter, up 18% from fourth quarter last year, resulting in a conversion of 119%. For the full year, free cash flow was $3.5 billion with a conversion to net income of 94%, driven by strong revenue growth and increases in working capital as well as capital investment and organic innovation for our clients, integration of our acquisitions and investment in technology infrastructure and real estate to create world-class collaboration space for our associates as we return to offices. \n For 2022, we expect free cash flow conversion to be between 95% and 100% of net income, investments in products and services to accelerate growth and the tail end of technology infrastructure and real estate investments, particularly our new technology and innovation hub in North Central New Jersey, which we will occupy later this year. \n Now looking to our segment results starting on Slide 7. Organic revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was a very strong 19% in the quarter and 20% for 2021. Global transactions and volume grew 13% and 16% in the quarter and 13% and 19% for the year, respectively. Excluding the impact of the exit of a processing client we discussed last quarter, Global Transactions volume grew 18% and 22% in the quarter and 17% and 24% in the year, respectively. Building off one of the best years for merchant location growth, we ended the fourth quarter with 10% higher global merchant locations versus the comparable quarter a year ago. \n Clover continues to build upon the momentum and strength of our product offering as opposed to a very strong 50% GPV growth year-over-year or $201 billion on an annualized basis. We've seen exciting opportunities for Clover this quarter, including our partnership with the University of Notre Dame and the UBS Arena in New York. These wins further strengthen our positioning with sports arenas globally and highlight our success in integrating the Money Pass mobile business we acquired in 2020. \n Carat, our platform for enterprise clients, saw omnichannel transaction growth of 26% in the quarter, driven by 59 client wins, including notable wins such as Papaya gaming and expanded relationships with Wegmans, a regional supermarket chain with 106 stores and with a leading home improvement client to serve their clients end to end. Our ISV volume this quarter through Clover Connect grew 64% year-over-year and 53% on a 2-year CAGR. We signed 45 ISVs this quarter, bringing our total signs to 187 for the year, and we are winning both ISVs that are new to payments as well as competitive takeaways. \n We had several notable international wins in the quarter, including an expanded partnership with UnionPay International, one of the world's largest payment networks to broaden the acceptance of UnionPay cards across Fiserv's global footprint, and with FirstCaribbean International Bank for merchant processing across its banking footprint in the Caribbean region. \n Additionally, we executed on an agreement with National Australia Bank for merchant processing in Australia. Adjusted operating income in the Acceptance segment increased 20% to $533 million in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was up 60 basis points to 31.3%, driven by continued top line strength. Through December 31, adjusted operating income improved 45% to $2 billion and adjusted operating margin grew 540 basis points to 30.8%. \n Before I leave the Merchant segment, as you may have noticed in our third quarter 10-Q filing, we anticipate the sale of a portion of our back book to a merchant alliance partner. This is fully contemplated in our outlook, and will have less than a 50 basis point impact on adjusted revenue for the company in 2022. We expect the transaction to close in the current quarter. \n Turning to Slide 8. The Payments and Network segment posted organic revenue growth of 8% in the quarter, resulting in a full year growth of 6%. For the quarter, card services and digital payments outperformed the segment organic revenue growth rate. Credit came in slightly under the segment average and bill pay continued as a headwind. \n Within card services, debit transactions grew 14% in the quarter. The strength of our credit offering for financial institutions was manifested in a notable win in the fourth quarter, an agreement with Randolph-Brooks Federal Credit Union, an institution with over $14 billion in assets and over 1 million members to provide our credit processing capabilities. \n Within issuer solutions, we are well underway with our onboarding the $120 million of new business we announced at our December 2020 Investor Day as well as other mandates awarded since. We have completed the onboarding of Atlanticus, a competitive takeaway; and BBVA, an M&A consolidation win. Onboarding is well underway for Genesis, another competitive takeaway, and for Alliance Data. This momentum continues. \n In addition to the merchant processing wins I mentioned earlier, we also signed long-term card issuing agreements with both National Australia Bank and UnionPay International. These wins demonstrate our ability to serve our clients on multiple fronts. Consumer demand for content count and P2P offerings continued with Zelle transactions up 71% and the number of clients live on Zelle was up 57% in the quarter. \n Finally, within bill pay, we have 2 notable fourth quarter wins in the health care vertical, demonstrating our strength in this high-growth segment of the market and broadening our client base from what has traditionally been the utilities and telecom focused offering. Blue Shield of California, a leading health plan in California, has chosen to extend the relationship with Fiserv as part of their enterprise-wide process of digital transformation. Additionally, CareSource, a nationally recognized nonprofit health care plan competitively selected Fiserv to improve their member experience through our robust technology platform. \n Adjusted operating income for the segment was up 8% to $713 million, and adjusted operating margin was down 20 basis points to 46.2% in the quarter, given tough comps. Q4 operating margin was the second highest margin recorded for the segment, second only to Q4 of last year. For the full year, adjusted operating income was up 8% to $2.6 billion and adjusted operating margin was up 80 basis points to 44.1%. \n Turning to Slide 9. The Financial Technology segment organic revenue grew at 4% in the fourth quarter and for the full year within our medium-term outlook for this segment. Our digital banking capabilities and digital solution offerings continue to win in the marketplace. In the fourth quarter, we added 14 new core account processing clients, bringing us to 48 core wins in the year, more than half of which were takeaways. Mobile deposits in Q4 grew 9% over the prior year, while self-service ATM deposits grew 52% over last year. \n Adjusted operating income was up 6% in the quarter to $287 million and up 9% year-to-date to $1.1 billion. Adjusted operating margin in the segment increased 80 basis points in the quarter to 37.3%. For the full year, adjusted operating margin expanded 160 basis points to 35.8%. The adjusted corporate operating loss was $102 million in the quarter, in line with our expectations. \n The adjusted effective tax rate for both the quarter and full year was 20% and in line with our expectations. We expect 2022's effective tax rate to be approximately 21%, up slightly as 2021 benefited from a few discrete tax planning items. 2021 was another demonstration of our disciplined capital allocation strategy, which includes fortifying our strong balance sheet, returning value to shareholders through share repurchases, driving organic growth through investment and pursuing high-value acquisitions. \n We invested approximately $850 million in M&A to acquire capabilities that we are best positioned to deploy across our scaled platform. We completed our acquisitions of BentoBox, NetPay and Integrity Payments, bringing our total transactions to 7 in 2021. And as Frank mentioned, we further strengthened our portfolio through the announced acquisition of Finxact, a developer of cloud-native banking solutions. \n Additionally, we returned $2.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchase this year, including $1 billion in the fourth quarter for 9.9 million shares. We have more than 42 million shares of repurchase authorization remaining. And finally, total debt outstanding was $21 billion on December 31. The debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio decreased to 3.1x, down nearly a full turn since we merged. \n With that, let me turn the call back to Frank. Yes, Tien-Tsin, I'll start and Frank can jump in. I think you'll see continued investments in all 3 of our segments. Obviously, each one of them have a slightly different growth trajectory. As Frank just talked in answering Lisa's comment about the 9% to 12% merchant growth, we expect all 3 of our segments to perform in the medium-term outlook range, 4% to 6% for the Fintech segment and 5% to 8% for payments.\n And you're seeing us focus on bringing new solutions to our clients on where they want us to meet, obviously, really across the board, the continued drive for digital, for mobile expanding out our capabilities to integrate all of our solutions. You heard me in my prepared remarks talk about the new wins with UnionPay and with National Australia Bank, 2 individual contracts that both had merchant and payments incorporated in them. \n And so we'll continue to invest in building out those capabilities. We continue to invest in our digital capability around our CardHub acquisition with Ondot, with SpendLabs. Our Abiliti solution, our bank -- digital banking solution that we launched earlier this year, a cloud-native online banking solution will continue to expand in the marketplace. And obviously, once we close with Finxact, it will be a focus of ours as we build out that capability. No, Jason, I think January, consistent to how we kind of closed out December, a little bit light. Obviously, the U.S., Europe, the globe is dealing with Omicron. We're starting to see the restrictions in Europe lifted, particularly in U.K., Ireland. Germany has still got a number of restrictions in various regions. It's not a country-wide program, it's region by region, and we're starting to see those lift. And so we expect things to improve as we progress through the quarter. \n I do expect each of the 4 quarters to be within that 7% to 9% range. So I don't think we have any quarter that's well below that and another quarter well above that. But with January being a little bit lighter, there could be some impact to Q1 there. James, just to kind of put an emphasis on that last point from Frank, it isn't an either/or it isn't an M&A or a share repurchase. In 2021, we deployed capital across the board. We spent $850 million on M&A. We repurchased $2.6 billion, so returned $2.6 billion to shareholders. That's the highest we've done as Fiserv, including $1 billion in the fourth quarter.\n We continue to invest organically. And all that done at the same time, we lowered leverage to 3.1x, down half a turn in the year and really, a full turn since our merger. So our ability is about deploying what is significant free cash flow across the portfolio and in a variety of different ways. Sure, Tim. So you had a lot of elements to that question, make sure I hit all of them. First and foremost, as you point out, we have a variety of different methods for revenue generation in our Merchant business, certainly a mix of volume driven as well as transaction driven. And of course, the other element of that is a variety of different distribution channels, whether it's a direct channel or through our partners or through a joint venture. So lots of different ways that, that revenue comes to us. \n Ultimately, we feel good about the pricing dynamic of the market. Inflation in 2022 will give us a natural lift on the activity that is volume based as volume goes up on higher volume transactions, which can be higher volume activity, we'll get a lift on that. And roughly, in the Merchant business, about 65% of our revenue is volume-based pricing and about 35% is transaction-based. \n If you turn to the Fintech segment, it's the segment that we probably have the highest level of CPI clauses in our contracts and certainly will be a lift for us in 2022 as those CPI increases go in. I don't have a percentage for you off the top of my head, but it's a good portion of the Fintech or the core account processing portions of Fintech that have a CPI index in it. Yes, Darrin, the 2 pieces I'd add, I guess is, one, that the $95 to $100 that we have for 2022 and the $94 million we did in '21 is in part driven by our increased spending on really 3 things. One is we are moving with a faster speed than we traditionally have around integrating new acquisitions. \n So a classic example is we acquired Ondot in the first part of 2021. And within a few months, we had that integrated in some of our mobile banking capability and started selling it as a truly integrated solution where traditionally, we might have taken a bit longer to actually integrate. We might sell it as a bundle, but really integrate it into the software, into the software offering. We're moving at a much faster speed. \n Secondly, you heard us talk in this -- on the prepared remarks about technology infrastructure spending. It's really associated with the merger of Fiserv First Data and finishing the swing on that. That's capital spending we're doing across our technology infrastructure. \n And then the third piece is building up some real estate. As we bring our organization back into the office after what's been a couple of years of working from home, we're building out what we think are world-class collaboration spaces to respond to what employees want and need now to enhance that collaboration. \n You heard us earlier in the year announce our new technology hub, innovation and technology hub in North Central New Jersey. That will be built out and occupied later this year. So that technology infrastructure associated with the Fiserv First Data merger and some of this real estate spend, you'll see kind of tail off at the end of this year, and then we'll see a shift in free cash flow going forward. Yes. I would punctuate saying, number one, with 7% to 9% top line growth on our scale business that provides some nice operating leverage, that will improve operating margin but also allows us to continue to invest in the company. We also have a long track record of good, strong productivity. \n The last couple of years that's been called integration savings or synergy. But we continue to have real opportunities for productivity. As such, we feel comfortable that we'll have at least that 150 basis points of margin improvement in 2022. No, I would not say that. Obviously, at this point, we're not ready to update 2023. But given some of that technology infrastructure spend and the real estate spend that I talk about -- that I talked about earlier, I expect that to drift down as we exit 2022 and beyond. Thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Welcome to the Fiserv 2021 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. \n At this time, I will turn the call over to Shub Mukherjee, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. \nShub Mukherjee: Thank you, and good morning. With me on the call today are Frank Bisignano, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. \n Our earnings release and supplemental materials for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Please refer to these materials for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this call, along with the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. Unless otherwise stated, performance references are year-over-year comparisons.\n Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results and strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. You should refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. \n Before I turn the call over to Frank, please note that going forward, we will be using the term organic constant currency revenue to replace internal revenue. There is no change in how we calculate this measure, just a change in terminology.\n And now over to Frank. \nFrank Bisignano: Thank you, Shub. And thank you all for listening in as we share our results for the quarter and highlight the progress against our growth agenda.\n As you know, we serve as the operating system for commerce and money movement across our client base of banks, fintechs and businesses, ranging from SMBs, to mid market, to large enterprises. We help our clients grow by extending our platform to capture new services and new money flows. We are also seeing real benefits from the ongoing economic recovery, especially here in the U.S. We remain optimistic and continue to invest in growth.\n Turning to our performance. We had a strong third quarter, with total company adjusted revenue up 10%. Adjusted operating margin expanded 130 basis points to 34.2%. Adjusted EPS grew 23% to $1.47. We attained our highest quarter of actioned revenue synergies of $95 million. To date, we have achieved $420 million of actioned revenue synergies, 70% of the increased commitment of $600 million for the 5-year period following the merger.\n As we invested to accelerate growth, free cash flow came in at $572 million for the quarter and $2.3 billion year-to-date. Free cash flow was driven by a combination of the following: first, increased capital expenditure in the areas of technology, innovation hubs and the integration of newly acquired capabilities; second, the working capital increase driven by revenue growth; and finally, reduced benefit of unmet operating loss carryforwards.\n On the back of our results and the strength of our investments, we are tightening our outlook for organic revenue growth and raising the lower end of our outlook for adjusted EPS. We now expect organic constant currency growth of 11% for the full year and adjusted earnings per share between $5.55 and $5.60. This raises the lower end of our prior adjusted earnings per share outlook by $0.05, a growth of 26% to 27% over last year.\n Turning to the business segments, let me start with Merchant Acceptance. We continue to grow beyond the buy button by investing in world-class, omnichannel capabilities, solutioning around vertical and horizontal business needs and capturing new flows. We achieved all of this throughout 3 growth platforms: Clover for small business, Clover Connect for ISV and Carat for enterprises.\n Driving into our performance, Merchant Acceptance led the quarter, posting organic revenue growth of 18% year-over-year, with North America and international largely in line with the segment average for the quarter. Our global merchant locations have been growing at a healthy clip, up 10% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis, driven by positive net new merchants across all regions. The quarter was driven by growth in global volume and transactions of 15% and 12%, respectively. North America volume and transactions grew 14% and 9%, respectively, led by strength in travel, restaurants and petro. Excluding the impact of the loss of a large processing client through one of our JVs, North America volume and transaction growth in the quarter would have been 19% and 14%, respectively.\n Next, let's go deeper by platform, starting with Clover. GPV grew 47% year-over-year or a 39% CAGR since 2019 to $196 billion on an annualized basis. In the SMB space, we remain focused in building vertical-specific solutions, offering an integrated suite of products that help merchants generate revenue and run their business. \n As part of our vertical strategy, we entered into an agreement to acquire BentoBox, a digital marketing and commerce platform focused on driving growth and engagement for restaurants. This transaction will expand our Clover dining solutions and industry-leading commerce and business management capabilities, which already enable nearly 200,000 restaurants of all sizes to deliver unique and differentiating dining experience, from quick and casual to fine dining. We expect the acquisition to close in the fourth quarter subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions.\n Additionally, we continue to focus on building value-added services for the Clover platform, including Clover Capital, Clover Dining, Clover Order Ahead and Clover inventory as well as our unique Clover app marketplace.\n On the enterprise side, Carat, our enterprise omnichannel platform, continued its strong momentum in the third quarter, with new wins, product innovation and a gradual recovery in cross-border commerce. Global e-commerce volume grew unabated in the quarter, driven by cross-border and international growth of 25% on a year-over-year basis as volumes recovered from the pandemic lows, with secular tailwinds expected to sustain future momentum. Omnichannel transactions, such as order ahead and buy online, pickup in store, grew 35% in the quarter. \n We had notable e-commerce wins in the quarter, including Johnson & Johnson and Caesars Entertainment. We also expanded our existing global acquiring relationship with Microsoft to be their provider for network tokens. In the quarter, we added PayPal and Venmo as digital wallet payout options to our global service platform, submitting Carat as a leader in digital payouts with over $10 billion processed year-to-date, an increase of 230% on a year-over-year basis.\n Additionally, we are building a new partnership with Bakkt, a leading crypto and consumer wallet solution provider Bakkt will utilize Fiserv's industry-leading funds-in, funds-out solution. And together, Fiserv and Bakkt will develop new crypto use cases for both merchant and FI clients.\n Moving to Clover Connect. The strength of our ISV focused offering showed through the third quarter with ISV volume up 71% year-over-year. Clover Connect allows us to bring together 2 strong Fiserv assets: the world-class hardware and software platform on Clover, along with the best-in-class partner management and operational tool of CoPilot, which gives ISVs a unique view into all of the merchants' activities, ranging from merchant application processing to support. \n Our commitment to being the best partner for ISVs is resonating. We signed 47 new ISVs in the third quarter, bringing our total wins to 142 year-to-date. We continue signing up ISVs that are new to payments and winning against the competition. This quarter, more than half of our wins were competitive takeaways.\n Before I address our international progress, I'd like to highlight another focus area in our merchant business, point-of-sale lending. We are leveraging our position as the operating platform for businesses small, medium and large to offer a range of buy now, pay later options. We are expanding our referral relationships while simplifying the merchant experience through integrations with our platforms like Clover. We currently have referral agreements with Zip, Citizens Pay and Bread. \n We're also working with our FI clients to bring payer BNPL offerings to market. For example, we are partnering with Synchrony to offer buy now, pay later solutions on our card processing platform, Optus. Synchrony also recently announced acceptance of private label cards through Clover. \n On our Investor Day, we talked to you about our Merchant Acceptance growth strategy for international. We remain focused on growing our global market presence with world-class bank partners and through our direct channels, all while leveraging the strength of common platforms and connections.\n The global expansion of Clover platform into APAC, Latin America and EMEA are all currently in flight. We're on track to roll out Clover in India by the third quarter of 2022, a tremendous opportunity given the size and growth potential of the market. Clover is already in market in Argentina and is expected to launch in Brazil next year, thereby covering the 2 largest markets in Latin America. \n In EMEA, Clover is in market across the U.K., Germany, the Netherlands and Ireland, with a further boost expected with the rollout of the Deutsche Bank JV that we announced last quarter. Among the key APAC deals completed in the quarter is an omnichannel merchant acquirer processing mandate from Bank of China for their fast-growing Macau market.\n Moving to EMEA, Fiserv partnered with PostFinance, one of the largest financial institutions in Switzerland, to provide credit card acquiring services to their Swiss merchant clients. We're starting with an initial 4,000 merchants that accept the PostFinance today, with plans to expand to the entire merchant base of 60,000 over time.\n Fiserv is also supporting Restaurant Brands, owner of iconic brands, including Burger King and Popeyes, as the company expands its footprint across Europe with an omnichannel approach. Fiserv will provide acquiring services for Burger King in the U.K. and the Nordics and Popeyes in the U.K.\n To close on the merchant segment. As you may recall, in April, we won a 20-year deal to become the exclusive provider of merchant acquiring services for Caixa Econ\u00f4mica Federal, one of the largest Brazilian banks. We are pleased to report that the implementation of this mandate started at the beginning of August and is going extremely well, with 65,000 merchants onboarded as of last week.\n Moving to the Payments and Network segment. Organic revenue grew 6% in the quarter, resulting in year-to-date growth of 5%. Our Payments segment consists of 3 businesses: global credit processing and output solutions, which we call issuer solutions, which is 40% of the segment; debit processing and debit networks, which we call -- we refer to as card services, also 1/3 of the segment; and the third business is comprised of digital solutions, bill pay and our prepaid business.\n Our issuer solutions business, which grew just below the overall Payments segment average, is seeing the benefit of a continued credit recovery, with general purpose credit gross active accounts up in the high single digits. Note that our credit issuer solutions revenue is driven by number of accounts, not credit volume. However, as credit volumes recover, the number of accounts will follow. Looking ahead, we expect growth in the business to be driven by the continued ramp of last year's notable wins, including 3 of the top 25 issuer wins, which we announced last year.\n We also recently completed PNC's conversion of BBVA's card portfolios through our platform. Our retail private label portfolio also continues to recover from its COVID lows, although at a slower pace than we anticipated at the beginning of the year.\n Within card services, which grew organic revenue a couple of points faster than the overall Payment segment average, we saw a strong growth in debit transactions driving our issuance and network businesses. Looking ahead, we expect to sustain growth for this business by broadening our total addressable market. \n For instance, in the quarter, our STAR debit network signed an agreement with leading U.S. consumer fintech, Chime, to become its preferred unaffiliated network for debit. We believe that aligning one of the largest fintech issuers is a testimony to the scale and technical capabilities of the STAR network and positions the network well for future growth. This was also one of our notable action synergy revenues in the quarter.\n During our Investor Day, we discussed the opportunity to offer a fully managed by Fiserv credit card issuing option to community FIs and shared that we were actively exploring this market. We are pleased to announce that we are currently piloting our agent credit program offering, branded Credit Choice, and will launch in Q1 2022. \n Credit Choice is a fully managed credit card issuing-as-a-service solution that allows our community FIs to offer their customers an FI-branded credit card experience that is fully integrated into their debit solution, but without the operational burden of running their own credit card portfolio. Credit Choice leverages our scale distribution and world-class card issuing surround solutions, such as OnDot and SpendLabs to expand into a sizable, new, addressable market for Fiserv where the economics per card are considerably richer than in processing. We have already seen strong, early interest from clients, with hundreds of prospects in the pipeline.\n On our Q2 call, we spoke to you about our rich, mobile-first consumer and business offerings powered by recent acquisitions, OnDot and SpendLabs. The early results of the launch have been very encouraging. We completed the integration of the CardHub platform into our credit and debit processing platforms and into our Mobiliti mobile banking platform. We are seeing tremendous demand for this integrated solution from both new prospects as well as existing CardValet clients, whom we expect to fully migrate to the integrated CardHub solution by the end of 2022. In addition, we expect to expand the platform to add loyalty, installment payment and dispute management, thereby establishing CardHub as a key differentiator and to drive new sales and client retention.\n For our financial institution clients, this solution is a game changer. It enhances consumer engagement with their digital banking platform, creates more fee income through greater card usage, and catapults the FI's overall digital experience into the leagues of some of the world's top banks and neobanks.\n In the third business, results are mixed. We had good growth in our digital payments activity, led by Zelle transaction growth of 75% in the quarter and the number of clients live now reaching just under 750. Prepaid growth was driven by new client wins within our Gift Solutions business. We expect growth to continue, driven by new use cases.\n Our bill pay business, which encompasses both the direct biller and bill pay through our financial institutions, continues to grow slower than expected. However, we're extending our bill pay capabilities beyond the financial institution channel, going live later this month as an enabler of PayPal's bill payment functionality within PayPal's new app. Additionally, we expanded our relationship with a large telecom provider to enable commercial card payments with our BillMatrix solution.\n Moving to the Financial Technology segment. The quarter was in line with our expectations, posting organic revenue growth of 4%, resulting in 4% growth year-to-date. We added 14 new core account processing clients in the quarter, including 7 competitive takeaways and 2 de novo wins. Our DNA platform is seeing great success, including with larger financial institutions, as evidenced in the Valley National Bank and Dollar Bank wins, with assets over $40 billion and $10 billion, respectively.\n Abiliti, our modern, cloud-based, API-driven digital banking platform, is seeing great momentum with 150 incremental sales in the quarter. 138 of these sales were to existing clients, which will drive our clients' digital transformation and deepen the penetration of our fully integrated digital surrounds, such as CardHub, sale and SpendLabs. The remaining 12 were new logo sales, with half being core competitive takeaways. \n We also continue to enrich our open banking and fintech ecosystem, again, in line with the goals laid out in last year's investor conference. We launched our new developer portal, which we call the Fiserv developer studio, towards the end of the third quarter. The developer studio provides rich and expansive API integrations to support banks, fintechs, merchants and enterprise clients with developer tools needed to accelerate innovation, integrations across the entire Fiserv ecosystem. Additionally, we also announced partnerships with exciting new fintechs: FutureFuel.io and Streetshares, aimed at creating new white space opportunities in digital for both retail consumer and small business lending, respectively.\n We believe that we're extremely well positioned to continue to drive revenue in the segment higher by delivering new innovation, such as Abiliti; strategically acquiring and integrating attractive surround solutions, like OnDot and SpendLabs; and leveraging the power of the developer community through our developer studio API portal or dedicated go-to-market integrations like FutureFuel.io and StreetShares. \n Now let me pass the discussion to Bob for more detail on our financial results. \nRobert Hau: Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin reviewing the detailed business results, as Shub mentioned, we are aligning with the broader community and simplifying our message by clarifying our internal revenue growth metric as organic constant currency revenue. This does not change how we calculate this measure, just clarifies the terminology. It will be the same definition in calculations we've used in prior quarters. \n On Slide 11, we've included a new schedule to clearly provide an understanding of the walk from GAAP revenue to internal or organic revenue for the third quarter. This summary can be seen in more detail in the appendix of our presentation. Now I will cover some detail on each of our segments. If you're following along on our slides, I'm starting with Slide 4. \n We feel great about our performance for both the quarter and the first 9 months of the year. And we are well positioned to achieve strong full year financial results.\n Total company organic revenue was up 10% in the quarter, with growth across all segments, led by Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 18%. Year-to-date, total company organic revenue grew 11%, also led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 21%. Total company adjusted revenue also grew 10% to nearly $4 billion in the quarter. Year-to-date, total company adjusted revenue has grown 11% to $11.4 billion. \n Third quarter adjusted operating income was up a strong 15% to $1.4 billion and adjusted operating margin increased by 130 basis points to 34.2%. This margin improvement was driven by our strong revenue results and our continued disciplined cost synergy execution, which produced $64 million of incremental cost synergies during the quarter. And we have now actioned $1.16 billion programmed today. Year-to-date, adjusted operating income increased 23% to $3.8 billion. Adjusted operating margin year-to-date expanded 330 basis points to 33.2%. \n Our third quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 23% to $1.47 compared to $1.20 in the prior year. Through September 30, adjusted earnings per share grew 29% to $4.01, putting us on pace to achieve our 36th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth, a testament to the incredible strength and resiliency of this company.\n Free cash flow for the first 9 months of the year was $2.3 billion, resulting in an 85% free cash flow conversion. This result was driven by increased capital investments related to technology, world-class facilities and the integration of newly acquired businesses; a working capital increase driven by revenue growth; and a reduction in the net operating loss carryforward benefit. With these investments and strong revenue growth, we now expect free cash flow conversion to be 95% to 100% for the full year. \n Now looking to our segment results, starting on Slide 6. Organic revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was a very strong 18% in the quarter and 21% year-to-date. Our revenue was driven by a combination of growth in volume and transactions. Our results were once again driven by strong performance across all 3 platforms: Clover for SMBs, Carat for large businesses and Clover Connect for ISVs. \n Clover continues to build upon the momentum and strength of our product offering as it posted a very strong 47% GPV growth year-over-year or $196 billion on an annualized basis, with growth across all of our distribution channels. \n With Carat, we won 45 new global enterprise e-commerce clients on the platform in the quarter. In addition, Carat expanded its mandate with existing high-quality brands, such as Valero. Continuous leading the high-growth, online EBT space, Carat has launched more than 50 clients to online EBT in the past 12 months. \n Our ISV volume in this quarter through Clover Connect grew 71% year-over-year and up almost 150% versus the third quarter of 2019. We are winning both ISVs that are new to payments as well as competitive takeaways. \n Adjusted operating income in the Acceptance segment increased 30% to $552 million in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was up 300 basis points to 32.2%, driven by top line strength. Through September 30, adjusted operating income improved 57% to $1.5 billion and adjusted operating margin grew 710 basis points to 30.6%. \n Turning to Slide 7. The Payments and Network segment posted organic revenue growth of 6% in the quarter, resulting in year-to-date growth of 5%. As Frank outlined in his composition of the segment, our card services, digital payments and prepaid businesses outperformed the segment organic revenue growth rate. \n Global issuer solutions came in just under the segment average, while bill pay was a headwind. Account to account transfers and P2P solutions continue to rise with consumer demand. Zelle transactions in the quarter were up 75%, and the number of clients live on Zelle was up 65% in the quarter. Debit transactions grew 11% in the quarter, a strong result in light of the tougher year-over-year comparisons in the third quarter versus the second quarter, driven by the macro impact of the reduced benefits of the stimulus. \n Given the performance year-to-date, we expect to see the Payments and Network segment's full year organic revenue rate to be within the medium-term outlook growth rate of 5% to 8%, driven by the continued ramp in new client onboarding and strong uptake of our advanced digital offering. However, this outlook is slightly tempered versus our previous expectation of approaching the higher end of 5% to 8% organic revenue growth target range.\n Adjusted operating income for the segment was up 7% to $650 million, and adjusted operating margin was up 50 basis points to 44.0% in the quarter. Year-to-date, adjusted operating income was up 7% to $1.9 billion, and adjusted operating margin was up 110 basis points to 43.4%. The results were driven by positive momentum in our card and issuer business and the positive impact of revenue and cost synergies. \n Turning to Slide 8. The Financial Technology segment organic revenue grew at 4% in the quarter. Year-to-date, organic revenue growth for the segment is 4%, within our medium-term outlook for this segment of 4% to 6%.\n Our digital banking capabilities and digital solution offerings continue to win in the marketplace. As Frank mentioned, we added 14 new core account processing clients in the quarter, half of which were competitive takeaways. \n We completed our integration of OnDot card management capabilities into our Mobiliti mobile banking platform and are currently in market with that offering. Mobile deposits in Q3 grew 10.5% over the prior year, while self-service ATM deposits grew nearly 60% over last year. \n Adjusted operating income was up 4% in the quarter to $275 million and up 10% year-to-date to $794 million. Adjusted operating margin in the segment decreased 40 basis points in the quarter to 36.0%. However, on a 2-year basis, adjusted operating margin has increased 560 basis points versus the third quarter of 2019. Adjusted operating margins expanded 190 basis points to 35.3% year-to-date. \n The adjusted corporate operating loss was $121 million in the quarter, in line with last year. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 20.3%, improving 260 basis points versus prior year. And we now expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate to be about 20%. \n During the quarter, we continued our disciplined capital allocation strategy by repurchasing over 3 million shares for $365 million. We have more than 52 million shares remaining authorized for share repurchase. \n As Frank mentioned, earlier this month, we entered into an agreement to acquire BentoBox, a digital marketing and e-commerce platform focused on driving growth and engagement for restaurants, that we will integrate into Clover's dining solutions to further strengthen our omnichannel restaurant platform. We expect to close this transaction later this quarter. \n Total debt outstanding was $21 billion on September 30, and the debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio decreased to 32 to 3.2x. Q3 was another demonstration of our time-tested capital allocation strategy, which includes maintaining a strong balance sheet, making organic investment in innovative solutions and pursuing high-value acquisitions. \n With that, let me turn the call back to Frank. \nFrank Bisignano: Thanks, Bob. I'm very proud of the results we've accomplished, with another quarter of double-digit adjusted revenue growth and double-digit adjusted EPS growth. \n In addition to delivering on our financial results, we continue to focus on our associates and our communities. In July, Fiserv was named to the Disability:IN's Disability Equality Index 2021 Best Places To Work, and in September, received the Silver Torch Award from the National Black MBA Association as Partner of the Year, recognizing our commitment to putting diversity at the forefront of our values and talent and client engagement strategies. \n During the quarter, we also entered into a multiyear relation with -- into multiyear relationships with Girl Scouts USA and the Russell Innovation Center for entrepreneurship. These partnerships focus on increasing access and opportunity for aspiring women and minorities within the entrepreneurial ecosystem. \n We also expanded our Back2Business program to Detroit and the Washington, D.C.; Maryland, Virginia area as well as internationally with our entry into the U.K. Additionally, during the quarter, we also completed our CDP submission, and for the first time, published our EE0-1 filing on our Internet site. \n None of these achievements would have been possible without our world-class talent. I thank our more than 40,000 associates around the world for their commitment and courage as we stand together to deliver value for clients, our colleagues and you, our shareholders. \n With that, operator, please open the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. \nTien-Tsin Huang: I want to ask on Acceptance. I'll ask on Acceptance. Looks like you outperformed the global Visa volume, if I'm looking at this correctly. But the yields turned negative in the third quarter. I know it was positive last quarter. So just a question here on pricing and mix in general for Acceptance. And what the outlook on yields might be here going into the fourth quarter? \nRobert Hau: Thanks, Tien-Tsin. This is Bob. I would attribute largely that variation to the difference between volume and trends of our mix relative to what you might see in Visa as well as the yield. Ever so slightly, that ebbs and flows within the quarter depending on the mix of SMB versus enterprises. Overall, we feel quite good about the overall performance, how we're performing against the overall market and against our peers. \nTien-Tsin Huang: Got you. So more mix than pricing. \nRobert Hau: Yes. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. \nLisa Dejong Ellis: Terrific. I think I'll follow up on Tien-Tsin's question, and actually specifically ask about the large processing client roll off that you highlighted. That looks like it's about a 5-point drag on overall volumes in Merchant Acceptance and a larger drag on e-com. Can you just elaborate a little bit on that situation? And specifically, how should we think about how it's affecting revenues. Like if it's a low-yielding client? And then also, is that something now that will take another 3 quarters before it lapsed? Or just any additional detail there would be helpful. \nRobert Hau: Yes, Lisa. The way to think about this, this is a large client that we processed through a joint venture. We pointed it out in terms of adjusting our volume and transactions for transparency, it has very little impact overall on the actual revenue. And the revenue numbers you see there are as reported, so including that decline. That client is largely off our platform at this point, and so you'll see it from a year-over-year standpoint. But there's no more decline going forward because they're essentially off our platform at the end of third quarter. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Dave Koning from Baird. \nDavid Koning: Nice job. I guess, first of all, just in Acceptance, I think last quarter, you even mentioned Q4 being up sequentially from Q3. I guess, is that still the case? And maybe as I look back on some of the more normal years, it seemed like you'd grow a few percent sequentially in Q4. Just wondering anything in Q3 or Q4 that would disrupt that kind of normal few percent up sequentially pattern? \nRobert Hau: So you're talking about growth quarter-to-quarter sequentially? \nDavid Koning: Yes. Just sequential revenue growth in Acceptance. It looks like a few percent up is kind of normal in Q4. \nRobert Hau: Yes, David, I think it's tough to call anything normal these days. I would expect our fourth quarter to be roughly in line with third quarter sequentially for this year. \nDavid Koning: Okay. Okay. Cool. And then I guess, secondly, just Payments, I know you kind of called out how it's going to be within the range. You'd said for maybe at the upper end of the range. Is some of that anything that's falling into 2022 now? Were there any maybe delays in implementations? Or anything there that just kind of makes '22 now a little better than it previously would have been? \nRobert Hau: Yes. I wouldn't call it any delays per se, but we highlighted a few growth drivers that we'll see into 2022: a couple of the new wins, PayPal going live. We signed a new large U.S. telecom that will go live soon. And of course, the announcement of Credit Choice will help us as we launch that program. As Frank pointed out, we're now in pilot. We're seeing very strong demand for that program, for something that we had not formally announced yet. So we're just now announcing that. So we have some good early read on that. And of course, we'll have CardHub, the offering that we acquired through OnDot, for a full year next year. And that is now fully integrated into our Mobiliti platform, and we continue to build out that capability. \nFrank Bisignano: We also have those -- 3 of the top 25 issuers that are beginning onboarding. So that will be within the numbers next year. And you heard us talk about us converting BBVA onto our platform also for our client, PNC. So -- and you're going to continue to get the Zelle ramp in there also as that continues to grow and we onboard more. So I think those all will factor into next year's numbers. \nOperator: Next, we have James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. \nJames Faucette: I wanted to ask a little bit more of a strategic question. I appreciate all the color on near-term trends and benefits that you're getting from new customer wins. But Frank, it seems like you have picked up a little bit the pace of acquisitions, at least the announced ones recently. Can you talk about how you're feeling about potential and importance of doing acquisitions as part of your FIS or as part of your overall strategy, and if that's evolving at all? And I guess tied to that, Bob highlighted the balanced capital allocation. But I'm wondering if it makes sense to accelerate debt paydown a little bit to improve optionality in case bigger deals come along. \nFrank Bisignano: Well, maybe I'll talk about what we've been doing on M&A, and how we're looking at M&A. And I think the first thing is, whether it's M&A or building out businesses, we're investing organically and inorganically. And I think the thing that, hopefully, you see is our agility and speed and innovation. \n We talked about OnDot, and it's fully integrated beyond its initial capability and now in our mobile product and winning in the market. You see us go and look at BentoBox. And we're extending our total addressable market with the capability that will start with restaurants, but actually could be a storefront and much larger. \n But all of these are nurturing good, strong startups that then we'll allow to thrive in our environment. And we put the capital behind them to integrate them and grow. And you hear how we bring SpendLabs along with it. So I think you should expect us to continue that and realize that -- I think we believe we have a deep skill set in integrating properties, transforming our property itself. In some cases, we're even disrupting ourselves in the process as we move from CardValet to CardHub to an integration. So you should expect us to continue to do that and be very, very thoughtful about acquisitions. But we will invest inorganically and we'll invest organically. And we will invest organically in the acquisitions to allow them to thrive within our ecosystem and not to be stand-alone entities. \nRobert Hau: And then, James, as far as paying down debt, we've seen a significant reduction or improvement in our leverage, now at 3.2x. Back when we completed the merger, we were just over 4x. But we continue to generate good free cash flow. And as you may recall, back at our Investor Day last December, we talked about the capital to deploy over the next 5 years of more than $30 billion. \n As we enter 2022, not only will we have very strong cash flow, but we will also have capacity on the balance sheet. As EBITDA grows, the company will naturally delever. And so we'll have the capability to borrow just to maintain that historic leverage ratio. So we feel like we're very good -- positioned to be able to complete acquisitions that we feel we want to complete. It's not prohibited or constrained by capital. \nOperator: Next, we have Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. \nJason Kupferberg: Just wanted to start with a follow-up on the -- that large processing client that is coming out of the numbers here. I guess it looks like it's an e-com client just based on how much it impacted the e-com volume numbers specifically. And was this just a competitive situation that was becoming too price intense from your guys' perspective? Just wanted to get a little bit more color because it's fairly sizable, it appears. \nFrank Bisignano: Yes. I mean let's go first to -- that volume coming off our system is in our revenue number. So hold that thought, right? I mean -- so when you look at a large processing client off a JV, that's exactly what it sounds like. Which is, first of all, they -- this was long telegraphed by the client. But when we always talked about our business, we knew the RPT on this and never saw it as an real economic impact. Really just a volume impact to our business. And they went in-house. It wasn't a competitive takeaway, and it was part of their strategy. We're happy to support them with our processing capability through our JV for the period of time that we did it. \nJason Kupferberg: Okay. And just on the free cash flow conversion. I just wanted to hone in on what, I guess, were the most significant changes in your expectations versus last quarter. Because I mean, at the end of the day, I know, on a quarterly basis, obviously, working capital can move around. But the full year revenue is coming in right in line with your plan. Presumably, the diminished benefit of the NOL would have been known previously. So is this really just a function of kind of higher CapEx than you anticipated at the end of the day versus what you were thinking last quarter? \nRobert Hau: Yes. Jason, the way to think about it is, our 11% revenue outlook, certainly at the high end of our original outlook, was 7% to 12%. So we're growing quite a bit faster than we originally expected overall. We are also seeing meaningful opportunities to invest for growth. So to your point, CapEx is higher in terms of spending on creating new capabilities, new products and services as well as integrating the acquisitions that we announced earlier in the year. Things like OnDot, the software development that we're investing there to not only integrate into our existing capabilities, our other products and services, but to create new capability with some of those acquisitions, led us to make the decision to continue to invest in growth and still have very good free cash flow and good cash conversion overall. \nOperator: Next, we have Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. \nRamsey El-Assal: Frank, I wanted to ask you a kind of a broader question. There seems to be some debate or discussion among investors about potential fintech kind of disruptive forces in the marketplace. At the same time, it seems like you guys function as somewhat of an infrastructure or enablement layer for fintechs. I mean even from the call today, you talked about Chime and Baakt and PayPal, and I know there's a slew of others. So can you talk about this tension between fintech as a competitor and a potential disruptor versus fintech as just sort of a high-growth distribution channel for the business? \nFrank Bisignano: Yes. I mean I take this as a long-term issue really back in time, right? I mean we're a platform, as we like to say, for everything from fintechs to SMB to large enterprises. And if you think about what we did with Clover, that was opened up a community to the development community, so we can be a platform for them and then a platform for our end users. \n So my view and our view is we're happy to do things to disrupt ourselves, like you see us doing with the SpendLabs, the OnDots. And even Clover was a disruptor of ourselves. And we'll continue to use our platform to enable. And ultimately, we want to serve all communities. \n So if you think about things we've talked about here, Chime previously, NYDIG, Baakt being an enabler and one of our clients' coin base. You think about us bringing PayPal into the bill payment ecosystem. We are going to use our platform to enable. And then we're going to compete heavily with our full capabilities. So our traditional clients who will get all the capabilities and continue innovation. And we will also enable those that have the capabilities that we believe our clients would use. \n When you think about all of that -- you hear us talk about being a token provider for Microsoft. That's about bringing their authorization rates higher. So I don't really find any conflict here. We have waterfront property. We open up the waterfront property. And our job is to enable commerce, and we get paid for enabling commerce. \nOperator: Next, we have Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. \nDarrin Peller: I want to hone in on Clover because I know there's been a lot of discussion on what that asset could mean for you. So help us understand. Any more metrics you think makes sense on the success of that asset? Obviously, it continues to grow well. But any other metrics in terms of how big the revenue is from that now? What kind of growth do you anticipate? Maybe any kind of profitability, volume? \n And then also, is there an opportunity given some disruption we're hearing about in the market around a Chinese competitor having some challenges on their terminals in the market now? I think they have 1 million -- 3 million or so terminals that might be challenged now. Could there be a replacement opportunity for Clover on that? \nRobert Hau: Yes, Darrin. It's Bob. Overall, obviously, we are quite pleased with the progress and the continued growth prospects of Clover. GPV up 46%, just under $200 billion for third quarter on an annualized basis. We continue to invest in new capabilities and expand our reach there. As you know, a large proportion -- about 90% of that volume is new to Fiserv, and so that is certainly a growth driver for the company overall and continue to expect that going forward. \n We're adding capabilities. BentoBox, as a great example, is building out some of the verticals. Across that capability, we have significant, strong distribution channels. And with the dissolution of the BAMS joint venture, we have a good and very quickly growing direct channel that we didn't see us have a few years back. And so we continue to see good opportunity there. \n And in terms of the terminal dynamic, we have -- obviously, we have our own Clover devices. We also use other terminals for the other parts of our company. And we have a variety of different providers of those terminals, and no disruption to us at this point. \nFrank Bisignano: Yes. And I would just add, Clover is a platform of choice. You heard about the international expansion of that. And I would think that as people are making choices going forward with disruption, for others, that will just further accelerate our growth. \nDarrin Peller: Yes. Yes. I would think that could be an opportunity for you to take a lot of share in the U.S., at least with what's going on there. A quick follow-up is just on the cash flow and the capital deployment. Just given what normalized earnings could be, how strongly -- or would you consider a more material accelerated share buyback by any chance just given you're now -- you probably will be at about that 2.8 turns leverage target, let's call it, at the end of the year? \nRobert Hau: Yes, Darrin. I think the way we think about capital deployment has been and remains quite consistent and quite balanced. We continue to focus on growing the business organically, doing value-accretive inorganic growth, i.e., acquisitions. And then, obviously, always looking to return cash to shareholders where appropriate. I don't think you ought to anticipate us doing a large buyback. As you know, we're essentially in the market every quarter and have been for years, short of the short period of time between announcing and closing our merger back in 2019. And we'll continue to be a disciplined capital allocator. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Timothy Chiodo from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. \nTimothy Chiodo: I wanted to dig in a little bit more with 2 mix-related questions on Clover. And you sort of alluded to in the last question, but hopefully, we can get some of the mix percentages. So first would be around the portions of revenue. So a large portion would be payments related. But also, you highlighted at the Investor Day some increasing software attach; strength in value-added services; and then also, clearly, there's the hardware component. So even if you could just give sort of rough breakdown of those components. \n And then the second part is around mix and distribution. So you alluded to some of the various channels, whether it be direct, in bank partners, retail ISO, wholesale ISO, even just broad strokes on the mix of distribution would be really helpful. \nRobert Hau: Yes, Tim. So a couple of things to think about there. One, in terms of channel, we are seeing broad growth across all of our channels, whether it's through partners, through ISV, ISOs, through obviously our joint ventures as well as, as I mentioned in a previous question, building out our direct channel. We have, have had and continue to be focused on having a very wide breadth of distribution capabilities and continue to focus on winning in all of those channels. And that remains -- it has been and will continue to be a broad focus of ours. \n And then in terms of breakdown of revenue, we haven't given detail around the mix of hardware versus software versus processing. Obviously, the vast majority of our revenue in the Merchant Acceptance business is the merchant acquiring revenue inside of Clover. Obviously, we've got hardware that we sell. But the magic to Clover is you sell the hardware and then you have a processing client, a merchant acquiring client for years and years with high attach and high attainment rate. And we continue to focus on that. \nOperator: Our next question comes from David Togut for -- from Evercore ISI. \nDavid Togut: Within Merchant Acceptance, what impact are you seeing on your payment volume when a competitive buy now, pay later solution is added at one of your e-commerce clients? And in particular, I'd appreciate your help with 2 things: Number one, are you retaining the merchant acquiring or merchant processing when a BNPL company is added? Or are they bringing in their own merchant acquirer? And number two, do you have any insights into funding mix when BNPL gets added at one of your clients in terms of debit ACH versus credit? \nRobert Hau: Yes. I think a couple of things. Number one, we have a number of referral partners. And over the last several quarters, we've announced these or talked about these, whether it's Zip or Bread or Citizens Pay. We continue to be focused on enabling multiple options for our merchants. And obviously, we're the merchant acquirer for those merchants, and so providing that capability maintains that relationship with those merchants. And in terms of credit versus ACH, et cetera, I think broad industry view is, today, a large portion of that -- paying for buy now, pay later activity is actually paid or are finally executed through card payments. \nDavid Togut: So you're not seeing any specific mix in terms of ACH when you look across kind of BNPL adoption at your customers. \nRobert Hau: No. I think the key there is, while buy now, pay later has a high volume in terms of news, it's still a relatively small portion of the overall GPV or merchant space and not moving the needle. And in fact, in some instances, instead of one transaction, you're actually seeing 4 transactions. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Dolev from Mizuho. \nDan Dolev: Can you give us some color on the -- what's implied in the fourth quarter organic growth guidance for the 2 other segments, for Payments and Fintech? That would be great. \nRobert Hau: Dan, you were quite muffled. Can you repeat that question? \nDan Dolev: Can you give us some color on what's implied by the guidance, the organic growth guidance for the other 2 segments, Fintech and Payments and Networks? \nRobert Hau: Yes. So I think I tried to give some of that color in our prepared remarks. In our FinTech segment, year-to-date, we're now at 4%. And we expect for the full year to be in that medium-term outlook range of 4% to 6%. And then in our Payments segment, again, relative to kind of our medium-term guidance, our medium-term outlook of 5% to 8%, we expect to be in that range. That is adjusted from previously, where we expected to be at the high end of the -- toward the high end of the range. Right now, I'd say just in the range. And year-to-date, we're at 5%. \nOperator: And that was our last question for today's call. \nFrank Bisignano: I'd like to thank everybody for joining us this morning. We appreciate your support. If you have further questions, please contact our Investor Relations team. Have a great day, and thank you for everything. \nOperator: Thank you all for participating in today's conference. You may disconnect your line, and enjoy the rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Frank Bisignano",
            "content": "Thank you, Shub. And thank you all for listening in as we share our results for the quarter and highlight the progress against our growth agenda.\n As you know, we serve as the operating system for commerce and money movement across our client base of banks, fintechs and businesses, ranging from SMBs, to mid market, to large enterprises. We help our clients grow by extending our platform to capture new services and new money flows. We are also seeing real benefits from the ongoing economic recovery, especially here in the U.S. We remain optimistic and continue to invest in growth.\n Turning to our performance. We had a strong third quarter, with total company adjusted revenue up 10%. Adjusted operating margin expanded 130 basis points to 34.2%. Adjusted EPS grew 23% to $1.47. We attained our highest quarter of actioned revenue synergies of $95 million. To date, we have achieved $420 million of actioned revenue synergies, 70% of the increased commitment of $600 million for the 5-year period following the merger.\n As we invested to accelerate growth, free cash flow came in at $572 million for the quarter and $2.3 billion year-to-date. Free cash flow was driven by a combination of the following: first, increased capital expenditure in the areas of technology, innovation hubs and the integration of newly acquired capabilities; second, the working capital increase driven by revenue growth; and finally, reduced benefit of unmet operating loss carryforwards.\n On the back of our results and the strength of our investments, we are tightening our outlook for organic revenue growth and raising the lower end of our outlook for adjusted EPS. We now expect organic constant currency growth of 11% for the full year and adjusted earnings per share between $5.55 and $5.60. This raises the lower end of our prior adjusted earnings per share outlook by $0.05, a growth of 26% to 27% over last year.\n Turning to the business segments, let me start with Merchant Acceptance. We continue to grow beyond the buy button by investing in world-class, omnichannel capabilities, solutioning around vertical and horizontal business needs and capturing new flows. We achieved all of this throughout 3 growth platforms: Clover for small business, Clover Connect for ISV and Carat for enterprises.\n Driving into our performance, Merchant Acceptance led the quarter, posting organic revenue growth of 18% year-over-year, with North America and international largely in line with the segment average for the quarter. Our global merchant locations have been growing at a healthy clip, up 10% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis, driven by positive net new merchants across all regions. The quarter was driven by growth in global volume and transactions of 15% and 12%, respectively. North America volume and transactions grew 14% and 9%, respectively, led by strength in travel, restaurants and petro. Excluding the impact of the loss of a large processing client through one of our JVs, North America volume and transaction growth in the quarter would have been 19% and 14%, respectively.\n Next, let's go deeper by platform, starting with Clover. GPV grew 47% year-over-year or a 39% CAGR since 2019 to $196 billion on an annualized basis. In the SMB space, we remain focused in building vertical-specific solutions, offering an integrated suite of products that help merchants generate revenue and run their business. \n As part of our vertical strategy, we entered into an agreement to acquire BentoBox, a digital marketing and commerce platform focused on driving growth and engagement for restaurants. This transaction will expand our Clover dining solutions and industry-leading commerce and business management capabilities, which already enable nearly 200,000 restaurants of all sizes to deliver unique and differentiating dining experience, from quick and casual to fine dining. We expect the acquisition to close in the fourth quarter subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions.\n Additionally, we continue to focus on building value-added services for the Clover platform, including Clover Capital, Clover Dining, Clover Order Ahead and Clover inventory as well as our unique Clover app marketplace.\n On the enterprise side, Carat, our enterprise omnichannel platform, continued its strong momentum in the third quarter, with new wins, product innovation and a gradual recovery in cross-border commerce. Global e-commerce volume grew unabated in the quarter, driven by cross-border and international growth of 25% on a year-over-year basis as volumes recovered from the pandemic lows, with secular tailwinds expected to sustain future momentum. Omnichannel transactions, such as order ahead and buy online, pickup in store, grew 35% in the quarter. \n We had notable e-commerce wins in the quarter, including Johnson & Johnson and Caesars Entertainment. We also expanded our existing global acquiring relationship with Microsoft to be their provider for network tokens. In the quarter, we added PayPal and Venmo as digital wallet payout options to our global service platform, submitting Carat as a leader in digital payouts with over $10 billion processed year-to-date, an increase of 230% on a year-over-year basis.\n Additionally, we are building a new partnership with Bakkt, a leading crypto and consumer wallet solution provider Bakkt will utilize Fiserv's industry-leading funds-in, funds-out solution. And together, Fiserv and Bakkt will develop new crypto use cases for both merchant and FI clients.\n Moving to Clover Connect. The strength of our ISV focused offering showed through the third quarter with ISV volume up 71% year-over-year. Clover Connect allows us to bring together 2 strong Fiserv assets: the world-class hardware and software platform on Clover, along with the best-in-class partner management and operational tool of CoPilot, which gives ISVs a unique view into all of the merchants' activities, ranging from merchant application processing to support. \n Our commitment to being the best partner for ISVs is resonating. We signed 47 new ISVs in the third quarter, bringing our total wins to 142 year-to-date. We continue signing up ISVs that are new to payments and winning against the competition. This quarter, more than half of our wins were competitive takeaways.\n Before I address our international progress, I'd like to highlight another focus area in our merchant business, point-of-sale lending. We are leveraging our position as the operating platform for businesses small, medium and large to offer a range of buy now, pay later options. We are expanding our referral relationships while simplifying the merchant experience through integrations with our platforms like Clover. We currently have referral agreements with Zip, Citizens Pay and Bread. \n We're also working with our FI clients to bring payer BNPL offerings to market. For example, we are partnering with Synchrony to offer buy now, pay later solutions on our card processing platform, Optus. Synchrony also recently announced acceptance of private label cards through Clover. \n On our Investor Day, we talked to you about our Merchant Acceptance growth strategy for international. We remain focused on growing our global market presence with world-class bank partners and through our direct channels, all while leveraging the strength of common platforms and connections.\n The global expansion of Clover platform into APAC, Latin America and EMEA are all currently in flight. We're on track to roll out Clover in India by the third quarter of 2022, a tremendous opportunity given the size and growth potential of the market. Clover is already in market in Argentina and is expected to launch in Brazil next year, thereby covering the 2 largest markets in Latin America. \n In EMEA, Clover is in market across the U.K., Germany, the Netherlands and Ireland, with a further boost expected with the rollout of the Deutsche Bank JV that we announced last quarter. Among the key APAC deals completed in the quarter is an omnichannel merchant acquirer processing mandate from Bank of China for their fast-growing Macau market.\n Moving to EMEA, Fiserv partnered with PostFinance, one of the largest financial institutions in Switzerland, to provide credit card acquiring services to their Swiss merchant clients. We're starting with an initial 4,000 merchants that accept the PostFinance today, with plans to expand to the entire merchant base of 60,000 over time.\n Fiserv is also supporting Restaurant Brands, owner of iconic brands, including Burger King and Popeyes, as the company expands its footprint across Europe with an omnichannel approach. Fiserv will provide acquiring services for Burger King in the U.K. and the Nordics and Popeyes in the U.K.\n To close on the merchant segment. As you may recall, in April, we won a 20-year deal to become the exclusive provider of merchant acquiring services for Caixa Econo\u0302mica Federal, one of the largest Brazilian banks. We are pleased to report that the implementation of this mandate started at the beginning of August and is going extremely well, with 65,000 merchants onboarded as of last week.\n Moving to the Payments and Network segment. Organic revenue grew 6% in the quarter, resulting in year-to-date growth of 5%. Our Payments segment consists of 3 businesses: global credit processing and output solutions, which we call issuer solutions, which is 40% of the segment; debit processing and debit networks, which we call -- we refer to as card services, also 1/3 of the segment; and the third business is comprised of digital solutions, bill pay and our prepaid business.\n Our issuer solutions business, which grew just below the overall Payments segment average, is seeing the benefit of a continued credit recovery, with general purpose credit gross active accounts up in the high single digits. Note that our credit issuer solutions revenue is driven by number of accounts, not credit volume. However, as credit volumes recover, the number of accounts will follow. Looking ahead, we expect growth in the business to be driven by the continued ramp of last year's notable wins, including 3 of the top 25 issuer wins, which we announced last year.\n We also recently completed PNC's conversion of BBVA's card portfolios through our platform. Our retail private label portfolio also continues to recover from its COVID lows, although at a slower pace than we anticipated at the beginning of the year.\n Within card services, which grew organic revenue a couple of points faster than the overall Payment segment average, we saw a strong growth in debit transactions driving our issuance and network businesses. Looking ahead, we expect to sustain growth for this business by broadening our total addressable market. \n For instance, in the quarter, our STAR debit network signed an agreement with leading U.S. consumer fintech, Chime, to become its preferred unaffiliated network for debit. We believe that aligning one of the largest fintech issuers is a testimony to the scale and technical capabilities of the STAR network and positions the network well for future growth. This was also one of our notable action synergy revenues in the quarter.\n During our Investor Day, we discussed the opportunity to offer a fully managed by Fiserv credit card issuing option to community FIs and shared that we were actively exploring this market. We are pleased to announce that we are currently piloting our agent credit program offering, branded Credit Choice, and will launch in Q1 2022. \n Credit Choice is a fully managed credit card issuing-as-a-service solution that allows our community FIs to offer their customers an FI-branded credit card experience that is fully integrated into their debit solution, but without the operational burden of running their own credit card portfolio. Credit Choice leverages our scale distribution and world-class card issuing surround solutions, such as OnDot and SpendLabs to expand into a sizable, new, addressable market for Fiserv where the economics per card are considerably richer than in processing. We have already seen strong, early interest from clients, with hundreds of prospects in the pipeline.\n On our Q2 call, we spoke to you about our rich, mobile-first consumer and business offerings powered by recent acquisitions, OnDot and SpendLabs. The early results of the launch have been very encouraging. We completed the integration of the CardHub platform into our credit and debit processing platforms and into our Mobiliti mobile banking platform. We are seeing tremendous demand for this integrated solution from both new prospects as well as existing CardValet clients, whom we expect to fully migrate to the integrated CardHub solution by the end of 2022. In addition, we expect to expand the platform to add loyalty, installment payment and dispute management, thereby establishing CardHub as a key differentiator and to drive new sales and client retention.\n For our financial institution clients, this solution is a game changer. It enhances consumer engagement with their digital banking platform, creates more fee income through greater card usage, and catapults the FI's overall digital experience into the leagues of some of the world's top banks and neobanks.\n In the third business, results are mixed. We had good growth in our digital payments activity, led by Zelle transaction growth of 75% in the quarter and the number of clients live now reaching just under 750. Prepaid growth was driven by new client wins within our Gift Solutions business. We expect growth to continue, driven by new use cases.\n Our bill pay business, which encompasses both the direct biller and bill pay through our financial institutions, continues to grow slower than expected. However, we're extending our bill pay capabilities beyond the financial institution channel, going live later this month as an enabler of PayPal's bill payment functionality within PayPal's new app. Additionally, we expanded our relationship with a large telecom provider to enable commercial card payments with our BillMatrix solution.\n Moving to the Financial Technology segment. The quarter was in line with our expectations, posting organic revenue growth of 4%, resulting in 4% growth year-to-date. We added 14 new core account processing clients in the quarter, including 7 competitive takeaways and 2 de novo wins. Our DNA platform is seeing great success, including with larger financial institutions, as evidenced in the Valley National Bank and Dollar Bank wins, with assets over $40 billion and $10 billion, respectively.\n Abiliti, our modern, cloud-based, API-driven digital banking platform, is seeing great momentum with 150 incremental sales in the quarter. 138 of these sales were to existing clients, which will drive our clients' digital transformation and deepen the penetration of our fully integrated digital surrounds, such as CardHub, sale and SpendLabs. The remaining 12 were new logo sales, with half being core competitive takeaways. \n We also continue to enrich our open banking and fintech ecosystem, again, in line with the goals laid out in last year's investor conference. We launched our new developer portal, which we call the Fiserv developer studio, towards the end of the third quarter. The developer studio provides rich and expansive API integrations to support banks, fintechs, merchants and enterprise clients with developer tools needed to accelerate innovation, integrations across the entire Fiserv ecosystem. Additionally, we also announced partnerships with exciting new fintechs: FutureFuel.io and Streetshares, aimed at creating new white space opportunities in digital for both retail consumer and small business lending, respectively.\n We believe that we're extremely well positioned to continue to drive revenue in the segment higher by delivering new innovation, such as Abiliti; strategically acquiring and integrating attractive surround solutions, like OnDot and SpendLabs; and leveraging the power of the developer community through our developer studio API portal or dedicated go-to-market integrations like FutureFuel.io and StreetShares. \n Now let me pass the discussion to Bob for more detail on our financial results. Thanks, Bob. I'm very proud of the results we've accomplished, with another quarter of double-digit adjusted revenue growth and double-digit adjusted EPS growth. \n In addition to delivering on our financial results, we continue to focus on our associates and our communities. In July, Fiserv was named to the Disability:IN's Disability Equality Index 2021 Best Places To Work, and in September, received the Silver Torch Award from the National Black MBA Association as Partner of the Year, recognizing our commitment to putting diversity at the forefront of our values and talent and client engagement strategies. \n During the quarter, we also entered into a multiyear relation with -- into multiyear relationships with Girl Scouts USA and the Russell Innovation Center for entrepreneurship. These partnerships focus on increasing access and opportunity for aspiring women and minorities within the entrepreneurial ecosystem. \n We also expanded our Back2Business program to Detroit and the Washington, D.C.; Maryland, Virginia area as well as internationally with our entry into the U.K. Additionally, during the quarter, we also completed our CDP submission, and for the first time, published our EE0-1 filing on our Internet site. \n None of these achievements would have been possible without our world-class talent. I thank our more than 40,000 associates around the world for their commitment and courage as we stand together to deliver value for clients, our colleagues and you, our shareholders. \n With that, operator, please open the line for questions. We also have those -- 3 of the top 25 issuers that are beginning onboarding. So that will be within the numbers next year. And you heard us talk about us converting BBVA onto our platform also for our client, PNC. So -- and you're going to continue to get the Zelle ramp in there also as that continues to grow and we onboard more. So I think those all will factor into next year's numbers. Well, maybe I'll talk about what we've been doing on M&A, and how we're looking at M&A. And I think the first thing is, whether it's M&A or building out businesses, we're investing organically and inorganically. And I think the thing that, hopefully, you see is our agility and speed and innovation. \n We talked about OnDot, and it's fully integrated beyond its initial capability and now in our mobile product and winning in the market. You see us go and look at BentoBox. And we're extending our total addressable market with the capability that will start with restaurants, but actually could be a storefront and much larger. \n But all of these are nurturing good, strong startups that then we'll allow to thrive in our environment. And we put the capital behind them to integrate them and grow. And you hear how we bring SpendLabs along with it. So I think you should expect us to continue that and realize that -- I think we believe we have a deep skill set in integrating properties, transforming our property itself. In some cases, we're even disrupting ourselves in the process as we move from CardValet to CardHub to an integration. So you should expect us to continue to do that and be very, very thoughtful about acquisitions. But we will invest inorganically and we'll invest organically. And we will invest organically in the acquisitions to allow them to thrive within our ecosystem and not to be stand-alone entities. Yes. I mean let's go first to -- that volume coming off our system is in our revenue number. So hold that thought, right? I mean -- so when you look at a large processing client off a JV, that's exactly what it sounds like. Which is, first of all, they -- this was long telegraphed by the client. But when we always talked about our business, we knew the RPT on this and never saw it as an real economic impact. Really just a volume impact to our business. And they went in-house. It wasn't a competitive takeaway, and it was part of their strategy. We're happy to support them with our processing capability through our JV for the period of time that we did it. Yes. I mean I take this as a long-term issue really back in time, right? I mean we're a platform, as we like to say, for everything from fintechs to SMB to large enterprises. And if you think about what we did with Clover, that was opened up a community to the development community, so we can be a platform for them and then a platform for our end users. \n So my view and our view is we're happy to do things to disrupt ourselves, like you see us doing with the SpendLabs, the OnDots. And even Clover was a disruptor of ourselves. And we'll continue to use our platform to enable. And ultimately, we want to serve all communities. \n So if you think about things we've talked about here, Chime previously, NYDIG, Baakt being an enabler and one of our clients' coin base. You think about us bringing PayPal into the bill payment ecosystem. We are going to use our platform to enable. And then we're going to compete heavily with our full capabilities. So our traditional clients who will get all the capabilities and continue innovation. And we will also enable those that have the capabilities that we believe our clients would use. \n When you think about all of that -- you hear us talk about being a token provider for Microsoft. That's about bringing their authorization rates higher. So I don't really find any conflict here. We have waterfront property. We open up the waterfront property. And our job is to enable commerce, and we get paid for enabling commerce. Yes. And I would just add, Clover is a platform of choice. You heard about the international expansion of that. And I would think that as people are making choices going forward with disruption, for others, that will just further accelerate our growth. I'd like to thank everybody for joining us this morning. We appreciate your support. If you have further questions, please contact our Investor Relations team. Have a great day, and thank you for everything."

            "name": "Robert Hau",
            "content": "Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin reviewing the detailed business results, as Shub mentioned, we are aligning with the broader community and simplifying our message by clarifying our internal revenue growth metric as organic constant currency revenue. This does not change how we calculate this measure, just clarifies the terminology. It will be the same definition in calculations we've used in prior quarters. \n On Slide 11, we've included a new schedule to clearly provide an understanding of the walk from GAAP revenue to internal or organic revenue for the third quarter. This summary can be seen in more detail in the appendix of our presentation. Now I will cover some detail on each of our segments. If you're following along on our slides, I'm starting with Slide 4. \n We feel great about our performance for both the quarter and the first 9 months of the year. And we are well positioned to achieve strong full year financial results.\n Total company organic revenue was up 10% in the quarter, with growth across all segments, led by Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 18%. Year-to-date, total company organic revenue grew 11%, also led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 21%. Total company adjusted revenue also grew 10% to nearly $4 billion in the quarter. Year-to-date, total company adjusted revenue has grown 11% to $11.4 billion. \n Third quarter adjusted operating income was up a strong 15% to $1.4 billion and adjusted operating margin increased by 130 basis points to 34.2%. This margin improvement was driven by our strong revenue results and our continued disciplined cost synergy execution, which produced $64 million of incremental cost synergies during the quarter. And we have now actioned $1.16 billion programmed today. Year-to-date, adjusted operating income increased 23% to $3.8 billion. Adjusted operating margin year-to-date expanded 330 basis points to 33.2%. \n Our third quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 23% to $1.47 compared to $1.20 in the prior year. Through September 30, adjusted earnings per share grew 29% to $4.01, putting us on pace to achieve our 36th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth, a testament to the incredible strength and resiliency of this company.\n Free cash flow for the first 9 months of the year was $2.3 billion, resulting in an 85% free cash flow conversion. This result was driven by increased capital investments related to technology, world-class facilities and the integration of newly acquired businesses; a working capital increase driven by revenue growth; and a reduction in the net operating loss carryforward benefit. With these investments and strong revenue growth, we now expect free cash flow conversion to be 95% to 100% for the full year. \n Now looking to our segment results, starting on Slide 6. Organic revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was a very strong 18% in the quarter and 21% year-to-date. Our revenue was driven by a combination of growth in volume and transactions. Our results were once again driven by strong performance across all 3 platforms: Clover for SMBs, Carat for large businesses and Clover Connect for ISVs. \n Clover continues to build upon the momentum and strength of our product offering as it posted a very strong 47% GPV growth year-over-year or $196 billion on an annualized basis, with growth across all of our distribution channels. \n With Carat, we won 45 new global enterprise e-commerce clients on the platform in the quarter. In addition, Carat expanded its mandate with existing high-quality brands, such as Valero. Continuous leading the high-growth, online EBT space, Carat has launched more than 50 clients to online EBT in the past 12 months. \n Our ISV volume in this quarter through Clover Connect grew 71% year-over-year and up almost 150% versus the third quarter of 2019. We are winning both ISVs that are new to payments as well as competitive takeaways. \n Adjusted operating income in the Acceptance segment increased 30% to $552 million in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was up 300 basis points to 32.2%, driven by top line strength. Through September 30, adjusted operating income improved 57% to $1.5 billion and adjusted operating margin grew 710 basis points to 30.6%. \n Turning to Slide 7. The Payments and Network segment posted organic revenue growth of 6% in the quarter, resulting in year-to-date growth of 5%. As Frank outlined in his composition of the segment, our card services, digital payments and prepaid businesses outperformed the segment organic revenue growth rate. \n Global issuer solutions came in just under the segment average, while bill pay was a headwind. Account to account transfers and P2P solutions continue to rise with consumer demand. Zelle transactions in the quarter were up 75%, and the number of clients live on Zelle was up 65% in the quarter. Debit transactions grew 11% in the quarter, a strong result in light of the tougher year-over-year comparisons in the third quarter versus the second quarter, driven by the macro impact of the reduced benefits of the stimulus. \n Given the performance year-to-date, we expect to see the Payments and Network segment's full year organic revenue rate to be within the medium-term outlook growth rate of 5% to 8%, driven by the continued ramp in new client onboarding and strong uptake of our advanced digital offering. However, this outlook is slightly tempered versus our previous expectation of approaching the higher end of 5% to 8% organic revenue growth target range.\n Adjusted operating income for the segment was up 7% to $650 million, and adjusted operating margin was up 50 basis points to 44.0% in the quarter. Year-to-date, adjusted operating income was up 7% to $1.9 billion, and adjusted operating margin was up 110 basis points to 43.4%. The results were driven by positive momentum in our card and issuer business and the positive impact of revenue and cost synergies. \n Turning to Slide 8. The Financial Technology segment organic revenue grew at 4% in the quarter. Year-to-date, organic revenue growth for the segment is 4%, within our medium-term outlook for this segment of 4% to 6%.\n Our digital banking capabilities and digital solution offerings continue to win in the marketplace. As Frank mentioned, we added 14 new core account processing clients in the quarter, half of which were competitive takeaways. \n We completed our integration of OnDot card management capabilities into our Mobiliti mobile banking platform and are currently in market with that offering. Mobile deposits in Q3 grew 10.5% over the prior year, while self-service ATM deposits grew nearly 60% over last year. \n Adjusted operating income was up 4% in the quarter to $275 million and up 10% year-to-date to $794 million. Adjusted operating margin in the segment decreased 40 basis points in the quarter to 36.0%. However, on a 2-year basis, adjusted operating margin has increased 560 basis points versus the third quarter of 2019. Adjusted operating margins expanded 190 basis points to 35.3% year-to-date. \n The adjusted corporate operating loss was $121 million in the quarter, in line with last year. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 20.3%, improving 260 basis points versus prior year. And we now expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate to be about 20%. \n During the quarter, we continued our disciplined capital allocation strategy by repurchasing over 3 million shares for $365 million. We have more than 52 million shares remaining authorized for share repurchase. \n As Frank mentioned, earlier this month, we entered into an agreement to acquire BentoBox, a digital marketing and e-commerce platform focused on driving growth and engagement for restaurants, that we will integrate into Clover's dining solutions to further strengthen our omnichannel restaurant platform. We expect to close this transaction later this quarter. \n Total debt outstanding was $21 billion on September 30, and the debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio decreased to 32 to 3.2x. Q3 was another demonstration of our time-tested capital allocation strategy, which includes maintaining a strong balance sheet, making organic investment in innovative solutions and pursuing high-value acquisitions. \n With that, let me turn the call back to Frank. Thanks, Tien-Tsin. This is Bob. I would attribute largely that variation to the difference between volume and trends of our mix relative to what you might see in Visa as well as the yield. Ever so slightly, that ebbs and flows within the quarter depending on the mix of SMB versus enterprises. Overall, we feel quite good about the overall performance, how we're performing against the overall market and against our peers. Yes. Yes, Lisa. The way to think about this, this is a large client that we processed through a joint venture. We pointed it out in terms of adjusting our volume and transactions for transparency, it has very little impact overall on the actual revenue. And the revenue numbers you see there are as reported, so including that decline. That client is largely off our platform at this point, and so you'll see it from a year-over-year standpoint. But there's no more decline going forward because they're essentially off our platform at the end of third quarter. So you're talking about growth quarter-to-quarter sequentially? Yes, David, I think it's tough to call anything normal these days. I would expect our fourth quarter to be roughly in line with third quarter sequentially for this year. Yes. I wouldn't call it any delays per se, but we highlighted a few growth drivers that we'll see into 2022: a couple of the new wins, PayPal going live. We signed a new large U.S. telecom that will go live soon. And of course, the announcement of Credit Choice will help us as we launch that program. As Frank pointed out, we're now in pilot. We're seeing very strong demand for that program, for something that we had not formally announced yet. So we're just now announcing that. So we have some good early read on that. And of course, we'll have CardHub, the offering that we acquired through OnDot, for a full year next year. And that is now fully integrated into our Mobiliti platform, and we continue to build out that capability. And then, James, as far as paying down debt, we've seen a significant reduction or improvement in our leverage, now at 3.2x. Back when we completed the merger, we were just over 4x. But we continue to generate good free cash flow. And as you may recall, back at our Investor Day last December, we talked about the capital to deploy over the next 5 years of more than $30 billion. \n As we enter 2022, not only will we have very strong cash flow, but we will also have capacity on the balance sheet. As EBITDA grows, the company will naturally delever. And so we'll have the capability to borrow just to maintain that historic leverage ratio. So we feel like we're very good -- positioned to be able to complete acquisitions that we feel we want to complete. It's not prohibited or constrained by capital. Yes. Jason, the way to think about it is, our 11% revenue outlook, certainly at the high end of our original outlook, was 7% to 12%. So we're growing quite a bit faster than we originally expected overall. We are also seeing meaningful opportunities to invest for growth. So to your point, CapEx is higher in terms of spending on creating new capabilities, new products and services as well as integrating the acquisitions that we announced earlier in the year. Things like OnDot, the software development that we're investing there to not only integrate into our existing capabilities, our other products and services, but to create new capability with some of those acquisitions, led us to make the decision to continue to invest in growth and still have very good free cash flow and good cash conversion overall. Yes, Darrin. It's Bob. Overall, obviously, we are quite pleased with the progress and the continued growth prospects of Clover. GPV up 46%, just under $200 billion for third quarter on an annualized basis. We continue to invest in new capabilities and expand our reach there. As you know, a large proportion -- about 90% of that volume is new to Fiserv, and so that is certainly a growth driver for the company overall and continue to expect that going forward. \n We're adding capabilities. BentoBox, as a great example, is building out some of the verticals. Across that capability, we have significant, strong distribution channels. And with the dissolution of the BAMS joint venture, we have a good and very quickly growing direct channel that we didn't see us have a few years back. And so we continue to see good opportunity there. \n And in terms of the terminal dynamic, we have -- obviously, we have our own Clover devices. We also use other terminals for the other parts of our company. And we have a variety of different providers of those terminals, and no disruption to us at this point. Yes, Darrin. I think the way we think about capital deployment has been and remains quite consistent and quite balanced. We continue to focus on growing the business organically, doing value-accretive inorganic growth, i.e., acquisitions. And then, obviously, always looking to return cash to shareholders where appropriate. I don't think you ought to anticipate us doing a large buyback. As you know, we're essentially in the market every quarter and have been for years, short of the short period of time between announcing and closing our merger back in 2019. And we'll continue to be a disciplined capital allocator. Yes, Tim. So a couple of things to think about there. One, in terms of channel, we are seeing broad growth across all of our channels, whether it's through partners, through ISV, ISOs, through obviously our joint ventures as well as, as I mentioned in a previous question, building out our direct channel. We have, have had and continue to be focused on having a very wide breadth of distribution capabilities and continue to focus on winning in all of those channels. And that remains -- it has been and will continue to be a broad focus of ours. \n And then in terms of breakdown of revenue, we haven't given detail around the mix of hardware versus software versus processing. Obviously, the vast majority of our revenue in the Merchant Acceptance business is the merchant acquiring revenue inside of Clover. Obviously, we've got hardware that we sell. But the magic to Clover is you sell the hardware and then you have a processing client, a merchant acquiring client for years and years with high attach and high attainment rate. And we continue to focus on that. Yes. I think a couple of things. Number one, we have a number of referral partners. And over the last several quarters, we've announced these or talked about these, whether it's Zip or Bread or Citizens Pay. We continue to be focused on enabling multiple options for our merchants. And obviously, we're the merchant acquirer for those merchants, and so providing that capability maintains that relationship with those merchants. And in terms of credit versus ACH, et cetera, I think broad industry view is, today, a large portion of that -- paying for buy now, pay later activity is actually paid or are finally executed through card payments. No. I think the key there is, while buy now, pay later has a high volume in terms of news, it's still a relatively small portion of the overall GPV or merchant space and not moving the needle. And in fact, in some instances, instead of one transaction, you're actually seeing 4 transactions. Dan, you were quite muffled. Can you repeat that question? Yes. So I think I tried to give some of that color in our prepared remarks. In our FinTech segment, year-to-date, we're now at 4%. And we expect for the full year to be in that medium-term outlook range of 4% to 6%. And then in our Payments segment, again, relative to kind of our medium-term guidance, our medium-term outlook of 5% to 8%, we expect to be in that range. That is adjusted from previously, where we expected to be at the high end of the -- toward the high end of the range. Right now, I'd say just in the range. And year-to-date, we're at 5%."

At this time, I will turn the call over to Shub Mukherjee, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. \nShub Mukherjee: Thank you, and good morning. With me on the call today are Frank Bisignano, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and supplemental materials for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, expected operating and financial results, strategic initiatives and expected benefits and synergies from the First Data acquisition. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. You should refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. Please refer to our earnings release and supplemental materials for today's call for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this call, along with the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. Unless otherwise stated, performance references are year-over-year comparisons, and all references to internal revenue growth are on a constant currency basis. And now I'll turn the call over to Frank.\nFrank J Bisignano: Thank you, Shub. Second quarter was a very strong quarter for us across the company. Total company adjusted revenue grew 20%. Adjusted operating margin grew 510 basis points, resulting in adjusted operating income growth of 41%. Adjusted EPS grew 47% to $1.37. Free cash flow in the quarter was in line with last year, just under $900 million, including the impact of a diminished NOL. Second quarter sales were up 31% with growth across the business. Our strong second quarter was driven by a combination of continued economic recovery and strong execution of our business strategy. On the macroeconomic side, we saw continued recovery in the US with uneven recovery in other parts of the world. The shift to digital commerce drove consumer demand for seamless experiences across channels. Amidst these trends, we executed on our strategies to continue to win business and grow share. We serve as the operating system for commerce across our client base, ranging from micro merchants to the world's largest corporations, financial institutions, banks and credit unions, fintechs and governments. This enables us to focus not only on growth at our core but also on new services, business models and adjacencies. Given the strong results to date and our solid pipeline, we are raising our outlook range for internal revenue growth and now expect 10% to 12% growth for 2021 from 9% to 12% previously. Additionally, we are raising our adjusted EPS full year outlook and now expect a range of $5.50 to $5.60, up from $5.35 to $5.50 previously. The increased adjusted EPS guidance outlook represents a 24% to 27% growth versus last year. Drilling down to the business segments, the quarter was led by our Merchant Acceptance segment, which posted internal revenue growth of 41% year-over-year. Normalizing for the year-ago comps, the segment posted a 13% growth in the quarter on a 2-year basis above our pre-pandemic run rate. Both North America and international largely grew in line with the segment average. North America purchase volume was up 33% in the quarter led by strength in retail, petro and restaurants. One of the trends that the pandemic has accelerated is the shift to omni-commerce. Consumers are increasingly looking to engage with merchants in whatever way is most convenient. Fiserv's ability to support clients with leading solutions in both brick-and-mortar and e-commerce environments is a differentiator. We saw the manifestation of this trend during the second quarter as offline commerce recovered with volumes growing 46% versus 2020 and 11% versus 2019. Online commerce volume also grew unabated at 21% year-over-year, highlighting the criticality of equipping merchants with omnichannel commerce capabilities. Our lead in omni commerce is the reason we were honored with the omni channel provider of the Year Award from The Strawhecker Group, a leading payments industry analyst firm. As you know, Clover, Carat and Clover Connect are Fiserv's leading platforms for small and medium-sized merchants, enterprises, and ISVs respectively. Starting with Clover, GPV in the quarter grew 96% year-over-year, reflecting a 38% CAGR since 2019 to $184 billion on an annualized basis. In the SMB space, we continue to build out vertical specific solutions in retail, restaurants and services. Our vertical sector strategy aims at expanding beyond the buy button offering an integrated suite of products that help merchants generate revenue and run their business. Value-added services on the Clover platform include Clover Capital, Clover Dining, Clover Order Ahead and Clover Inventory as well as our unique app marketplace, which provides access to services such as payroll management, loyalty, and marketing that enable us to increase our share of the merchant's wallet and become the platform of choice. On the enterprise side, Carat, our enterprise omnichannel ecosystem, continued its strong momentum in the second quarter with new wins and continued innovation in key verticals. In restaurants, Carat powers digital commerce for 10 of the Top 15 QSRs. Carat has helped Burger King expand its mobile payments experience into Latin America; in restaurant brands international expansion in the UK and other parts of EMEA. In grocery, where Carat now serves 9 of the Top 10 grocers, we have helped new clients such as Wakefern, ALDI, and the companies of Ahold Delhaize USA, expand their digital grocery ordering capabilities with new payment types. Evidence to Carat's commitment to the grocery industry and transform digital experience is exemplified by Carat's leading online EBT program that has processed $2.5 billion in GPV year-to-date. In retail, where Carat serves 7 of the Top 10 retailers, we're expanding our merchant services by working with clients such as Adidas on innovative solutions, including our new consumer recommendation engine. This engine connects digital experiences to local stores enabled by the integration of Radius8, an acquisition we completed in the first quarter of this year. Carat has also established new at-scale leadership with crypto wallets, where we power cards funds in and funds out solutions. Through this capability, we helped consumers move more than $4 billion in payments volume in and out of wallets for the past 12 months. In the second quarter alone, we moved $2 billion of volume, demonstrating the sharp ramp in digital currency movement. Moving to Clover Connect, our ISV-focused offering, momentum continued in the second quarter with ISV volume up 122% year-over-year. We signed 53 new ISV partners in the quarter, bringing the new ISV partnerships to 95 year-to-date. We're signing up ISVs that are new to payments and those that are converting from competitors. Year-to-date, almost half of our wins are competitive takeaways. Our ISV partners derive great value in getting access to our partner management tool, CoPilot and integrating with Clover. On our Investor Day, we talked to you about our merchant acceptance growth strategy for international. We remain focused on growing our global market presence with world-class bank partners and through our direct channels, all while leveraging the strength of common platforms and connections. In the quarter, we announced the JV with Deutsche Bank in Germany that offers us access to over 800,000 merchants, many of whom will power with our Clover platform. In Asia Pacific region, we won a multi-country acquiring processing mandate from Citibank for its new integrated digital commerce offering, Spring by Citi. Early in July, we began onboarding and processing payment transactions as part of the merchant acquiring services agreement signed with Brazil's CaixaBank in April of this year. The onboarding began 70 days after contract signing, once again demonstrating our speed to market. In addition to the successes I mentioned above, in our Merchant Acceptance segment yesterday we announced a strategic relationship with Goldman Sachs to integrate cross-border payment functionality into our B2B accounts receivable and accounts payable solution, SnapPay. As you know, B2B payments is a vast and growing market ripe with opportunity. We believe that in partnership with Goldman Sachs, we can deliver best-in-class B2B payment capabilities, enhancing visibility, operational efficiencies and cost savings for our large and mid-market business clients. Moving to the Payments and Network segment, we posted internal revenue growth of 7% over the second quarter of last year. Positives in the quarter included the continued growth of Zelle, continued strength in debit transaction volume, initial recovery in credit account volumes and international growth with some weakness in bill pay, although results improved sequentially. The differentiated and industry-leading businesses within our Payments and Network portfolio and our agile execution are the key reasons why we continue to win with clients. We are proceeding well with onboarding $120 million of credit issuing wins we told you about on our Investor Day. We completed boarding Atlanticus in Q2 and have completed several stages of migrating both Alliance Data and Genesis Financial to the Optus environment. In less than 12 months, after announcing these three banner wins, we are poised to recognize revenue on all three clients in the third quarter of this year. We continue to grow our relationship with innovative growth-stage fintechs, digital banks and consumer lenders. In June, we signed an agreement with Prosper, a Fintech pioneer and a premier AI-driven consumer lending marketplace for credit card processing services. This space is a growth focus for us. Our revenue with fintech issuance grew over 300% during the first half of this year versus the same period in 2019. On Investor Day, you'll recall that driving best-in-class integrated digital consumer journeys is a key differentiator and imperative for our clients. Experiences are the new currency of loyalty. Customers gravitate toward institutions that could give them a unified, seamless experience across both channels and products. To that end, yesterday we announced enhanced Fiserv digital capabilities for integrated digital banking and card management. This enriched mobile-first suite will enable financial institutions to offer their consumer and business customers a best-in-class digital banking experience that's designed for the way customers expect to engage. To introduce these enhanced capabilities, we rapidly integrated two recent acquisitions, Ondot and SpendLabs. The result is a single unified platform for consumer and small and midsized business cardholders that enables expense and business card management. This offering allows us to deliver a single point of access for all banking products. Our enhanced Fiserv digital capabilities will span all three business segments: in payments through a leading digital cardholder experience; in financial technology, by driving the penetration of our core account processing in digital surrounds; in merchant acceptance, by increasing the uptake of value-added services from integrating SpendLabs with our Clover platform. We expect to see incremental usage, engagement and services revenue on the Fiserv platform as a result. Before I close out the Payments segment, I would like to mention the strong growth we are seeing in our debit networks, STAR and Accel as we are winning new issuers through our ability to support all transaction type, including best-in-class fraud management and chargeback products. Moving to the Financial Technologies segment, the quarter was in line with our expectations, posting internal revenue growth of 5%, including an 80 basis points headwind from periodic revenue. I want to highlight some key achievements in the quarter that reflect our strong market position. We added 10 new core account processing clients in the quarter, including 8 on the DNA platform and 4 in the over $1 billion asset size market. As the smaller end of the banking industry consolidates, we're moving up the asset chains, winning share in the $1 billion to $50 billion market. One such win is SunStream Business Services, a service entity which spans 12 financial institutions and provides business and technology services to farm credit associations, totaling more than $115 billion in assets. SunStream will be converted into DNA and a number of surround solutions. Continuing our strong momentum in the de novo bank market, we signed LCA Financial Services, a newly created -- a newly chartered bank focused on small business. While we continue to win with our digital surround solutions, Abiliti is the new paradigm in digital banking, a single retail and business online and mobile platform. We had our first client go live on the Abiliti platform in the second quarter with more than 100 clients signed up. We are also fully embracing openness as a strategy. The Fiserv Developer Studio is aimed at attracting the developer community to build innovative products using the range of APIs we expose across cards, payments, banking, small, medium and large businesses. Additionally, we are building a pre-integrated fintech app marketplace where our financial institutions clients can acquire, test and deploy third-party apps seamlessly, easily and quickly. This openness strategy creates a net new revenue opportunity within our existing client base while widening the value-added services opportunity. With that, let me update you on our integration efforts. Through the second quarter, we've already actioned over $1.1 billion of cost savings and are well on our way to completing our $1.2 billion cost synergy objective by the end of this year. With the majority of the integration work behind us, we are focused on driving further growth and sustainable value in the years ahead. On the revenue side, we're pleased with the level of synergy sales, which accelerated in the second quarter. As of the end of the second quarter, we've already actioned $325 million in annual revenue synergies, and our synergy sales pipeline is growing robustly and we expect to meet or exceed our $600 million target over the 5 years post merger. Revenue synergies in the quarter were driven by payments, debit network and card sales across our three major client segments FIs, corporates, and government. Additionally, as the partner of choice, we continue to see momentum in our bank merchant program. Now let me pass the discussion to Bob for more detail on our financial results.\nRobert Hau: Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. If you're following along on our slides, I will cover some of the detail on each of our segments, starting with Slide 4. We had a very strong second quarter, thanks to our broad portfolio of products and services as well as the positioning of our assets and strong execution across the business. Total company internal revenue growth was 18% in the quarter, with growth across all segments and led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 41%. Year-to-date, total company internal revenue grew 11%, also led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 23%. Second quarter adjusted operating income was up a strong 41% to $1.3 billion, and adjusted operating margin increased by a very strong 510 basis points to 33.9%. This margin improvement was driven by our outstanding revenue results and our continued and disciplined cost synergy execution, which produced $90 million of incremental cost synergies during the quarter as well as strong operating performance. First half adjusted operating income increased 28% to $2.4 billion. Adjusted operating margin through the end of June expanded 440 basis points to 32.7%. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 47% to $1.37 compared to $0.93 in the prior year. Through June 30, adjusted earnings per share increased 32% to $2.54, putting us on a pace to achieve our 36th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings-per-share growth, a testament to the incredible resiliency of this company. Free cash flow in the quarter of $897 million was in line with last year, with free cash flow for the first 6 months of the year up 4% to $1.72 billion. Free cash flow conversion was 97% to adjusted net income, including a $172 million impact from reduced net operating loss carryforwards. Year-to-date, free cash flow conversion came in at 100% and we continue to expect at least 108% free cash flow conversion for 2021. Now looking at our segment results. Internal revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was a stellar 41% in the quarter and 23% year-to-date. Our results were driven by a strong performance of our SMB platform, Clover; our enterprise platform, Carat; and our ISV platform, Clover Connect. These results were driven by a strong global performance despite uneven economic recovery outside North America. The second quarter was a record quarter for Clover. In addition to a very strong 96% annualized GPV growth, this quarter was also the highest shipment volume for Clover hardware, having recently shipped our 2 millionth Clover device. Moving to Carat. We won 52 new global enterprise e-commerce clients on a platform in the quarter. Including existing clients, Carat won or expanded business with brands such as SportTrade, ALDI, and Yapstone. In India, Carat won the business of a leading digital food delivery platform. Our ISV volume in the quarter through Clover Connect grew 122% year-over-year. And we're winning both ISVs that are new to the payments as well as competitive takeaways. Adjusted operating income in the Acceptance segment increased 135% to $524 million in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was up more than 12 full percentage points to 31.4%, driven by the strength in the top line. Through June 30, adjusted operating income improved 80% to $911 million and adjusted operating margin grew 950 basis points to 29.7%. The Payments and Network segment posted internal revenue growth of 7% in this quarter, resulting in year-to-date growth of 4%. Debit transactions grew a strong 31% in the quarter and this was a low double-digit sequential grower versus last quarter. We continue to build upon the strong momentum of transaction growth in account-to-account transfers and P2P solutions. Versus prior year, Zelle transactions in the quarter were up 94% and the number of clients live on Zelle was up 88% in the quarter. Our bill pay business saw a sequential improvement in growth from Q1 and is expected to continue to improve through the second half of this year. We continue to expect to see the full year internal revenue growth for the Payments and Network segment to be toward the upper end of the medium-term growth rate of 5% to 8%. Adjusted operating income for the segment was up 14% to $636 million, and adjusted operating margin was up 260 basis points to 44.6% in the quarter. Year-to-date, adjusted operating income was up 8% to $1.2 billion and adjusted operating margin was up 140 basis points to 43%. The results were driven by positive momentum in our issuer business and the impact of revenue and cost synergies. The Financial Technology segment internal revenue grew in line with expectations at 5% in the second quarter as continued growth in high-quality recurring revenue was partially offset by lower periodic revenue, which created an 80 basis points of headwind to internal revenue growth. For the first half of the year, internal revenue growth for the Financial Technology segment is now 4%, reaching the lower end of our medium-term outlook for the segment of 4% to 6%. Demand for our digital banking capabilities and for our deep offering of digital solutions continues to build momentum. As Frank mentioned, we added 10 new core account processing clients in the quarter. Total mobile subscribers across our leading digital platforms, Mobiliti and Architect, grew 9% in the quarter. Mobile deposits in Q2 grew 12% over the prior year, while self-service ATM deposits grew 70% over last year. Adjusted operating income was up a strong 8% in the quarter to $273 million and up 14% year-to-date to $519 million. Adjusted operating margin in this segment increased a robust 80 basis points in the quarter to 36.2% and 300 basis points to 34.9% through the end of June, due to a combination of revenue growth, operational effectiveness benefits, and cost synergies. The adjusted corporate operating loss was $124 million in the quarter, in line with our expectations, up from last year largely on higher variable compensation expenses. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 21.3%, increasing 80 basis points versus prior year. We also expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate will be fairly consistent with 2020 rate and at the lower end of our previously forecasted range of 21% to 22%. During the quarter, we continued our disciplined capital allocation strategy by repurchasing 5 million shares for $588 million, and we have more than 55 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase. We completed two acquisitions in the quarter, SpendLabs, a mobile native cloud-based commercial card payments and software company; and Pineapple Payments, a leading independent sales organization focused on integrated payments. Additionally, we divested our remaining interest in the Investment Services business and received pre-tax proceeds of $460 million from the transaction. Total debt outstanding was $20.8 billion on June 30, and the debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio decreased to 3.3 times, putting us well on track to achieve our targeted leverage of less than 3 times by the end of this year. We are fully committed to our long-standing capital allocation strategy, which includes maintaining a strong balance sheet, making organic investments in innovative solutions and pursuing high-value acquisitions. Importantly, share repurchase remains our benchmark for capital deployment. With that, let me turn the call back to Frank.\nFrank J Bisignano: Thanks, Bob. I'm very proud of the results we've delivered. The quality of our assets, our relentless focus on innovation, our agility, speed of new client implementation with examples like CAXIA, ADS, Atlanticus and Genesis put us in a great spot to serve our clients. Our speed to market with the enhanced Fiserv digital capabilities for banking and card management announced yesterday along with the integration of business expense management into the Clover platform, all of which leverage the full capabilities of recent acquisitions, Ondot and SpendLabs, add to our continued success. In addition to delivering on our financial results, we continue to focus on our people and on our communities. Earlier this month, Fiserv was named by Forbes as the Best Employer for Diversity, recognizing our commitment to putting diversity at the forefront of our values and having implemented long-term initiatives to create a more inclusive environment. During the quarter, we published our first annual corporate social responsibility report, which is available on the Corporate Social Responsibility section of our website. We also expanded our back-to-business grant program beyond the original locations that were selected in 2020. In May, we partnered with the New York Mets to recognize small businesses as part of our Asian, American and Pacific Islander Heritage month. And in June, we awarded grants to businesses in Tulsa as part of the centennial observation of the Tulsa Race Massacre. None of these achievements would have been possible without our world-class talent. I thank our more than 40,000 associates around the world for their commitment and courage as we stand together to deliver value for clients, our colleagues and you, our shareholders. And finally before I close, I want to congratulate the Milwaukee Bucks for winning the NBA championship at Fiserv Forum last week. The Bucks are terrific partners, and our partnership goes way beyond putting our name on their arena. Clover has been deployed throughout Fiserv Forum for food and beverage concessions, providing attendees with seamless, quick and easy transactions. They also partnered with us for several back-to-business events earlier this year. Congratulations to the entire Milwaukee Bucks organization. With that, operator, let's open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nLisa Ellis: Hi, good morning. Thanks, guys. Good to hear from you. I wanted to follow up on the two-year CAGR call out for the Merchant Acceptance segment. I believe you said it's running now at a 13% internal revenue growth on a two-year CAGR basis. One, wanted to just confirm that number. And then two, I wanted to kind of just drill into it a little bit, given that that's above your medium-term outlook for that segment, which as per Investor Day was 9% to 12%. Can you just highlight like what you're seeing, say, in North America versus ex-US? And are there any unusual dynamics in this quarter or do you see that sustainable going forward? And kind of what's different about the business now than prior to the pandemic when I believe it was running close to about 10%? Thank you.\nFrank J Bisignano: Well, I think it starts with the US has been the strong spot in the recovery right now. You heard us talk about unevenness outside the US. But I do think you saw a robust even last July when it all began coming back. I do think you've got to focus on the three legs in the US and internationally. The three legs are Clover, Carat and Clover Connect, right? And all of those were continued investments, continued build out and we're seeing it show up in the clients' office. So I would say, it's really driven by US. When you see that we say US and international for the quarter performed fundamentally evenly, that was a spotty evenness, meaning not every country was the same and you could kind of map to where recoveries happened or not. So I think it's all about our platform strategy and our client strategy that's driving the outcomes. And I think our teams galvanized very well around it.\nRobert Hau: And Lisa, just to hit the first part of that question, the 13% is an average growth rate. If you look at Q2 of last year, it was actually down 15% over the prior year. We're now up 41% over 2020. So the average 13% there.\nLisa Ellis: Terrific. Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of David Koning from Baird. Please go ahead.\nDavid Koning: Maybe my first question, just on the Merchant segment momentum, I guess a little bit like what Lisa was asking about, I went back several years and the second half usually has quarters that look a lot like Q2. So usually Q3 and Q4 look a lot like Q2. But the question, I guess is, is the momentum building? You mentioned international still has room to improve. US momentum seems kind of off the charts, BAMS actually grew faster year-over-year than your core merchant business for the first time probably in many, many years. So are we in a momentum situation that Q3 and Q4 could actually be better than Q2 this year compared to when normally it's the same?\nFrank J Bisignano: I think the answer to that is yes. There is concern in the world. Right? So that's a little bit in how we think about it when we talk to about what we're doing. So there is a degree of us saying, the world's not out of the woods yet, although I think they've learned how to grow with this. So it's highly possible what you're saying could happen. We're driving the business to get the results we're getting. You see all the partnerships we're aligning to, to bring more. So, yeah, I'd say it's possible. But the world has spottiness right now too.\nDavid Koning: Yeah, that's great. And I guess, secondly, just as a follow-up, the past, I guess, handful of quarters at different times KKR has sold -- they're down to a much smaller position they were a year or two ago. But on the heels of now a really good quarter, what do you think their thoughts are about selling now?\nFrank J Bisignano: I'd start off with, first and foremost, I do not anticipate them conducting additional secondary offerings. Their holdings are just under 10% now. And they have told us they intend to sell shares on the open market over time in a routine and pragmatic way going forward. So I don't think we're going to see another secondary.\nDavid Koning: Sounds great. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Next we'll go to Timothy Chiodo from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nTimothy Chiodo: Thanks a lot. Thank you for taking the question. So over the last year or so, we've seen a few merchant acquirers become public. They have pretty fast growth in some more niche verticals. So online gambling, regulated financial services. Clearly, the First Data Fiserv merchant acquiring business is extremely well diversified and has a much, much larger scale, meaning that any one vertical can be overly meaningful, but maybe you could just touch on your approach to participation in those types of verticals, the extent to which you either are or will, how much it could help your business, what are the pros, cons, etc.? Thanks a lot.\nFrank J Bisignano: Well, I think we're in every vertical. When we talk about grocer, QSR, retail but we're in gaming, we're across the board. You don't have a business of this size and scale that isn't serving all markets. And when you look at our capability, we do a good job of bringing base capability, and then segmenting to what verticals specifically need. So I think we are completely deployed against -- and we're deployed against growth, I mean, we're deployed against growth. Where we invest is where we believe the growthier segments are.\nRobert Hau: Tim, I think one of the keys for our growth and, quite frankly, how we work through the pandemic and continue to grow the business meaningfully is we're very well diversified in terms of the way we go to market, whether that's our direct channel, through our bank partners, through our non-financial institution partners, joint ventures, etc., but also extremely well diversified across verticals and participate essentially in all of them, and have offerings that get us revenue growth across a very wide spectrum.\nTimothy Chiodo: All right. Excellent. Thank you so much. Really appreciate that. As a minor follow-up, was there any comment you could give on the assessments' timing on the contra revenue, any impact in Q2 given the difference in quarter-over-quarter growth, Q1 to Q2, some of those impacts that we saw last year?\nRobert Hau: Yeah. You recall, we had a pretty significant impact in Q2 of last year, a negative impact in Q2 that rebounded in the second half of last year. We're seeing the opposite now as we saw a big rebound in second quarter of this year. We do have a tailwind that will be muted a bit in the second half of the year. We don't have quite the same snapback in the second half as we did in the second half of last year. So, call it, roughly, of the 12 full points of margin improvement we saw this year over Q2 of last year, about 4 points of that was the brand assessment fees. And then that will be a bit of a headwind for us in the second half of the year. But we certainly see margin expansion continuing into the second half.\nTimothy Chiodo: Perfect. That's really helpful. Thank you so much both of you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next we'll go to the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJames Faucette: Thanks a lot. And really appreciate your comments this morning. I know Bob talked a little bit about capital allocation. But I'm wondering if you can just help us think about how priorities or at least the way that you allocate may be changing, if at all, especially given kind of what's happening from the perspective of your stock is a little cheaper now, and so maybe that speaks to wanting to do buybacks. On the other hand, we're kind of continuing to see massive flows of capital into competitors, both through the private and public markets and the like. So just wondering if there's any evolution there on your thinking of how to prioritize use of capital going forward?\nFrank J Bisignano: I'd start with three[Phonetic] on leverage, that will be well behind us. And we did talk about Investor Day, $30 billion of free cash. And so I think you also see us continuing the strategy of taking Silicon Valley digital expertise and capability, integrate it into our company and fundamentally creating experiences that nobody in peer group can do. You saw it with Clover back in the day. And when I talked about Ondot, I did say that the acquisition of Ondot and then subsequently SpendLabs, but Ondot specifically, would bring a Clover-like effect to our company. And the fact that -- so you'll see us deploy capital to those type of acquisitions. But I want to bring clarity to what I mean in a Clover type. We've created a single instance for consumers to be able to get every banking product they have and have card functionality that surpasses the industry by a lot. So we have tremendous -- everything from digital issuance to the ability to put it in the wallet. I think you've got to really think about what we're doing there. And then we will invest in these products quite heavily. Right? So I think you'll see us continue to do those type of acquisitions that drive the digital presence, but we've done things unparalleled through those acquisitions. So we talked about $30 billion. You see the properties we bought. You see us integrating those properties, integrating for growth. And I think you'll see us unique, always though using buyback as a benchmark.\nRobert Hau: James, I think this quarter is perhaps a prototypical example, this digital enhancement, this digital innovation that Frank talked about in his prepared remarks and just referenced is a combination of investing in our business organically, internal investment, advancing our digital banking capability with Mobiliti, bringing more feature function capability to our mobile capability, adding to that inorganic investment the acquisitions of SpendLabs and Ondot in a quarter that we also repurchased 5 million shares. So the $30 billion of capital available we have this year and for the next four or five years allows us to buy back shares, making organic investment in M&A and develop internal products and internal innovation and generate very high return.\nJames Faucette: That's great color. Thank you very much to both of you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next we'll go to Dan Dolev from Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nDan Dolev: Hey, guys, good morning. Great results. So did I hear that correctly you said that this quarter was a record shipment quarter for Clover?\nFrank J Bisignano: That's correct.\nDan Dolev: And so it sounds like it's more idiosyncratic share gains than anything market or reopening related. Maybe can you comment a little bit on who you're gaining share from, maybe specific verticals? And then maybe kind of the trajectory, you went from 36% in Q1 to 96% in Q2. How should we think about the remainder of the year? Thank you.\nFrank J Bisignano: Well, why don't I start off with a look at -- I think Clover is a platform of choice and Clover is a partner platform of choice. And we did talk about that Clover would get other distribution channels, and that distribution could be our own outside the US. It could be with our ISV partners. And then just in our base core business, our own, I mean, your question of share, when you're as big as we are, we're competing with everybody and we feel that Clover is at the top of the list of what people want as a product. So I think it is about the differentiated product and the capability that gets it the type of numbers you saw in this quarter.\nRobert Hau: And then, Dan, just to add, the 96% growth year-over-year, remember this is the quarter that's comparing to the second quarter of last year, which was obviously a very difficult year across the board. But I think the pertinent number here is a 38% CAGR over the last two years. So, obviously, Clover growing incredibly well, continue to expect that to be a lift and a share gainer for us as we lead with Clover in the marketplace. We're seeing benefits of continued innovation, continued investments in Clover as new business formation kicks in post-pandemic, as merchants that were not transacting at all or very much come back. Our investments in Clover Dining, etc. pay off when the economy recovers, people think of Clover and allow us to serve them with Clover devices, hitting our record shipment as well as giving us that nice lift in overall GPV.\nDan Dolev: Yes, great. I agree, it's definitely everywhere, Great stuff. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next we have Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nDarrin Peller: Thanks, guys. Let me just shift to the fintech segment for a minute, which for several quarters was really in the 3% to 4% range and did show the acceleration to that 5%. You guys have talked about it being something that can do 4% to 6% growth. And we're seeing some signs of improvement now. You talked a lot about digital bank in your release also. And so I'm curious from a structural standpoint, given all the new competition out there, if you could touch on the assets you have and your capabilities and, in your view, confidence level around that segment actually being in that 4% to 6% or better versus low single-digit over time, that'd be great. Thanks.\nFrank J Bisignano: Well, you see a number of things going on our FinTech segment, but let me bring -- I want to bring complete clarity on the digital offering because I think it affects both core and our digital business. And ultimately, what we have a deep belief is that we're here to help our clients serve their clients. So the ability to take 2,100 Mobiliti banks and bring them a fully integrated card experience at the highest level of card via the Ondot and bring that in a way that -- maybe the simple way to think about it is everything you can imagine in one application that allows you to do everything from originate transactions to digital card issuance to digital card view to card free cash, all in the same place that you're doing your bill pay and you're doing your Zelle transactions. So we're going to take 2,100 Mobiliti clients, 1,300 CardValet and bring that to them. And then that will be what we -- and those are financial institutions, we believe that will also help our clients increase their digital adoption quotient with their clients. So we see this as a game changer. So it's early innings. We got banks up and running on it. And we will deploy. And then you hear us talking about, on top of all that for financial institutions, we bring in Abiliti that sits on top of all of it. But the most important thing to think about is our cores are strategic. The front end, though, is where we believe the tip of the spear and where we win to help our clients serve their clients. And you saw what we posted now, but I look forward to continuing to generate more revenue through better function we bring to clients that allow them to do more with their clients. And then, you've got an integration of a SpendLabs into Clover, which allows -- these are our digital platforms. We're talking about digital platforms, one-of-a-kind digital platform. And I think what you should take away, there's an element of this company that's digitally agile and can deliver, and you saw it on those credit conversions. I think those are good track rated speeds for those size and scope. CAIXA is unparalleled. 70 days from signing, we're boarding merchants for them every day. And then you look at us taking SpendLabs and Ondot and I think we're going to have that same effect that Clover had when we look years out from now.\nRobert Hau: Going back to the -- sorry, go ahead.\nDarrin Peller: No, no, Bob, go ahead, please.\nRobert Hau: I was just going to bring you it back to the 5% growth. Obviously, we had a good quarter, hitting 5%. We indicated that periodic revenue headwind would abate. I think it was 150 basis points. Last quarter, we said we expected this quarter to be half that. We saw 80 basis points into the second half of the year. We see that no longer being a headwind. And through the first half of the year, we're now at 4%. So we reached the bottom end of that medium-term guidance and continue to be quite comfortable that we will be in that 4% to 6% range this year. And the things that Frank's talked about, the investments we're making in digital banking gives us an opportunity to continue to see that good mid-single digit growth going forward.\nDarrin Peller: Okay. Great. Hey, Frank, just quick follow-up on M&A. What are your thoughts on doing more tuck-ins that keep improving the tech stack and really thinking about maybe even just accretive to revenue growth, maybe even dilutive to EPS just type deals, just really add to the long-term growth strategy? Thanks, guys.\nFrank J Bisignano: Well, I feel -- obviously, you've watched over time the type of properties we buy. Our ISV strategy was born out of acquisition. Now it's a winning strategy. Clover was born out of acquisition. And I think you'd have to argue that's a bigger than winning strategy. You'll watch these assets, Ondot and SpendLabs, so I think you're just going to continue. I don't think it needs to be dilutive to EPS. I think we know how to make it accretive pretty darn quick. And what I just talked about was kind of the dream of the acquisition when we put the companies together, that we could take an asset like an Ondot and spread it all the way through because of what a great bank partner we were, and that we could bring it all the way from merchant to our fintech. So I think you should expect us to continue to do more like that. And I think we have a skill at it that we keep the talent, we grow the talent, and we build a bigger digital gene pool in the process.\nDarrin Peller: Great. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJason Kupferberg: Can you comment just on any July trends in the Acceptance segment? Any impacts from the Delta variant? And then also just on the revenue yield dynamics, I know those were positive in the second quarter in Acceptance, how should we think about that for Q3? Will volumes and revenues be a little bit more in sync?\nRobert Hau: Yes. So in terms of July trends in our Merchant segment, I'd say, obviously, through what 26 days or so, we have information yesterday, day before, slightly better than June. So continued improvement in growth. And I'm talking about versus 2019. When you do a 2020 compare, you get some real odd variations on the comparison points. So we're looking at versus prior year as well as versus 2019. But slight improvement in July versus what we saw in June, consistent with what we've got loaded in our full-year outlook with that growth rate and EPS growth. Call it mid-20%, 25%, 26% merchant growth, volume growth over 2019. In terms of yield, you saw a recovery, so to speak, in Q2 versus what we saw in Q1 as our SMB portfolio continues to grow nicely. I think that's going to be consistent in the second half of the year.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay. So, we should expect those positive yield dynamics to continue. I just wanted to switch over to the Payments segment for a minute. I know you're reiterating the higher end of the 5% to 8% target range. And I think you probably have to do 10%, 11% in the second half to get there. I know you've got some new portfolios ramping up, but just talk about the visibility on that acceleration relative to where you were in the first half.\nFrank J Bisignano: I think you see the credit momentum and you see us talking about that we'll have good second half revenue from that. You see, in general -- that's on the wins, and then, you see general credit momentum beginning in our portfolio. Debit networks, I've talked about the strength of them and we feel very, very strongly about what's going on there in debit transaction growth. So when you put all those in the calculation, you saw us go from 2% to 7%, and you should expect us to continue our trajectory north.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay. Good stuff. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi guys. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I wanted to ask about your payment mix in the Acceptance segment sort of in a post-pandemic environment. I know we're maybe not 100% there yet. But when you think about digital versus offline, debit versus credit, SMB versus enterprise, do you expect kind of a different mix in your business after the pandemic and how does that feed into your kind of longer-term growth algorithm?\nRobert Hau: Ramsey, I think we certainly have seen a broad movement to digital everything. That's why you hear his talk about the investments we're making in mobile capability and integrating our digital banking and card management experience. More and more digital transactions, e-commerce, etc. is certainly -- I believe the pandemic brought forward multiple periods of transition into that space. And I do think it was not transitory. Those changes are here to stay. And we'll see, as people return to whatever normal is going to be, what that continued transition growth rate happens, but, obviously, we're seeing great growth in Zelle. We're seeing more and more transactions on account to account transfers and good e-com volume, you heard us talk about in our merchant space, up 21%. So getting mobile first capability and digital experiences was a focus of ours over the last several quarters, and we're bringing a number of that into a single instance right now and continue to see that integration going forward.\nRamsey El-Assal: Great. Let me squeeze one quick last one in here, which is, do you see the Feds revisiting the Durbin routing rule as kind of opening up a market opportunity for STAR and Accel?\nFrank J Bisignano: Yes.\nRamsey El-Assal: Short and sweet.\nRobert Hau: Obviously, Ramsey, it remains to be seen the timing and when that will happen, but does look to be a real opportunity for us.\nFrank J Bisignano: Yeah. I think the thing is, our capabilities around fraud and chargeback management and our capabilities to serve the biggest issuers is very deep. And I think that many times having a third network is very valuable to everybody, both merchants and issuers, and so -- and STAR and Accel, we've invested heavily in them. And that's why we get the type of transaction growth you're seeing there. So, we really, really love our debit networks.\nRamsey El-Assal: Great. Fantastic. Thanks.\nFrank J Bisignano: So thank you for joining us this morning. We appreciate your support. If you have further questions, please don't hesitate to contact our Investor Relations team. Stay safe and have a great day.\nOperator: [Operator Closing Remarks]",

            "name": "Robert Hau",
            "content": "Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. If you're following along on our slides, I will cover some of the detail on each of our segments, starting with Slide 4. We had a very strong second quarter, thanks to our broad portfolio of products and services as well as the positioning of our assets and strong execution across the business. Total company internal revenue growth was 18% in the quarter, with growth across all segments and led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 41%. Year-to-date, total company internal revenue grew 11%, also led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 23%. Second quarter adjusted operating income was up a strong 41% to $1.3 billion, and adjusted operating margin increased by a very strong 510 basis points to 33.9%. This margin improvement was driven by our outstanding revenue results and our continued and disciplined cost synergy execution, which produced $90 million of incremental cost synergies during the quarter as well as strong operating performance. First half adjusted operating income increased 28% to $2.4 billion. Adjusted operating margin through the end of June expanded 440 basis points to 32.7%. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 47% to $1.37 compared to $0.93 in the prior year. Through June 30, adjusted earnings per share increased 32% to $2.54, putting us on a pace to achieve our 36th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings-per-share growth, a testament to the incredible resiliency of this company. Free cash flow in the quarter of $897 million was in line with last year, with free cash flow for the first 6 months of the year up 4% to $1.72 billion. Free cash flow conversion was 97% to adjusted net income, including a $172 million impact from reduced net operating loss carryforwards. Year-to-date, free cash flow conversion came in at 100% and we continue to expect at least 108% free cash flow conversion for 2021. Now looking at our segment results. Internal revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was a stellar 41% in the quarter and 23% year-to-date. Our results were driven by a strong performance of our SMB platform, Clover; our enterprise platform, Carat; and our ISV platform, Clover Connect. These results were driven by a strong global performance despite uneven economic recovery outside North America. The second quarter was a record quarter for Clover. In addition to a very strong 96% annualized GPV growth, this quarter was also the highest shipment volume for Clover hardware, having recently shipped our 2 millionth Clover device. Moving to Carat. We won 52 new global enterprise e-commerce clients on a platform in the quarter. Including existing clients, Carat won or expanded business with brands such as SportTrade, ALDI, and Yapstone. In India, Carat won the business of a leading digital food delivery platform. Our ISV volume in the quarter through Clover Connect grew 122% year-over-year. And we're winning both ISVs that are new to the payments as well as competitive takeaways. Adjusted operating income in the Acceptance segment increased 135% to $524 million in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was up more than 12 full percentage points to 31.4%, driven by the strength in the top line. Through June 30, adjusted operating income improved 80% to $911 million and adjusted operating margin grew 950 basis points to 29.7%. The Payments and Network segment posted internal revenue growth of 7% in this quarter, resulting in year-to-date growth of 4%. Debit transactions grew a strong 31% in the quarter and this was a low double-digit sequential grower versus last quarter. We continue to build upon the strong momentum of transaction growth in account-to-account transfers and P2P solutions. Versus prior year, Zelle transactions in the quarter were up 94% and the number of clients live on Zelle was up 88% in the quarter. Our bill pay business saw a sequential improvement in growth from Q1 and is expected to continue to improve through the second half of this year. We continue to expect to see the full year internal revenue growth for the Payments and Network segment to be toward the upper end of the medium-term growth rate of 5% to 8%. Adjusted operating income for the segment was up 14% to $636 million, and adjusted operating margin was up 260 basis points to 44.6% in the quarter. Year-to-date, adjusted operating income was up 8% to $1.2 billion and adjusted operating margin was up 140 basis points to 43%. The results were driven by positive momentum in our issuer business and the impact of revenue and cost synergies. The Financial Technology segment internal revenue grew in line with expectations at 5% in the second quarter as continued growth in high-quality recurring revenue was partially offset by lower periodic revenue, which created an 80 basis points of headwind to internal revenue growth. For the first half of the year, internal revenue growth for the Financial Technology segment is now 4%, reaching the lower end of our medium-term outlook for the segment of 4% to 6%. Demand for our digital banking capabilities and for our deep offering of digital solutions continues to build momentum. As Frank mentioned, we added 10 new core account processing clients in the quarter. Total mobile subscribers across our leading digital platforms, Mobiliti and Architect, grew 9% in the quarter. Mobile deposits in Q2 grew 12% over the prior year, while self-service ATM deposits grew 70% over last year. Adjusted operating income was up a strong 8% in the quarter to $273 million and up 14% year-to-date to $519 million. Adjusted operating margin in this segment increased a robust 80 basis points in the quarter to 36.2% and 300 basis points to 34.9% through the end of June, due to a combination of revenue growth, operational effectiveness benefits, and cost synergies. The adjusted corporate operating loss was $124 million in the quarter, in line with our expectations, up from last year largely on higher variable compensation expenses. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 21.3%, increasing 80 basis points versus prior year. We also expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate will be fairly consistent with 2020 rate and at the lower end of our previously forecasted range of 21% to 22%. During the quarter, we continued our disciplined capital allocation strategy by repurchasing 5 million shares for $588 million, and we have more than 55 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase. We completed two acquisitions in the quarter, SpendLabs, a mobile native cloud-based commercial card payments and software company; and Pineapple Payments, a leading independent sales organization focused on integrated payments. Additionally, we divested our remaining interest in the Investment Services business and received pre-tax proceeds of $460 million from the transaction. Total debt outstanding was $20.8 billion on June 30, and the debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio decreased to 3.3 times, putting us well on track to achieve our targeted leverage of less than 3 times by the end of this year. We are fully committed to our long-standing capital allocation strategy, which includes maintaining a strong balance sheet, making organic investments in innovative solutions and pursuing high-value acquisitions. Importantly, share repurchase remains our benchmark for capital deployment. With that, let me turn the call back to Frank. And Lisa, just to hit the first part of that question, the 13% is an average growth rate. If you look at Q2 of last year, it was actually down 15% over the prior year. We're now up 41% over 2020. So the average 13% there. Tim, I think one of the keys for our growth and, quite frankly, how we work through the pandemic and continue to grow the business meaningfully is we're very well diversified in terms of the way we go to market, whether that's our direct channel, through our bank partners, through our non-financial institution partners, joint ventures, etc., but also extremely well diversified across verticals and participate essentially in all of them, and have offerings that get us revenue growth across a very wide spectrum. Yeah. You recall, we had a pretty significant impact in Q2 of last year, a negative impact in Q2 that rebounded in the second half of last year. We're seeing the opposite now as we saw a big rebound in second quarter of this year. We do have a tailwind that will be muted a bit in the second half of the year. We don't have quite the same snapback in the second half as we did in the second half of last year. So, call it, roughly, of the 12 full points of margin improvement we saw this year over Q2 of last year, about 4 points of that was the brand assessment fees. And then that will be a bit of a headwind for us in the second half of the year. But we certainly see margin expansion continuing into the second half. James, I think this quarter is perhaps a prototypical example, this digital enhancement, this digital innovation that Frank talked about in his prepared remarks and just referenced is a combination of investing in our business organically, internal investment, advancing our digital banking capability with Mobiliti, bringing more feature function capability to our mobile capability, adding to that inorganic investment the acquisitions of SpendLabs and Ondot in a quarter that we also repurchased 5 million shares. So the $30 billion of capital available we have this year and for the next four or five years allows us to buy back shares, making organic investment in M&A and develop internal products and internal innovation and generate very high return. And then, Dan, just to add, the 96% growth year-over-year, remember this is the quarter that's comparing to the second quarter of last year, which was obviously a very difficult year across the board. But I think the pertinent number here is a 38% CAGR over the last two years. So, obviously, Clover growing incredibly well, continue to expect that to be a lift and a share gainer for us as we lead with Clover in the marketplace. We're seeing benefits of continued innovation, continued investments in Clover as new business formation kicks in post-pandemic, as merchants that were not transacting at all or very much come back. Our investments in Clover Dining, etc. pay off when the economy recovers, people think of Clover and allow us to serve them with Clover devices, hitting our record shipment as well as giving us that nice lift in overall GPV. Going back to the -- sorry, go ahead. I was just going to bring you it back to the 5% growth. Obviously, we had a good quarter, hitting 5%. We indicated that periodic revenue headwind would abate. I think it was 150 basis points. Last quarter, we said we expected this quarter to be half that. We saw 80 basis points into the second half of the year. We see that no longer being a headwind. And through the first half of the year, we're now at 4%. So we reached the bottom end of that medium-term guidance and continue to be quite comfortable that we will be in that 4% to 6% range this year. And the things that Frank's talked about, the investments we're making in digital banking gives us an opportunity to continue to see that good mid-single digit growth going forward. Yes. So in terms of July trends in our Merchant segment, I'd say, obviously, through what 26 days or so, we have information yesterday, day before, slightly better than June. So continued improvement in growth. And I'm talking about versus 2019. When you do a 2020 compare, you get some real odd variations on the comparison points. So we're looking at versus prior year as well as versus 2019. But slight improvement in July versus what we saw in June, consistent with what we've got loaded in our full-year outlook with that growth rate and EPS growth. Call it mid-20%, 25%, 26% merchant growth, volume growth over 2019. In terms of yield, you saw a recovery, so to speak, in Q2 versus what we saw in Q1 as our SMB portfolio continues to grow nicely. I think that's going to be consistent in the second half of the year. Ramsey, I think we certainly have seen a broad movement to digital everything. That's why you hear his talk about the investments we're making in mobile capability and integrating our digital banking and card management experience. More and more digital transactions, e-commerce, etc. is certainly -- I believe the pandemic brought forward multiple periods of transition into that space. And I do think it was not transitory. Those changes are here to stay. And we'll see, as people return to whatever normal is going to be, what that continued transition growth rate happens, but, obviously, we're seeing great growth in Zelle. We're seeing more and more transactions on account to account transfers and good e-com volume, you heard us talk about in our merchant space, up 21%. So getting mobile first capability and digital experiences was a focus of ours over the last several quarters, and we're bringing a number of that into a single instance right now and continue to see that integration going forward. Obviously, Ramsey, it remains to be seen the timing and when that will happen, but does look to be a real opportunity for us."

            "name": "Frank J Bisignano",
            "content": "Thank you, Shub. Second quarter was a very strong quarter for us across the company. Total company adjusted revenue grew 20%. Adjusted operating margin grew 510 basis points, resulting in adjusted operating income growth of 41%. Adjusted EPS grew 47% to $1.37. Free cash flow in the quarter was in line with last year, just under $900 million, including the impact of a diminished NOL. Second quarter sales were up 31% with growth across the business. Our strong second quarter was driven by a combination of continued economic recovery and strong execution of our business strategy. On the macroeconomic side, we saw continued recovery in the US with uneven recovery in other parts of the world. The shift to digital commerce drove consumer demand for seamless experiences across channels. Amidst these trends, we executed on our strategies to continue to win business and grow share. We serve as the operating system for commerce across our client base, ranging from micro merchants to the world's largest corporations, financial institutions, banks and credit unions, fintechs and governments. This enables us to focus not only on growth at our core but also on new services, business models and adjacencies. Given the strong results to date and our solid pipeline, we are raising our outlook range for internal revenue growth and now expect 10% to 12% growth for 2021 from 9% to 12% previously. Additionally, we are raising our adjusted EPS full year outlook and now expect a range of $5.50 to $5.60, up from $5.35 to $5.50 previously. The increased adjusted EPS guidance outlook represents a 24% to 27% growth versus last year. Drilling down to the business segments, the quarter was led by our Merchant Acceptance segment, which posted internal revenue growth of 41% year-over-year. Normalizing for the year-ago comps, the segment posted a 13% growth in the quarter on a 2-year basis above our pre-pandemic run rate. Both North America and international largely grew in line with the segment average. North America purchase volume was up 33% in the quarter led by strength in retail, petro and restaurants. One of the trends that the pandemic has accelerated is the shift to omni-commerce. Consumers are increasingly looking to engage with merchants in whatever way is most convenient. Fiserv's ability to support clients with leading solutions in both brick-and-mortar and e-commerce environments is a differentiator. We saw the manifestation of this trend during the second quarter as offline commerce recovered with volumes growing 46% versus 2020 and 11% versus 2019. Online commerce volume also grew unabated at 21% year-over-year, highlighting the criticality of equipping merchants with omnichannel commerce capabilities. Our lead in omni commerce is the reason we were honored with the omni channel provider of the Year Award from The Strawhecker Group, a leading payments industry analyst firm. As you know, Clover, Carat and Clover Connect are Fiserv's leading platforms for small and medium-sized merchants, enterprises, and ISVs respectively. Starting with Clover, GPV in the quarter grew 96% year-over-year, reflecting a 38% CAGR since 2019 to $184 billion on an annualized basis. In the SMB space, we continue to build out vertical specific solutions in retail, restaurants and services. Our vertical sector strategy aims at expanding beyond the buy button offering an integrated suite of products that help merchants generate revenue and run their business. Value-added services on the Clover platform include Clover Capital, Clover Dining, Clover Order Ahead and Clover Inventory as well as our unique app marketplace, which provides access to services such as payroll management, loyalty, and marketing that enable us to increase our share of the merchant's wallet and become the platform of choice. On the enterprise side, Carat, our enterprise omnichannel ecosystem, continued its strong momentum in the second quarter with new wins and continued innovation in key verticals. In restaurants, Carat powers digital commerce for 10 of the Top 15 QSRs. Carat has helped Burger King expand its mobile payments experience into Latin America; in restaurant brands international expansion in the UK and other parts of EMEA. In grocery, where Carat now serves 9 of the Top 10 grocers, we have helped new clients such as Wakefern, ALDI, and the companies of Ahold Delhaize USA, expand their digital grocery ordering capabilities with new payment types. Evidence to Carat's commitment to the grocery industry and transform digital experience is exemplified by Carat's leading online EBT program that has processed $2.5 billion in GPV year-to-date. In retail, where Carat serves 7 of the Top 10 retailers, we're expanding our merchant services by working with clients such as Adidas on innovative solutions, including our new consumer recommendation engine. This engine connects digital experiences to local stores enabled by the integration of Radius8, an acquisition we completed in the first quarter of this year. Carat has also established new at-scale leadership with crypto wallets, where we power cards funds in and funds out solutions. Through this capability, we helped consumers move more than $4 billion in payments volume in and out of wallets for the past 12 months. In the second quarter alone, we moved $2 billion of volume, demonstrating the sharp ramp in digital currency movement. Moving to Clover Connect, our ISV-focused offering, momentum continued in the second quarter with ISV volume up 122% year-over-year. We signed 53 new ISV partners in the quarter, bringing the new ISV partnerships to 95 year-to-date. We're signing up ISVs that are new to payments and those that are converting from competitors. Year-to-date, almost half of our wins are competitive takeaways. Our ISV partners derive great value in getting access to our partner management tool, CoPilot and integrating with Clover. On our Investor Day, we talked to you about our merchant acceptance growth strategy for international. We remain focused on growing our global market presence with world-class bank partners and through our direct channels, all while leveraging the strength of common platforms and connections. In the quarter, we announced the JV with Deutsche Bank in Germany that offers us access to over 800,000 merchants, many of whom will power with our Clover platform. In Asia Pacific region, we won a multi-country acquiring processing mandate from Citibank for its new integrated digital commerce offering, Spring by Citi. Early in July, we began onboarding and processing payment transactions as part of the merchant acquiring services agreement signed with Brazil's CaixaBank in April of this year. The onboarding began 70 days after contract signing, once again demonstrating our speed to market. In addition to the successes I mentioned above, in our Merchant Acceptance segment yesterday we announced a strategic relationship with Goldman Sachs to integrate cross-border payment functionality into our B2B accounts receivable and accounts payable solution, SnapPay. As you know, B2B payments is a vast and growing market ripe with opportunity. We believe that in partnership with Goldman Sachs, we can deliver best-in-class B2B payment capabilities, enhancing visibility, operational efficiencies and cost savings for our large and mid-market business clients. Moving to the Payments and Network segment, we posted internal revenue growth of 7% over the second quarter of last year. Positives in the quarter included the continued growth of Zelle, continued strength in debit transaction volume, initial recovery in credit account volumes and international growth with some weakness in bill pay, although results improved sequentially. The differentiated and industry-leading businesses within our Payments and Network portfolio and our agile execution are the key reasons why we continue to win with clients. We are proceeding well with onboarding $120 million of credit issuing wins we told you about on our Investor Day. We completed boarding Atlanticus in Q2 and have completed several stages of migrating both Alliance Data and Genesis Financial to the Optus environment. In less than 12 months, after announcing these three banner wins, we are poised to recognize revenue on all three clients in the third quarter of this year. We continue to grow our relationship with innovative growth-stage fintechs, digital banks and consumer lenders. In June, we signed an agreement with Prosper, a Fintech pioneer and a premier AI-driven consumer lending marketplace for credit card processing services. This space is a growth focus for us. Our revenue with fintech issuance grew over 300% during the first half of this year versus the same period in 2019. On Investor Day, you'll recall that driving best-in-class integrated digital consumer journeys is a key differentiator and imperative for our clients. Experiences are the new currency of loyalty. Customers gravitate toward institutions that could give them a unified, seamless experience across both channels and products. To that end, yesterday we announced enhanced Fiserv digital capabilities for integrated digital banking and card management. This enriched mobile-first suite will enable financial institutions to offer their consumer and business customers a best-in-class digital banking experience that's designed for the way customers expect to engage. To introduce these enhanced capabilities, we rapidly integrated two recent acquisitions, Ondot and SpendLabs. The result is a single unified platform for consumer and small and midsized business cardholders that enables expense and business card management. This offering allows us to deliver a single point of access for all banking products. Our enhanced Fiserv digital capabilities will span all three business segments: in payments through a leading digital cardholder experience; in financial technology, by driving the penetration of our core account processing in digital surrounds; in merchant acceptance, by increasing the uptake of value-added services from integrating SpendLabs with our Clover platform. We expect to see incremental usage, engagement and services revenue on the Fiserv platform as a result. Before I close out the Payments segment, I would like to mention the strong growth we are seeing in our debit networks, STAR and Accel as we are winning new issuers through our ability to support all transaction type, including best-in-class fraud management and chargeback products. Moving to the Financial Technologies segment, the quarter was in line with our expectations, posting internal revenue growth of 5%, including an 80 basis points headwind from periodic revenue. I want to highlight some key achievements in the quarter that reflect our strong market position. We added 10 new core account processing clients in the quarter, including 8 on the DNA platform and 4 in the over $1 billion asset size market. As the smaller end of the banking industry consolidates, we're moving up the asset chains, winning share in the $1 billion to $50 billion market. One such win is SunStream Business Services, a service entity which spans 12 financial institutions and provides business and technology services to farm credit associations, totaling more than $115 billion in assets. SunStream will be converted into DNA and a number of surround solutions. Continuing our strong momentum in the de novo bank market, we signed LCA Financial Services, a newly created -- a newly chartered bank focused on small business. While we continue to win with our digital surround solutions, Abiliti is the new paradigm in digital banking, a single retail and business online and mobile platform. We had our first client go live on the Abiliti platform in the second quarter with more than 100 clients signed up. We are also fully embracing openness as a strategy. The Fiserv Developer Studio is aimed at attracting the developer community to build innovative products using the range of APIs we expose across cards, payments, banking, small, medium and large businesses. Additionally, we are building a pre-integrated fintech app marketplace where our financial institutions clients can acquire, test and deploy third-party apps seamlessly, easily and quickly. This openness strategy creates a net new revenue opportunity within our existing client base while widening the value-added services opportunity. With that, let me update you on our integration efforts. Through the second quarter, we've already actioned over $1.1 billion of cost savings and are well on our way to completing our $1.2 billion cost synergy objective by the end of this year. With the majority of the integration work behind us, we are focused on driving further growth and sustainable value in the years ahead. On the revenue side, we're pleased with the level of synergy sales, which accelerated in the second quarter. As of the end of the second quarter, we've already actioned $325 million in annual revenue synergies, and our synergy sales pipeline is growing robustly and we expect to meet or exceed our $600 million target over the 5 years post merger. Revenue synergies in the quarter were driven by payments, debit network and card sales across our three major client segments FIs, corporates, and government. Additionally, as the partner of choice, we continue to see momentum in our bank merchant program. Now let me pass the discussion to Bob for more detail on our financial results. Thanks, Bob. I'm very proud of the results we've delivered. The quality of our assets, our relentless focus on innovation, our agility, speed of new client implementation with examples like CAXIA, ADS, Atlanticus and Genesis put us in a great spot to serve our clients. Our speed to market with the enhanced Fiserv digital capabilities for banking and card management announced yesterday along with the integration of business expense management into the Clover platform, all of which leverage the full capabilities of recent acquisitions, Ondot and SpendLabs, add to our continued success. In addition to delivering on our financial results, we continue to focus on our people and on our communities. Earlier this month, Fiserv was named by Forbes as the Best Employer for Diversity, recognizing our commitment to putting diversity at the forefront of our values and having implemented long-term initiatives to create a more inclusive environment. During the quarter, we published our first annual corporate social responsibility report, which is available on the Corporate Social Responsibility section of our website. We also expanded our back-to-business grant program beyond the original locations that were selected in 2020. In May, we partnered with the New York Mets to recognize small businesses as part of our Asian, American and Pacific Islander Heritage month. And in June, we awarded grants to businesses in Tulsa as part of the centennial observation of the Tulsa Race Massacre. None of these achievements would have been possible without our world-class talent. I thank our more than 40,000 associates around the world for their commitment and courage as we stand together to deliver value for clients, our colleagues and you, our shareholders. And finally before I close, I want to congratulate the Milwaukee Bucks for winning the NBA championship at Fiserv Forum last week. The Bucks are terrific partners, and our partnership goes way beyond putting our name on their arena. Clover has been deployed throughout Fiserv Forum for food and beverage concessions, providing attendees with seamless, quick and easy transactions. They also partnered with us for several back-to-business events earlier this year. Congratulations to the entire Milwaukee Bucks organization. With that, operator, let's open up the line for questions. Well, I think it starts with the US has been the strong spot in the recovery right now. You heard us talk about unevenness outside the US. But I do think you saw a robust even last July when it all began coming back. I do think you've got to focus on the three legs in the US and internationally. The three legs are Clover, Carat and Clover Connect, right? And all of those were continued investments, continued build out and we're seeing it show up in the clients' office. So I would say, it's really driven by US. When you see that we say US and international for the quarter performed fundamentally evenly, that was a spotty evenness, meaning not every country was the same and you could kind of map to where recoveries happened or not. So I think it's all about our platform strategy and our client strategy that's driving the outcomes. And I think our teams galvanized very well around it. I think the answer to that is yes. There is concern in the world. Right? So that's a little bit in how we think about it when we talk to about what we're doing. So there is a degree of us saying, the world's not out of the woods yet, although I think they've learned how to grow with this. So it's highly possible what you're saying could happen. We're driving the business to get the results we're getting. You see all the partnerships we're aligning to, to bring more. So, yeah, I'd say it's possible. But the world has spottiness right now too. I'd start off with, first and foremost, I do not anticipate them conducting additional secondary offerings. Their holdings are just under 10% now. And they have told us they intend to sell shares on the open market over time in a routine and pragmatic way going forward. So I don't think we're going to see another secondary. Well, I think we're in every vertical. When we talk about grocer, QSR, retail but we're in gaming, we're across the board. You don't have a business of this size and scale that isn't serving all markets. And when you look at our capability, we do a good job of bringing base capability, and then segmenting to what verticals specifically need. So I think we are completely deployed against -- and we're deployed against growth, I mean, we're deployed against growth. Where we invest is where we believe the growthier segments are. I'd start with three[Phonetic] on leverage, that will be well behind us. And we did talk about Investor Day, $30 billion of free cash. And so I think you also see us continuing the strategy of taking Silicon Valley digital expertise and capability, integrate it into our company and fundamentally creating experiences that nobody in peer group can do. You saw it with Clover back in the day. And when I talked about Ondot, I did say that the acquisition of Ondot and then subsequently SpendLabs, but Ondot specifically, would bring a Clover-like effect to our company. And the fact that -- so you'll see us deploy capital to those type of acquisitions. But I want to bring clarity to what I mean in a Clover type. We've created a single instance for consumers to be able to get every banking product they have and have card functionality that surpasses the industry by a lot. So we have tremendous -- everything from digital issuance to the ability to put it in the wallet. I think you've got to really think about what we're doing there. And then we will invest in these products quite heavily. Right? So I think you'll see us continue to do those type of acquisitions that drive the digital presence, but we've done things unparalleled through those acquisitions. So we talked about $30 billion. You see the properties we bought. You see us integrating those properties, integrating for growth. And I think you'll see us unique, always though using buyback as a benchmark. That's correct. Well, why don't I start off with a look at -- I think Clover is a platform of choice and Clover is a partner platform of choice. And we did talk about that Clover would get other distribution channels, and that distribution could be our own outside the US. It could be with our ISV partners. And then just in our base core business, our own, I mean, your question of share, when you're as big as we are, we're competing with everybody and we feel that Clover is at the top of the list of what people want as a product. So I think it is about the differentiated product and the capability that gets it the type of numbers you saw in this quarter. Well, you see a number of things going on our FinTech segment, but let me bring -- I want to bring complete clarity on the digital offering because I think it affects both core and our digital business. And ultimately, what we have a deep belief is that we're here to help our clients serve their clients. So the ability to take 2,100 Mobiliti banks and bring them a fully integrated card experience at the highest level of card via the Ondot and bring that in a way that -- maybe the simple way to think about it is everything you can imagine in one application that allows you to do everything from originate transactions to digital card issuance to digital card view to card free cash, all in the same place that you're doing your bill pay and you're doing your Zelle transactions. So we're going to take 2,100 Mobiliti clients, 1,300 CardValet and bring that to them. And then that will be what we -- and those are financial institutions, we believe that will also help our clients increase their digital adoption quotient with their clients. So we see this as a game changer. So it's early innings. We got banks up and running on it. And we will deploy. And then you hear us talking about, on top of all that for financial institutions, we bring in Abiliti that sits on top of all of it. But the most important thing to think about is our cores are strategic. The front end, though, is where we believe the tip of the spear and where we win to help our clients serve their clients. And you saw what we posted now, but I look forward to continuing to generate more revenue through better function we bring to clients that allow them to do more with their clients. And then, you've got an integration of a SpendLabs into Clover, which allows -- these are our digital platforms. We're talking about digital platforms, one-of-a-kind digital platform. And I think what you should take away, there's an element of this company that's digitally agile and can deliver, and you saw it on those credit conversions. I think those are good track rated speeds for those size and scope. CAIXA is unparalleled. 70 days from signing, we're boarding merchants for them every day. And then you look at us taking SpendLabs and Ondot and I think we're going to have that same effect that Clover had when we look years out from now. Well, I feel -- obviously, you've watched over time the type of properties we buy. Our ISV strategy was born out of acquisition. Now it's a winning strategy. Clover was born out of acquisition. And I think you'd have to argue that's a bigger than winning strategy. You'll watch these assets, Ondot and SpendLabs, so I think you're just going to continue. I don't think it needs to be dilutive to EPS. I think we know how to make it accretive pretty darn quick. And what I just talked about was kind of the dream of the acquisition when we put the companies together, that we could take an asset like an Ondot and spread it all the way through because of what a great bank partner we were, and that we could bring it all the way from merchant to our fintech. So I think you should expect us to continue to do more like that. And I think we have a skill at it that we keep the talent, we grow the talent, and we build a bigger digital gene pool in the process. I think you see the credit momentum and you see us talking about that we'll have good second half revenue from that. You see, in general -- that's on the wins, and then, you see general credit momentum beginning in our portfolio. Debit networks, I've talked about the strength of them and we feel very, very strongly about what's going on there in debit transaction growth. So when you put all those in the calculation, you saw us go from 2% to 7%, and you should expect us to continue our trajectory north. Yes. Yeah. I think the thing is, our capabilities around fraud and chargeback management and our capabilities to serve the biggest issuers is very deep. And I think that many times having a third network is very valuable to everybody, both merchants and issuers, and so -- and STAR and Accel, we've invested heavily in them. And that's why we get the type of transaction growth you're seeing there. So, we really, really love our debit networks. So thank you for joining us this morning. We appreciate your support. If you have further questions, please don't hesitate to contact our Investor Relations team. Stay safe and have a great day."

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I will turn the call over to Shub Mukherjee, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. \nShub Mukherjee: Thank you and good morning. With me on the call today are Frank Bisignano, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and supplemental materials for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about among other matters, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, expected operating and financial results, strategic initiatives and expected benefits and synergies from the First Data acquisition. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. You should refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. Please refer to our earnings release and supplemental materials for today's call. For an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this call, along with the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest to applicable GAAP measures. Unless otherwise stated performance, references are year-over-year comparisons and all references to internal revenue growth are on a constant currency basis. And now I'll turn the call over to Frank.\nFrank J Bisignano: Thank you, Shub. Great to have you on the team. 2021 is off to a strong start with Q1 at or better than our expectations across a broad range of metrics. The strength of our results reflects our continued investment in technology, innovation, our client portfolio and our people through the COVID-19 pandemic. Let me provide a brief overview of our strong financial results in the quarter. You may have noticed that Q1 earnings presentation has been updated. If you're following along. I will provide some overview comments captured on the first three pages. And then Bob will provide more detail on a subsequent slides. Total company internal revenue growth was 4% for the quarter, including low double-digit growth in March. That performance was led by our Merchant Acceptance segment, which was up 8%, an exceptional result in light of the global pandemic and continued COVID restrictions, particularly in Brazil, India and a variety of countries in EMEA for much of the quarter. Adjusted operating margin grew 360 basis points resulting in an 18% increase in adjusted earnings per share. Free cash flow grew 8% to $821 million, a 100% conversion to adjusted net income. Our sales momentum remains quite strong as first quarter sales were up 42%, which strong results in our payments and international businesses and this momentum continues into the second quarter. Yesterday, we announced a 20-year agreement with Caixa Economica Federal to become the exclusive provider of Merchant Acquiring Services. Caixa is one of Brazil's largest banks with more than 26,000 sales outlets and a broad presence throughout all of Brazil, making this one of the largest wins for our company in Latin America and one of the largest globally. Also this morning, we announced a new solution with PayPal to enable our merchant network across the Clover and Carat platforms to accept payments via PayPal and Venmo through QR codes presented at the point of sale. We believe this is an important offering for our merchants as consumer preferences continue to shift toward touch free transactions. The combination of robust sales and excellent pipeline is evidence that our formula of bringing the strength and breadth of Fiserv's offerings together with our integrated sales model is extremely well received in the client's office and we believe bodes well for the future. Now I'd like to update you on how our leading digital enabled merchant business is performing through Clover, our leading SMB platform, Carat our enterprise omni-channel commerce solution and Clover Connect, our rich ISV solutions set. We continue to drive innovation, expand partnerships and deliver leading solutions to our merchant clients. The momentum within the digital enabled segments of the merchant business continues to be excellent. Clover's gross payment volume grew 36% year-over-year to $141 billion annualized. To provide some more context around the strength of the Clover platform, GPV has grown 75% from $81 billion in Q1 2019 in Q1 to $141 billion in Q1 this year, despite the economic headwinds from the pandemic. Carat, our enterprise omni-channel solution, continued to perform very well. E-commerce transactions grew 24% compared to prior year. Omni-channel transactions such as order ahead and pickup in store were up over 122% year-over-year. We won a record 51 new enterprise level e-commerce clients in the first quarter, including Cost Plus World Market, a US specialty retailer for which Fiserv has been chosen to provide e-commerce gateway, point-of-sale hardware devices and value-added services like security tokenization. We had a very strong result sales internationally. The notable wins in EMEA include Selecta, Europe's leading self-service retailer offering coffee and convenience food solutions for which Fiserv has been chosen to provide acquiring services and unattended POS hardware. In LatAm, we extended our relationship with one of the largest e-commerce marketplaces in the region. In APAC, we won the Merchant Acquiring business where Australia's second largest bill payment provider. We also expanded our relationship with key brands such as state barn [Phonetic] where we are piloting a new digital payout experience for insurance claims. Recognizing our innovation to bring digital payments to all consumers, Fiserv was named one of the world's most innovative companies by Fast Company for our role in enabling the acceptance of US Department of Agriculture SNAP Online EBT payments during the pandemic. We continue to see great momentum in the ISV space with Clover Connect. In the first quarter, we signed 42 new ISV partners. Our continuing strength and expanding partner relationships is driving strong results in active merchants, which were up 38% in Q1 and ISV channel revenue growth, which was up 34%. For example, during the quarter, Fiserv further cemented its lead in the mortgage servicing software vertical by signing a strategic partnership agreement with mortgage cadence, an accentured company, which provides more origination software to the mortgage industry. This is yet another example of a successful integrated cell continuing to fuel future growth in our ISV channel. Additionally, we are continuing to build and enhance our existing ISV relationships by leveraging our technology and market knowledge. In the quarter, we finalized an agreement with e-tail head [Phonetic] to move their large set of existing merchants to us and build upon the agreement we had in place for new merchants. Moving to our account processing business, we continue to expand our [Indecipherable] relationships across financial institutions of all sizes and types. We signed 10 new core account processing clients in the quarter, including five on the DNA platform. I'd like to highlight a few of our recent wins. As we mentioned on our last earnings call, we signed Republic First Bank, a commercial bank with more than $5 billion in assets and rated America's Best Bank by Forbes for a full service of Fiserv products including core processing, card services and output solutions in February. Additionally, we signed two de novo banks in the quarter, including Genesis Bank, a newly chartered bank focus as a minority depository institution. This win continues to show our commitment to supporting minority communities. Majority of these illustrative wins were competitive takeaways with a common characteristic. The client selected a leading core platform plus multiple surround digital solutions to support their goals of sustained growth and superior customer service. These wins also like the strength of our offering for a wide range of clients from de novo banks to large financial institutions. In our payment and network segment, we continue to leverage the power of our combined solutions to drive revenue synergies. In Q1, we signed a significant new agreement to provide statement and letter services to a major US healthcare services provider strengthening our position in this industry vertical. Further building on our digital momentum in Q1, we signed agreements to provide digital solutions to First Horizon Bank as well as 10 fed credit union in both cases leveraging our newly acquired Ondot capabilities. Through Ondot, we can enable our FI [Phonetic] clients to offer their cardholders personalized, real time digital experiences, driving cardholder engagement and spend. We expect continued adoption of these digital solutions across our client base. With that, let me update you on our integration efforts. Through Q1, we've already actioned nearly $1.1 billion of cost savings and are well on our way to fully action $1.2 billion cost synergy objective by the end of this year. With the majority of the integration work behind us, we are focused on driving further growth and sustainable value in the years ahead. On the revenue side, we're pleased with the level of synergy sales, which accelerated in the first quarter. As of the end Q1, we've already actioned $265 million in annual revenue synergies and our synergy sales pipeline is growing robustly. And we expect to meet or or exceed our $600 million target over the five years post-merger. Our bank merchant program continues to be a synergy opportunity and offers financial institutions of all sizes, the ability to offer their important merchant clients a modern suite of merchant acquiring capabilities, including the innovative Clover platform along with digital capabilities like loyalty programs and e-commerce solutions. In the first quarter, we added 34 new bank merchant clients, six with assets over $1 billion. Additionally, half of these wins were competitive takeaways. The pipeline remains robust through the rest of 2021. One final point on our digital initiatives before turning it over to Bob. As you've heard us discussed in the past, one of the most important strategic initiatives is to redefining the client experience by utilizing the latest technology to drive innovation and offer digital capabilities across our payments ecosystem. An example of that commitment to this area is the acquisition of Ondat Systems, a leading digital experience platform provider for financial institutions of all sizes, which closed in the first quarter. We also acquired Raduis8, a cloud-based platform that had hyperlocalized commerce capabilities to Carat thereby enhancing our beyond the buy button strategy. Last but not least, we announced the definitive agreement to acquire Pineapple Payments, a leading ISO focused on integrated payments. Now, let me pass the discussion to Bob for more detail on our financial results.\nBob Hau: Thank you Frank and good morning everyone. If you're following along at our new slides, I'll cover some detail on each of our segments. We had a strong first quarter in light of continued pressure from the pandemic across the globe. Q1 represents the final period of pre-pandemic comparison points with the impact beginning to materialize in the final two weeks of March last year. Total company internal revenue growth was 4% in the quarter led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 8%. First quarter adjusted operating income was up a strong 15% to $1.1 billion and adjusted operating margin increased by a very strong 360 basis points to 31.4%. This margin improvement was driven by our rigorous cost synergy execution, which produced $129 million of incremental cost synergies in the quarter as well as strong operating performance. First quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 18% to $1.17 compared to $0.99 in the prior year. Free cash flow in the quarter was $821 million, up 8% over Q1 last year and 103% percent conversion to adjusted net income impacting Q1's free cash flow was an increase in accounts receivable driven by a strong rebound in March. Turning to each of the segments, internal revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was 8% in the quarter. Our results were once again driven by strong performances in our portfolio of SMB clients supported by our Clover platform, enterprise clients supported by Carat and another strong quarter from our ISV business. This result includes a meaningful headwind from our EMEA region, which experienced restrictions for much of the quarter in several important markets for us including the UK, Germany, Ireland and Poland. As Frank discussed, our Clover GPV continues to grow very nicely, up 36% in the quarter. The outlook for the SMB business looks strong as a sequential uplift that we witnessed in this business in the last few weeks of March has continued through April. Our integrated payments or ISV business continues to perform extremely well with continued strong revenue growth in the quarter. As we discussed at our Investor Day, we recently rolled out Clover Connect, a Clover integrated solution for ISVs. We believe that this solution will further extend our differentiation for ISVs and their merchant customers and continue to drive excellent growth in the future. Adjusted operating income in the Acceptance segment increased 37% to $387 million in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was up 650 basis points to 27.7% driven by the strength in the topline and continued cost synergies. The Fintech segment internal revenue grew 2% in the first quarter compared to the prior year as growth in high quality recurring revenue was again partially offset by lower periodic revenue most prominently termination fees, which created approximately 150 basis points of headwind to internal revenue growth in the quarter. The shift toward digital banking and the result in strong demand for our broader way of digital solutions continues. For example, total mobile subscribers across our leading digital platforms, Mobiliti and Architect, grew 12% in the quarter. Mobile deposits in Q1 grew 30% over the prior year, while self-service ATM deposits grew 65% over last year. We expect these trends to continue as users who have moved to mobile or ATM for check deposits may adopt these as preferred channels after experiencing their convenience and safety. Adjusted operating income was up a strong 21% in the quarter to $246 million. Adjusted operating margin in the segment increased a robust 510 basis points in the quarter to 33.4% on a combination of growth in processing revenue, operational effectiveness benefits and cost synergies. The Payments and Network segment saw internal revenue grew 2% in the first quarter as growth in our card services, output solutions Zelle and prepaid businesses including the benefit from revenue synergies was partially offset by headwinds in our bill-pay and credit businesses. Debit transactions grew a strong 16% year-over-year, slightly ahead of levels last quarter. We continue to see excellent transaction growth in solutions such as our account-to-account transfers and P2P. Both Zelle transactions and the number of clients live on Zelle more than doubled in the quarter versus a year ago. Our bill pay and credit businesses in particular given our retail private label mix saw headwinds from the pandemic that we expect to subside as we reach the second half of the year with better economic activity and better revenue comparisons. Adjusted operating income for the segment was up 2% to $585 million and adjusted operating margin was up 20 basis points to 41.4% in the quarter. The results were driven by positive impact of both revenue and cost synergies in part offset by the lower revenue in our higher margin credit processing and bill pay businesses. The adjusted corporate operating loss was $102 million in the quarter, in line with our expectations. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 17.2% flat versus prior year. We also expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate to be fairly consistent with the 2020 rate in the range of 21% to 22%. During the quarter, we continued our disciplined capital allocation strategy by repurchasing 5.2 million shares for $612 million and we have more than 16 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase. In addition, as Frank mentioned earlier, we completed the acquisition of Ondot Systems in January and increased our investment related to the Tegra118, our former investment services business. In connection with this combination with Wealthtech Holdings. Total debt outstanding was $21.2 billion at March 31 and the debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio remained at 3.6 times. We are on track to achieve our targeted leverage of less than 3 times in the second half of 2021 as we anticipate both strong adjusted EBITDA growth and debt repayment this year. As you heard us emphasize throughout our Investor Day in December, we're fully committed to our long-standing capital allocation strategy, which includes maintaining a strong balance sheet, making organic investment in innovative solutions and pursuing high value acquisitions like Ondot, Radius8 and Pineapple Payments. Importantly, share repurchase remains our benchmark for capital deployment. With that, let me turn the call back to Frank.\nFrank J Bisignano: Thanks, Bob. Given our strong Q1 performance and an improved economic outlook, we are raising the low end of our outlook range for both internal revenue and adjusted EPS growth. We now expect 2021 internal revenue growth to be in the 9% to 12% range versus 8% to 12% previous. We expect adjusted EPS to be in the $5.35 to $5.50 range, which is a 21% to 24% growth over last year. This is up $0.05 at the bottom end from our prior outlook. We continue to expect adjusted operating margin to expand by at least 250 basis points and free cash flow conversion to be greater than 108% for the year. The range for internal revenue and adjusted EPS growth outlook are grounded in our performance to date. The current state of the economy and our internal assumptions about the trajectory of economic recovery, both of which have improved versus February when we provided our prior outlook. To remind you, the low end of our original outlook in February assumed no material economic recovery from where we were at that time. Similarly, the 9% at the low end of our updated outlook assumes the same no material economic recovery for the remainder of the year. Regionally, we are seeing good economic progress in the US driven both by government stimulus as well as COVID vaccine distribution with uneven recovery outside the US as more pronounced COVID impacts persisted in parts of EMEA, LatAm and APAC. As we indicated during our last earnings call, given the timing of the pandemic impact last year, we expect more variability in quarterly growth in 2021. Given difficult comparisons, we expected Q1 performance to be below our full-year outlook range and at once. We expect Q2 growth rates will be above the full-year outlook range driven by our business momentum and an easier year ago comparison. I'm proud of the results we've delivered as we navigate the ongoing global crisis. Our business has shown incredible strength and resilience leading to what we expect to be our 36th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings-per-share growth in 2021 and setting a foundation for even stronger results beyond. In addition to delivering on our financial results, we continue to focus on our community. During the quarter, we successfully completed our back to business grant program in the original six locations that were selected in 2020. We also held two additional programs in Milwaukee partnering with the Milwaukee Bucks to celebrate Black History month, March 2 event partnering with the Bucks and Nancy Lieberman during Women's History Month to award additional brands to minority women owned small businesses. Last, let me thank our more than 40,000 talented associates around the world for their commitment and courage as we stand together to deliver value for clients, our colleagues and for you, our shareholders. With that, operator, let's open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We would now like to open the phone lines for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dave Koning from Baird. Your line is open.\nDavid Koning: Yeah. Hey guys, great job.\nFrank J Bisignano: Thanks, David. Good morning.\nBob Hau: Thank you. Good morning.\nDavid Koning: Yeah, thanks. So I guess first of all, just on the Acceptance segment really nice momentum there, maybe could you kind of walk through how January and February trends were? And then how kind of March and April trends were? Just to kind of understand how the months worked as things kind of progressed.\nFrank J Bisignano: Yeah, I'd take it at the macro level. January and February obviously began a little movement up in volume, but really not very much. If you remember, in February we talked to you all and gave a little look at what we saw up until then, and that's when we took really that bottom end up from through the flow up from 7 to 8 because we felt better than it did when we talk to you on December 8 at Investor Day. We did see a strong March. We saw a weaker February in the US. I'd credit a fair amount of that to whether there is store [Phonetic] going on. We saw a stronger March, but I think on top of that we saw more lockdowns in EMEA and Brazil as I had talked about previously, although hampered tremendously by COVID still had spending going on. And I feel as we come into April and as we're going to head to the end of it we see the progression in the US. Obviously, India is a challenged environment in total right now. EMEA is beginning to open up and Brazil continues to perform. And why we take the bottom up from 8 to 9 there if that's helpful here.\nDavid Koning: Yeah. Thank you. I guess another way, kind of to think through this as we look really into Q2. I look back at the last five years of First Data, the GBS segment and very routinely, it was up about 10% sequentially in Q2, very close to the same every year and margins were up like the incremental margins were nearly 100%. So it's like a 300 basis points, 400 basis points, 500 basis points sequential jump in margins. Is there anything different about that seasonality? It would almost seem like the season now would be even better this Q2 than some of those past trends, but just trying to triangulate that.\nFrank J Bisignano: Yeah, I think you're thinking about it right. I mean look at it -- and January versus last January was definitely a back compare would consider Q2 and why we talked about it as being outside the top end of the range is because it's against the weak comp. So I would expect that seasonality to perform better than you would have ever seen.\nBob Hau: Dave, recall during our earnings call last quarter 90 days ago, when we talked about the cadence of our revenue growth, we expected Q1 to be below the full- year guidance range, given the comps against pre-pandemic period really all of January, February and half of March, then second quarter would actually be above the full-year guidance range with the second half of the year more in line with that overall full year. We do expect sequentially to continue to see seasonality benefit Q1 to Q2 in the Merchant segment. We also see the benefit of pandemic continuing to subside, particularly in the US as more and more people get inoculated and hopefully improvement in EMEA as some of the lockdowns began to be relaxed.\nDavid Koning: Yeah, great. Thanks guys. Nice job.\nFrank J Bisignano: Great to talk to you in the morning too, Dave.\nDavid Koning: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nDarrin Peller: Hey guys, great job. Thanks. I want to just hone in on looking at the outperformance in the Merchant side going back. Frank, if you look at what you guys outperformed on, there's a lot of debate, was it mix or was it -- the technology. You showed some really good data points on Clover and Carat ISVs and now when thinking about coming on the other side of this pandemic. First of all, if you can comment on that point that it's probably a good combination of mix and technology. What was the areas that really stood out technologically? What are the areas that you now see on the other side of the pandemic that are doing more than you would have thought pre-pandemic and could drive even better growth to that 9% to 12% merchant range you've talked about?\nFrank J Bisignano: Yeah, I think Mercialys [Phonetic] think about Clover growth very, very strong, e-comm wins and that's the backlog that is on boarding continues to be very, very strong. Our ISV business performing well. I mean lockdowns in EMEA definitely affect us and I would see us coming, we could feel that in the UK opening up. Our client mix, we've been bullish on the whole way, but I've also been very clear that we have a huge diversed client base from SMEs to large enterprises across every industry sector as well as the large presence in geographies. And so I think when you look at outlook goal, we still have lagging verticals, restaurants, travel and services. So we have an expectation in the later second quarter and in the third quarter that recover well. We've invested heavily and Clover continue to do it heavily and Carat continue to do it heavily and Clover Connect. So I look forward to us being able to continue the type of momentum we have for a long time.\nDarrin Peller: Okay. All right. So all of those areas are really going to be a bigger percentage of the mix coming out of this than they were before I guess, right?\nFrank J Bisignano: Sorry again, Darrin.\nDarrin Peller: So whether it's Clover or Carat or ISVs the mix contribution -- the revenue contribution from those areas probably will be notably bigger percent of revenue coming out of the pandemic than they were before. I would say, and I don't know if you can give any update on data points around that, but the Investor Day started this off with some good ones. Is that fair?\nBob Hau: Yeah, Darrin. I think there's a couple of things that will play. Number one is as Frank pointed out, while we have strength of diversity of geography and client base, meaning we serve the largest retailers in the world, all the way down to the smallest SMBs, the breadth has served us well. But we also of course have pretty meaningful exposure to restaurants and retail that have still a lot of recovery ahead of them that will help us with growth going forward. We think we've outperformed the market in the last four, six, eight quarters, quite frankly, and we have the opportunity to continue that. The other dynamic of course is as Clover and ISV and e-comm, which are growing faster than the overall average, become a larger part. You will see better growth from those becoming a more meaningful piece of the overall company. As we pointed out $1 billion e-comm business to grow nicely, it becomes a bigger part of that $6 billion segment and providing some nice growth.\nDarrin Peller: All right. Just very quickly, repurchasing shares. I think you did 5 -- a little over 5 million shares. Again that's a key area that we focus on for you guys, especially given good free cash conversion. So, just can you update us on your appetite and your capacity for the rest of this year. And thanks again, guys.\nBob Hau: Yeah, sure. We feel great about the position that we're in, good cash generation in the first quarter. I mentioned in my prepared remarks, a little bit of accounts receivable growth driven this given the strong March, which of course will generate cash in the second quarter as we collect those receivables, 103% conversion in the first quarter, well on track to do the 108% for the full year. So we feel that we've got continued good strong free cash flow generation, gives us the capacity to buy back shares and of course, as you heard us lay out in our earnings, looks to me at our Investor Day back in December $30 billion of capital to deploy over the next five years. We did a meaningful buyback in the first quarter and we see the opportunity to do that for the balance of the year.\nDarrin Peller: Great. Thanks again, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nLisa Ellis: Good morning, guys. I had a specific question on the use of the digital sales channels for Clover. If I recall prior to the merger with Fiserv, this was an area of First Data had invested really heavily in building online sales channel so a merchant could apply, get approved instantly by their Clover's directly and I realize we hadn't heard a lot about this too much in the last year or two. So I was just wondering at the time that was a major differentiator for your platform compared to your large competitors. Could you just update us on how widely this channel has been deployed and how significant of a factor it is in Clover sales? Thank you.\nFrank J Bisignano: I'd say, first of all, we continue to hear in there and when you hear us talk about the addition of new bank programs we view every one of those as us ultimately driving digital adoption, right? We always believe that partners were great places for digital adoption and we believe Clover itself was great place for digital adoption. When you look at the totality of our business globally, I would still put it in the not meaningful in total category, but a channel, which continues to accelerate its growth and one that we believe we will deliver more integrated opportunities for digital sign-up. And when you think about things we will do longer-term with our bank partners having a one of a kind digital experience for that bank merchant partner while continuing to work with Paychex and the Verizons also and using our direct channels to digitally sign up. So I think it will be part of the five-year journey we talk about. It's not the overwhelming part of our sign-up machine, but our capability is huge and our ability to attract new partners because of that digital capability and sign up merchants is being contributing to the growth rate.\nLisa Ellis: Okay. And then my follow-up, another one related to go to market or distribution on the Merchant side. Just a question on your strategy with e-commerce platforms and I'm thinking specifically about businesses that aggregate SMBs in a particular industry like restaurant aggregators or retail aggregators of a particular type. With everything you're doing with Clover, with Carat, with Clover Connect with the recent acquisitions, how are you serving these types of customers? Or how are you -- how do they sort of fit into your strategy in Merchant? Thank you.\nFrank J Bisignano: Well, I think it fits completely in our strategy. We've always viewed us as a partner of choice., a great distributor. We operate in basically every vertical and every capability and you hear us today, talk about extending our relationship in Brazil, in Latin America with one of the largest income players. That's really an example of us, our commitment to market places actually and you'll see that happen internally on the new open coming marketplaces us being an enabler and a distributor for them too. So I think we have a deep commitment there as you can capabilities are strong and you hear it and the things we will say today in our announcement.\nLisa Ellis: Terrific. Thank you. Good stuff.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Dolev from Mizuho. Your line is open.\nDan Dolev: Hey, thank you. Amazing results, very impressive. Great job, Frank and team.\nFrank J Bisignano: Thank you, Dan.\nDan Dolev: So I almost refused to accept the explanation that it's just a macro improvement. I mean I think there is significant share gains that you guys are getting out there and that's what we are hearing from the channel in Merchant Acquiring. Can you maybe give us a little bit of an understanding of who you're taking share from, who you're displacing? What are you seeing out there? How are you winning and who are you winning against? Thank you.\nFrank J Bisignano: Well, if you think about, -- it's a global -- it's a global business we're in. So you saw us announcing a large deal in Brazil. And we've been -- we started that Brazilian business back '14 and '15 and we've been taking share beyond where anybody had thought was capable on that market itself. So I'd point to that because we weren't a big ISV player back in '15 and '16 or probably '17 until we bought CardConnect and BluePay [Phonetic] but there we fit together with Clover and began that journey. You see that. You well know probably people thought we're an e-comm lagger [Phonetic] and we continue to win in that space. Now in summary statements. It's new markets but in many cases, taking it from all the places you won't suspect and you know I would look at us saying, hey, if you go through the hundreds of bank merchant wins we have talked about, fundamentally, those are 50% takeaways. So we continue to compete against everybody very strongly. And that in every market and in every vertical and it gets back to what we had said on Investor Day, when you look at this portfolio with Clover, with Clover Connect, with Carat, with global distribution with the client base that we have from largest in the world to the corner as I like to say it the corner store I think we've built a business that's the most diverse and probably has the most technology in all honesty.\nDan Dolev: Thank you. And then, a quick follow-up. If I think about that 8% growth in Merchant, would you -- and I'm sorry if I missed it, can you give us maybe the cadence like January, February, March, and what it's looking like in April specifically on that 8% in Merchant? Is there any way to parse it out a little bit?\nBob Hau: Yeah. Dan. I think there is a couple of things. If you look at the year-over-year growth rate obviously given the pre-pandemic comparison in January and February and then March half of the quarter was pre-pandemic. The other half -- half a month -- the other half of the month was a pretty severe shutdown as particularly in the US, but also in Europe. People really significantly went home and commerce really took a hit in the second half of March last year. So you see the year-over-year comp get significantly better in those last two weeks. If you just look at kind of the raw transactions, January started out the year, the quarter strong, February as Frank mentioned, we saw some weather, particularly in the south in the US slow things down a bit, and then March came back quite a bit stronger. If you -- if you can adjust for weather, I would say January started out nice, February again adjusted for weather was again in line or good with January and then we started seeing things really pick up in March, I'm sure not coincidentally and help supported by the SIM 3 payments that started flowing out. And we've seen that continue into April. So we're definitely feeling the the recovery of the pandemic as vaccines really spread in the US. We're seeing more and more commerce retail picking up, restaurants starting to pick up, still down year-over-year in a meaningful way but starting to improve sequentially pretty nicely.\nDan Dolev: Thank you. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey from Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Hi. Pardon me. Good morning. I appreciate you taking the question. Lots of helpful inputs and commentary in the Acceptance business. Can you talk a little bit about churn. I'm just trying to get a sense of how that might improve or what the dynamic looks like as we reopen in terms of what's coming in the top of the funnel be that Clover SME enterprise e-comm versus what's coming out of the bottom the funnel and how we think about that sort of all translating into sustainable internal revenue growth in your Acceptance business?\nFrank J Bisignano: Yeah. Well a pandemic, I guess, a lot of people did shut down their businesses and get a lot of people to open up new businesses. I think we're going to see the strongest small business formation in the second half that we've ever seen. And that's why these channels we have are so darn valuable. Our commitment to the small businesses you probably saw us as a technical provider one of a few to the SBA for the restaurant brand. So I think we've done a good job over the long haul of keeping our clients and I think our Clover platform, our ISV platform, our Carat platform all are well received by our client base. And I look for strength in small business formation even for those who shut down to come back in a different shape and form. So I guess churn seems very good for us, if you want to think about attrition, I mean we feel strong about what job we're doing and of course any client leaving upsets us at any level. But I think the other part we got to put on top of it is tremendously strong small business formation and why all of these channels we have we believe are so darn valuable for us in that process.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And Bob, quick follow-up on payments. Again really nice KPIs, whether it's Zelle or debit transaction growth and I realize there are some pandemic headwinds perhaps in credit. Can you offer some insight as to win some of the digital solutions P2P I'm thinking in particular really start to move the needle from a topline perspective in that business.\nBob Hau: Yeah. Andrew, there -- as you pointed out, we saw some very nice KPIs support in the overall payments business, Zelle with both the number of transactions and number of users doubling certainly supports debit processing as well as the debit network performing quite well. We continue to love the acquisition of Ondat and our ability to provide additional digital services for card controls and card activation to our overall channel. We see that as a significant growth opportunity not only to obviously provide that particular capability, but that as an overall part of our solution. We certainly have the benefit of some of the significant wins in the credit issuing business that we talked about over the last couple of quarters beginning to ramp late 2021 and into 2022. The 2% growth in the Payments segment in the first quarter here is not an indication of where we see the opportunity for the full year. There are some definite headwinds there from the pandemic that we expect to subside. And I think we said this at the end of last earnings call, but still believe it today. We expect the Payments segment for the full year to be at the upper end of the medium-term outlook for internal revenue. So we believe 2022, 2023 that Payments segment can grow 5% to 8% and we think this year will be at the upper end of that as we head into the second half of the year and we see the full-year results. So I think we're in a great spot. We'll see some continued growth, particularly in our digital side of the Payments and we'll see improvement in that bill pay and credit issuing particularly the retail private label in the second half.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang from JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nTien-tsin Huang: Hi, good morning. Really appreciate the new slide formats real good. Just looking at the Acceptance side here, the 8% internal revenue growth and 13% global volume growth, do you see potential for that spread between revenue volume growth to narrow or even flip in the second quarter or the second half of the year? I'm asking because based on what Frank said around new businesses reforming and hopefully more in-store behavior that should help you I think on the spread. So I just wanted to check that.\nBob Hau: Yeah, I think, that's the right way to think about it. There is certainly opportunity going forward and we'll see obviously how the economy rebounds into the second half of the year. All indications right now are quite strong. It's why we lifted the bottom end of our guidance range now twice in a row from 7% back in December to 8% in last quarter and now 9%. We see the economy improving and that helps overall Merchant Acceptance it helps the overall company but Merchant Acceptance in that spread also.\nTien-tsin Huang: That's great. And then just a quick follow-up. I wanted to ask about Star and your PINless debit initiatives and investments in light of I think Visa did disclose that DOJ is looking in into some of the debit practices so those good time to check in with you on, on what's happening with the PINless debit.\nFrank J Bisignano: Yeah, I mean Star and Excel are standout performers for us and our investment and business continues to be large. I think you'll continue to see us invest where card on PINless debit and other aspects around signature too as we had talked about over time. That's a long haul. It's not a short haul. It's a lot of the infrastructure work, but we're investing heavily in the network and we have a deep belief in the growth in network and the power of the network, especially in this company, where we have a network business and we have merchants and it is good for financial institutions, Star and Excel together and good ground merchants, so a long journey. But that will continue to be something that we'll talk to you about it and we're committed to and show as part of the star-performing businesses in the company. No but intended.\nTien-tsin Huang: Got it. Thanks for the update.\nBob Hau: Thanks, Tsein-tsin.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. Good morning. Looking at the acceleration in Clover TPV growth from 25% in Q4 to 36% in Q1, can you drill down a little bit into the drivers there, for example, how much would have been from on-boarding new clients versus an improvement in same-store sales? Just trying to understand the sustainability of this higher growth rate for Clover.\nBob Hau: Yeah, I think the way to think about it is, number one, we do think the growth rate of Clover is quite sustainable. We've seen very strong growth the last several years, 25%. 30%, 35%, 40% in a given quarter. I think you saw in fourth quarter really the second half of last year some slowing driven the pandemic obviously as we anniversary that and continue to see, as Frank pointed out, new business formation that certainly is a beneficiary to Clover given the depth of our channel capability and our distribution system, we think we can benefit very nicely from that new business formation. So I would expect that Clover revenue to me their GPV growth to continue for some time going forward, and we continue to invest in capability there and continue to enhance our solution set.\nDavid Togut: Understood. Just as a follow-up. Looking at the 2% organic revenue growth in the Fintech segment in Q1, can you call out the headwind that you saw from declining periodic revenue, so we can gauge the underlying internal growth going forward?\nBob Hau: Yeah. For Q1, that periodic headwind, which again was largely driven by termination fees, was about 150 basis points. Said another way, outside of that, we would have grown about 350 bps. We do expect the headwind to continue into second quarter although to a slightly abated rate level and then as we enter the second half of the year that will no longer be a headwind for us going forward as it gets to a diminished level and then we'll see what happens beyond that in terms of, as the economy improves, do you see more bank mergers, which tends to be a driver of termination fees, but that headwind subsides a bit in Q2 and then I anticipated not being a headwind that we discussed in the second half of the year.\nDavid Togut: Understood. Thanks so much for the helpful detail.\nBob Hau: Sure. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Your line is open.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi guys, thanks for taking my question here. I wanted to ask about the broader M&A strategy. Should we expect more deals sort of similar size to Pineapple and Ondat? Or would you take a swing at something a little larger if -- or maybe more transformative if the opportunity presented itself?\nFrank J Bisignano: Well, I think, first, we feel great about our capabilities and the total hand we have, The tuck-ins have played very, very well for us for a very long time. I think if you'll look at Ondot and you're going to see that gets spread across the product base, to client base that digital capability and integrated fashion. I think Pineapple takes us on another area around our ISV capability. I think if you look at Radius8, it is about bringing that across this large platform, so they played very, very well for us. We've been very committed to our capital allocation strategy, tried and true and all of these acquisitions fit exactly within that envelope but of course, we pay attention, think about everything and as a dynamic world it keeps changing. So I think we're pretty committed to the path we're on, and we think about all things in the market always around the table. And so it has to work for our shareholders for it to make sense and that's why we held our capital allocation strategy.\nRamsey El-Assal: All right. That makes lot of sense. Lastly for me, this is just a point of clarification, forgive me if you guys already covered off on it, but in the slide deck you mentioned pressure on long cycle credit processing in the Payments segment, what is that exactly? And as a headwind, do you expect to persist?\nBob Hau: Yeah, I would -- that is essentially -- our credit issuer processing business is not transaction driven. And so as we see the economy improve in more active accounts, we'll see an improvement in that revenue. And so that's a bit of a lagging indicator and we expect that to to take place really in the second half, as the economy improves, we'll see more activity. In addition, you'll get different comparisons. And so we think that helps lift the growth of the the Payments segment and obviously the credit issuer processing.\nRamsey El-Assal: Great. Got it. Okay. So that's just a euphemism for credit issuer processing effect, right? Okay. Terrific. Thanks so much.\nFrank J Bisignano: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question comes from George Mihalos from Cowen. Your line is open.\nGeorge Mihalos: Hey guys, thanks. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just wanted to ask kicking things off on the Merchant side, the nice momentum you're seeing there. As it relates to EMEA, we're hearing anecdotally that things are getting better throughout the course of April, particularly in the UK, and I'm just curious if you could share any high-level trends that you might be seeing through the month of April and would you guys expect that region to be in the black in 2Q. Is there any reason why that's not possible?\nFrank J Bisignano: I think the UK is, we can feel it, we see it. I think referred to potentially somewhere along the line here too. I think Ireland still has challenges but you know, our expectation is that in the second half. EMEA is in recovery. I don't want to be thinking too hard about this quarter itself as much as the full year. And we believe the EMEA business will perform well in the second half. I think it's been under pressure in the first half.\nBob Hau: Certainly feels like it's in the right trajectory though, as you say the restrictions are beginning to lift UK in particular and hopefully some of the other countries in that region soon.\nGeorge Mihalos: Okay, that's helpful. And just as a quick follow-up, Bob, on the on the Fintech segment, should we continue to believe. I mean it seems like it's tracking in the right direction, but is the 4% to 6% growth for Fintech. I think that you laid out last quarter, is that still on the table for '21 or how are you guys feeling about that range?\nBob Hau: Yeah, we didn't give a guidance for '21, that 4% to 6% is our medium-term guidance. We don't give specific in your guidance on our [Indecipherable] segment level. I'd just reiterate we did -- we printed it too, if you adjust for the periodic revenue. It's a 3.5% in the quarter that subsides pretty meaningfully in the second quarter and is no longer a headwind in the third and fourth quarter. So we'll see a nice uptick in that segment and believe we'll be in that range in the second half of the year for sure. Okay. Thank you, guys. Congrats on the results. Thank you very much.\nFrank J Bisignano: I'd like to thank everybody for their time today. I look forward to taking to you all. And we appreciate everything you do. Have a great day.\nOperator: [Operator Closing Remarks]",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bob Hau",
            "content": "Thank you Frank and good morning everyone. If you're following along at our new slides, I'll cover some detail on each of our segments. We had a strong first quarter in light of continued pressure from the pandemic across the globe. Q1 represents the final period of pre-pandemic comparison points with the impact beginning to materialize in the final two weeks of March last year. Total company internal revenue growth was 4% in the quarter led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 8%. First quarter adjusted operating income was up a strong 15% to $1.1 billion and adjusted operating margin increased by a very strong 360 basis points to 31.4%. This margin improvement was driven by our rigorous cost synergy execution, which produced $129 million of incremental cost synergies in the quarter as well as strong operating performance. First quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 18% to $1.17 compared to $0.99 in the prior year. Free cash flow in the quarter was $821 million, up 8% over Q1 last year and 103% percent conversion to adjusted net income impacting Q1's free cash flow was an increase in accounts receivable driven by a strong rebound in March. Turning to each of the segments, internal revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was 8% in the quarter. Our results were once again driven by strong performances in our portfolio of SMB clients supported by our Clover platform, enterprise clients supported by Carat and another strong quarter from our ISV business. This result includes a meaningful headwind from our EMEA region, which experienced restrictions for much of the quarter in several important markets for us including the UK, Germany, Ireland and Poland. As Frank discussed, our Clover GPV continues to grow very nicely, up 36% in the quarter. The outlook for the SMB business looks strong as a sequential uplift that we witnessed in this business in the last few weeks of March has continued through April. Our integrated payments or ISV business continues to perform extremely well with continued strong revenue growth in the quarter. As we discussed at our Investor Day, we recently rolled out Clover Connect, a Clover integrated solution for ISVs. We believe that this solution will further extend our differentiation for ISVs and their merchant customers and continue to drive excellent growth in the future. Adjusted operating income in the Acceptance segment increased 37% to $387 million in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was up 650 basis points to 27.7% driven by the strength in the topline and continued cost synergies. The Fintech segment internal revenue grew 2% in the first quarter compared to the prior year as growth in high quality recurring revenue was again partially offset by lower periodic revenue most prominently termination fees, which created approximately 150 basis points of headwind to internal revenue growth in the quarter. The shift toward digital banking and the result in strong demand for our broader way of digital solutions continues. For example, total mobile subscribers across our leading digital platforms, Mobiliti and Architect, grew 12% in the quarter. Mobile deposits in Q1 grew 30% over the prior year, while self-service ATM deposits grew 65% over last year. We expect these trends to continue as users who have moved to mobile or ATM for check deposits may adopt these as preferred channels after experiencing their convenience and safety. Adjusted operating income was up a strong 21% in the quarter to $246 million. Adjusted operating margin in the segment increased a robust 510 basis points in the quarter to 33.4% on a combination of growth in processing revenue, operational effectiveness benefits and cost synergies. The Payments and Network segment saw internal revenue grew 2% in the first quarter as growth in our card services, output solutions Zelle and prepaid businesses including the benefit from revenue synergies was partially offset by headwinds in our bill-pay and credit businesses. Debit transactions grew a strong 16% year-over-year, slightly ahead of levels last quarter. We continue to see excellent transaction growth in solutions such as our account-to-account transfers and P2P. Both Zelle transactions and the number of clients live on Zelle more than doubled in the quarter versus a year ago. Our bill pay and credit businesses in particular given our retail private label mix saw headwinds from the pandemic that we expect to subside as we reach the second half of the year with better economic activity and better revenue comparisons. Adjusted operating income for the segment was up 2% to $585 million and adjusted operating margin was up 20 basis points to 41.4% in the quarter. The results were driven by positive impact of both revenue and cost synergies in part offset by the lower revenue in our higher margin credit processing and bill pay businesses. The adjusted corporate operating loss was $102 million in the quarter, in line with our expectations. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 17.2% flat versus prior year. We also expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate to be fairly consistent with the 2020 rate in the range of 21% to 22%. During the quarter, we continued our disciplined capital allocation strategy by repurchasing 5.2 million shares for $612 million and we have more than 16 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase. In addition, as Frank mentioned earlier, we completed the acquisition of Ondot Systems in January and increased our investment related to the Tegra118, our former investment services business. In connection with this combination with Wealthtech Holdings. Total debt outstanding was $21.2 billion at March 31 and the debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio remained at 3.6 times. We are on track to achieve our targeted leverage of less than 3 times in the second half of 2021 as we anticipate both strong adjusted EBITDA growth and debt repayment this year. As you heard us emphasize throughout our Investor Day in December, we're fully committed to our long-standing capital allocation strategy, which includes maintaining a strong balance sheet, making organic investment in innovative solutions and pursuing high value acquisitions like Ondot, Radius8 and Pineapple Payments. Importantly, share repurchase remains our benchmark for capital deployment. With that, let me turn the call back to Frank. Thank you. Good morning. Dave, recall during our earnings call last quarter 90 days ago, when we talked about the cadence of our revenue growth, we expected Q1 to be below the full- year guidance range, given the comps against pre-pandemic period really all of January, February and half of March, then second quarter would actually be above the full-year guidance range with the second half of the year more in line with that overall full year. We do expect sequentially to continue to see seasonality benefit Q1 to Q2 in the Merchant segment. We also see the benefit of pandemic continuing to subside, particularly in the US as more and more people get inoculated and hopefully improvement in EMEA as some of the lockdowns began to be relaxed. Yeah, Darrin. I think there's a couple of things that will play. Number one is as Frank pointed out, while we have strength of diversity of geography and client base, meaning we serve the largest retailers in the world, all the way down to the smallest SMBs, the breadth has served us well. But we also of course have pretty meaningful exposure to restaurants and retail that have still a lot of recovery ahead of them that will help us with growth going forward. We think we've outperformed the market in the last four, six, eight quarters, quite frankly, and we have the opportunity to continue that. The other dynamic of course is as Clover and ISV and e-comm, which are growing faster than the overall average, become a larger part. You will see better growth from those becoming a more meaningful piece of the overall company. As we pointed out $1 billion e-comm business to grow nicely, it becomes a bigger part of that $6 billion segment and providing some nice growth. Yeah, sure. We feel great about the position that we're in, good cash generation in the first quarter. I mentioned in my prepared remarks, a little bit of accounts receivable growth driven this given the strong March, which of course will generate cash in the second quarter as we collect those receivables, 103% conversion in the first quarter, well on track to do the 108% for the full year. So we feel that we've got continued good strong free cash flow generation, gives us the capacity to buy back shares and of course, as you heard us lay out in our earnings, looks to me at our Investor Day back in December $30 billion of capital to deploy over the next five years. We did a meaningful buyback in the first quarter and we see the opportunity to do that for the balance of the year. Yeah. Dan. I think there is a couple of things. If you look at the year-over-year growth rate obviously given the pre-pandemic comparison in January and February and then March half of the quarter was pre-pandemic. The other half -- half a month -- the other half of the month was a pretty severe shutdown as particularly in the US, but also in Europe. People really significantly went home and commerce really took a hit in the second half of March last year. So you see the year-over-year comp get significantly better in those last two weeks. If you just look at kind of the raw transactions, January started out the year, the quarter strong, February as Frank mentioned, we saw some weather, particularly in the south in the US slow things down a bit, and then March came back quite a bit stronger. If you -- if you can adjust for weather, I would say January started out nice, February again adjusted for weather was again in line or good with January and then we started seeing things really pick up in March, I'm sure not coincidentally and help supported by the SIM 3 payments that started flowing out. And we've seen that continue into April. So we're definitely feeling the the recovery of the pandemic as vaccines really spread in the US. We're seeing more and more commerce retail picking up, restaurants starting to pick up, still down year-over-year in a meaningful way but starting to improve sequentially pretty nicely. Yeah. Andrew, there -- as you pointed out, we saw some very nice KPIs support in the overall payments business, Zelle with both the number of transactions and number of users doubling certainly supports debit processing as well as the debit network performing quite well. We continue to love the acquisition of Ondat and our ability to provide additional digital services for card controls and card activation to our overall channel. We see that as a significant growth opportunity not only to obviously provide that particular capability, but that as an overall part of our solution. We certainly have the benefit of some of the significant wins in the credit issuing business that we talked about over the last couple of quarters beginning to ramp late 2021 and into 2022. The 2% growth in the Payments segment in the first quarter here is not an indication of where we see the opportunity for the full year. There are some definite headwinds there from the pandemic that we expect to subside. And I think we said this at the end of last earnings call, but still believe it today. We expect the Payments segment for the full year to be at the upper end of the medium-term outlook for internal revenue. So we believe 2022, 2023 that Payments segment can grow 5% to 8% and we think this year will be at the upper end of that as we head into the second half of the year and we see the full-year results. So I think we're in a great spot. We'll see some continued growth, particularly in our digital side of the Payments and we'll see improvement in that bill pay and credit issuing particularly the retail private label in the second half. Yeah, I think, that's the right way to think about it. There is certainly opportunity going forward and we'll see obviously how the economy rebounds into the second half of the year. All indications right now are quite strong. It's why we lifted the bottom end of our guidance range now twice in a row from 7% back in December to 8% in last quarter and now 9%. We see the economy improving and that helps overall Merchant Acceptance it helps the overall company but Merchant Acceptance in that spread also. Thanks, Tsein-tsin. Yeah, I think the way to think about it is, number one, we do think the growth rate of Clover is quite sustainable. We've seen very strong growth the last several years, 25%. 30%, 35%, 40% in a given quarter. I think you saw in fourth quarter really the second half of last year some slowing driven the pandemic obviously as we anniversary that and continue to see, as Frank pointed out, new business formation that certainly is a beneficiary to Clover given the depth of our channel capability and our distribution system, we think we can benefit very nicely from that new business formation. So I would expect that Clover revenue to me their GPV growth to continue for some time going forward, and we continue to invest in capability there and continue to enhance our solution set. Yeah. For Q1, that periodic headwind, which again was largely driven by termination fees, was about 150 basis points. Said another way, outside of that, we would have grown about 350 bps. We do expect the headwind to continue into second quarter although to a slightly abated rate level and then as we enter the second half of the year that will no longer be a headwind for us going forward as it gets to a diminished level and then we'll see what happens beyond that in terms of, as the economy improves, do you see more bank mergers, which tends to be a driver of termination fees, but that headwind subsides a bit in Q2 and then I anticipated not being a headwind that we discussed in the second half of the year. Sure. Thank you. Yeah, I would -- that is essentially -- our credit issuer processing business is not transaction driven. And so as we see the economy improve in more active accounts, we'll see an improvement in that revenue. And so that's a bit of a lagging indicator and we expect that to to take place really in the second half, as the economy improves, we'll see more activity. In addition, you'll get different comparisons. And so we think that helps lift the growth of the the Payments segment and obviously the credit issuer processing. Certainly feels like it's in the right trajectory though, as you say the restrictions are beginning to lift UK in particular and hopefully some of the other countries in that region soon. Yeah, we didn't give a guidance for '21, that 4% to 6% is our medium-term guidance. We don't give specific in your guidance on our [Indecipherable] segment level. I'd just reiterate we did -- we printed it too, if you adjust for the periodic revenue. It's a 3.5% in the quarter that subsides pretty meaningfully in the second quarter and is no longer a headwind in the third and fourth quarter. So we'll see a nice uptick in that segment and believe we'll be in that range in the second half of the year for sure. Okay. Thank you, guys. Congrats on the results. Thank you very much."

            "name": "Frank J Bisignano",
            "content": "Thank you, Shub. Great to have you on the team. 2021 is off to a strong start with Q1 at or better than our expectations across a broad range of metrics. The strength of our results reflects our continued investment in technology, innovation, our client portfolio and our people through the COVID-19 pandemic. Let me provide a brief overview of our strong financial results in the quarter. You may have noticed that Q1 earnings presentation has been updated. If you're following along. I will provide some overview comments captured on the first three pages. And then Bob will provide more detail on a subsequent slides. Total company internal revenue growth was 4% for the quarter, including low double-digit growth in March. That performance was led by our Merchant Acceptance segment, which was up 8%, an exceptional result in light of the global pandemic and continued COVID restrictions, particularly in Brazil, India and a variety of countries in EMEA for much of the quarter. Adjusted operating margin grew 360 basis points resulting in an 18% increase in adjusted earnings per share. Free cash flow grew 8% to $821 million, a 100% conversion to adjusted net income. Our sales momentum remains quite strong as first quarter sales were up 42%, which strong results in our payments and international businesses and this momentum continues into the second quarter. Yesterday, we announced a 20-year agreement with Caixa Economica Federal to become the exclusive provider of Merchant Acquiring Services. Caixa is one of Brazil's largest banks with more than 26,000 sales outlets and a broad presence throughout all of Brazil, making this one of the largest wins for our company in Latin America and one of the largest globally. Also this morning, we announced a new solution with PayPal to enable our merchant network across the Clover and Carat platforms to accept payments via PayPal and Venmo through QR codes presented at the point of sale. We believe this is an important offering for our merchants as consumer preferences continue to shift toward touch free transactions. The combination of robust sales and excellent pipeline is evidence that our formula of bringing the strength and breadth of Fiserv's offerings together with our integrated sales model is extremely well received in the client's office and we believe bodes well for the future. Now I'd like to update you on how our leading digital enabled merchant business is performing through Clover, our leading SMB platform, Carat our enterprise omni-channel commerce solution and Clover Connect, our rich ISV solutions set. We continue to drive innovation, expand partnerships and deliver leading solutions to our merchant clients. The momentum within the digital enabled segments of the merchant business continues to be excellent. Clover's gross payment volume grew 36% year-over-year to $141 billion annualized. To provide some more context around the strength of the Clover platform, GPV has grown 75% from $81 billion in Q1 2019 in Q1 to $141 billion in Q1 this year, despite the economic headwinds from the pandemic. Carat, our enterprise omni-channel solution, continued to perform very well. E-commerce transactions grew 24% compared to prior year. Omni-channel transactions such as order ahead and pickup in store were up over 122% year-over-year. We won a record 51 new enterprise level e-commerce clients in the first quarter, including Cost Plus World Market, a US specialty retailer for which Fiserv has been chosen to provide e-commerce gateway, point-of-sale hardware devices and value-added services like security tokenization. We had a very strong result sales internationally. The notable wins in EMEA include Selecta, Europe's leading self-service retailer offering coffee and convenience food solutions for which Fiserv has been chosen to provide acquiring services and unattended POS hardware. In LatAm, we extended our relationship with one of the largest e-commerce marketplaces in the region. In APAC, we won the Merchant Acquiring business where Australia's second largest bill payment provider. We also expanded our relationship with key brands such as state barn [Phonetic] where we are piloting a new digital payout experience for insurance claims. Recognizing our innovation to bring digital payments to all consumers, Fiserv was named one of the world's most innovative companies by Fast Company for our role in enabling the acceptance of US Department of Agriculture SNAP Online EBT payments during the pandemic. We continue to see great momentum in the ISV space with Clover Connect. In the first quarter, we signed 42 new ISV partners. Our continuing strength and expanding partner relationships is driving strong results in active merchants, which were up 38% in Q1 and ISV channel revenue growth, which was up 34%. For example, during the quarter, Fiserv further cemented its lead in the mortgage servicing software vertical by signing a strategic partnership agreement with mortgage cadence, an accentured company, which provides more origination software to the mortgage industry. This is yet another example of a successful integrated cell continuing to fuel future growth in our ISV channel. Additionally, we are continuing to build and enhance our existing ISV relationships by leveraging our technology and market knowledge. In the quarter, we finalized an agreement with e-tail head [Phonetic] to move their large set of existing merchants to us and build upon the agreement we had in place for new merchants. Moving to our account processing business, we continue to expand our [Indecipherable] relationships across financial institutions of all sizes and types. We signed 10 new core account processing clients in the quarter, including five on the DNA platform. I'd like to highlight a few of our recent wins. As we mentioned on our last earnings call, we signed Republic First Bank, a commercial bank with more than $5 billion in assets and rated America's Best Bank by Forbes for a full service of Fiserv products including core processing, card services and output solutions in February. Additionally, we signed two de novo banks in the quarter, including Genesis Bank, a newly chartered bank focus as a minority depository institution. This win continues to show our commitment to supporting minority communities. Majority of these illustrative wins were competitive takeaways with a common characteristic. The client selected a leading core platform plus multiple surround digital solutions to support their goals of sustained growth and superior customer service. These wins also like the strength of our offering for a wide range of clients from de novo banks to large financial institutions. In our payment and network segment, we continue to leverage the power of our combined solutions to drive revenue synergies. In Q1, we signed a significant new agreement to provide statement and letter services to a major US healthcare services provider strengthening our position in this industry vertical. Further building on our digital momentum in Q1, we signed agreements to provide digital solutions to First Horizon Bank as well as 10 fed credit union in both cases leveraging our newly acquired Ondot capabilities. Through Ondot, we can enable our FI [Phonetic] clients to offer their cardholders personalized, real time digital experiences, driving cardholder engagement and spend. We expect continued adoption of these digital solutions across our client base. With that, let me update you on our integration efforts. Through Q1, we've already actioned nearly $1.1 billion of cost savings and are well on our way to fully action $1.2 billion cost synergy objective by the end of this year. With the majority of the integration work behind us, we are focused on driving further growth and sustainable value in the years ahead. On the revenue side, we're pleased with the level of synergy sales, which accelerated in the first quarter. As of the end Q1, we've already actioned $265 million in annual revenue synergies and our synergy sales pipeline is growing robustly. And we expect to meet or or exceed our $600 million target over the five years post-merger. Our bank merchant program continues to be a synergy opportunity and offers financial institutions of all sizes, the ability to offer their important merchant clients a modern suite of merchant acquiring capabilities, including the innovative Clover platform along with digital capabilities like loyalty programs and e-commerce solutions. In the first quarter, we added 34 new bank merchant clients, six with assets over $1 billion. Additionally, half of these wins were competitive takeaways. The pipeline remains robust through the rest of 2021. One final point on our digital initiatives before turning it over to Bob. As you've heard us discussed in the past, one of the most important strategic initiatives is to redefining the client experience by utilizing the latest technology to drive innovation and offer digital capabilities across our payments ecosystem. An example of that commitment to this area is the acquisition of Ondat Systems, a leading digital experience platform provider for financial institutions of all sizes, which closed in the first quarter. We also acquired Raduis8, a cloud-based platform that had hyperlocalized commerce capabilities to Carat thereby enhancing our beyond the buy button strategy. Last but not least, we announced the definitive agreement to acquire Pineapple Payments, a leading ISO focused on integrated payments. Now, let me pass the discussion to Bob for more detail on our financial results. Thanks, Bob. Given our strong Q1 performance and an improved economic outlook, we are raising the low end of our outlook range for both internal revenue and adjusted EPS growth. We now expect 2021 internal revenue growth to be in the 9% to 12% range versus 8% to 12% previous. We expect adjusted EPS to be in the $5.35 to $5.50 range, which is a 21% to 24% growth over last year. This is up $0.05 at the bottom end from our prior outlook. We continue to expect adjusted operating margin to expand by at least 250 basis points and free cash flow conversion to be greater than 108% for the year. The range for internal revenue and adjusted EPS growth outlook are grounded in our performance to date. The current state of the economy and our internal assumptions about the trajectory of economic recovery, both of which have improved versus February when we provided our prior outlook. To remind you, the low end of our original outlook in February assumed no material economic recovery from where we were at that time. Similarly, the 9% at the low end of our updated outlook assumes the same no material economic recovery for the remainder of the year. Regionally, we are seeing good economic progress in the US driven both by government stimulus as well as COVID vaccine distribution with uneven recovery outside the US as more pronounced COVID impacts persisted in parts of EMEA, LatAm and APAC. As we indicated during our last earnings call, given the timing of the pandemic impact last year, we expect more variability in quarterly growth in 2021. Given difficult comparisons, we expected Q1 performance to be below our full-year outlook range and at once. We expect Q2 growth rates will be above the full-year outlook range driven by our business momentum and an easier year ago comparison. I'm proud of the results we've delivered as we navigate the ongoing global crisis. Our business has shown incredible strength and resilience leading to what we expect to be our 36th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings-per-share growth in 2021 and setting a foundation for even stronger results beyond. In addition to delivering on our financial results, we continue to focus on our community. During the quarter, we successfully completed our back to business grant program in the original six locations that were selected in 2020. We also held two additional programs in Milwaukee partnering with the Milwaukee Bucks to celebrate Black History month, March 2 event partnering with the Bucks and Nancy Lieberman during Women's History Month to award additional brands to minority women owned small businesses. Last, let me thank our more than 40,000 talented associates around the world for their commitment and courage as we stand together to deliver value for clients, our colleagues and for you, our shareholders. With that, operator, let's open the line for questions. Thanks, David. Good morning. Yeah, I'd take it at the macro level. January and February obviously began a little movement up in volume, but really not very much. If you remember, in February we talked to you all and gave a little look at what we saw up until then, and that's when we took really that bottom end up from through the flow up from 7 to 8 because we felt better than it did when we talk to you on December 8 at Investor Day. We did see a strong March. We saw a weaker February in the US. I'd credit a fair amount of that to whether there is store [Phonetic] going on. We saw a stronger March, but I think on top of that we saw more lockdowns in EMEA and Brazil as I had talked about previously, although hampered tremendously by COVID still had spending going on. And I feel as we come into April and as we're going to head to the end of it we see the progression in the US. Obviously, India is a challenged environment in total right now. EMEA is beginning to open up and Brazil continues to perform. And why we take the bottom up from 8 to 9 there if that's helpful here. Yeah, I think you're thinking about it right. I mean look at it -- and January versus last January was definitely a back compare would consider Q2 and why we talked about it as being outside the top end of the range is because it's against the weak comp. So I would expect that seasonality to perform better than you would have ever seen. Great to talk to you in the morning too, Dave. Yeah, I think Mercialys [Phonetic] think about Clover growth very, very strong, e-comm wins and that's the backlog that is on boarding continues to be very, very strong. Our ISV business performing well. I mean lockdowns in EMEA definitely affect us and I would see us coming, we could feel that in the UK opening up. Our client mix, we've been bullish on the whole way, but I've also been very clear that we have a huge diversed client base from SMEs to large enterprises across every industry sector as well as the large presence in geographies. And so I think when you look at outlook goal, we still have lagging verticals, restaurants, travel and services. So we have an expectation in the later second quarter and in the third quarter that recover well. We've invested heavily and Clover continue to do it heavily and Carat continue to do it heavily and Clover Connect. So I look forward to us being able to continue the type of momentum we have for a long time. Sorry again, Darrin. I'd say, first of all, we continue to hear in there and when you hear us talk about the addition of new bank programs we view every one of those as us ultimately driving digital adoption, right? We always believe that partners were great places for digital adoption and we believe Clover itself was great place for digital adoption. When you look at the totality of our business globally, I would still put it in the not meaningful in total category, but a channel, which continues to accelerate its growth and one that we believe we will deliver more integrated opportunities for digital sign-up. And when you think about things we will do longer-term with our bank partners having a one of a kind digital experience for that bank merchant partner while continuing to work with Paychex and the Verizons also and using our direct channels to digitally sign up. So I think it will be part of the five-year journey we talk about. It's not the overwhelming part of our sign-up machine, but our capability is huge and our ability to attract new partners because of that digital capability and sign up merchants is being contributing to the growth rate. Well, I think it fits completely in our strategy. We've always viewed us as a partner of choice., a great distributor. We operate in basically every vertical and every capability and you hear us today, talk about extending our relationship in Brazil, in Latin America with one of the largest income players. That's really an example of us, our commitment to market places actually and you'll see that happen internally on the new open coming marketplaces us being an enabler and a distributor for them too. So I think we have a deep commitment there as you can capabilities are strong and you hear it and the things we will say today in our announcement. Thank you, Dan. Well, if you think about, -- it's a global -- it's a global business we're in. So you saw us announcing a large deal in Brazil. And we've been -- we started that Brazilian business back '14 and '15 and we've been taking share beyond where anybody had thought was capable on that market itself. So I'd point to that because we weren't a big ISV player back in '15 and '16 or probably '17 until we bought CardConnect and BluePay [Phonetic] but there we fit together with Clover and began that journey. You see that. You well know probably people thought we're an e-comm lagger [Phonetic] and we continue to win in that space. Now in summary statements. It's new markets but in many cases, taking it from all the places you won't suspect and you know I would look at us saying, hey, if you go through the hundreds of bank merchant wins we have talked about, fundamentally, those are 50% takeaways. So we continue to compete against everybody very strongly. And that in every market and in every vertical and it gets back to what we had said on Investor Day, when you look at this portfolio with Clover, with Clover Connect, with Carat, with global distribution with the client base that we have from largest in the world to the corner as I like to say it the corner store I think we've built a business that's the most diverse and probably has the most technology in all honesty. Yeah. Well a pandemic, I guess, a lot of people did shut down their businesses and get a lot of people to open up new businesses. I think we're going to see the strongest small business formation in the second half that we've ever seen. And that's why these channels we have are so darn valuable. Our commitment to the small businesses you probably saw us as a technical provider one of a few to the SBA for the restaurant brand. So I think we've done a good job over the long haul of keeping our clients and I think our Clover platform, our ISV platform, our Carat platform all are well received by our client base. And I look for strength in small business formation even for those who shut down to come back in a different shape and form. So I guess churn seems very good for us, if you want to think about attrition, I mean we feel strong about what job we're doing and of course any client leaving upsets us at any level. But I think the other part we got to put on top of it is tremendously strong small business formation and why all of these channels we have we believe are so darn valuable for us in that process. Yeah, I mean Star and Excel are standout performers for us and our investment and business continues to be large. I think you'll continue to see us invest where card on PINless debit and other aspects around signature too as we had talked about over time. That's a long haul. It's not a short haul. It's a lot of the infrastructure work, but we're investing heavily in the network and we have a deep belief in the growth in network and the power of the network, especially in this company, where we have a network business and we have merchants and it is good for financial institutions, Star and Excel together and good ground merchants, so a long journey. But that will continue to be something that we'll talk to you about it and we're committed to and show as part of the star-performing businesses in the company. No but intended. Well, I think, first, we feel great about our capabilities and the total hand we have, The tuck-ins have played very, very well for us for a very long time. I think if you'll look at Ondot and you're going to see that gets spread across the product base, to client base that digital capability and integrated fashion. I think Pineapple takes us on another area around our ISV capability. I think if you look at Radius8, it is about bringing that across this large platform, so they played very, very well for us. We've been very committed to our capital allocation strategy, tried and true and all of these acquisitions fit exactly within that envelope but of course, we pay attention, think about everything and as a dynamic world it keeps changing. So I think we're pretty committed to the path we're on, and we think about all things in the market always around the table. And so it has to work for our shareholders for it to make sense and that's why we held our capital allocation strategy. Thank you. I think the UK is, we can feel it, we see it. I think referred to potentially somewhere along the line here too. I think Ireland still has challenges but you know, our expectation is that in the second half. EMEA is in recovery. I don't want to be thinking too hard about this quarter itself as much as the full year. And we believe the EMEA business will perform well in the second half. I think it's been under pressure in the first half. I'd like to thank everybody for their time today. I look forward to taking to you all. And we appreciate everything you do. Have a great day."

At this time, I will turn the call over to Julie Chariell, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv.\nJulie Chariell: Thank you, and good morning. With me today on the call are Frank Bisignano, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and supplemental materials for the quarter and full year are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Please refer to these materials for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call, along with a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. Unless otherwise stated, performance references are year-over-year comparisons. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results and strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. You should refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. And now over to Frank.\nFrank Bisignano: Thank you, Julie. And thank you all for joining us today to discuss the strong ending to a pivotal year at Fiserv. 2022 marked a year of great progress for us with better-than-expected growth against the challenging backdrop. The integration of First Data and Fiserv wrapped up in the first half, and we are entering 2023 with a focus on growth and operational excellence to drive quality and productivity to the next level. We laid out a plan for our merchant segment that includes extending Clover's leadership and are on pace to achieve our 2025 objectives. We won awards for our new enterprise omnichannel solution, Carat, and continue to roll out this unified commerce platform with a leading number of value-added services. In payments, we completed the 3 major credit issuer implementations and followed them up with 2 major new wins in the fourth quarter. And we advanced our core banking cloud road map for new and existing clients with the acquisition and integration of Finxact. Through all of that, we navigated the return to office and are seeing a boost in productivity as our employees come back together, many in new state of the art facilities. We head into 2023 as a unified company that's better than the sum of its parts. One with faster growth and deeper investment that still holds a tradition of strong operating leverage, high recurring revenue and value-accretive capital allocation. Our progress over the last 2 years is undeniable after consecutive years of 11% organic revenue growth, 370 basis points of total adjusted operating margin improvement, and over $5 billion in share repurchases. We delivered on our guidance with a steep ramp in the fourth quarter with 12% organic revenue growth, 360 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement and adjusted earnings per share of $1.91. This led to 2022 results within the guidance range, which we raised twice last year despite unexpected FX headwinds. For the year, organic revenue growth was 11%; adjusted operating margin expanded 120 basis points to 35.1%; and adjusted EPS was $6.49, up 16%. Free cash flow conversion was 84% as we continued to invest for growth. Each of our operating segments recorded strong performance, led by Merchant Acceptance with organic revenue growth of 16% and 17% in the quarter and year, respectively. Our Clover and Carat operating systems are driving segment growth well above pre-pandemic levels. Our newer products, such as Data as a Service, pay by bank, disbursements and EBT online, widen the value proposition to clients and bolster our strong positioning in card and non-card payments.  Expanded ISV and direct sales channels extend outreach to merchants and help us capture more of the value in each transaction. Payments and Network revenue had a superb year of growth, up 10% organically in the fourth quarter and 9% for the year, above our medium-term guidance range. Performance was led by implementations of 3 top-25 credit issuing customers and continued growth with existing customers. We followed this up with 2 major new credit wins in the fourth quarter with Target, one of the largest retailers in the world; and with Desjardins, the largest credit union consortium in Canada and the fourth-largest card issuer. We are very excited to bring 1 of the world's largest retailers onto our platform, and we're pleased to expand our geographic reach in Canada with Desjardins. It is another example of a major in-house card issuer partnering with us to achieve industry-leading capability. And it's our first connection with a major Canadian issuer, giving us important scale in a key market. We've already begun working with both clients and anticipate revenue starting in 2024. In Fintech, we delivered 8% organic revenue growth in the quarter, rebounding from third quarter as expected. For the full year, we generated 5% of organic growth, at the midpoint of our medium-term guidance. Core wins were robust over the last several quarters and continue to go live, adding to an already strong recurring revenue base in this segment. Interest in Finxact is exceeding our expectations, and we're excited to extend our leadership in cloud core banking by going live with digital bank, [ Chello ]. We continue to believe we have the most clients in production in the cloud. We are carrying this positive momentum forward into 2023. This year, we expect organic revenue growth of 7% to 9%, adjusted operating margin expansion above 125 basis points and adjusted earnings per share of $7.25 to $7.40, which assumes a mild recession in the U.S. Our guidance reflects internal confidence in the face of external uncertainty. This confidence is built on the strength of our unparalleled client base, our industry-leading distribution, a broad and growing product portfolio and our best-in-class management team. We have the revenue base, the profit-driven cash flow and sturdy balance sheet that should sustain us through a tougher economy. It's times like these that make it good to be an industry leader that continues to invest in new and innovative products. Nowhere was this strong positioning more evident then in the many noteworthy contract extension and product additions signed with existing clients in the fourth quarter. These wins are a reflection of 4 factors: First, our list of clients is vast, high-quality and full of opportunity, and our relationships with them are deep; second, we have the broadest portfolio of solutions supporting both growth and operating efficiency for our clients; third, our client-first relationship model is off to a strong start; and fourth, our vision for the cross-sell opportunity between Fiserv and First Data offerings has become reality. The promise of the merger is being realized. Synergies are apparent. For example, between acquiring and core banking, core banking and embedded finance, and card issuing services across multiple verticals. In Merchant Acceptance, for example, we expanded our global relationship with ExxonMobil. This energy giant will move to the Carat platform to support its retail fuel stations in the U.S. and Canada with gateway, acquiring and fraud security services. We also renewed Carat's contract with one of the largest beauty retailers in the U.S. and added network tokens to their e-commerce system to help increase authorizations, reduce cost and limit fraud. And a major restaurant operator will extend our Merchant Acquiring and prepaid business to more of its brands. In the Payments and Network segment, in addition to the significant Target and Desjardins wins, we expanded our existing relationship with the State of California. After a successful rollout of the Middle Class Tax Refund program in the fourth quarter, we were awarded another prepaid mandate supporting California's unemployment and related insurance programs. This, along with disbursement support for the comptroller's office announced in October, represents longer-term recurring work for the state and marks our leadership in payments for the government vertical. We also signed a large e-commerce payments company for debit network services. This client will enable our STAR and Accel networks for its millions of merchants as an alternative to the larger debit networks. And in Fintech, as a proof point of our deep relationships, ability to cross-sell products and seize synergy from our merger, we continue to add solutions for Webster Bank since its merger with Sterling National Bank earlier this year. In addition to the account processing win we announced in the third quarter, we've now added the Optus platform and ATM services to the growing list of solutions we provide. Similarly, Bethpage Federal Credit Union has also added several of our payments products to its existing core banking platform. In keeping with the emerging trend of core modernization, Innovation Credit Union of Canada will be the latest client to move from a licensed solution of DNA to a hosted version in the Microsoft Azure Cloud. This is one of a couple of dozen DNA customers migrating to the cloud for more flexibility and resilience in their infrastructure. It highlights the modern architecture of DNA, Fiserv's experience in the cloud and further migration from license to ASP revenue. Outside the U.S., we made important progress in EMEA, adding Absa Bank in Mauritius as a client of our Internet gateway. This will allow Absa clients to tap into the fast-growing e-commerce segment in Africa and grow with key corporate clients that are active in this well-known tourist destination. It also opens the door for us to enter 8 other countries in Sub-Sahara Africa where Absa operates today. In Latin America, we extended a large bank acquiring relationship to include several more countries. And in APAC, we signed India's Tata Motors for loan processing and attained a major payment institution license in Singapore. This will allow us to expand beyond merchant acquiring into domestic and cross-border money transfer services, a market that has $180 billion of payment flow. A key to our new and following wins is the significant investment we have made to bring new product to market, increase our value to existing customers, open the door to new customers and grow our TAM. Let me recap just a few of our innovation and advancements this year, starting with merchant. In the SMB space, we serve small businesses wherever they want to conduct business through cloud-based operating systems like Clover, through our channel partners, including ISVs, banks and ISOs; and on platforms that act as payment facilitators, or PayFac. At Clover, we integrated the BentoBox acquisition into the Clover platform to add more e-commerce and digital capability to our offerings in the restaurant vertical. Catering services and hotel restaurants are emerging subverticals for us now, and we know that when Bento and Clover are sold together, we see an over 3x increase in average revenue per user. We also rolled out lower-cost hardware and partnered with major providers of retail technology to offer web and point-of-sale inventory solutions to this large SMB vertical. We've begun migrating merchants from our existing Internet gateway to a new Clover gateway where they can more easily access our full suite of value-added services. This positions Clover to compete more for card-not-present business this year from a position of strength. Value-added services penetration, an important driver of Clover growth and ARPU, reached 16% in the quarter from 13% a year earlier. One example is Clover Capital, a product we continue to invest in, is growing rapidly and favorably impacting customer attrition in the SMB segment. In the ISV channel, we've added 174 ISV partners this year and continue to benefit from the high growth and lower customer acquisition costs of this go-to-market approach. Since our acquisition of NetPay, we continue to build PayFac, marketplace and software platform solutions, including real-time boarding, underwriting and split pay services. In the quarter, Fiserv continued to expand and deepen our platform integrations with partners that include PayPal, offering our customers more flexibility in their service offerings. We look forward to exploring other integrations with current and future partners while expanding our capabilities across this market. Carat, our leading enterprise omnichannel solution, continues to expand its capabilities, including payout choice and flexibility. With the introduction of several products this year, including digital checks; prepaid cards and crypto wallets; followed by our multi-purse wallet, a white-label solution that holds multiple sources of value, including loyalty and prepaid. We continue to onboard large merchants for Pay by Bank, which lowers the cost of acceptance for merchants and is an easy way for consumers to earn rewards. And we have seen a strong early uptake in our new Data as a Service offering, partnering with Snowflake. It enables our merchant customers to access their payments data in near real time to better inform business decisions. We also have a growing number of financial institutions lined up to pilot our Open Data solution offered in partnership with Snowflake. Open Data enables near real-time access to data across customers, accounts and activities, bringing relevant insights to support strategic decisions. In Payments and Network, our strong growth in issuer solutions can be traced directly to the investments we've made in our operating platform, Optus. This includes a robust set of APIs, AI-based fraud management, cardholder experience technology via the Ondot acquisition, integrated output solutions, plus ongoing cloud enablement of key features. We have multiple payment innovations underway to take advantage of emerging trends, such as real-time payments. The clearinghouse RTP network, Zelle and FedNow, all work differently than legacy networks, creating demand for an end-to-end solutions provider. We are leveraging the Fiserv NOW network to be just that this year. In Fintech, we've been taking an open-source approach to serving our clients. We've pre-integrated third-party digital solutions into many of our cores and made these solutions discoverable to clients via our app marketplace. We've also made our platform attractive to the developer community by exposing our microservice APIs through our developer studio. Building on its Webby Award last year, this product won a DEVIES award from DeveloperWeek in January for best innovation and financial services. With these advancements, we are driving Fiserv to become the destination of choice for embedded finance, integrating card issuing and processing, merchant and core banking capabilities for a variety of nontraditional providers, including retailers, QSRs, payback and government entities. Another highlight of 2022 was the Finxact acquisition, our new cloud-native banking solution, which we've been integrating with our existing digital surrounds, selling to our existing clients as an innovation platform, or a sidecar core, and winning new logo sales. Our pipeline is particularly active with pioneering digital banks and big issuers entering the banking market via embedded finance. Finxact offers them faster time to market, greater flexibility and scalability and the largest product portfolio available, making it an ideal way to conceptualize, create and launch new banking products. With all of this new product development and the client wins that validate it, I hope you'll see why we remain enthusiastic for 2023. So let me pass the discussion to Bob for more detail on our financial results.\nRobert Hau: Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. If you're following along on our slides, I'll cover additional detail on total company and segment performance, starting with our financial metrics and trends on Slide 4. Fourth quarter and full year results reflected our focus on delivering on our commitments with momentum in all 3 business segments. Total company organic revenue growth was 12% in the quarter with ongoing strength in Merchant Acceptance, further growth in our Payments and Network segment and a rebound in the Fintech segment as previewed on our last earnings call. For the full year, total company organic revenue grew 11%, in line with the higher guidance we provided 90 days ago. This performance was led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 17%. Fourth quarter total company adjusted revenue grew 8% to $4.4 billion and adjusted operating income grew 20% to $1.7 billion, resulting in adjusted operating margin of 39.2%, an increase of 360 basis points versus the prior year and a sequential improvement of 400 basis points. As we anticipated, 4 factors drove this margin improvement: First, the final ramp-down of integration expenses and resulting productivity benefits; second, operating leverage on increased revenue and improved inflation comparisons; third, actions taken late in the third quarter and in fourth quarter to tighten spending in light of the uncertain macroeconomic conditions across the globe; and finally, the divesture of our Korea business and 2 small, low-margin nonstrategic units. As expected, the fourth quarter performance brought the full year adjusted operating margin to 35.1%, an increase of 120 basis points over 2021. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 22% to $1.91 compared to $1.57 in the prior year. Full year adjusted earnings per share increased 16% and to $6.49. Volume, productivity and operating performance more than offset the foreign exchange headwind of $0.25 for the full year. This was much higher than the $0.11 assumed in our guidance at the start of the year. Free cash flow came in at $1.4 billion for the quarter and $3.5 billion for the full year. Free cash flow conversion was a strong 115% of adjusted net income for this quarter. For the full year, free cash flow conversion was 84%, roughly in line with our expectations for approximately 85%, with a slight increase in accounts receivable on some slower collections. Now looking to our segment results, starting on Slide 6. Organic revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was a healthy 16% in the quarter and 17% for the full year, well ahead of our medium-term segment guidance of 9% to 12%. Adjusted revenue growth was 9% in the quarter and 13% for the full year. This is well ahead of the 11.5% annual growth rate needed to achieve our Merchant Acceptance segment revenue outlook of $10 billion by 2025, as laid out in our March 2022 investor call. As we've said, we grow and create value in 3 ways: First, attracting more merchants to our operating systems, our Clover active merchant count grew 9% in 2022; second, expanding our merchant relationships, the adoption of more value-added software and services, Clover VAS penetration reached 16% in the quarter, up 13% from last year; and third, by growing with our existing customer base, our average revenue per Clover merchant expanded 12% in 2022. In the quarter, merchant volume and transactions grew 6% and 3%, respectively. For the year, they grew 10% and 6%, excluding the loss of a processing client in mid-2021. Volume in local currency was up 8% for the quarter and 12% for the year, excluding the client loss. This is in line with our typical spread relative to the card networks. Factors that drove faster revenue growth include value-added services, new payment flows and value-based pricing. Turning to our merchant operating systems, Clover and Carat. We continue to post robust growth, and we're on track for $3.5 billion in Clover revenue by 2025 as presented at our Merchant Investor Call this past March. Clover revenue grew 23% in the fourth quarter on payment volume growth of 16%. For the full year, Clover revenue was up 25%. We posted above-average growth in Clover Capital, Clover Software and Marketplace SaaS. Clover Connect for ISVs continues to post very strong revenue growth and added 48 ISV partners in the quarter, totaling 174 for the full year. Carat, our Enterprise omnichannel solution, also had a strong quarter, with revenue growing at 15%. For the year, Carat revenue grew 18% on important new client wins and enhancements for existing clients. This includes our new client experience portals, which improve service and access to data while positioning us to sell more products, from data as a service to fraud services to emerging flows. In 2023, we will complete the build-out of our single orchestration layer known as Commerce Hub, which will allow our clients to more seamlessly integrate with the breadth and depth of our products and services and enhance our e-commerce capabilities. Adjusted operating income in the Merchant Acceptance segment increased 22% to $648 million in the quarter, with margin up 350 basis points to 34.8%. Full year adjusted operating income improved 16% to $2.3 billion and margin grew 100 basis points to 31.8%. The improvement in both periods was led by operating leverage and productivity. We completed the acquisition of Merchant One in late December, folding in this long-term Fiserv customer. This should enhance our direct merchant acquisition capabilities, extend the reach of our Clover product line and create cost synergies. We also acquired Yacare late in the quarter, expanding our capabilities in Argentina by enabling us to bring our QR code payment acceptance to our merchants there. We stand to rapidly become a significant QR code provider as we get this technology into customers' hands. Looking into 2023. In January, overall volume growth was stronger than volume growth in December. This is partly attributable to an easier year-over-year comparison but also indicates the ongoing strength of the consumer and the Fiserv brand. Turning to Slide 7. On the Payments and Network segment. Organic revenue grew 10% in the quarter. This growth was enabled by a variety of drivers across our business lines. Our North American credit active accounts on file grew 17%, driven by both new business onboarding and a favorable credit environment. The California Middle Class Tax Refund program was also an important contributor to revenue during the quarter. While the revenue was mostly onetime in nature, we've signed 2 additional contracts with the state that will bring in recurring revenue in 2023 and beyond. Full year organic revenue growth of 9% was above the upper end of our medium-term outlook range of 5% to 8%. Fourth quarter adjusted operating income for the segment was up 14% to $811 million, and margin was up 230 basis points to 48.5%, driven by strong operating leverage. For the full year, adjusted operating income was up 10% to $2.8 billion and margin expanded 120 basis points to 45.3%. Moving to Slide 8. In the Financial Technology segment, we posted 8% organic revenue growth for the quarter and 5% for the full year, right in the middle of our 4% to 6% medium-term guidance range. The rebound in nonrecurring revenue portions of this business: License, professional services and termination fees, was a meaningful contributor to growth in the fourth quarter, as we expected after those revenues slowed in the third quarter. Meanwhile, customer momentum continues, and we had 14 core wins in the quarter, including 8 competitive takeaways. Over the last 3 years, we have 155 core wins and a healthy backlog of implementations that offer solid visibility to revenue for 2023. Adjusted operating income was up 18% in the quarter to $340 million and up 7% to $1.2 billion for the full year. Adjusted operating margin in the segment increased 400 basis points to 41.3% in the quarter, helped by higher periodic revenue and productivity. Full year margin increased 70 basis points to 36.5%. The corporate adjusted operating loss was $88 million in the quarter, slightly improved from the first half run rate, and $444 million for the full year. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.3% and was 19.6% for the full year, in line with our expectations. We expect 2023's adjusted effective tax rate will be approximately 20% for the full year. Total debt outstanding was $21.4 billion on December 31. The debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio dropped another 0.1 turns to 2.8x, within our target leverage of being below 3x in the second half of the year. We have approximately 19% of our debt in variable rate instruments. During the quarter, we repurchased $750 million of our stock, bringing our total 2022 share repurchase to $2.5 billion and $5 billion over the last 24 months. We had 17 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase at the end of the quarter. Our long-standing capital allocation strategy will continue into 2023, defined by a strong balance sheet, share repurchases and complementary and innovative acquisitions. As we look through the mixed indicators on the 2023 economy, we are taking a measured approach to our outlook and assume a mild consumer spending recession, lower inflation and higher interest rates. As Frank said earlier, we expect organic revenue growth of 7% to 9%, in line with our medium-term guidance, with adjusted operating margin expansion of at least 125 basis points. This translates into adjusted earnings per share of $7.25 to $7.40 or 12% to 14% growth over 2022 and would represent our 38th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. This strong operating performance in a weaker economic environment reflects our continued investment in growth opportunities at a time when others may be cutting back. We are redirecting our free cash flow guidance toward dollars instead of conversion since this aligns more directly with how we run our business. We estimate approximately $3.8 billion of free cash flow for 2023. In the past 2 years, we increased our level of investment in growth initiatives, and it led to back-to-back years of accelerated 11% organic revenue growth. We see tremendous opportunity to do the same this year to invest in our growth platforms and continue to grow faster than our markets. We retain our focus on long-term free cash flow as a driver of long-term value for our shareholders. With that, let me turn the call back to Frank for some closing remarks.\nFrank Bisignano: Thanks, Bob. In the quarter, Fiserv provided Back2Business grants to 13 veteran and military spouse business owners through our partnerships in Atlanta. We also launched Back2Business in New Jersey, committing $1 million to small local minority-owned businesses. For the year, we awarded 241 such grants in total. The CDP published our GHG emissions results for 2021. They improved from the prior year in part because of the COVID shutdowns. We are encouraged by the future direction of our program since receiving LEED Gold status for our 1 Broadway space, awaiting LEED Platinum status for our new technology innovation center in Berkeley Heights, and pursuing LEED Gold for offices in Milwaukee and Dublin, Ireland. Overall, I am excited about what the next 5 years can bring for Fiserv. We are off to a great start in 2023, having just been recognized as the world's most admired company by Fortune Magazine for the 12th time in 15 years. I'm especially proud about our 2 most admired attributes, innovation and financial soundness, 2 particularly important qualities in the current environment. We delivered beyond expectations in the past year, and that was not by chance. It was the result of specific actions and thoughtful investment. The groundwork is laid for more strong performance to come. Leading products, bigger TAM, expanding geographies, better service and streamlined modern technology are in our grasp. The years I've spent at highly successful businesses have taught me that our reach must exceed our grasp. There is always room for improvement, so my leadership team and I are focused on driving greater productivity and better processes this year in the quest for operational excellence. I'm confident in our more than 40,000 Fiserv associates around the world. You come prepared to meet our high bar every day, and I thank you for all you do. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Solid results here. One question. I'll ask Frank, if you don't mind. You spent some time talking about how Fiserv is better than the sum of the parts with the cross-selling and the synergies, et cetera. Has your thinking on synergy contribution to growth changed at all in the last year or 2? Any way to size that in terms of contribution to growth maybe for fiscal '23 or the midterm outlook in general?\nFrank Bisignano: Well, I think if you look at this year's growth rate, obviously, at 11%, we can feel the power of the franchise coming together, right? And obviously, I like to step back on that question a little bit, too. Remember, we announced a merger, made the top 10 mergers of the year in 2019, and then we had a pandemic. And that definitely did not accelerate our ability to see clients, sell, get in front of them on offerings. We managed through it, we used all the tools available. But I think today, when you look through the company, the opportunities are larger than we thought. Remember, we said we're going to stop really talking about the synergy number. We put a bow on it, we closed out M&I and then continue to still working. But I think embedded in what you see in our growth rate and what we believe the promise was, it's much larger. And I think it will continue. It's just natural cross-sell now, but it's bringing -- we love talking about merchant acquiring and core banking, of the math at all those banks. We like to think about the opportunities, that we've got it by taking out larger capabilities across the company. And delivering more product to the government vertical, you see the things that we're doing that neither company did before, but the 2 together did. And I'd say I simply always think that this is a completely different company fundamentally in its fourth year. A new company where we took the 2 growth rates and exceeded either one, and we'll do that for the rest of our life, with the exception of a pandemic. So I think it's bigger than we ever thought. And I think you'll continue to see it, and it's definitely had an effect, and you see effect in the difference in the growth rate. So we see it in the 2 combined companies, and then from what we originally announced, and how it shows up in today's numbers. So thanks for asking that. It really does matter a lot. It's really we are getting the benefits of what we told you all we'd do, and it's better than we thought.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Lisa Ellis from SVB MoffettNathanson.\nLisa Dejong Ellis: Frank, another one for you as well. I was hoping to follow up on the growth in Payments and Networks, and specifically the 17% growth in North America credit account growth. I think this is several quarters in a row now you guys have highlighted mid-teens growth there, and then you highlighted 2 additional wins. Can you just elaborate a little bit on what is going on in the credit issuer processing space? Like you guys have a ton of momentum here right now. So kind of what's changed and what's driving that really strong momentum?\nFrank Bisignano: Yes. I think as you've watched the evolution over time, I start with we love operating systems, we love our platform systems. And the investments that we made in Optus through the cycle really has benefited us in the client's office. And I think it's the full enterprise capability that we bring. I think it's a single platform that we bring. It's the modernization of the platform that we did over the past few years. And I think we came and talked to you at 2020 Investor Day about the 3 large wins that were in the top 25. And then we continued to add. If you remember, I've said to many, I believe, that we did think those 3 top wins were a very, very, very onetime unique situation. But we came back and said, over the past year, we won as much as 3. And then we followed on with these 2 wins that we're pretty darn proud of, in the rank of Target and Desjardins. These are long-term big decisions for these issuers, long-term relationships. And I think the team has done an unbelievable job building out the platform, building out the capabilities all the way from loyalty to user interfaces. And so I think the fruits of this labor continue to come through, and that will be a ramp like the last one.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dave Koning from Baird.\nDavid Koning: Great job. And I guess my question, within the Acceptance segment, the gap between revenue growth and volume growth was pretty massive. It was 10%, which might be the biggest we've ever seen potentially. Is that the mix of SMBs? Like you're actually seeing SMBs really good? Is it just more products sold to Clover? You talked about that. Is it pricing? Maybe talk a little bit about that. And then is that sustainable through 2023?\nRobert Hau: Yes, Dave, it's Bob. Thanks for the question. The answer to your question is yes, it was those items. Obviously, we're continuing to see great growth in the business. We've talked about the key drivers of growth, getting more merchants, selling more to merchants, the value-added sales. You saw our penetration rate go up in Clover. We continue to build out our direct sales channel, the integration of Bento into the Clover solution significantly increases the ARPU. And then we saw some benefit of value-based pricing. So kind of across the board doing very well. And that's both in the SMB as well as in the enterprise markets for us. Am I going to suggest we'll continue that 10% every quarter going forward? No, I wouldn't lay that out. But we see tremendous opportunity for continued growth. We can call you back to our March investor call that we had on the merchant business. We think this is a $10 billion business in 2025. And 2022, the first year on that journey, was right on track.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays.\nRamsey El-Assal: Can you comment on growth in different geographies? I know Europe had seen some weakness previously. Where are you seeing the more robust growth across the globe versus some weakness?\nRobert Hau: Yes, Ramsey, definitely seeing some very nice growth across our 3 international regions. They are, for all practical purposes, almost double, maybe a little bit better than double our U.S. growth rate. Continue to see tremendous contribution. The fastest-growing region for us is certainly LatAm with good growth in Brazil and Argentina, particularly in the merchant space, but also seeing some nice traction and our credit issuing capability across the regions. We talked about expanding our reach with a large bank, growing our reach in a number of countries in Latin America this past quarter. Seeing good growth in APAC. Both of those obviously smaller than our footprint in EMEA. But even in EMEA, we're seeing good growth, particularly in the issuer space. So all 3 regions contributing to the growth. And in total, our international business growing almost double the rate of our domestic U.S. business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Timothy Chiodo from Credit Suisse.\nTimothy Chiodo: Great. Since distribution is one of your major advantages and super important to the Clover growth algorithm, you mentioned some of the various channels you have, the bank channel, direct sales, ISVs, ISOs. I was wondering if you could just give us an update on the mix in terms of where most of the new gross adds are coming from. And as a very brief follow-up, if you could give us an update on the U.S. versus international mix for Clover.\nRobert Hau: Yes, Tim, I think the simplest way to tee that up is we're seeing actually growth across those channels. There are some ebbs and flows as you go quarter-to-quarter, et cetera. But broadly, we continue to sign more banks and get more merchants through that bank channel. We continue to build out our direct sales force. ISO is obviously -- our partner channel is obviously quite significant. ISV, our Clover Connect solution for our ISV partners, is still adding ISVs in a meaningful way. We talked about some of those numbers in our prepared remarks. So the benefit for us is the broad distribution channel isn't that one is growing faster than the other and they're offsetting each other, it's that we just have a broad reach and we can grow across the board. And overall, Clover continues to grow. You heard us quote the 25% growth in 2022, nicely on our path to our $3.5 billion-plus goal for 2025. And international is certainly part of that. In 2023, we'll continue to get some nice growth there, in particular with the Deutsche Bank joint venture now live and beginning to provide some growth for us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research.\nDarrin Peller: Nice job this quarter. I just want to look at the -- Frank, when you look at the strategy for the merchant growth to continue, and you see how strong some of the assets like Clover and card have been, maybe talk to us about the next couple of years, of your view of what could drive that growth to continue at what seems to be above-industry levels. And it looks like -- you mentioned services and value added, but it looks like pricing probably played a part as well in the merchant revenue growth rate. Is that continuing? Last one is just for Bob on the segment growth rates. What are you guys thinking about for the year ahead in terms of merchant, or really all 3 segments, embedded in the guide?\nFrank Bisignano: Let me take the first part. First of all, on all the indicators that we talked about in March relative to our merchant business, we see that as visibly as we saw it back in March, the opportunity. I do think this is about an operating system, it's about platforms. And with that software capability that we bring, obviously, value-added services, changes our growth rate. As I said on this call, I think that we've made a big point of getting off of yield. And as I hope you could see we did get off of it because we were going in a different direction. We just think that, ultimately, we're going to bring more product in, and the mix of our business is different. I think when you take a look at this business, when you're running it the way we do, when you're bringing more stickiness, more clients, limiting attrition through those value-added services, you also have pricing opportunity. And we definitely have value-based pricing that is not having any effect on our attrition rate because we're really delivering multiple products into the clients. That's why we think a lot about ARPU and LTV around these. So it will be continuing to invest in value-added services. We love distribution partners. We love them. We love direct sales. And our distribution partners, I think we have the largest sales force of agents out there. I think our retail ISO business, you remember, when we say ISO in that dimension, I'm really talking about retail ISO way more than wholesale, which we really highlighted more in the processing space. So our vision to invest in software, continue to drive software sales, continue to grow distribution, continue to grow our own direct distribution. And obviously, drive to $10 billion, which is clearly in sight, and the other indicators we talked about.\nRobert Hau: And Darrin, in terms of the 2023 outlook by segment. You heard the full year, we expect to be kind of in the 7% to 9% range. Our baseline does assume a mild consumer recession which obviously will impact our Merchant segment more than our payments and Fintech, that tend to be more high recurring revenue. I would say that our merchant business will probably be at the top end, maybe above the top end of our 9% to 12% medium-term guidance. In our Fintech space, we did 5% in 2022. I'd expect that to continue to be in our range of 4% to 6% that we provided for medium-term guidance. And in the payment space, which was 9% in '22, actually above our guidance range, I think we'll be at the top half of our medium-term range, of the 5% to 8%, as we exit 2023.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank.\nBryan Keane: Congrats on the solid results here. Frank, I just want to ask you about the mild recession that you're expecting. Are you seeing any signs of that today? Or are you just kind of reading the tea leaves? And maybe you can talk about the timing of the potential recession as you see it.\nFrank Bisignano: Well, first of all, I'm not calling for a mild recession. That's in our baseline, right? I just thought I'd be very clear on that. And I mean, there are plenty of people, including Bob, that would say statistically, we already have seen a recession given the contraction in GDP we saw last year. But I would treat it like we built that into our baseline. And to the extent that doesn't happen, we have expectations on the high end at minimum is how I would think about that. I mean, I think we're not right now feeling that element. So it was not a forecast of a recession as much as a planning baseline to consider all scenarios.\nRobert Hau: And Bryan, I'd add, obviously, it's, what, February 7. January came in well, good. There is certainly some benefit of comparisons. January last year, we were actually coming back out of COVID in a couple of spots, and so it's a little bit easier. That will moderate a bit as we go through February and March. But things seem to be generally holding. And if you listen to the talking heads on TV or read Wall Street Journal or FT or whatever, there's more folks now talking about maybe not a recession. We think kind of the baseline is a slowing of the GDP. And that's obviously, U.S. -- 84% of our revenue is U.S.-based. Obviously, Europe, particularly in the U.K. and Germany, are seeing a tougher economic environment. Who knows what happens with China. And for us, China directly isn't an issue, but the implications, particularly in APAC. So we think it's appropriate prudence to have that baked in. And it's tough to know whether we'll have a mild recession, let alone when. But right now, things are holding.\nOperator: And for our final question, comes from Dave Togut from Evercore ISI.\nDavid Togut: With fourth quarter organic revenue growth of 12%, well above your midterm guidance and annual guide for next year of 7% to 9%, how should we think through the cadence of organic revenue growth and margin expansion? Thinking through the higher supply chain and wage inflation you had in the first 2 to 3 quarters of last year, combined with any callouts on periodic revenue comparisons?\nRobert Hau: Yes, Dave. Important element. I think that the easiest way to think about this, or maybe the most straightforward way to think about that, is to look at some of the ebbs and flows that we had in 2022. Obviously, fourth quarter margin came in quite strong. Inflation eased as we ended the second half of the year, so it's a different comparison point. Margins will expand better in the first half, first 90 -- or excuse me, first 9 months of '23 than they did in '22 because of that timing. Certainly, from a periodic revenue standpoint or a nonrecurring revenue standpoint, Q3 of '23 will be against a much easier compare, which was 1% in Q3 of 2022 that jumped to 8%. So you'll see variations like that. I don't necessarily see anything in '23's results that's going to drive great variation, so it's more against the comparisons, of course, other than broad economy and that manageable timing of when a recession might actually hit. But given that, it is expected to be mild, you're not going to see shocks like we did in 2020 in second quarter when the world just shut down. Knock on wood.\nOperator: And that was our final question.\nFrank Bisignano: Well, I'd like to thank everybody for your attention today. Feel -- please feel free to reach out to our Investor Relations team with any questions. And have a great day, and thank you for your time.\nOperator: Thank you all for participating in the Fiserv Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. That concludes the call for today. Please disconnect at this time, and have a great rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Frank Bisignano",
            "content": "Thank you, Julie. And thank you all for joining us today to discuss the strong ending to a pivotal year at Fiserv. 2022 marked a year of great progress for us with better-than-expected growth against the challenging backdrop. The integration of First Data and Fiserv wrapped up in the first half, and we are entering 2023 with a focus on growth and operational excellence to drive quality and productivity to the next level. We laid out a plan for our merchant segment that includes extending Clover's leadership and are on pace to achieve our 2025 objectives. We won awards for our new enterprise omnichannel solution, Carat, and continue to roll out this unified commerce platform with a leading number of value-added services. In payments, we completed the 3 major credit issuer implementations and followed them up with 2 major new wins in the fourth quarter. And we advanced our core banking cloud road map for new and existing clients with the acquisition and integration of Finxact. Through all of that, we navigated the return to office and are seeing a boost in productivity as our employees come back together, many in new state of the art facilities. We head into 2023 as a unified company that's better than the sum of its parts. One with faster growth and deeper investment that still holds a tradition of strong operating leverage, high recurring revenue and value-accretive capital allocation. Our progress over the last 2 years is undeniable after consecutive years of 11% organic revenue growth, 370 basis points of total adjusted operating margin improvement, and over $5 billion in share repurchases. We delivered on our guidance with a steep ramp in the fourth quarter with 12% organic revenue growth, 360 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement and adjusted earnings per share of $1.91. This led to 2022 results within the guidance range, which we raised twice last year despite unexpected FX headwinds. For the year, organic revenue growth was 11%; adjusted operating margin expanded 120 basis points to 35.1%; and adjusted EPS was $6.49, up 16%. Free cash flow conversion was 84% as we continued to invest for growth. Each of our operating segments recorded strong performance, led by Merchant Acceptance with organic revenue growth of 16% and 17% in the quarter and year, respectively. Our Clover and Carat operating systems are driving segment growth well above pre-pandemic levels. Our newer products, such as Data as a Service, pay by bank, disbursements and EBT online, widen the value proposition to clients and bolster our strong positioning in card and non-card payments.  Expanded ISV and direct sales channels extend outreach to merchants and help us capture more of the value in each transaction. Payments and Network revenue had a superb year of growth, up 10% organically in the fourth quarter and 9% for the year, above our medium-term guidance range. Performance was led by implementations of 3 top-25 credit issuing customers and continued growth with existing customers. We followed this up with 2 major new credit wins in the fourth quarter with Target, one of the largest retailers in the world; and with Desjardins, the largest credit union consortium in Canada and the fourth-largest card issuer. We are very excited to bring 1 of the world's largest retailers onto our platform, and we're pleased to expand our geographic reach in Canada with Desjardins. It is another example of a major in-house card issuer partnering with us to achieve industry-leading capability. And it's our first connection with a major Canadian issuer, giving us important scale in a key market. We've already begun working with both clients and anticipate revenue starting in 2024. In Fintech, we delivered 8% organic revenue growth in the quarter, rebounding from third quarter as expected. For the full year, we generated 5% of organic growth, at the midpoint of our medium-term guidance. Core wins were robust over the last several quarters and continue to go live, adding to an already strong recurring revenue base in this segment. Interest in Finxact is exceeding our expectations, and we're excited to extend our leadership in cloud core banking by going live with digital bank, [ Chello ]. We continue to believe we have the most clients in production in the cloud. We are carrying this positive momentum forward into 2023. This year, we expect organic revenue growth of 7% to 9%, adjusted operating margin expansion above 125 basis points and adjusted earnings per share of $7.25 to $7.40, which assumes a mild recession in the U.S. Our guidance reflects internal confidence in the face of external uncertainty. This confidence is built on the strength of our unparalleled client base, our industry-leading distribution, a broad and growing product portfolio and our best-in-class management team. We have the revenue base, the profit-driven cash flow and sturdy balance sheet that should sustain us through a tougher economy. It's times like these that make it good to be an industry leader that continues to invest in new and innovative products. Nowhere was this strong positioning more evident then in the many noteworthy contract extension and product additions signed with existing clients in the fourth quarter. These wins are a reflection of 4 factors: First, our list of clients is vast, high-quality and full of opportunity, and our relationships with them are deep; second, we have the broadest portfolio of solutions supporting both growth and operating efficiency for our clients; third, our client-first relationship model is off to a strong start; and fourth, our vision for the cross-sell opportunity between Fiserv and First Data offerings has become reality. The promise of the merger is being realized. Synergies are apparent. For example, between acquiring and core banking, core banking and embedded finance, and card issuing services across multiple verticals. In Merchant Acceptance, for example, we expanded our global relationship with ExxonMobil. This energy giant will move to the Carat platform to support its retail fuel stations in the U.S. and Canada with gateway, acquiring and fraud security services. We also renewed Carat's contract with one of the largest beauty retailers in the U.S. and added network tokens to their e-commerce system to help increase authorizations, reduce cost and limit fraud. And a major restaurant operator will extend our Merchant Acquiring and prepaid business to more of its brands. In the Payments and Network segment, in addition to the significant Target and Desjardins wins, we expanded our existing relationship with the State of California. After a successful rollout of the Middle Class Tax Refund program in the fourth quarter, we were awarded another prepaid mandate supporting California's unemployment and related insurance programs. This, along with disbursement support for the comptroller's office announced in October, represents longer-term recurring work for the state and marks our leadership in payments for the government vertical. We also signed a large e-commerce payments company for debit network services. This client will enable our STAR and Accel networks for its millions of merchants as an alternative to the larger debit networks. And in Fintech, as a proof point of our deep relationships, ability to cross-sell products and seize synergy from our merger, we continue to add solutions for Webster Bank since its merger with Sterling National Bank earlier this year. In addition to the account processing win we announced in the third quarter, we've now added the Optus platform and ATM services to the growing list of solutions we provide. Similarly, Bethpage Federal Credit Union has also added several of our payments products to its existing core banking platform. In keeping with the emerging trend of core modernization, Innovation Credit Union of Canada will be the latest client to move from a licensed solution of DNA to a hosted version in the Microsoft Azure Cloud. This is one of a couple of dozen DNA customers migrating to the cloud for more flexibility and resilience in their infrastructure. It highlights the modern architecture of DNA, Fiserv's experience in the cloud and further migration from license to ASP revenue. Outside the U.S., we made important progress in EMEA, adding Absa Bank in Mauritius as a client of our Internet gateway. This will allow Absa clients to tap into the fast-growing e-commerce segment in Africa and grow with key corporate clients that are active in this well-known tourist destination. It also opens the door for us to enter 8 other countries in Sub-Sahara Africa where Absa operates today. In Latin America, we extended a large bank acquiring relationship to include several more countries. And in APAC, we signed India's Tata Motors for loan processing and attained a major payment institution license in Singapore. This will allow us to expand beyond merchant acquiring into domestic and cross-border money transfer services, a market that has $180 billion of payment flow. A key to our new and following wins is the significant investment we have made to bring new product to market, increase our value to existing customers, open the door to new customers and grow our TAM. Let me recap just a few of our innovation and advancements this year, starting with merchant. In the SMB space, we serve small businesses wherever they want to conduct business through cloud-based operating systems like Clover, through our channel partners, including ISVs, banks and ISOs; and on platforms that act as payment facilitators, or PayFac. At Clover, we integrated the BentoBox acquisition into the Clover platform to add more e-commerce and digital capability to our offerings in the restaurant vertical. Catering services and hotel restaurants are emerging subverticals for us now, and we know that when Bento and Clover are sold together, we see an over 3x increase in average revenue per user. We also rolled out lower-cost hardware and partnered with major providers of retail technology to offer web and point-of-sale inventory solutions to this large SMB vertical. We've begun migrating merchants from our existing Internet gateway to a new Clover gateway where they can more easily access our full suite of value-added services. This positions Clover to compete more for card-not-present business this year from a position of strength. Value-added services penetration, an important driver of Clover growth and ARPU, reached 16% in the quarter from 13% a year earlier. One example is Clover Capital, a product we continue to invest in, is growing rapidly and favorably impacting customer attrition in the SMB segment. In the ISV channel, we've added 174 ISV partners this year and continue to benefit from the high growth and lower customer acquisition costs of this go-to-market approach. Since our acquisition of NetPay, we continue to build PayFac, marketplace and software platform solutions, including real-time boarding, underwriting and split pay services. In the quarter, Fiserv continued to expand and deepen our platform integrations with partners that include PayPal, offering our customers more flexibility in their service offerings. We look forward to exploring other integrations with current and future partners while expanding our capabilities across this market. Carat, our leading enterprise omnichannel solution, continues to expand its capabilities, including payout choice and flexibility. With the introduction of several products this year, including digital checks; prepaid cards and crypto wallets; followed by our multi-purse wallet, a white-label solution that holds multiple sources of value, including loyalty and prepaid. We continue to onboard large merchants for Pay by Bank, which lowers the cost of acceptance for merchants and is an easy way for consumers to earn rewards. And we have seen a strong early uptake in our new Data as a Service offering, partnering with Snowflake. It enables our merchant customers to access their payments data in near real time to better inform business decisions. We also have a growing number of financial institutions lined up to pilot our Open Data solution offered in partnership with Snowflake. Open Data enables near real-time access to data across customers, accounts and activities, bringing relevant insights to support strategic decisions. In Payments and Network, our strong growth in issuer solutions can be traced directly to the investments we've made in our operating platform, Optus. This includes a robust set of APIs, AI-based fraud management, cardholder experience technology via the Ondot acquisition, integrated output solutions, plus ongoing cloud enablement of key features. We have multiple payment innovations underway to take advantage of emerging trends, such as real-time payments. The clearinghouse RTP network, Zelle and FedNow, all work differently than legacy networks, creating demand for an end-to-end solutions provider. We are leveraging the Fiserv NOW network to be just that this year. In Fintech, we've been taking an open-source approach to serving our clients. We've pre-integrated third-party digital solutions into many of our cores and made these solutions discoverable to clients via our app marketplace. We've also made our platform attractive to the developer community by exposing our microservice APIs through our developer studio. Building on its Webby Award last year, this product won a DEVIES award from DeveloperWeek in January for best innovation and financial services. With these advancements, we are driving Fiserv to become the destination of choice for embedded finance, integrating card issuing and processing, merchant and core banking capabilities for a variety of nontraditional providers, including retailers, QSRs, payback and government entities. Another highlight of 2022 was the Finxact acquisition, our new cloud-native banking solution, which we've been integrating with our existing digital surrounds, selling to our existing clients as an innovation platform, or a sidecar core, and winning new logo sales. Our pipeline is particularly active with pioneering digital banks and big issuers entering the banking market via embedded finance. Finxact offers them faster time to market, greater flexibility and scalability and the largest product portfolio available, making it an ideal way to conceptualize, create and launch new banking products. With all of this new product development and the client wins that validate it, I hope you'll see why we remain enthusiastic for 2023. So let me pass the discussion to Bob for more detail on our financial results. Thanks, Bob. In the quarter, Fiserv provided Back2Business grants to 13 veteran and military spouse business owners through our partnerships in Atlanta. We also launched Back2Business in New Jersey, committing $1 million to small local minority-owned businesses. For the year, we awarded 241 such grants in total. The CDP published our GHG emissions results for 2021. They improved from the prior year in part because of the COVID shutdowns. We are encouraged by the future direction of our program since receiving LEED Gold status for our 1 Broadway space, awaiting LEED Platinum status for our new technology innovation center in Berkeley Heights, and pursuing LEED Gold for offices in Milwaukee and Dublin, Ireland. Overall, I am excited about what the next 5 years can bring for Fiserv. We are off to a great start in 2023, having just been recognized as the world's most admired company by Fortune Magazine for the 12th time in 15 years. I'm especially proud about our 2 most admired attributes, innovation and financial soundness, 2 particularly important qualities in the current environment. We delivered beyond expectations in the past year, and that was not by chance. It was the result of specific actions and thoughtful investment. The groundwork is laid for more strong performance to come. Leading products, bigger TAM, expanding geographies, better service and streamlined modern technology are in our grasp. The years I've spent at highly successful businesses have taught me that our reach must exceed our grasp. There is always room for improvement, so my leadership team and I are focused on driving greater productivity and better processes this year in the quest for operational excellence. I'm confident in our more than 40,000 Fiserv associates around the world. You come prepared to meet our high bar every day, and I thank you for all you do. With that, operator, please open the line for questions. Well, I think if you look at this year's growth rate, obviously, at 11%, we can feel the power of the franchise coming together, right? And obviously, I like to step back on that question a little bit, too. Remember, we announced a merger, made the top 10 mergers of the year in 2019, and then we had a pandemic. And that definitely did not accelerate our ability to see clients, sell, get in front of them on offerings. We managed through it, we used all the tools available. But I think today, when you look through the company, the opportunities are larger than we thought. Remember, we said we're going to stop really talking about the synergy number. We put a bow on it, we closed out M&I and then continue to still working. But I think embedded in what you see in our growth rate and what we believe the promise was, it's much larger. And I think it will continue. It's just natural cross-sell now, but it's bringing -- we love talking about merchant acquiring and core banking, of the math at all those banks. We like to think about the opportunities, that we've got it by taking out larger capabilities across the company. And delivering more product to the government vertical, you see the things that we're doing that neither company did before, but the 2 together did. And I'd say I simply always think that this is a completely different company fundamentally in its fourth year. A new company where we took the 2 growth rates and exceeded either one, and we'll do that for the rest of our life, with the exception of a pandemic. So I think it's bigger than we ever thought. And I think you'll continue to see it, and it's definitely had an effect, and you see effect in the difference in the growth rate. So we see it in the 2 combined companies, and then from what we originally announced, and how it shows up in today's numbers. So thanks for asking that. It really does matter a lot. It's really we are getting the benefits of what we told you all we'd do, and it's better than we thought. Yes. I think as you've watched the evolution over time, I start with we love operating systems, we love our platform systems. And the investments that we made in Optus through the cycle really has benefited us in the client's office. And I think it's the full enterprise capability that we bring. I think it's a single platform that we bring. It's the modernization of the platform that we did over the past few years. And I think we came and talked to you at 2020 Investor Day about the 3 large wins that were in the top 25. And then we continued to add. If you remember, I've said to many, I believe, that we did think those 3 top wins were a very, very, very onetime unique situation. But we came back and said, over the past year, we won as much as 3. And then we followed on with these 2 wins that we're pretty darn proud of, in the rank of Target and Desjardins. These are long-term big decisions for these issuers, long-term relationships. And I think the team has done an unbelievable job building out the platform, building out the capabilities all the way from loyalty to user interfaces. And so I think the fruits of this labor continue to come through, and that will be a ramp like the last one. Let me take the first part. First of all, on all the indicators that we talked about in March relative to our merchant business, we see that as visibly as we saw it back in March, the opportunity. I do think this is about an operating system, it's about platforms. And with that software capability that we bring, obviously, value-added services, changes our growth rate. As I said on this call, I think that we've made a big point of getting off of yield. And as I hope you could see we did get off of it because we were going in a different direction. We just think that, ultimately, we're going to bring more product in, and the mix of our business is different. I think when you take a look at this business, when you're running it the way we do, when you're bringing more stickiness, more clients, limiting attrition through those value-added services, you also have pricing opportunity. And we definitely have value-based pricing that is not having any effect on our attrition rate because we're really delivering multiple products into the clients. That's why we think a lot about ARPU and LTV around these. So it will be continuing to invest in value-added services. We love distribution partners. We love them. We love direct sales. And our distribution partners, I think we have the largest sales force of agents out there. I think our retail ISO business, you remember, when we say ISO in that dimension, I'm really talking about retail ISO way more than wholesale, which we really highlighted more in the processing space. So our vision to invest in software, continue to drive software sales, continue to grow distribution, continue to grow our own direct distribution. And obviously, drive to $10 billion, which is clearly in sight, and the other indicators we talked about. Well, first of all, I'm not calling for a mild recession. That's in our baseline, right? I just thought I'd be very clear on that. And I mean, there are plenty of people, including Bob, that would say statistically, we already have seen a recession given the contraction in GDP we saw last year. But I would treat it like we built that into our baseline. And to the extent that doesn't happen, we have expectations on the high end at minimum is how I would think about that. I mean, I think we're not right now feeling that element. So it was not a forecast of a recession as much as a planning baseline to consider all scenarios. Well, I'd like to thank everybody for your attention today. Feel -- please feel free to reach out to our Investor Relations team with any questions. And have a great day, and thank you for your time."

            "name": "Robert Hau",
            "content": "Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. If you're following along on our slides, I'll cover additional detail on total company and segment performance, starting with our financial metrics and trends on Slide 4. Fourth quarter and full year results reflected our focus on delivering on our commitments with momentum in all 3 business segments. Total company organic revenue growth was 12% in the quarter with ongoing strength in Merchant Acceptance, further growth in our Payments and Network segment and a rebound in the Fintech segment as previewed on our last earnings call. For the full year, total company organic revenue grew 11%, in line with the higher guidance we provided 90 days ago. This performance was led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 17%. Fourth quarter total company adjusted revenue grew 8% to $4.4 billion and adjusted operating income grew 20% to $1.7 billion, resulting in adjusted operating margin of 39.2%, an increase of 360 basis points versus the prior year and a sequential improvement of 400 basis points. As we anticipated, 4 factors drove this margin improvement: First, the final ramp-down of integration expenses and resulting productivity benefits; second, operating leverage on increased revenue and improved inflation comparisons; third, actions taken late in the third quarter and in fourth quarter to tighten spending in light of the uncertain macroeconomic conditions across the globe; and finally, the divesture of our Korea business and 2 small, low-margin nonstrategic units. As expected, the fourth quarter performance brought the full year adjusted operating margin to 35.1%, an increase of 120 basis points over 2021. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 22% to $1.91 compared to $1.57 in the prior year. Full year adjusted earnings per share increased 16% and to $6.49. Volume, productivity and operating performance more than offset the foreign exchange headwind of $0.25 for the full year. This was much higher than the $0.11 assumed in our guidance at the start of the year. Free cash flow came in at $1.4 billion for the quarter and $3.5 billion for the full year. Free cash flow conversion was a strong 115% of adjusted net income for this quarter. For the full year, free cash flow conversion was 84%, roughly in line with our expectations for approximately 85%, with a slight increase in accounts receivable on some slower collections. Now looking to our segment results, starting on Slide 6. Organic revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was a healthy 16% in the quarter and 17% for the full year, well ahead of our medium-term segment guidance of 9% to 12%. Adjusted revenue growth was 9% in the quarter and 13% for the full year. This is well ahead of the 11.5% annual growth rate needed to achieve our Merchant Acceptance segment revenue outlook of $10 billion by 2025, as laid out in our March 2022 investor call. As we've said, we grow and create value in 3 ways: First, attracting more merchants to our operating systems, our Clover active merchant count grew 9% in 2022; second, expanding our merchant relationships, the adoption of more value-added software and services, Clover VAS penetration reached 16% in the quarter, up 13% from last year; and third, by growing with our existing customer base, our average revenue per Clover merchant expanded 12% in 2022. In the quarter, merchant volume and transactions grew 6% and 3%, respectively. For the year, they grew 10% and 6%, excluding the loss of a processing client in mid-2021. Volume in local currency was up 8% for the quarter and 12% for the year, excluding the client loss. This is in line with our typical spread relative to the card networks. Factors that drove faster revenue growth include value-added services, new payment flows and value-based pricing. Turning to our merchant operating systems, Clover and Carat. We continue to post robust growth, and we're on track for $3.5 billion in Clover revenue by 2025 as presented at our Merchant Investor Call this past March. Clover revenue grew 23% in the fourth quarter on payment volume growth of 16%. For the full year, Clover revenue was up 25%. We posted above-average growth in Clover Capital, Clover Software and Marketplace SaaS. Clover Connect for ISVs continues to post very strong revenue growth and added 48 ISV partners in the quarter, totaling 174 for the full year. Carat, our Enterprise omnichannel solution, also had a strong quarter, with revenue growing at 15%. For the year, Carat revenue grew 18% on important new client wins and enhancements for existing clients. This includes our new client experience portals, which improve service and access to data while positioning us to sell more products, from data as a service to fraud services to emerging flows. In 2023, we will complete the build-out of our single orchestration layer known as Commerce Hub, which will allow our clients to more seamlessly integrate with the breadth and depth of our products and services and enhance our e-commerce capabilities. Adjusted operating income in the Merchant Acceptance segment increased 22% to $648 million in the quarter, with margin up 350 basis points to 34.8%. Full year adjusted operating income improved 16% to $2.3 billion and margin grew 100 basis points to 31.8%. The improvement in both periods was led by operating leverage and productivity. We completed the acquisition of Merchant One in late December, folding in this long-term Fiserv customer. This should enhance our direct merchant acquisition capabilities, extend the reach of our Clover product line and create cost synergies. We also acquired Yacare late in the quarter, expanding our capabilities in Argentina by enabling us to bring our QR code payment acceptance to our merchants there. We stand to rapidly become a significant QR code provider as we get this technology into customers' hands. Looking into 2023. In January, overall volume growth was stronger than volume growth in December. This is partly attributable to an easier year-over-year comparison but also indicates the ongoing strength of the consumer and the Fiserv brand. Turning to Slide 7. On the Payments and Network segment. Organic revenue grew 10% in the quarter. This growth was enabled by a variety of drivers across our business lines. Our North American credit active accounts on file grew 17%, driven by both new business onboarding and a favorable credit environment. The California Middle Class Tax Refund program was also an important contributor to revenue during the quarter. While the revenue was mostly onetime in nature, we've signed 2 additional contracts with the state that will bring in recurring revenue in 2023 and beyond. Full year organic revenue growth of 9% was above the upper end of our medium-term outlook range of 5% to 8%. Fourth quarter adjusted operating income for the segment was up 14% to $811 million, and margin was up 230 basis points to 48.5%, driven by strong operating leverage. For the full year, adjusted operating income was up 10% to $2.8 billion and margin expanded 120 basis points to 45.3%. Moving to Slide 8. In the Financial Technology segment, we posted 8% organic revenue growth for the quarter and 5% for the full year, right in the middle of our 4% to 6% medium-term guidance range. The rebound in nonrecurring revenue portions of this business: License, professional services and termination fees, was a meaningful contributor to growth in the fourth quarter, as we expected after those revenues slowed in the third quarter. Meanwhile, customer momentum continues, and we had 14 core wins in the quarter, including 8 competitive takeaways. Over the last 3 years, we have 155 core wins and a healthy backlog of implementations that offer solid visibility to revenue for 2023. Adjusted operating income was up 18% in the quarter to $340 million and up 7% to $1.2 billion for the full year. Adjusted operating margin in the segment increased 400 basis points to 41.3% in the quarter, helped by higher periodic revenue and productivity. Full year margin increased 70 basis points to 36.5%. The corporate adjusted operating loss was $88 million in the quarter, slightly improved from the first half run rate, and $444 million for the full year. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.3% and was 19.6% for the full year, in line with our expectations. We expect 2023's adjusted effective tax rate will be approximately 20% for the full year. Total debt outstanding was $21.4 billion on December 31. The debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio dropped another 0.1 turns to 2.8x, within our target leverage of being below 3x in the second half of the year. We have approximately 19% of our debt in variable rate instruments. During the quarter, we repurchased $750 million of our stock, bringing our total 2022 share repurchase to $2.5 billion and $5 billion over the last 24 months. We had 17 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase at the end of the quarter. Our long-standing capital allocation strategy will continue into 2023, defined by a strong balance sheet, share repurchases and complementary and innovative acquisitions. As we look through the mixed indicators on the 2023 economy, we are taking a measured approach to our outlook and assume a mild consumer spending recession, lower inflation and higher interest rates. As Frank said earlier, we expect organic revenue growth of 7% to 9%, in line with our medium-term guidance, with adjusted operating margin expansion of at least 125 basis points. This translates into adjusted earnings per share of $7.25 to $7.40 or 12% to 14% growth over 2022 and would represent our 38th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. This strong operating performance in a weaker economic environment reflects our continued investment in growth opportunities at a time when others may be cutting back. We are redirecting our free cash flow guidance toward dollars instead of conversion since this aligns more directly with how we run our business. We estimate approximately $3.8 billion of free cash flow for 2023. In the past 2 years, we increased our level of investment in growth initiatives, and it led to back-to-back years of accelerated 11% organic revenue growth. We see tremendous opportunity to do the same this year to invest in our growth platforms and continue to grow faster than our markets. We retain our focus on long-term free cash flow as a driver of long-term value for our shareholders. With that, let me turn the call back to Frank for some closing remarks. Yes, Dave, it's Bob. Thanks for the question. The answer to your question is yes, it was those items. Obviously, we're continuing to see great growth in the business. We've talked about the key drivers of growth, getting more merchants, selling more to merchants, the value-added sales. You saw our penetration rate go up in Clover. We continue to build out our direct sales channel, the integration of Bento into the Clover solution significantly increases the ARPU. And then we saw some benefit of value-based pricing. So kind of across the board doing very well. And that's both in the SMB as well as in the enterprise markets for us. Am I going to suggest we'll continue that 10% every quarter going forward? No, I wouldn't lay that out. But we see tremendous opportunity for continued growth. We can call you back to our March investor call that we had on the merchant business. We think this is a $10 billion business in 2025. And 2022, the first year on that journey, was right on track. Yes, Ramsey, definitely seeing some very nice growth across our 3 international regions. They are, for all practical purposes, almost double, maybe a little bit better than double our U.S. growth rate. Continue to see tremendous contribution. The fastest-growing region for us is certainly LatAm with good growth in Brazil and Argentina, particularly in the merchant space, but also seeing some nice traction and our credit issuing capability across the regions. We talked about expanding our reach with a large bank, growing our reach in a number of countries in Latin America this past quarter. Seeing good growth in APAC. Both of those obviously smaller than our footprint in EMEA. But even in EMEA, we're seeing good growth, particularly in the issuer space. So all 3 regions contributing to the growth. And in total, our international business growing almost double the rate of our domestic U.S. business. Yes, Tim, I think the simplest way to tee that up is we're seeing actually growth across those channels. There are some ebbs and flows as you go quarter-to-quarter, et cetera. But broadly, we continue to sign more banks and get more merchants through that bank channel. We continue to build out our direct sales force. ISO is obviously -- our partner channel is obviously quite significant. ISV, our Clover Connect solution for our ISV partners, is still adding ISVs in a meaningful way. We talked about some of those numbers in our prepared remarks. So the benefit for us is the broad distribution channel isn't that one is growing faster than the other and they're offsetting each other, it's that we just have a broad reach and we can grow across the board. And overall, Clover continues to grow. You heard us quote the 25% growth in 2022, nicely on our path to our $3.5 billion-plus goal for 2025. And international is certainly part of that. In 2023, we'll continue to get some nice growth there, in particular with the Deutsche Bank joint venture now live and beginning to provide some growth for us. And Darrin, in terms of the 2023 outlook by segment. You heard the full year, we expect to be kind of in the 7% to 9% range. Our baseline does assume a mild consumer recession which obviously will impact our Merchant segment more than our payments and Fintech, that tend to be more high recurring revenue. I would say that our merchant business will probably be at the top end, maybe above the top end of our 9% to 12% medium-term guidance. In our Fintech space, we did 5% in 2022. I'd expect that to continue to be in our range of 4% to 6% that we provided for medium-term guidance. And in the payment space, which was 9% in '22, actually above our guidance range, I think we'll be at the top half of our medium-term range, of the 5% to 8%, as we exit 2023. And Bryan, I'd add, obviously, it's, what, February 7. January came in well, good. There is certainly some benefit of comparisons. January last year, we were actually coming back out of COVID in a couple of spots, and so it's a little bit easier. That will moderate a bit as we go through February and March. But things seem to be generally holding. And if you listen to the talking heads on TV or read Wall Street Journal or FT or whatever, there's more folks now talking about maybe not a recession. We think kind of the baseline is a slowing of the GDP. And that's obviously, U.S. -- 84% of our revenue is U.S.-based. Obviously, Europe, particularly in the U.K. and Germany, are seeing a tougher economic environment. Who knows what happens with China. And for us, China directly isn't an issue, but the implications, particularly in APAC. So we think it's appropriate prudence to have that baked in. And it's tough to know whether we'll have a mild recession, let alone when. But right now, things are holding. Yes, Dave. Important element. I think that the easiest way to think about this, or maybe the most straightforward way to think about that, is to look at some of the ebbs and flows that we had in 2022. Obviously, fourth quarter margin came in quite strong. Inflation eased as we ended the second half of the year, so it's a different comparison point. Margins will expand better in the first half, first 90 -- or excuse me, first 9 months of '23 than they did in '22 because of that timing. Certainly, from a periodic revenue standpoint or a nonrecurring revenue standpoint, Q3 of '23 will be against a much easier compare, which was 1% in Q3 of 2022 that jumped to 8%. So you'll see variations like that. I don't necessarily see anything in '23's results that's going to drive great variation, so it's more against the comparisons, of course, other than broad economy and that manageable timing of when a recession might actually hit. But given that, it is expected to be mild, you're not going to see shocks like we did in 2020 in second quarter when the world just shut down. Knock on wood."

At this time, I will turn the call over to Julie Chariell, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv.\nJulie Chariell: Thank you, and good morning. With me on the call today are Frank Bisignano, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and supplemental materials for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Please refer to these materials for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call, along with a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. Unless otherwise stated, performance references are year-over-year comparisons. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results and strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. You should refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. And now over to Frank.\nFrank Bisignano: Thank you, Julie. Before I begin, let me again welcome Julie to the team. As we announced last quarter, she moved to a new role as the Head of Strategy. Julie joins us from Bloomberg, where she was a senior equity analyst covering the fintech and payment space and has extensive experience as a sell-side analyst and investment product manager. Welcome to your first Fiserv earnings call, Julie. Turning to the results. Overall, I am very pleased with yet another quarter of double-digit growth in both organic revenue and adjusted EPS. We continue to demonstrate the strength of our client base, depth of our partnerships and resilience of our businesses. Consumers activated more cards, continue to spend and were issued new credit. Merchants opened up new businesses, offered better experiences and took advantage of more value-added services. Financial institutions upgraded their systems and invested in new products to better compete and capture efficiencies. In the early days of the fourth quarter, we are seeing the same trends continue. We grew adjusted revenue 8% with organic revenue up 11%, at the top end of our full year 2022 guidance range. Adjusted operating margin of 35.2% was up 100 basis points year-over-year, expanded 170 basis points sequentially and was consistent with our internal modeling. Adjusted EPS of $1.63 included an $0.08 foreign exchange headwind versus last year, which is $0.03 more than we anticipated 90 days ago. As we look forward, pressure remained from inflation, a still tight [ global ] market and geopolitical uncertainty. But as a global and diverse business, we are well prepared to capitalize in any market environment. Based on continued momentum, strong execution and near-term visibility, we are raising our revenue guidance to the high end of the range for this year to 11% organic and raising our adjusted EPS to $6.48 to $6.55. Clearly, we're executing well beyond our legacy as a mid-single-digit top line grower. Based on the actions we've taken and the investments we've made, I remain confident that we can achieve faster growth in the high single-digit range or better over the coming years while maintaining our track record of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. When we brought together Fiserv and First Data in July 2019, we envisioned an industry-leading combination with a complete set of strong payments and fintech capabilities that were highly complementary. As we've combined these great companies, we're sometimes asked how being a diversified company that serves merchants and financial institutions, large and small, across all payment types is the winning strategy. We believe we're already demonstrating this through market share gains, faster growth and expanding margins, and the third quarter is another proof point of the power of this team and our set of assets and capabilities. Third quarter highlights the continuing momentum in our Payments and Network segment with organic revenue growth of 11% and adjusted operating margin expanding 190 basis points to 45.9%. Our issuer solutions business, which includes credit processing for large issuers and card and statement services, was particularly strong. Issuer solutions [indiscernible] contracts, with 3 of the top 25 North American credit card issuers within the last 2 years, a testament to our single platform that delivers a full suite of digital capabilities. We can trace our success here directly to the investment we've made in the business over the last few years. These include a robust set of APIs; AI-based fraud management; cardholder experience technology, being the Ondot acquisition; integrated end-to-end output solutions plus ongoing cloud enablement of our technology stack. Since we began combining Fiserv and First Data, we made a decision to pursue the opportunity in the government vertical with its large TAM and multiple use cases that span merchant, issuer and output services. We began investing in the solutions, people and infrastructure, and the strategy is now playing out. This month, we began issuing roughly 10 million prepaid cards for the State of California under its middle class tax credit program. Since announcing this win last quarter, we were awarded another contract with the California State Controller for cards supporting various disbursement needs. We work with 5 other states to disburse and process their unemployment benefit cards. The pipeline remains large, and this vertical is traditionally quite resilient through the economic cycle. Investing in innovation is a constant across our business, and nowhere are the benefits more evident than in our Merchant Acceptance business. We had another strong quarter for merchant, growing organic revenue 14%, once again outpacing our medium-term guidance of 9% to 12%. At Clover, we rolled out several new products to enhance the merchant experience and customer authorization. This quarter, we'll be piloting an expanded retail vertical offering with additional horizontal value-added services, including an integration with accounting and business software. Our vertical solutions are resonating. In September, Clover Sport signed an agreement with Caesars Superdome and the Smoothie King Center in New Orleans, adding to its base of over 250 professional- and college-level sports venues. Clover will streamline purchasing at concession stands, premium bars and clubs with digital, contactless and self-service purchasing. We will also provide third-party integration to related services and real-time data insights. Carat, our enterprise omnichannel operating system, launched new money flows and continued to lead the market in payout choice and flexibility. We launched more instances of our multi-purse wallet, a white-label solution that holds multiple sources of value, including loyalty and prepaid. And we're proud to share that in July, Fiserv was named Merchant Acquirer of the Year by the Merchant Payments Ecosystem Awards in recognition of the highly successful debut of Carat as an omnichannel commerce operating system. As I mentioned earlier this year, data is an emerging business for us, and it spans both merchant and financial institution clients. We're excited to announce our new data-as-a-service offering in September, partnering with Snowflake. Fiserv will enable customers to access their payments data in near real time to better inform business decisions. By leveraging Snowflake Secure Data Sharing, customers can now seamlessly and securely access and integrate their data, driving deeper timely insights. A large energy company is just one type of client already in pilot. Financial institutions are excited by our data-as-a-service offering as well. Carter Bank, a $4 billion Mid-Atlantic community bank, is in an open data pilot with us to consolidate and connect all data across the enterprise. Many banks tell us they spend too much time trying to source, provision and integrate data. Fiserv and Snowflake will make it easier for Carter to use the data across their Fiserv and non-Fiserv systems to fully understand their customers down to the branch level. Fintech performance was lower than normal this quarter at 1% organic revenue growth but generated 4% growth year-to-date, and is on track to meet our organic growth guidance of 4% to 6%. This is a consistent business, but timing of product additions, new business implementations and professional services revenue can vary from quarter-to-quarter. Some of this revenue anticipated for September slipped into the fourth quarter, and we have good line of sight to full year revenue in the medium-term guidance range. We remain encouraged by our visibility here after signing 14 core wins in the quarter, with 9 being competitive takeaways spread across large banks, new banks, fintechs, community banks and credit unions. Earlier this year, Webster Bank acquired Fiserv client Sterling Bank to create a $65 billion Northeast regional. In the quarter, Webster chose Fiserv as its core account processing platform with multiple surround spanning our fintech and payments offering. We've talked about the strategic importance of Finxact, a leading cloud banking core today, with 11 clients already in production. After just 6 months under our umbrella, Finxact is attracting strong interest from both new and existing Fiserv clients. With 2 large new client wins in the quarter, Finxact will become the cloud-based core platform for 2 more emerging online banks. And just yesterday, we entered into a new agreement with Zenus to power this global digital bank's first-to-market solution, running Finxact on the Microsoft Azure Cloud. Looking forward, there's plenty of uncertainty around what 2023 will bring. We're currently in the planning phase but have already taken steps to ensure we are prepared for a softer macroeconomic environment. We are fortunate to have a well-diversified business with high recurring revenue and a strong balance sheet. Bob will talk more about these factors shortly, but I want to share with you what I am seeing and hearing from clients and where I see opportunity for Fiserv in the coming quarters. The Payments segment has successfully capitalized on industry trends that are enabling strong growth. I call out 4 major trends that are responsible not only for the strong growth we are seeing now but a robust pipeline for the coming year. First, cardholders continue to expect better payment experiences, and more issuers look to our platforms to meet this demand. Issuers are also investing in more modern technology solutions such as better digital, broad and loyalty capabilities, all of which offer us attractive cross-sell opportunities. Second, the addressable market is growing. Segments such as health care, education and government are increasingly looking for new credit processing and disbursement solutions. Nontraditional start-ups and fintechs have also been actively entering the card issuing and lending space. Third, demand for plastic solution remains high as issuers compete heavily for new volume. Finally, the card payments environment has remained active even as we see continued growth in noncard payments, including Zelle and real-time payments. Two regulation-led opportunities [indiscernible] first, the Fed announced that its real-time network, FedNow, would go live in mid-2023. Fiserv has been part of the FedNow pilot, and we believe that we are well positioned to participate in the rising adoption of real-time payments. We enable financial institutions and, eventually, billers and merchants to integrate with a variety of real-time services and networks through our single connection. Second, earlier this month, the Federal Reserve finalized a clarification to Reg II that the dual network requirement for debit applies for all transaction types, including card-not-present. Fiserv believes this will promote market competition, which will ultimately benefit consumers, merchants, issuers and the industry at large. Our debit networks, STAR and Accel, support card-not-present transactions, but many factors will influence our ultimate opportunity, so we will wait to see how issuers implement this rule once it takes effect in July. In Merchant Acceptance, the uncertain macro environment has merchants, large and small, looking to optimize the value in their operations. In some cases, this has increased their desire for a single full-service provider over fragmented specialists. And that suits us well given our breadth and scale. Their focus on areas like payment optimization, lower-cost payment methods and fraud is presenting more value-added service opportunities as well. In fact, we've won a few deals to enable Pay by Bank, which lowers the cost of acceptance for merchants, is an easy way for consumers to earn rewards. One of our large petro merchants, Sunoco, with 5,500 locations, was just one such win in the third quarter. With the e-commerce penetration returning to a more normal growth trend, card-present solutions are in focus as the more complex problem to solve for integrated omnichannel solutions. Our marquee base of large merchant customers is looking to us here. This includes leading petro and grocery merchants who are more insulated from economic slowdowns due to the nondiscretionary nature of their businesses. In our Fintech business, banks are managing through the macro uncertainty with a focus on serving existing customers and improving operational efficiency, two areas where we provide a number of important products and services that offer a way to grow accounts and enter new markets in a cost-effective manner. Finxact, our new cloud-native modern banking platform, is being recognized as the best way to conceptualize, create and launch new banking products. And our pipeline is particularly active with pioneering digital banks and big issuers entering the banking market via embedded finance. A leading example is our partnership with One Finance, supporting their growth initiatives in retail. We can offer them faster time to market with greater flexibility and scalability plus the largest product portfolio available. Now let me pass the discussion to Bob for more detail on our financial results.\nRobert Hau: Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone.  If you're following along on our slides, I will cover additional detail on total company and segment performance, starting with our financial metrics and trends on Slide 4. Third quarter results showed continued strength and the benefit of our broad portfolio. Total company organic revenue growth was 11% in the quarter with continued momentum in Merchant Acceptance, a nice step-up in growth in our Payments and Network segment and stable performance in the Fintech segment, considering the impact of some timing of revenue quarter-to-quarter. Year-to-date, total company organic revenue grew 11%, led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 17%. Third quarter total company adjusted revenue grew 8% to $4.3 billion, and adjusted operating income grew 11% to $1.5 billion, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 35.2%, an increase of 100 basis points versus the prior year. As Frank mentioned, margins improved sequentially 170 basis points from the second quarter on 1% higher revenue and 2% lower expenses. For the first 9 months of the year, adjusted revenue grew 9% to $12.4 billion, and adjusted operating income increased 10% to $4.2 billion, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 33.6%, 40 basis points ahead of the prior year period. The adjusted operating margin for the quarter was impacted by several factors, including, first, investments related to new acquisitions, including BentoBox and Finxact; second, the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar, particularly in September; and third, the net impact of inflation on our revenue, offset by costs for both labor and material. As we've previously said, we expect significant adjusted operating margin expansion in the fourth quarter. We have 4 factors driving this improvement. First, the benefits of the final ramp-down of prior integration expenses and resulting productivity benefits. Second, in the latter part of the third quarter, we began taking some cost actions to tighten spending in light of the continued uncertain macroeconomic conditions across the globe. Third, as part of our ongoing strategic review, we divested our Korea business and 2 small low-margin nonstrategic units. Finally, we anticipate healthy operating leverage and easier inflation comparisons in the fourth quarter. These factors should deliver our full year guidance for at least 100 basis point improvement and sets us up well for 2023. Third quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 11% to $1.63  compared to $1.47 in the prior year. Unfavorable foreign exchange impacted adjusted EPS by $0.08 per share year-over-year or 5 points of growth headwind relative to the exchange rates a year ago. Year-to-date through September 30, adjusted earnings per share increased 14% to $4.59. Free cash flow came in at $849 million for the quarter and $2.1 billion for the first 9 months of the year. Free cash flow conversion was 81% of adjusted net income this quarter, well ahead of prior year and first half levels. Like the fourth quarter of 2021, we expect a significant ramp in free cash flow and free cash flow conversion in the last quarter of the year. Free cash flow conversion of 71% year-to-date reflects a combination of: first, continued organic investment in software and application development to drive higher growth across the business; second, greater working capital investment in both accounts receivable and inventory, driven by accelerated revenue growth; and third, higher capital expenditures associated with the newly acquired capabilities to drive innovation and integration. As we close out the year, the sustained strength in our business gives us confidence to raise our full year organic revenue growth outlook to 11%, the top end of our previous guidance range of 9% to 11%. With this higher organic revenue growth outlook and execution on cost actions that support continued adjusted operating margin expansion, we are raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance range to a new range of $6.48 to $6.55, representing growth of 16% to 17% over 2021, at the high end of our original 15% to 17% guide. This includes significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which leads to an additional $0.06 of unfavorable foreign exchange impact in the third and fourth quarters relative to our expectations just 90 days ago. While we anticipate greater than 100% conversion of free cash flow in the fourth quarter, we continue to anticipate strong revenue growth as indicated by another increase in our organic revenue outlook. We have real investment opportunities to sustainably grow our top line faster than market and faster than our history of mid-single-digit growth. Therefore, we now expect full year free cash flow conversion to be approximately 85%. Now looking to our segment results, starting on Slide 5. Organic revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was a healthy 14% in the quarter and 17% year-to-date. Adjusted revenue growth in the quarter was 9% and 14% for the first 9 months, well ahead of the medium-term segment guidance of 9% to 12%. Merchant volume and transactions grew 10% and 5%, respectively, excluding the loss of a processing client mid last year. Activity was consistent in North America with some deceleration in Europe. We see new opportunity with the launch of our Deutsche Bank joint venture in the quarter. Turning to our merchant operating systems, Clover and Carat. We continue to see gains across key metrics, including net new merchant adds, value-added services penetration and partner relationships. Clover revenue grew 19%, coming off our toughest comparison against last year when the post-COVID return to normal was in full swing. Payment volume growth was 21%. Software and services penetration reached 15% of total revenue, an increase of over 260 basis points from last year and up 30 basis points sequentially, with strength in assets like Clover Capital. Clover Connect for ISVs built on its momentum with very strong revenue growth in the quarter as we continue to execute on our vertical strategies, adding 37 ISV partners. We won key clients away from competition such as SalonUltimate software, a comprehensive solution for salons and spas. Another PayFac win in the quarter was Tempus, which expands our presence in the health care vertical. We focused on our integration of BentoBox and rounded out our restaurant offering with the acquisition of NexTable for reservations, providing an opportunity to expand ARPU beyond the average increase of 2 to 3x, which we see for merchants using BentoBox and Clover. Carat also had a strong quarter with revenue growing at 18%. We continue to drive accelerated growth in new money flows with third quarter digital transactions up 67% year-over-year and online EBT transactions up 27%. We delivered on our new innovations and signed agreements with Sunoco to launch Pay by Bank and with Subway's digital acquiring business in Puerto Rico via our connected commerce ecosystem, among others. We also continue to show we're a provider of choice for fintechs, this time with [ peer lenders there too ] for digital disbursements and card-not-present acquiring. Adjusted operating income in Acceptance segment increased 11% to $610 million in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was up 20 basis points to 32.4%. The improvement was led by operating leverage and cost management more than offsetting the impact of acquisitions and divestitures as well as FX. Year-to-date, adjusted operating income improved 14% to $1.7 billion, and adjusted operating margin grew 20 basis points to 30.8%. Turning to Slide 6. On the Payments and Network segment, organic revenue grew 11% in the quarter, above the high end of the 5% to 8% medium-term guidance range. This growth was enabled by a variety of drivers across our business lines. Our North American credit active accounts on file grew 19% versus third quarter of last year. This growth was driven by both new business onboarding and a favorable credit environment. Our international issuing business grew strong double digits, driven by macroeconomic improvement as well as the onboarding of new clients. And our debit business continues to post solid growth, driven by new client wins on our debit networks, STAR and Accel. We are pleased with several wins among fintechs in the quarter as well, including one with Papaya for eBill distribution. Papaya is an app provider that brings billers and consumers together for a better bill pay experience. Year-to-date organic revenue grew 8%, and we expect the momentum in this segment to continue through the rest of the year, resulting in full year organic revenue growth at or above the top end of our medium-term outlook range of 5% to 8%. Adjusted operating income for the segment was up 14% to $744 million, and adjusted operating margin was up 190 basis points to 45.9%, driven by strong operating leverage. Year-to-date, adjusted operating income was up 9% to $2 billion, and adjusted operating margin was up 70 basis points versus last year at 44.1%. Moving to Slide 7. In the Financial Technology segment, we posted 1% organic revenue growth for the quarter and 4% year-to-date, within our 4% to 6% medium-term guidance range. The nonrecurring portions of this business, including new product implementation work and professional services, was impacted by the timing of contracts in September. But we retain good line of sight to this revenue being booked in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, customer momentum continues, and we had 14 core wins in the quarter, including 9 competitive takeaways. Adjusted operating income was down 5% in the quarter to $261 million and up 3% to $817 million year-to-date. Adjusted operating margin in the segment decreased 190 basis points to 34.1% in the quarter, driven by investment in Finxact and timing of periodic revenue. Year-to-date, the segment's adjusted operating margin declined 50 basis points to 34.8%. The adjusted corporate operating loss was $109 million in the quarter, a slight improvement from the first half run rate and $356 million year-to-date. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 20.9% and was 19.8% year-to-date. We expect the full year 2022 adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 20%. Total debt outstanding was $21.4 billion on September 30. The debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio dropped another 0.1 turn to 2.9x, reaching our target leverage of being below 3x, which we set when we announced our merger. During the quarter, we stepped up our share repurchases, buying back $750 million worth of our stock. We had 24.5 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase at the end of the quarter. Additionally, we've repurchased a little more than $250 million so far in October. We are fully committed to our long-standing capital allocation strategy, which includes investing in our business organically, maintaining a strong balance sheet, repurchasing shares and pursuing high-value and innovative acquisitions. We've included Slide 8 in the presentation to reflect this greater investment while strengthening our balance sheet and returning cash to our shareholders. With that, let me turn the call back to Frank.\nFrank Bisignano: Thanks, Bob. Let me wrap up with an update about progress on ESG and our people platform. Since the release of our most recent CSR report in the second quarter, we have seen positive momentum in our ESG ratings at MSCI, Refinitiv and S&P CSA and significant increases in our ISS quality scores. We have submitted our CDP survey for the second year. These improvements are attributable to our improved ESG programming, framework alignment and our 2021 CSR report. As we look out to what is best described as an uncertain year ahead, Fiserv is well positioned for the long haul. We've made the investments in product, people and infrastructure that will allow us to continue as an industry leader, driving better top line growth and productivity. We've talked about some of the product innovation and TAM expansion that we've achieved. So let me take a minute to discuss our people. We're grateful for our dedicated workforce, especially our essential workers who are present throughout the pandemic. We recognize their commitment both through compensation and career advancement while supporting them by upgrading and expanding our infrastructure. This made it particularly gratifying when we were ranked #6 of the top 250 largest U.S. public companies on the American Opportunity Index earlier this month. The index measures how well these companies foster economic mobility based on real-world outcomes for employees, particularly those without a college degree. This index is one indicator that shows we are well positioned to compete for talent. Our hybrid workforce strategy is greatly enhanced by world-class facilities and colocated workforces. We began consolidating around large modern hubs and closed over 70 facilities in the past 2 years. This morning, we announced our new location for our global headquarters in Downtown Milwaukee. Last month, we opened the largest fintech hub on the East Coast, our innovation center in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, where we anticipate LEED Platinum certification. This followed a major upgrade of both our production and office facilities in Omaha, Nebraska. We are opening new and expanded facilities in Dublin, Ireland and Sao Paulo, Brazil and are working towards LEED certification in these facilities after achieving LEED Gold status in New York. While this spending will ease in 2023, we are already reaping the rewards through lower operating expenses and increased productivity. I will close by thanking our more than 40,000 hardworking Fiserv associates around the world for working relentlessly to serve our clients and you, our shareholders. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson.\nLisa Dejong Ellis: First one, just, Bob, it's for you on free cash flow. Can you just elaborate a bit on what changed, I guess, relative to 90 days ago that caused you to bring down the free cash flow outlook for the year? And maybe just more broadly, looking forward, how are you thinking about what more of a sustainable level of free cash flow conversion is for Fiserv, realizing that there were some unusual items in this year, in 2022?\nRobert Hau: Yes. Lisa, thank you. So I guess a couple of things. One, in terms of the adjustment in our outlook for the full year, I think I would point to a couple of things. One is we continue to see good opportunities to invest for future growth. Obviously, we're seeing an impact in the current year from an 11% growth rate that puts pressure on working capital. As you grow the top line, you have more receivables, but we're also carrying more inventory. One of the things that has persisted longer than we had anticipated just 90 days ago is the supply chain issues/problems in China around getting point-of-sale devices, et cetera. And we continue to ensure that we have availability of product and can support our client base with having a product, point-of-sale product. COVID shutdowns in China are actually going on right now, and so protecting ourselves there. We also have some new geographies and new clients that are bringing on Clover and other point-of-sale devices. So we continue to invest in that. You see our capital spending around new product development, software cap. We continue to see good opportunities, so we're driving for sustainable, very high single, perhaps even low double-digit growth investments around the acquisitions of Finxact, Ondot, BentoBox. We've made the decision to keep investing and therefore revised our free cash flow. In terms of long-term sustainability, I'm not prepared to give guidance for 2023. But we've certainly seen in the last 2 years, '21 and '22, a pretty significant step function change in our growth rate, 11% last year, which granted is against the COVID adjusted prior year. But 11% this year, bending that curve, so to speak, from companies that were mid-single digits and perhaps generously mid-single digits pre merger, now double digits. You're going to see something less than 100% free cash flow going forward, I think.\nLisa Dejong Ellis: Okay. Okay. All right. And then my follow-up, Frank, for you. In your prepared remarks commenting in regards to Carat, you highlighted that many merchants find that the in-store, the card-present component of acquiring or omnichannel acquiring is often the more complicated part. Can you just elaborate on this? I think this is a question we get often just sort of related to how to think about omnichannel acquiring and the tricky aspects of executing that for merchants that might currently use different acquirers in-store and online.\nFrank Bisignano: Yes. Thanks. I think we always had a very strong in-store presence. And we were always a large processor for e-commerce transactions. And then we geared into the front end of the business and began building out that omnichannel presence. What we see is that our ability to bring, in fact, a single integration point, single reporting structure, connected hardware, connected systems as companies evolve and want many times an easier instance, we are an excellent provider of it. And when we look at Carat long term, you see us also talking about other features in there where we allow a multi-purse wallet that puts more product in there. It could be loyalty. It could be prepaid. It could be rebates. So how we bring all that capability in a single connection, ultimately even allowing larger players. And ultimately, we think it will drop to mid-market, this capability, the ability for their consumers to build greater loyalty through this single connection and this omnichannel presence. So we're pretty excited. We've built it out. The use cases are there. We feel the winning is occurring and the volume is falling through the system. So it's been strategic. We came from a different place than others. We came with a great physical presence and a great processing capability. And then building omnichannel front end of Carat is resonating well with our clients. So think about it along with integrated value-added services and embedded finance, and all of that ultimately was using a much larger value prop, that pure omnichannel. I hope that's helpful.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of David Togut from Evercore ISI.\nDavid Togut: Bob, could you dig into your commentary around the bridge to 2022 margins, particularly your actions to tighten spending in the third quarter? Can you bracket for us what the annualized cost savings from these actions might be?\nRobert Hau: Sure, David. So a couple of things from a margin standpoint. If you recall, actually going back to our first quarter earnings call, which we reiterated in the second earning -- second quarter earnings. And we've expected since the beginning of the year that our margin would accelerate into the second half of the year. That acceleration was largely driven by carryover integration spending that we used to back in 2021, just out as merger and integration spending. Our company policy says you do that through the end of last year. And any projects that are continuing no longer get adjusted out of our earnings, and so we had some cost flow into the P&L at the beginning of the year that we knew those projects were going to finish up in the first half, first 9 months of the year. And so that investment, that integration spending would taper off through the year and, in particular, be mostly out by the end of the third quarter. So you see improvement in investment or lower spending on those projects. Plus you get the benefit of the projects being done, i.e., those generate a return, generate productivity. And so you get a double bang in the second half of the year. And in particular, as those projects again have largely been completed at the end of the third quarter, we'll see that come down in Q4 and get the productivity. The second piece of growth in margin is basic productivity, i.e., nonmerger-related nonintegration, what we used to refer to as operational excellence rolling through the business. Some of that is very basic productivity Six Sigma leaning out your spending sort of a thing. Some of it is the fact that we've now reopened our offices, and our associate base is returning to the office, increasing our collaboration. Frank talked about the location work that we've done in creating large hubs like the Berkeley Heights facility in North Central New Jersey that is now open, driving some collaboration and productivity. And then the -- I guess, the final 2 things that will drive margin in the fourth quarter, one is scale. As you know, an incremental dollar of revenue in this company comes through at higher than company average growth given the fixed cost nature of the company. And so we feel good about seeing good operating leverage on revenue growth and scale. And then finally, some of the divestitures, we did those 3 small units that we sold. At the end of the third quarter, you'll see the benefit of fourth. Q3 over Q2, we expanded margins 170 basis points. Obviously, if you do the math, we've got a big expansion expected in the fourth quarter. But quite frankly, if you look over the last 5 or 6 quarters, right in line with what we've done in the past, 300, 400, even 500 basis point margin improvement in a number of quarters in the last 6, 8 quarters. So I feel good about our ability to generate at least 100 basis points for the full year.\nDavid Togut: Just a quick follow-up on the Clover revenue growth, which stepped down a little bit to 19% but still well above market growth. What's the path to get back on the 5-year growth plan of 27% that you laid out at the March Merchant Acceptance deep dive?\nRobert Hau: Sure, David. I guess the fastest thing to think about or the largest thing to think about is the 19% number that we showed in our prepared remarks and in the slides. That's a reported number. Obviously, FX had a pretty significant impact in the entire company, actually in all companies in the third quarter. If you were to currency adjust that number, you'll probably pick up 3 points, maybe even 4 points of growth. Plus, as you recall, in the first quarter of this year, we divested a small joint venture that we had. It was a minority equity interest actually technically, generated about $175 million of cash. So on an organic basis, that Clover growth is actually more in line with the 25% that we've talked about as part of our long-range expectation of growing Clover to at least $3.5 billion.\nFrank Bisignano: Yes, I would add there. We talked about $3.5 billion in 2025. We talked about a 9% to 12% for the segment. We're in normal compares, we're at 14% right now for the segment. I also think what we're doing on value-added services and they don't keep inching up and moving up and just saw it's a key driver here. We continue to grow the merchant base, grow the LTV , growth the ARPU, and we feel highly confident in exactly what we said in March. And I think it's playing out right now exactly as planned. Our sequential growth has been very high and I think so. If you look at it ex what Bob talked about and just look at the business case and the driving of it, our confidence level is as high as it was in March, and we're seeing it play out, and the value-added services will continue to grow quarter-by-quarter.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research.\nDarrin Peller: If we break down the merchant growth rate again, 14% is obviously somewhat industry-leading growth. And you had the volume growth, I think it was 10%. If you could just remind us, are the components all the same as to what's really driving that outperformance on overall growth? And the spread between revenue and volume, if that's something that you see sustainable and what's driving that? Obviously, Clover and Carat continue to do well. But how is international? How is the SMB versus enterprise? And Frank, just any patterns you're seeing change, if any, in the consumer behavior would be great.\nFrank Bisignano: Yes. We like to say, hey, we don't really talk about yields, we are talking about revenue. I know you've heard us be consistently beating that drumbeat. We decided to beat that drumbeat when we're on the right side of that curve. So I think we used it as they walk away from commitment on anything. I think the investment you see us putting into this business, and net investments from sales to infrastructure to product development is really driving the number. I think you heard us announce partnerships across the board and even more today than as we talk more about Deutsche. But then the ISV is -- I think the business mix which we said at the start of the pandemic that we had this tremendously balanced mix, we had the best distribution in the industry and we had fabulous geographic reach, is still playing out. And that really is what's driving our growth number and our volume numbers. We did not have a great quarter in the European theater. But the mix of our business and the strength of our business from the largest retailers to the pizza store in Brooklyn, as you know, I like to talk about my own town, really shows through in the model. I think the work in Clover and the building of the value-added services is definitely also playing into our growth in a way that may not always be just in that but also in our total product set and the ability to deliver it. So I think we do have the industry-leading franchise. I think Clover, they've always been supportive of it from the start, has proved out its merit and you're seeing it come through. I'd say the only other thing I'd add is our franchises in Brazil, in Argentina continue to win and grow as does our U.S. franchise. So value-added services, omnichannel growth in verticals like restaurants, international, that was our story in the beginning of the pandemic, and that's our story coming out of it. And we're having a margin discussion, and we're fully confident where we're going to be there. I would note that merchant has the largest margin it's ever had this quarter also, and that's a testimony to how leadership in that business is driving it and the outcomes it's getting.\nDarrin Peller: Okay. Just a quick follow-up on the Payments segment. Just the strong, strong growth, obviously, the accounts and the issuer side was strong in the credit card and the new wins. But if you could just comment on what's happening in some of the other aspects of the business, whether it's bill payments or it's the network. Just -- and what kind of aspects of that growth is sustainable versus maybe once we anniversary the new wins, is there more to go?\nFrank Bisignano: Yes. I mean we had talked about this. The wins, the onboarding of the wins, they're growing. I'd like to frequently go back to Investor Day where we talked about this incredible pipeline, which at the time felt like it was a once in a lifetime event, meaning you win 3 of the top 25 issuers. And that part was a onetime event. But that pipeline is the same size and shape as it was back in 2020. And the building out of health care and government verticals, investment in education, all bode very well for performing at the higher end of that guidance range as we go forward here. I'm not giving guidance for anything other than what we're talking about in '22. But the pipeline is very strong. And you hear us talking about the California win. But the reality is we've had multiple government wins with our ability to distribute payments in a card-based fashion and having probably the best capability in the industry around that.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Dave Koning from Baird.\nDavid Koning: And a couple of things. I guess my first question, kind of a follow-up on David Togut's question. It looks like your sequential EBIT dollars of growth, the way you're guiding is $150 million plus. Your revenue is about $50 million, give or take. So let's say that all goes to EBIT, that's $100 million of extra, right, of extra kind of that cost control. Is that a fair way to think about it? And you kind of said that's sustainable. I mean is that $400 million of run rate cost savings? Because I mean that would be a huge benefit into next year as well. Are we looking at that right?\nRobert Hau: Yes. David, I'd be a little careful. I have to run through all of your math. You've got some broad assumptions on the sequential growth or the growth year-over-year in fourth quarter. Ultimately, the simple or straight answer is, look, we see some good cost improvement third quarter to fourth quarter. As I talked about earlier, the ramp-down of these integration projects as well as the benefit of the projects driving productivity into the organization now that we've got integration largely behind us, maintaining the productivity model that you've seen from this company for a lot of years. And certainly, incremental revenue drops to the bottom line. The growth in Payments certainly helps. Obviously, that's our highest-margin business, and continuing to see good growth in SMB also helps. So we feel good about the quote, to use a 4-letter word mix, in the fourth quarter. We see good opportunity or a good line of sight towards cost reduction/productivity, divesting a couple of these small nonstrategic units that are low margin and getting that scale really helps into the fourth quarter.\nDavid Koning: Got you. And just a quick follow-up. In the Fintech segment, I know Q3 was clearly weak. Is there a way to give kind of a more normalized growth number ex the implementations? And then also, Q4 has been higher than Q2. Every year going back since, I think, '08 was maybe the last time Q4 was below Q2. Is it fair just to think that if everything is kind of normalized that, that pattern would continue?\nRobert Hau: No. Obviously, we put up a 7% Q2 number. I would not anticipate us being north of 7% in fourth quarter. We do feel good about the growth of the Fintech segment. If you look over the last several years, there's variation quarter-to-quarter. Some of that is the periodic revenue or license and term fees. We have the additional impact in third quarter of this year for these nonrecurring one-timer type. I hate to use to as one-timer because they're regular. As contracts renew, we get short-term or immediate-term revenue, and some of that's already slipped into fourth quarter, i.e., we started to see some of that rebounds. We feel good about, number one, we're already in the 4% to 6% range, and we'll close the year out that way.\nFrank Bisignano: Yes. I'll just say I thought you had asked about our new Milwaukee headquarters.\nDavid Koning: Yes, nice. Yes, great.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Good revenue here. I just wanted to ask on the buybacks here.  You're at your target leverage, as you've called out, and you stepped up your buybacks. It looks like, what, 80% of free cash flow is getting allocated to buybacks year-to-date. So just wanted to check your appetite on buying back stock here. It sounds like October was in line with the third quarter run rate. Appetite to buy back stock versus acquisitions?\nRobert Hau: Tien-Tsin, I guess, first, yes, obviously, we've been buying back shares. We are always in the market. Every once in a while there's some ebbs and flows, and we've been -- we were strong in the third quarter and certainly strong so far in fourth quarter. I feel good about our ability to continue to buy back shares. It's a balanced capital deployment approach that we've always had and continue to have around investing in organic growth. If you look at that new slide, we added a significant increase in CapEx, which is obviously putting pressure on free cash flow. But we did that while also paying down some debt or delevering down to our targeted leverage rate that gives us lots of flexibility to ultimately do both M&A and share purchase. I see it obviously, as a bit of a trade-off. If I spend $1 in M&A, I don't have that dollar available on -- for share repurchase. But we have good capacity to do both. We look at acquisitions through the lens of a share repurchase. We're certainly interested in continuing to add to our portfolio. As I've said in the past, I don't wake up in the morning saying, \"Geez, I really need to go get x capability given the breadth of our existing portfolio.\" There are lots of things that we can add, whether it's NexTable that we did recently or it's BentoBox or Finxact. We did all of that while also buying back a lot of shares.\nFrank Bisignano: Yes. No, I think I'd just say that we have an appetite. You see our appetite across the segments. We are highly selective, Bento, Finxact. And then we come back and invest heavily, Ondot, in those as we had done on Clover. So we feel good about our balanced approach. I think you can see that, obviously, we invest in the business organically or invest in the business inorganically. And then we feel good about buying back of stock and returning that to shareholders too. You should imagine that we're going to have that continued balance mentality. And obviously, we like to integrate companies and grow them.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Good. My quick follow-up, if you don't mind. Just on the -- you mentioned STAR and Accel supporting card-not-present transactions. I know I've asked about this in the past, and I hear you that you want to wait for how issuers want to implement the new rule in July. But the readiness for STAR and Accel, is there still a lot of investment required to attack that? And I guess, I'll ask how aggressive will Fiserv be in that pursuit.\nFrank Bisignano: I'd say readiness is high. I think we made a comment that they are designed to be dual network capable. And our ability to execute, we think, is very high. Obviously, we always felt that this would create more competition, and we like that. Obviously, we weren't competing for those transactions before. And you should expect us to behave like we do in every other business line, which is try to grow at the best possible rate. So I think we're in the planning stage. Obviously, it is up to issuers. But we think that this was a very good outcome, and we continue to expect ourselves to participate as we would given our size and scale and the nature of the business we have.\nOperator: Our last question will come from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America.\nJason Kupferberg: Just wanted to go back to Bob, your answer to Lisa's question in the Q&A. The free cash flow conversion, I think you said likely to remain below 100% going forward. But I'm just trying to think about this in the context of the Analyst Day in 2020. I think the target there was 105% plus, and that was with a 7% to 9% revenue growth rate. So just wanted to kind of calibrate this. I mean if revenue growth moves back to the high single-digit range from the current low double-digit run rate, does that mean that free cash flow conversion goes back north of 100%? Or have some other things changed in the business around CapEx or other factors that we should just be thinking about?\nRobert Hau: Yes. One, I'll have to go back and check the transcript. I don't think I said it was likely. I said to see a business growing at this level. I try not to give guidance or an outlook or adjust what we've said previously. Obviously, in today's world, the view of 2023, '24, '25, '26 is just a little bit cloudy, and we'll continue to evaluate. Some of it is what are our investment opportunities to either be at the top end of that range and/or perhaps even accelerate from that. When we gave -- when we did our earnings, looks to me our investment call, investor conference back in December of '20, we hadn't yet closed the Finxact transaction. We've talked about how that acquisition may give us an opportunity to bend the curve, so to speak, yet again on the Fintech segment, which today hitting at a 4% to 6% rate is above what we've been able to do traditionally. And as Finxact continues to grow, we'll see some opportunity there. Building out Clover and growing our merchant business at perhaps even the high end of that 9% to 12%, the March of '22 investor conference talked about perhaps better growth in that segment. So lots of opportunities for us, and we're going to make sure that we are making good investment decisions to grow the top and bottom line and generating good returns for our shareholders.\nJason Kupferberg: And just a quick follow-up. Just given all the momentum in the Payments segment, do you feel more bullish on your ability to be near the higher end of the 5% to 8% target range there, not just for this year but beyond this year?\nRobert Hau: Look, I think we've seen some very nice progress in the growth this year. We're getting some great feedback from our clients. The $120 million worth of wins that we talked about back in December of '20 now all implemented and growing, many of them actually outperforming that $120 million worth of ACV. We have a continued strong backlog. Building out that government vertical that we've talked about, certainly an opportunity. Again, we're not prepared to give an outlook or guidance for 2023, but we feel quite good about how that segment is performing right now.\nFrank Bisignano: Thank you for your attention today. Please feel free to reach out to our IR team with any questions, and have a great day. Thanks a lot, guys and girls, ladies.\nOperator: Thank you all for participating in the Fiserv Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. That concludes today's call. Please disconnect at this time, and have a great rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Frank Bisignano",
            "content": "Thank you, Julie. Before I begin, let me again welcome Julie to the team. As we announced last quarter, she moved to a new role as the Head of Strategy. Julie joins us from Bloomberg, where she was a senior equity analyst covering the fintech and payment space and has extensive experience as a sell-side analyst and investment product manager. Welcome to your first Fiserv earnings call, Julie. Turning to the results. Overall, I am very pleased with yet another quarter of double-digit growth in both organic revenue and adjusted EPS. We continue to demonstrate the strength of our client base, depth of our partnerships and resilience of our businesses. Consumers activated more cards, continue to spend and were issued new credit. Merchants opened up new businesses, offered better experiences and took advantage of more value-added services. Financial institutions upgraded their systems and invested in new products to better compete and capture efficiencies. In the early days of the fourth quarter, we are seeing the same trends continue. We grew adjusted revenue 8% with organic revenue up 11%, at the top end of our full year 2022 guidance range. Adjusted operating margin of 35.2% was up 100 basis points year-over-year, expanded 170 basis points sequentially and was consistent with our internal modeling. Adjusted EPS of $1.63 included an $0.08 foreign exchange headwind versus last year, which is $0.03 more than we anticipated 90 days ago. As we look forward, pressure remained from inflation, a still tight [ global ] market and geopolitical uncertainty. But as a global and diverse business, we are well prepared to capitalize in any market environment. Based on continued momentum, strong execution and near-term visibility, we are raising our revenue guidance to the high end of the range for this year to 11% organic and raising our adjusted EPS to $6.48 to $6.55. Clearly, we're executing well beyond our legacy as a mid-single-digit top line grower. Based on the actions we've taken and the investments we've made, I remain confident that we can achieve faster growth in the high single-digit range or better over the coming years while maintaining our track record of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. When we brought together Fiserv and First Data in July 2019, we envisioned an industry-leading combination with a complete set of strong payments and fintech capabilities that were highly complementary. As we've combined these great companies, we're sometimes asked how being a diversified company that serves merchants and financial institutions, large and small, across all payment types is the winning strategy. We believe we're already demonstrating this through market share gains, faster growth and expanding margins, and the third quarter is another proof point of the power of this team and our set of assets and capabilities. Third quarter highlights the continuing momentum in our Payments and Network segment with organic revenue growth of 11% and adjusted operating margin expanding 190 basis points to 45.9%. Our issuer solutions business, which includes credit processing for large issuers and card and statement services, was particularly strong. Issuer solutions [indiscernible] contracts, with 3 of the top 25 North American credit card issuers within the last 2 years, a testament to our single platform that delivers a full suite of digital capabilities. We can trace our success here directly to the investment we've made in the business over the last few years. These include a robust set of APIs; AI-based fraud management; cardholder experience technology, being the Ondot acquisition; integrated end-to-end output solutions plus ongoing cloud enablement of our technology stack. Since we began combining Fiserv and First Data, we made a decision to pursue the opportunity in the government vertical with its large TAM and multiple use cases that span merchant, issuer and output services. We began investing in the solutions, people and infrastructure, and the strategy is now playing out. This month, we began issuing roughly 10 million prepaid cards for the State of California under its middle class tax credit program. Since announcing this win last quarter, we were awarded another contract with the California State Controller for cards supporting various disbursement needs. We work with 5 other states to disburse and process their unemployment benefit cards. The pipeline remains large, and this vertical is traditionally quite resilient through the economic cycle. Investing in innovation is a constant across our business, and nowhere are the benefits more evident than in our Merchant Acceptance business. We had another strong quarter for merchant, growing organic revenue 14%, once again outpacing our medium-term guidance of 9% to 12%. At Clover, we rolled out several new products to enhance the merchant experience and customer authorization. This quarter, we'll be piloting an expanded retail vertical offering with additional horizontal value-added services, including an integration with accounting and business software. Our vertical solutions are resonating. In September, Clover Sport signed an agreement with Caesars Superdome and the Smoothie King Center in New Orleans, adding to its base of over 250 professional- and college-level sports venues. Clover will streamline purchasing at concession stands, premium bars and clubs with digital, contactless and self-service purchasing. We will also provide third-party integration to related services and real-time data insights. Carat, our enterprise omnichannel operating system, launched new money flows and continued to lead the market in payout choice and flexibility. We launched more instances of our multi-purse wallet, a white-label solution that holds multiple sources of value, including loyalty and prepaid. And we're proud to share that in July, Fiserv was named Merchant Acquirer of the Year by the Merchant Payments Ecosystem Awards in recognition of the highly successful debut of Carat as an omnichannel commerce operating system. As I mentioned earlier this year, data is an emerging business for us, and it spans both merchant and financial institution clients. We're excited to announce our new data-as-a-service offering in September, partnering with Snowflake. Fiserv will enable customers to access their payments data in near real time to better inform business decisions. By leveraging Snowflake Secure Data Sharing, customers can now seamlessly and securely access and integrate their data, driving deeper timely insights. A large energy company is just one type of client already in pilot. Financial institutions are excited by our data-as-a-service offering as well. Carter Bank, a $4 billion Mid-Atlantic community bank, is in an open data pilot with us to consolidate and connect all data across the enterprise. Many banks tell us they spend too much time trying to source, provision and integrate data. Fiserv and Snowflake will make it easier for Carter to use the data across their Fiserv and non-Fiserv systems to fully understand their customers down to the branch level. Fintech performance was lower than normal this quarter at 1% organic revenue growth but generated 4% growth year-to-date, and is on track to meet our organic growth guidance of 4% to 6%. This is a consistent business, but timing of product additions, new business implementations and professional services revenue can vary from quarter-to-quarter. Some of this revenue anticipated for September slipped into the fourth quarter, and we have good line of sight to full year revenue in the medium-term guidance range. We remain encouraged by our visibility here after signing 14 core wins in the quarter, with 9 being competitive takeaways spread across large banks, new banks, fintechs, community banks and credit unions. Earlier this year, Webster Bank acquired Fiserv client Sterling Bank to create a $65 billion Northeast regional. In the quarter, Webster chose Fiserv as its core account processing platform with multiple surround spanning our fintech and payments offering. We've talked about the strategic importance of Finxact, a leading cloud banking core today, with 11 clients already in production. After just 6 months under our umbrella, Finxact is attracting strong interest from both new and existing Fiserv clients. With 2 large new client wins in the quarter, Finxact will become the cloud-based core platform for 2 more emerging online banks. And just yesterday, we entered into a new agreement with Zenus to power this global digital bank's first-to-market solution, running Finxact on the Microsoft Azure Cloud. Looking forward, there's plenty of uncertainty around what 2023 will bring. We're currently in the planning phase but have already taken steps to ensure we are prepared for a softer macroeconomic environment. We are fortunate to have a well-diversified business with high recurring revenue and a strong balance sheet. Bob will talk more about these factors shortly, but I want to share with you what I am seeing and hearing from clients and where I see opportunity for Fiserv in the coming quarters. The Payments segment has successfully capitalized on industry trends that are enabling strong growth. I call out 4 major trends that are responsible not only for the strong growth we are seeing now but a robust pipeline for the coming year. First, cardholders continue to expect better payment experiences, and more issuers look to our platforms to meet this demand. Issuers are also investing in more modern technology solutions such as better digital, broad and loyalty capabilities, all of which offer us attractive cross-sell opportunities. Second, the addressable market is growing. Segments such as health care, education and government are increasingly looking for new credit processing and disbursement solutions. Nontraditional start-ups and fintechs have also been actively entering the card issuing and lending space. Third, demand for plastic solution remains high as issuers compete heavily for new volume. Finally, the card payments environment has remained active even as we see continued growth in noncard payments, including Zelle and real-time payments. Two regulation-led opportunities [indiscernible] first, the Fed announced that its real-time network, FedNow, would go live in mid-2023. Fiserv has been part of the FedNow pilot, and we believe that we are well positioned to participate in the rising adoption of real-time payments. We enable financial institutions and, eventually, billers and merchants to integrate with a variety of real-time services and networks through our single connection. Second, earlier this month, the Federal Reserve finalized a clarification to Reg II that the dual network requirement for debit applies for all transaction types, including card-not-present. Fiserv believes this will promote market competition, which will ultimately benefit consumers, merchants, issuers and the industry at large. Our debit networks, STAR and Accel, support card-not-present transactions, but many factors will influence our ultimate opportunity, so we will wait to see how issuers implement this rule once it takes effect in July. In Merchant Acceptance, the uncertain macro environment has merchants, large and small, looking to optimize the value in their operations. In some cases, this has increased their desire for a single full-service provider over fragmented specialists. And that suits us well given our breadth and scale. Their focus on areas like payment optimization, lower-cost payment methods and fraud is presenting more value-added service opportunities as well. In fact, we've won a few deals to enable Pay by Bank, which lowers the cost of acceptance for merchants, is an easy way for consumers to earn rewards. One of our large petro merchants, Sunoco, with 5,500 locations, was just one such win in the third quarter. With the e-commerce penetration returning to a more normal growth trend, card-present solutions are in focus as the more complex problem to solve for integrated omnichannel solutions. Our marquee base of large merchant customers is looking to us here. This includes leading petro and grocery merchants who are more insulated from economic slowdowns due to the nondiscretionary nature of their businesses. In our Fintech business, banks are managing through the macro uncertainty with a focus on serving existing customers and improving operational efficiency, two areas where we provide a number of important products and services that offer a way to grow accounts and enter new markets in a cost-effective manner. Finxact, our new cloud-native modern banking platform, is being recognized as the best way to conceptualize, create and launch new banking products. And our pipeline is particularly active with pioneering digital banks and big issuers entering the banking market via embedded finance. A leading example is our partnership with One Finance, supporting their growth initiatives in retail. We can offer them faster time to market with greater flexibility and scalability plus the largest product portfolio available. Now let me pass the discussion to Bob for more detail on our financial results. Thanks, Bob. Let me wrap up with an update about progress on ESG and our people platform. Since the release of our most recent CSR report in the second quarter, we have seen positive momentum in our ESG ratings at MSCI, Refinitiv and S&P CSA and significant increases in our ISS quality scores. We have submitted our CDP survey for the second year. These improvements are attributable to our improved ESG programming, framework alignment and our 2021 CSR report. As we look out to what is best described as an uncertain year ahead, Fiserv is well positioned for the long haul. We've made the investments in product, people and infrastructure that will allow us to continue as an industry leader, driving better top line growth and productivity. We've talked about some of the product innovation and TAM expansion that we've achieved. So let me take a minute to discuss our people. We're grateful for our dedicated workforce, especially our essential workers who are present throughout the pandemic. We recognize their commitment both through compensation and career advancement while supporting them by upgrading and expanding our infrastructure. This made it particularly gratifying when we were ranked #6 of the top 250 largest U.S. public companies on the American Opportunity Index earlier this month. The index measures how well these companies foster economic mobility based on real-world outcomes for employees, particularly those without a college degree. This index is one indicator that shows we are well positioned to compete for talent. Our hybrid workforce strategy is greatly enhanced by world-class facilities and colocated workforces. We began consolidating around large modern hubs and closed over 70 facilities in the past 2 years. This morning, we announced our new location for our global headquarters in Downtown Milwaukee. Last month, we opened the largest fintech hub on the East Coast, our innovation center in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, where we anticipate LEED Platinum certification. This followed a major upgrade of both our production and office facilities in Omaha, Nebraska. We are opening new and expanded facilities in Dublin, Ireland and Sao Paulo, Brazil and are working towards LEED certification in these facilities after achieving LEED Gold status in New York. While this spending will ease in 2023, we are already reaping the rewards through lower operating expenses and increased productivity. I will close by thanking our more than 40,000 hardworking Fiserv associates around the world for working relentlessly to serve our clients and you, our shareholders. With that, operator, please open the line for questions. Yes. Thanks. I think we always had a very strong in-store presence. And we were always a large processor for e-commerce transactions. And then we geared into the front end of the business and began building out that omnichannel presence. What we see is that our ability to bring, in fact, a single integration point, single reporting structure, connected hardware, connected systems as companies evolve and want many times an easier instance, we are an excellent provider of it. And when we look at Carat long term, you see us also talking about other features in there where we allow a multi-purse wallet that puts more product in there. It could be loyalty. It could be prepaid. It could be rebates. So how we bring all that capability in a single connection, ultimately even allowing larger players. And ultimately, we think it will drop to mid-market, this capability, the ability for their consumers to build greater loyalty through this single connection and this omnichannel presence. So we're pretty excited. We've built it out. The use cases are there. We feel the winning is occurring and the volume is falling through the system. So it's been strategic. We came from a different place than others. We came with a great physical presence and a great processing capability. And then building omnichannel front end of Carat is resonating well with our clients. So think about it along with integrated value-added services and embedded finance, and all of that ultimately was using a much larger value prop, that pure omnichannel. I hope that's helpful. Yes, I would add there. We talked about $3.5 billion in 2025. We talked about a 9% to 12% for the segment. We're in normal compares, we're at 14% right now for the segment. I also think what we're doing on value-added services and they don't keep inching up and moving up and just saw it's a key driver here. We continue to grow the merchant base, grow the LTV , growth the ARPU, and we feel highly confident in exactly what we said in March. And I think it's playing out right now exactly as planned. Our sequential growth has been very high and I think so. If you look at it ex what Bob talked about and just look at the business case and the driving of it, our confidence level is as high as it was in March, and we're seeing it play out, and the value-added services will continue to grow quarter-by-quarter. Yes. We like to say, hey, we don't really talk about yields, we are talking about revenue. I know you've heard us be consistently beating that drumbeat. We decided to beat that drumbeat when we're on the right side of that curve. So I think we used it as they walk away from commitment on anything. I think the investment you see us putting into this business, and net investments from sales to infrastructure to product development is really driving the number. I think you heard us announce partnerships across the board and even more today than as we talk more about Deutsche. But then the ISV is -- I think the business mix which we said at the start of the pandemic that we had this tremendously balanced mix, we had the best distribution in the industry and we had fabulous geographic reach, is still playing out. And that really is what's driving our growth number and our volume numbers. We did not have a great quarter in the European theater. But the mix of our business and the strength of our business from the largest retailers to the pizza store in Brooklyn, as you know, I like to talk about my own town, really shows through in the model. I think the work in Clover and the building of the value-added services is definitely also playing into our growth in a way that may not always be just in that but also in our total product set and the ability to deliver it. So I think we do have the industry-leading franchise. I think Clover, they've always been supportive of it from the start, has proved out its merit and you're seeing it come through. I'd say the only other thing I'd add is our franchises in Brazil, in Argentina continue to win and grow as does our U.S. franchise. So value-added services, omnichannel growth in verticals like restaurants, international, that was our story in the beginning of the pandemic, and that's our story coming out of it. And we're having a margin discussion, and we're fully confident where we're going to be there. I would note that merchant has the largest margin it's ever had this quarter also, and that's a testimony to how leadership in that business is driving it and the outcomes it's getting. Yes. I mean we had talked about this. The wins, the onboarding of the wins, they're growing. I'd like to frequently go back to Investor Day where we talked about this incredible pipeline, which at the time felt like it was a once in a lifetime event, meaning you win 3 of the top 25 issuers. And that part was a onetime event. But that pipeline is the same size and shape as it was back in 2020. And the building out of health care and government verticals, investment in education, all bode very well for performing at the higher end of that guidance range as we go forward here. I'm not giving guidance for anything other than what we're talking about in '22. But the pipeline is very strong. And you hear us talking about the California win. But the reality is we've had multiple government wins with our ability to distribute payments in a card-based fashion and having probably the best capability in the industry around that. Yes. I'll just say I thought you had asked about our new Milwaukee headquarters. Yes. No, I think I'd just say that we have an appetite. You see our appetite across the segments. We are highly selective, Bento, Finxact. And then we come back and invest heavily, Ondot, in those as we had done on Clover. So we feel good about our balanced approach. I think you can see that, obviously, we invest in the business organically or invest in the business inorganically. And then we feel good about buying back of stock and returning that to shareholders too. You should imagine that we're going to have that continued balance mentality. And obviously, we like to integrate companies and grow them. I'd say readiness is high. I think we made a comment that they are designed to be dual network capable. And our ability to execute, we think, is very high. Obviously, we always felt that this would create more competition, and we like that. Obviously, we weren't competing for those transactions before. And you should expect us to behave like we do in every other business line, which is try to grow at the best possible rate. So I think we're in the planning stage. Obviously, it is up to issuers. But we think that this was a very good outcome, and we continue to expect ourselves to participate as we would given our size and scale and the nature of the business we have. Thank you for your attention today. Please feel free to reach out to our IR team with any questions, and have a great day. Thanks a lot, guys and girls, ladies."

            "name": "Robert Hau",
            "content": "Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone.  If you're following along on our slides, I will cover additional detail on total company and segment performance, starting with our financial metrics and trends on Slide 4. Third quarter results showed continued strength and the benefit of our broad portfolio. Total company organic revenue growth was 11% in the quarter with continued momentum in Merchant Acceptance, a nice step-up in growth in our Payments and Network segment and stable performance in the Fintech segment, considering the impact of some timing of revenue quarter-to-quarter. Year-to-date, total company organic revenue grew 11%, led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 17%. Third quarter total company adjusted revenue grew 8% to $4.3 billion, and adjusted operating income grew 11% to $1.5 billion, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 35.2%, an increase of 100 basis points versus the prior year. As Frank mentioned, margins improved sequentially 170 basis points from the second quarter on 1% higher revenue and 2% lower expenses. For the first 9 months of the year, adjusted revenue grew 9% to $12.4 billion, and adjusted operating income increased 10% to $4.2 billion, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 33.6%, 40 basis points ahead of the prior year period. The adjusted operating margin for the quarter was impacted by several factors, including, first, investments related to new acquisitions, including BentoBox and Finxact; second, the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar, particularly in September; and third, the net impact of inflation on our revenue, offset by costs for both labor and material. As we've previously said, we expect significant adjusted operating margin expansion in the fourth quarter. We have 4 factors driving this improvement. First, the benefits of the final ramp-down of prior integration expenses and resulting productivity benefits. Second, in the latter part of the third quarter, we began taking some cost actions to tighten spending in light of the continued uncertain macroeconomic conditions across the globe. Third, as part of our ongoing strategic review, we divested our Korea business and 2 small low-margin nonstrategic units. Finally, we anticipate healthy operating leverage and easier inflation comparisons in the fourth quarter. These factors should deliver our full year guidance for at least 100 basis point improvement and sets us up well for 2023. Third quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 11% to $1.63  compared to $1.47 in the prior year. Unfavorable foreign exchange impacted adjusted EPS by $0.08 per share year-over-year or 5 points of growth headwind relative to the exchange rates a year ago. Year-to-date through September 30, adjusted earnings per share increased 14% to $4.59. Free cash flow came in at $849 million for the quarter and $2.1 billion for the first 9 months of the year. Free cash flow conversion was 81% of adjusted net income this quarter, well ahead of prior year and first half levels. Like the fourth quarter of 2021, we expect a significant ramp in free cash flow and free cash flow conversion in the last quarter of the year. Free cash flow conversion of 71% year-to-date reflects a combination of: first, continued organic investment in software and application development to drive higher growth across the business; second, greater working capital investment in both accounts receivable and inventory, driven by accelerated revenue growth; and third, higher capital expenditures associated with the newly acquired capabilities to drive innovation and integration. As we close out the year, the sustained strength in our business gives us confidence to raise our full year organic revenue growth outlook to 11%, the top end of our previous guidance range of 9% to 11%. With this higher organic revenue growth outlook and execution on cost actions that support continued adjusted operating margin expansion, we are raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance range to a new range of $6.48 to $6.55, representing growth of 16% to 17% over 2021, at the high end of our original 15% to 17% guide. This includes significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which leads to an additional $0.06 of unfavorable foreign exchange impact in the third and fourth quarters relative to our expectations just 90 days ago. While we anticipate greater than 100% conversion of free cash flow in the fourth quarter, we continue to anticipate strong revenue growth as indicated by another increase in our organic revenue outlook. We have real investment opportunities to sustainably grow our top line faster than market and faster than our history of mid-single-digit growth. Therefore, we now expect full year free cash flow conversion to be approximately 85%. Now looking to our segment results, starting on Slide 5. Organic revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was a healthy 14% in the quarter and 17% year-to-date. Adjusted revenue growth in the quarter was 9% and 14% for the first 9 months, well ahead of the medium-term segment guidance of 9% to 12%. Merchant volume and transactions grew 10% and 5%, respectively, excluding the loss of a processing client mid last year. Activity was consistent in North America with some deceleration in Europe. We see new opportunity with the launch of our Deutsche Bank joint venture in the quarter. Turning to our merchant operating systems, Clover and Carat. We continue to see gains across key metrics, including net new merchant adds, value-added services penetration and partner relationships. Clover revenue grew 19%, coming off our toughest comparison against last year when the post-COVID return to normal was in full swing. Payment volume growth was 21%. Software and services penetration reached 15% of total revenue, an increase of over 260 basis points from last year and up 30 basis points sequentially, with strength in assets like Clover Capital. Clover Connect for ISVs built on its momentum with very strong revenue growth in the quarter as we continue to execute on our vertical strategies, adding 37 ISV partners. We won key clients away from competition such as SalonUltimate software, a comprehensive solution for salons and spas. Another PayFac win in the quarter was Tempus, which expands our presence in the health care vertical. We focused on our integration of BentoBox and rounded out our restaurant offering with the acquisition of NexTable for reservations, providing an opportunity to expand ARPU beyond the average increase of 2 to 3x, which we see for merchants using BentoBox and Clover. Carat also had a strong quarter with revenue growing at 18%. We continue to drive accelerated growth in new money flows with third quarter digital transactions up 67% year-over-year and online EBT transactions up 27%. We delivered on our new innovations and signed agreements with Sunoco to launch Pay by Bank and with Subway's digital acquiring business in Puerto Rico via our connected commerce ecosystem, among others. We also continue to show we're a provider of choice for fintechs, this time with [ peer lenders there too ] for digital disbursements and card-not-present acquiring. Adjusted operating income in Acceptance segment increased 11% to $610 million in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was up 20 basis points to 32.4%. The improvement was led by operating leverage and cost management more than offsetting the impact of acquisitions and divestitures as well as FX. Year-to-date, adjusted operating income improved 14% to $1.7 billion, and adjusted operating margin grew 20 basis points to 30.8%. Turning to Slide 6. On the Payments and Network segment, organic revenue grew 11% in the quarter, above the high end of the 5% to 8% medium-term guidance range. This growth was enabled by a variety of drivers across our business lines. Our North American credit active accounts on file grew 19% versus third quarter of last year. This growth was driven by both new business onboarding and a favorable credit environment. Our international issuing business grew strong double digits, driven by macroeconomic improvement as well as the onboarding of new clients. And our debit business continues to post solid growth, driven by new client wins on our debit networks, STAR and Accel. We are pleased with several wins among fintechs in the quarter as well, including one with Papaya for eBill distribution. Papaya is an app provider that brings billers and consumers together for a better bill pay experience. Year-to-date organic revenue grew 8%, and we expect the momentum in this segment to continue through the rest of the year, resulting in full year organic revenue growth at or above the top end of our medium-term outlook range of 5% to 8%. Adjusted operating income for the segment was up 14% to $744 million, and adjusted operating margin was up 190 basis points to 45.9%, driven by strong operating leverage. Year-to-date, adjusted operating income was up 9% to $2 billion, and adjusted operating margin was up 70 basis points versus last year at 44.1%. Moving to Slide 7. In the Financial Technology segment, we posted 1% organic revenue growth for the quarter and 4% year-to-date, within our 4% to 6% medium-term guidance range. The nonrecurring portions of this business, including new product implementation work and professional services, was impacted by the timing of contracts in September. But we retain good line of sight to this revenue being booked in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, customer momentum continues, and we had 14 core wins in the quarter, including 9 competitive takeaways. Adjusted operating income was down 5% in the quarter to $261 million and up 3% to $817 million year-to-date. Adjusted operating margin in the segment decreased 190 basis points to 34.1% in the quarter, driven by investment in Finxact and timing of periodic revenue. Year-to-date, the segment's adjusted operating margin declined 50 basis points to 34.8%. The adjusted corporate operating loss was $109 million in the quarter, a slight improvement from the first half run rate and $356 million year-to-date. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 20.9% and was 19.8% year-to-date. We expect the full year 2022 adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 20%. Total debt outstanding was $21.4 billion on September 30. The debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio dropped another 0.1 turn to 2.9x, reaching our target leverage of being below 3x, which we set when we announced our merger. During the quarter, we stepped up our share repurchases, buying back $750 million worth of our stock. We had 24.5 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase at the end of the quarter. Additionally, we've repurchased a little more than $250 million so far in October. We are fully committed to our long-standing capital allocation strategy, which includes investing in our business organically, maintaining a strong balance sheet, repurchasing shares and pursuing high-value and innovative acquisitions. We've included Slide 8 in the presentation to reflect this greater investment while strengthening our balance sheet and returning cash to our shareholders. With that, let me turn the call back to Frank. Yes. Lisa, thank you. So I guess a couple of things. One, in terms of the adjustment in our outlook for the full year, I think I would point to a couple of things. One is we continue to see good opportunities to invest for future growth. Obviously, we're seeing an impact in the current year from an 11% growth rate that puts pressure on working capital. As you grow the top line, you have more receivables, but we're also carrying more inventory. One of the things that has persisted longer than we had anticipated just 90 days ago is the supply chain issues/problems in China around getting point-of-sale devices, et cetera. And we continue to ensure that we have availability of product and can support our client base with having a product, point-of-sale product. COVID shutdowns in China are actually going on right now, and so protecting ourselves there. We also have some new geographies and new clients that are bringing on Clover and other point-of-sale devices. So we continue to invest in that. You see our capital spending around new product development, software cap. We continue to see good opportunities, so we're driving for sustainable, very high single, perhaps even low double-digit growth investments around the acquisitions of Finxact, Ondot, BentoBox. We've made the decision to keep investing and therefore revised our free cash flow. In terms of long-term sustainability, I'm not prepared to give guidance for 2023. But we've certainly seen in the last 2 years, '21 and '22, a pretty significant step function change in our growth rate, 11% last year, which granted is against the COVID adjusted prior year. But 11% this year, bending that curve, so to speak, from companies that were mid-single digits and perhaps generously mid-single digits pre merger, now double digits. You're going to see something less than 100% free cash flow going forward, I think. Sure, David. So a couple of things from a margin standpoint. If you recall, actually going back to our first quarter earnings call, which we reiterated in the second earning -- second quarter earnings. And we've expected since the beginning of the year that our margin would accelerate into the second half of the year. That acceleration was largely driven by carryover integration spending that we used to back in 2021, just out as merger and integration spending. Our company policy says you do that through the end of last year. And any projects that are continuing no longer get adjusted out of our earnings, and so we had some cost flow into the P&L at the beginning of the year that we knew those projects were going to finish up in the first half, first 9 months of the year. And so that investment, that integration spending would taper off through the year and, in particular, be mostly out by the end of the third quarter. So you see improvement in investment or lower spending on those projects. Plus you get the benefit of the projects being done, i.e., those generate a return, generate productivity. And so you get a double bang in the second half of the year. And in particular, as those projects again have largely been completed at the end of the third quarter, we'll see that come down in Q4 and get the productivity. The second piece of growth in margin is basic productivity, i.e., nonmerger-related nonintegration, what we used to refer to as operational excellence rolling through the business. Some of that is very basic productivity Six Sigma leaning out your spending sort of a thing. Some of it is the fact that we've now reopened our offices, and our associate base is returning to the office, increasing our collaboration. Frank talked about the location work that we've done in creating large hubs like the Berkeley Heights facility in North Central New Jersey that is now open, driving some collaboration and productivity. And then the -- I guess, the final 2 things that will drive margin in the fourth quarter, one is scale. As you know, an incremental dollar of revenue in this company comes through at higher than company average growth given the fixed cost nature of the company. And so we feel good about seeing good operating leverage on revenue growth and scale. And then finally, some of the divestitures, we did those 3 small units that we sold. At the end of the third quarter, you'll see the benefit of fourth. Q3 over Q2, we expanded margins 170 basis points. Obviously, if you do the math, we've got a big expansion expected in the fourth quarter. But quite frankly, if you look over the last 5 or 6 quarters, right in line with what we've done in the past, 300, 400, even 500 basis point margin improvement in a number of quarters in the last 6, 8 quarters. So I feel good about our ability to generate at least 100 basis points for the full year. Sure, David. I guess the fastest thing to think about or the largest thing to think about is the 19% number that we showed in our prepared remarks and in the slides. That's a reported number. Obviously, FX had a pretty significant impact in the entire company, actually in all companies in the third quarter. If you were to currency adjust that number, you'll probably pick up 3 points, maybe even 4 points of growth. Plus, as you recall, in the first quarter of this year, we divested a small joint venture that we had. It was a minority equity interest actually technically, generated about $175 million of cash. So on an organic basis, that Clover growth is actually more in line with the 25% that we've talked about as part of our long-range expectation of growing Clover to at least $3.5 billion. Yes. David, I'd be a little careful. I have to run through all of your math. You've got some broad assumptions on the sequential growth or the growth year-over-year in fourth quarter. Ultimately, the simple or straight answer is, look, we see some good cost improvement third quarter to fourth quarter. As I talked about earlier, the ramp-down of these integration projects as well as the benefit of the projects driving productivity into the organization now that we've got integration largely behind us, maintaining the productivity model that you've seen from this company for a lot of years. And certainly, incremental revenue drops to the bottom line. The growth in Payments certainly helps. Obviously, that's our highest-margin business, and continuing to see good growth in SMB also helps. So we feel good about the quote, to use a 4-letter word mix, in the fourth quarter. We see good opportunity or a good line of sight towards cost reduction/productivity, divesting a couple of these small nonstrategic units that are low margin and getting that scale really helps into the fourth quarter. No. Obviously, we put up a 7% Q2 number. I would not anticipate us being north of 7% in fourth quarter. We do feel good about the growth of the Fintech segment. If you look over the last several years, there's variation quarter-to-quarter. Some of that is the periodic revenue or license and term fees. We have the additional impact in third quarter of this year for these nonrecurring one-timer type. I hate to use to as one-timer because they're regular. As contracts renew, we get short-term or immediate-term revenue, and some of that's already slipped into fourth quarter, i.e., we started to see some of that rebounds. We feel good about, number one, we're already in the 4% to 6% range, and we'll close the year out that way. Tien-Tsin, I guess, first, yes, obviously, we've been buying back shares. We are always in the market. Every once in a while there's some ebbs and flows, and we've been -- we were strong in the third quarter and certainly strong so far in fourth quarter. I feel good about our ability to continue to buy back shares. It's a balanced capital deployment approach that we've always had and continue to have around investing in organic growth. If you look at that new slide, we added a significant increase in CapEx, which is obviously putting pressure on free cash flow. But we did that while also paying down some debt or delevering down to our targeted leverage rate that gives us lots of flexibility to ultimately do both M&A and share purchase. I see it obviously, as a bit of a trade-off. If I spend $1 in M&A, I don't have that dollar available on -- for share repurchase. But we have good capacity to do both. We look at acquisitions through the lens of a share repurchase. We're certainly interested in continuing to add to our portfolio. As I've said in the past, I don't wake up in the morning saying, \"Geez, I really need to go get x capability given the breadth of our existing portfolio.\" There are lots of things that we can add, whether it's NexTable that we did recently or it's BentoBox or Finxact. We did all of that while also buying back a lot of shares. Yes. One, I'll have to go back and check the transcript. I don't think I said it was likely. I said to see a business growing at this level. I try not to give guidance or an outlook or adjust what we've said previously. Obviously, in today's world, the view of 2023, '24, '25, '26 is just a little bit cloudy, and we'll continue to evaluate. Some of it is what are our investment opportunities to either be at the top end of that range and/or perhaps even accelerate from that. When we gave -- when we did our earnings, looks to me our investment call, investor conference back in December of '20, we hadn't yet closed the Finxact transaction. We've talked about how that acquisition may give us an opportunity to bend the curve, so to speak, yet again on the Fintech segment, which today hitting at a 4% to 6% rate is above what we've been able to do traditionally. And as Finxact continues to grow, we'll see some opportunity there. Building out Clover and growing our merchant business at perhaps even the high end of that 9% to 12%, the March of '22 investor conference talked about perhaps better growth in that segment. So lots of opportunities for us, and we're going to make sure that we are making good investment decisions to grow the top and bottom line and generating good returns for our shareholders. Look, I think we've seen some very nice progress in the growth this year. We're getting some great feedback from our clients. The $120 million worth of wins that we talked about back in December of '20 now all implemented and growing, many of them actually outperforming that $120 million worth of ACV. We have a continued strong backlog. Building out that government vertical that we've talked about, certainly an opportunity. Again, we're not prepared to give an outlook or guidance for 2023, but we feel quite good about how that segment is performing right now."

        "content": "Operator: Welcome to the Fiserv 2022 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. \n At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Shub Mukherjee, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. \nShub Mukherjee: Thank you, and good morning. With me on the call today are Frank Bisignano, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. \n Our earnings release and supplemental materials for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Please refer to these materials for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this call, along with a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. Unless otherwise stated, performance references are year-over-year comparisons. \n Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results and strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. You should refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. \n And now over to Frank. \nFrank Bisignano: Thank you, Shub. And thank you all for listening in as we share our results for the quarter and highlight the progress against our growth agenda. As you know, we serve as the operating system for commerce and money movement across our client base of banks, credit unions, fintechs and businesses, ranging from SMBs to mid-market or large enterprises. \n We help our clients grow by extending our platform to capture new services and new money flows. Our relentless pursuit of innovation for our clients yet again won us several accolades in the quarter. Fiserv was named a leader among merchant payment providers for the Carat operating system by Forrester Wave. Fiserv was also awarded the prestigious Webby Award for our Developer studio, a platform, which provides rich and expansive API integrations. \n Now moving to our second quarter results. We delivered a strong 12% total company organic revenue growth, once again exceeding the 7% to 9% guidance range we provided for the year. The terrific performance on the top line resulted in 14% adjusted EPS growth to $1.56, bringing our year-to-date adjusted EPS growth to 17%, at the high end of the 15% to 17% guidance range provided for the full year. We attained $180 million of actioned revenue synergies in the quarter, reaching $700 million since the merger, exceeding the increased commitment of $600 million 2 years ahead of our original commitment. The impact of high inflation and our continued investment in the business resulted in adjusted operating margin of 33.5%, down 40 basis points from second quarter last year. \n We continue to see opportunities to innovate for our clients. through our recent acquisitions, such as Ondot, BentoBox and Finxact, as well as organic investments across our portfolio. Additionally, these investments and accelerated revenue growth resulted in higher capital expenditures and working capital, leading to free cash flow of $658 million for the quarter and $1.3 billion year-to-date. \n Looking into the remainder of the year, our year-to-date organic revenue growth outperformance of 11% puts us in a very good position to beat our prior organic revenue growth guidance for the full year. Given the strength in the first half of the year, we are raising our full year organic revenue growth outlook to a range of 9% to 11%, up from 7% to 9% previously. The low end of this revised growth outlook assumes a macro slowdown in the second half versus the first half of the year. \n With this higher organic revenue outlook and the year-to-date adjusted EPS performance of 17% growth, we are raising the lower end about full year adjusted EPS guidance range by $0.05 to a new range of $6.45 to $6.55, representing growth of 16% to 17% over 2021. Given the elevated inflation environment, unfavorable foreign exchange and our plans to continue to invest in innovation for our clients. We now expect our full year adjusted margin expansion to be at least 100 basis points. \n Now turning to the business strategy. Fiserv solutions are geared towards merchants and financial institutions, including fintechs. Starting with merchants, we are transforming from selling merchants individual point solutions to offering operating systems: Clover for small- to medium-sized merchants and Carat for large enterprises. This operating system approach expands the size of our total addressable market and makes us more valuable to our customers. \n We grow and create value in 3 ways: First, attracting more merchants to our operating systems; second, expanding the relationship we have with our merchants by encouraging adoption of more software and services modules; and third, benefiting from the growth of our existing customer base. \n Turning to our financial institution clients. We remain committed to continuously innovate for our clients and broaden our total addressable market. Since we closed the acquisition of Finxact, a leading developer of cloud-native banking solutions in early April, we have been focused on 3 key areas: Integrating our existing digital surrounds into Finxact; selling Finxact to our existing clients as an innovation platform or sidecar core; and winning new logo sales on the Finxact solution. The feedback from both existing and new clients has been very positive. \n Now let's dive deeper into our performance in the quarter by business segment. Let me start with merchant acceptance. We posted very strong organic revenue growth of 17% for the quarter. Merchant volume and transactions grew 10% and 7%, respectively. Our global active merchant accounts grew 5% in the second quarter, continuing the positive trend since the start of 2021. \n Results were strong across all regions. North America was led by the strength in SMBs, particularly within the restaurant vertical as well as strength in enterprise verticals, such as travel and petro. \n Our international regions also had very strong performance on a local currency basis, in part offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. Spending across the EMEA region accelerated during the quarter, driven by strength in hospitality, restaurant and retail verticals. \n Our merchant business in Latin America was very strong in the quarter as we continue to make significant progress in the Argentina market. And in Brazil, onboarding merchants throughout exclusive merchant-acquiring mandate from Caixa. We are also expanding our presence rapidly in Mexico and Colombia. \n Spending trends in APAC were strong, driven by a rebound in the economic activity across nearly all markets, as well as new wins and implementations. \n Moving to our merchant operating systems. Clover and Carat both continue to gain significant traction with clients. \n Clover global revenue grew 24% in the quarter, driven by volume growth of 27%, as well as growth in software and services penetration to 15%, up over 350 basis points. Clover's vertical-focused strategy continues to deliver in market with BentoBox now fully integrated into Clover for all e-commerce payments. When Bento and Clover are sold together, we see an over 3x increase in average revenue per user versus a Clover-only restaurant. In addition, UberEats was launched in the second quarter as another integrated delivery partner for our restaurant merchants. \n Carat, our omni-commerce operating system for enterprise clients, grew revenue 22%. We saw a broad-based growth across verticals, including petro and quick service restaurants. In the quarter, Carat made several strides in further strengthening its positioning within the petro vertical. Among the notable wins include a contract with Wawa, a large chain of convenience stores and gas stations. Additionally, we expanded our relationship with a long-standing client to introduce a customized dealer settlement and reporting platform supporting over 10,000 retail locations in North America. \n In keeping with Carat's mission to continuously innovate for our clients, Carat launched pay by plate, enabling our petro partners to facilitate transactions based on license plate recognition for customers that opt in, replacing the need for a physical card. \n Carat continues to capture new payment flows and has made significant progress across digital payouts and EBT online, with transactions growing 69% and 54%, respectively, in the quarter. Further bolstering its capabilities, Carat launched new payout options in the quarter to include digital checks, prepaid cards and crypto wallets. \n We also had some notable wins within our enterprise business in North America during the quarter. We expanded our partnership with Walmart to facilitate onetime digital payouts to consumers and won a contract with Sodexo, a leading global facilities management company, to digitize consumer and employee payouts. \n Turning to our international merchant business. We continue to show strong momentum with the following highlights in the second quarter. In EMEA, Fiserv signed a deal with Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, one of the largest banks in the region with over $115 billion in assets and a significant presence across the retail, corporate and SMB space with over 24,000 POS terminals deployed today. Fiserv will be providing it's acquiring as a service suite of solutions, including our automated onboarding solution and omnichannel acceptance platform, with SoftPOS-enabled deployment. The bank will also benefit from Fiserv's enhanced risk, real-time broad management solutions, our merchant portal and reporting capabilities. \n In APAC, we went live with Sportsbet, the market leader in online sports betting across Australia; and boarded 10,000 submerchants from MYOB, a leading provider of digital business accounting services to small businesses in Australia. \n Moving to the Payments and Network segment. Organic revenue grew 8% in the quarter. This growth was enabled by a variety of drivers across our business lines. Our North American credit active accounts on file grew 14% versus Q2 of last year. This growth was driven by both new business onboarding and a favorable credit environment. \n As a reminder, in the second quarter, we completed the onboarding of Bread Financial, formerly ADS, the largest of the 3 top 25 credit issuing wins we announced in 2020. Bread was the third of the 3 wins to onboard, completing the $120 million in annual revenue related to new wins we announced at our last investor conference. Looking forward, our current implementation and sales pipeline remains very robust. \n Our international issuing business grew strong double digits, driven by macroeconomic improvement as well as onboarding of new clients. Our debit business continues to post solid growth, driven by new client wins on our debit networks, STAR and Accel, even as debit transaction growth continues to normalize industry-wide following the stimulus-driven high debit volumes last year. \n Our market-leading digital solutions, including CardHub and SpendTrack, have become key differentiators in our new business pursuits and serve to drive more cards into our debit network, more opportunities for Fiserv to offer risk, fraud, digital banking and account processing solutions, demonstrating an attractive flywheel effect. \n We continue to see growth in digital payments driven by Zelle, which posted transaction growth of a strong 35% in the quarter. Our 1,000th Zelle client went live during the quarter, a feat we accomplished in under 4 years of commencing Zelle implementations. And we expect this momentum to continue with line of sight into doubling our Zelle client base over the next 2 years. \n Fiserv recently won a competitive bid to support the state of California's middle-class tax refund program. Fiserv will manage the program and distribute prepaid debit cards to qualified program recipients. This win reinforces our position as a leading provider of government programs, an area of expanding opportunity. \n We had a notable win in the student loan processing space which will considerably extend our position as a provider of choice to student loan servicers. \n We continue to win credit processing mandates globally. In the second quarter, we expanded our relationship with a U.K.-based financial services company, NewDay, to provide processing and other services as they relaunch the John Lewis Partnership card, one of the U.K.'s most popular retail rewards credit cards. \n Moving to the Financial Technology segment. We posted another strong quarter with organic revenue growth of 7%, driven by strength in our account processing and digital activity as well as the timing benefit of periodic revenue. We had 7 core wins in the quarter, including 4 competitive takeaways. \n Sales of digital surround solutions continue to grow at a healthy clip, driven by our 3-pronged approach. Our proprietary online and digital banking solutions with integrated surround solutions, such as CardHub, Zelle and SpendTrack, offer a leading modern banking experience for our clients and users. In keeping with our open sourced approach to serving our clients, we are also pre-integrating third-party digital solutions into our cores and making these solutions discoverable to clients their our app marketplace. \n Last but definitely not least, we are making our platform attractive to the developer community by exposing our microservice APIs through our Developer Studio with the goal of becoming the destination of choice for the embedded finance ecosystem, including card issuing and processing, merchant and core banking integrations. \n And Finxact further cements our lead in next-generation banking. Our Finxact product was selected by Colorado-based National Bank Holdings to utilize Finxact's modern core to pursue an SMB-focused digital-only greenfield initiative called 2UniFi as part of their initial modernization effort. \n As an example of cross-selling Finxact into Fiserv's existing core clients, Massachusetts-based Martha's Vineyard Bank will utilize Finxact's open APIs to deliver innovative new products and services across all channels, including highly personalized experiences for its customers. \n The combination of Finxact's technology and Fiserv's size and scale, ecosystem of digital surrounds and knowledge of banking, is winning over other competing offers in the market. Together, we are delivering value to our clients by accelerating their modernization journey. \n Now let me pass the discussion to Bob for more detail on our financial results. \nRobert Hau: Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. If you're following along on our slides, I will cover additional detail on total company and segment performance, starting with our financial metrics and trends on Slide 4. We had a strong second quarter thanks to our execution across the business and our broad portfolio of products and services. \n Total company organic revenue growth was 12% in the quarter with strong growth across all segments. Notably the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 17%. Year-to-date, total company organic revenue grew 11%, also led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 18%. \n Second quarter total company adjusted revenue grew 10% to $4.2 billion and adjusted operating income grew 8% to $1.4 billion, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 33.5%, a decrease of 40 basis points versus the prior year. For the first half of the year, adjusted revenue grew 10% to $8.1 billion and adjusted operating income increased 10% to $2.7 billion, resulting in adjusted operating margin of 32.7%, consistent with the first half of last year. \n The adjusted margin was impacted by a combination of factors, including: First, cost inflation for both labor and material, including point-of-sale terminals for our Merchant Acceptance segment and paper and plastic for our Payments segment; second, investments related to new acquisitions, including BentoBox and Finxact; and third, continued reinvestment into the business, including wrapping up of the Fiserv-First Data integration projects. As we previously indicated, these began ramping down late in the second quarter and into the third quarter. This will lead to improved margins as we complete the spending and as the benefits of those projects materialize in the second half of the year, particularly in Q4, leading to a strong exit rate for 2023. \n Second quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 14% to $1.56 compared to $1.37 in the prior year. Through June 30, adjusted earnings per share increased 17% to $2.96, at the high end of the 15% to 17% guidance range which we provided for the full year. \n Free cash flow came in at $658 million for the quarter and $1.3 billion for the first 6 months of the year. Free cash flow conversion was 65% to adjusted net income this quarter and year-to-date. The free cash flow conversion was driven by a combination of: First, increased capital expenditures, particularly in the areas of innovation and integration of newly acquired capabilities; second, increased working capital investment, driven by the very strong revenue growth, including growth in anticipation revenue in Latin America; third, increased inventory to minimize any potential impact to our clients given the risk of supply chain disruption; and fourth, continued investment in software and application development to drive sustainably higher growth across the business. \n As we look forward, we expect the free cash flow conversion to improve meaningfully to end the year at 90% to 95%, which is slightly below our previous outlook of 95% to 100%. We are focused on serving our clients with innovative solutions and sustainably stepping up our growth rate for the company to high single digits or even better this year from historic levels of mid-single digits. \n Now looking to our segment results, starting on Slide 5. Organic revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was a strong 17% in the quarter and 18% year-to-date. Adjusted revenue growth in the quarter was 14% and 16% for the first half. Merchant volume and transactions grew 7% and 5%, respectively. When excluding the loss of a processing client mid last year, which we will fully cycle through in the third quarter, merchant volume and transactions grew 10% and 7% in the quarter, respectively. \n Clover, our operating system for small and medium-sized businesses, continues to build on the strength of its product offering to attract and retain more merchants and expand relationships with them. Clover posted a strong 24% revenue growth for the quarter and 30% year-to-date. Quarterly Clover GPV was $58 billion or $233 billion on an annualized basis, up 27%. Our ISV volume in the quarter through Clover Connect grew 39% and 44% year-to-date. We signed 45 ISVs this quarter, bringing our total signed to 89 year-to-date. \n Carat, our omnicommerce operating system for enterprise clients, grew revenue 22% in the second quarter. \n Adjusted operating income in the Acceptance segment increased 13% to $593 million in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was down 20 basis points to 31.2%. This was driven by inflation and continued investments in the business for growth. Year-to-date adjusted operating income improved 17% to $1.1 billion and adjusted operating margin grew 20 basis points to 29.9%. We expect adjusted margin in the Merchant Acceptance segment to improve in the second half of the year as we see the benefit of lower inflation, continued strength in revenue and productivity. \n Turning to Slide 6. The Payments and Network segment posted organic revenue growth of 8% in the quarter, at the high end of the 5% to 8% medium-term guidance range. Notable growth drivers in this segment include active accounts on file in our North American credit processing business; the output solutions business; our debit networks, STAR and Accel; and Zelle, led by an increase in the number of clients and transaction growth. We expect the momentum in this segment to continue through the rest of the year, resulting in the full year organic revenue growth rate to come well within our medium-term outlook of 5% to 8%. \n Adjusted operating income for the segment was up 5% to $668 million, and adjusted operating margin was down 80 basis points to 43.8%, driven by a combination of inflation and investments in the quarter. Year-to-date, adjusted operating income was up 6% to $1.3 billion and adjusted operating margin was up 20 basis points versus last year at 43.2%. \n Moving to Slide 7. The Financial Technology segment organic revenue grew at 7% in the second quarter, resulting in 6% growth for the first half, at the high end of our 4% to 6% medium-term guidance range. As Frank mentioned, we added 7 new core account processing clients in the quarter, including 4 competitive takeaways. The combination of Finxact's modern core and Fiserv's leading digital surrounds is winning in the client's office. \n Adjusted operating income was up 3% in the quarter to $281 million and up 7% to $556 million year-to-date. Adjusted operating margin in the segment decreased 120 basis points to 35% in the quarter, driven by investments in Finxact, which we acquired early in the quarter; as well as increased organic investments in the business. For the first half, the segment's adjusted operating margin grew 30 basis points to 35.2%. \n The adjusted corporate operating loss was $125 million in the quarter and $247 million year-to-date. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 21% and was 19% for the first half. We continue to expect 2022 adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 21% for the full year. \n Total debt outstanding was $21.5 billion on June 30, and debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 3.0x, in line with our target leverage. In June, we increased our bank revolver to $6 billion from $3.5 billion previously and extended the maturity to June 2027. The new revolver provides additional capacity and flexibility. \n During the quarter, we continued our disciplined capital allocation strategy, repurchasing 5.1 million shares for $500 million. We had 32 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase at the end of the quarter. Additionally, we have had nearly $400 million of share repurchases so far in July. We are fully committed to our long-standing capital allocation strategy, which includes maintaining a strong balance sheet, repurchasing shares and pursuing high-value and innovative acquisitions. \n With that, let me turn the call back to Frank. \nFrank Bisignano: Thanks, Bob. I'm very proud of the results we've accomplished, with another quarter of double-digit growth in both adjusted revenue and adjusted EPS. In the second quarter, we published our 2021 CSR report, which included a number of key enhancements to add disclosures and respond to new reporting standards on environmental impact and corporate governance. We are proud to share our ESG journey as we continue to optimize the business while generating value to shareholders and communities. \n In June, we expand our back-to-business program in Nebraska. In addition to a $10,000 grant, businesses receive access to innovative business management technology from Clover, ongoing community support and small business resources. Our program in Nebraska is expected to award $1 million in grants for small diverse businesses. \n We are incorporating green building design principles as a priority for our offices and facilities. In the second quarter, Fiserv received LEED Gold green building certification for our Downtown Manhattan location. And we are working toward LEED status at the completion of our Berkeley Heights, New Jersey and Dublin, Ireland hubs. \n Finally, before I turn it over to the operator for Q&A, I'd like to thank Shub for her terrific work as our Head of Investor Relations for the last 18 months. Shub is taking on a new assignment as our Head of Strategy, and I look forward to continuing to work with her. \n I'm pleased to welcome Julie Chariell, who is with us today, as our new Head of Investor Relations. Welcome, Julie. \n I will close by thanking our more than 40,000 hard-working Fiserv associates around the world for working relentlessly to serve our clients and you, our shareholders. \n With that, operator, please open the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] For our first question, we'll go to the line of Dave Koning from Baird. \nDavid Koning: Great results across the board. \nRobert Hau: Thanks, Dave. \nDavid Koning: Yes, I thought one of the most interesting things, volume up 10% in merchant. Yield must be up 7%. I think that's the biggest in maybe ever that we've seen. Is that primarily -- you called out mix of SMBs, but there could be pricing components or just more services to the merchants. Is there any 1 or 2 of those that's more prevalent? And how sustainable is that? \nRobert Hau: Yes, Dave, thanks. As you heard us say over the last couple of quarters, we don't necessarily -- like to necessarily track yield. And the fact is we're not managing for yield, we're managing for revenue growth and overall margin. There's always quarter-to-quarter fluctuations. This quarter, last quarter are 2 examples where both yield is positive. As we continue to sell more value-added services, as we see more revenue per merchant, obviously, we see the benefit of yield. \n And yes, we see that it -- we believe our overall revenue growth is sustainable, and we'll continue to see good growth in the business. Some of that will be \"yield\" because of more value-added services. Some of that will be more transactions. \nDavid Koning: Great. And then just as a follow-up, just on margins. I know you called out investments and inflation impacts. But as we look in the back half, I think it has to be up about 200 bps in the back half, 200 bps year-over-year. Is Q3 or Q4 above or below that? Like maybe the cadence just of the 2 quarters remaining. \nRobert Hau: Yes. I think you should expect the margin to improve into Q3 and more so into Q4. The combination of -- we do anticipate inflation to subside a bit from the very high levels we saw in the first half of the year. \n Additionally, as we've talked about in the prepared remarks as well as last quarter, we have this carryover work that we have going on from an integration standpoint. Last year, we dialed those costs out. We added them back to adjusted earnings. Beginning in January 1 of this year, we stopped dialing that back out. And therefore, you see those costs hit in Q1. \n In Q2, they started to ease. In the latter part of Q2, they will continue their easing rate. So those costs go away. In addition, you get the benefit or the productivity out of that integration work. And so you'll see a bigger improvement in fourth quarter than you do in third, and second half stronger than the first half. \nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. \nLisa Dejong Ellis: I think I'll start with actually the follow-on question to Dave's question. Same question for you, Bob, on the free cash flow bridge throughout the remainder of the year. Conversion running 65% year-to-date, you're now expecting 90 to 95% for the full year. Can you just help us with what gives you confidence in the improvement in conversion in the second half? \nRobert Hau: Yes. Lisa, so I think a couple of things there. One, we definitely see the improvement in inventory in the back half of the year. We have been buying significant amounts of inventory, both in terms of point-of-sale devices, but also in paper and plastic for our Payments segment, our output solutions business payments. We see that easing into the second half of the year. That was done not only the case of actual point-of-sale devices, but some components to protect our clients from having hardware available. And we see that easing in the second half of the year so we'll see an improvement there.  \n Overall, I believe working capital will improve into the second half as well as some improvement in CapEx from a timing standpoint. And then, finally, as we see improved margins, a bit more productivity to get more cash flow. \nFrank Bisignano: Yes, I would just add. We've had tremendous opportunity for greater product build-out, organic opportunities and market opportunities. We didn't look at it -- I now look at Finxact, Bento and Ondot as 3 examples where I think we are very, very pleasantly surprised by the opportunity to have a much larger footprint on those. Finxact would be a perfect example. We're building into industrial strength at a much faster speed. \n And I think one of the other items I highlight is we have increased our speed of execution. You see in our revenue numbers, it does affect our CapEx number also. But if you look at the speed at which we implement, the size and scope of which we operate, it's been a very, very good, strong trajectory, increased speed and execution. \nRobert Hau: And Lisa, I think those 2 last elements that Frank pointed out is really at the heart of why we've taken our full year outlook down from the 95% to 100%, now 90% to 95%. Continue to see those opportunities, and we want to work those opportunities. \nLisa Dejong Ellis: Okay. Good. And then my second one is more of a strategic question related to Zelle because you had a number of Zelle-related call-outs this quarter: 35% transaction growth, 54% client growth. Can you just remind us how big Zelle is as a contributor to Payments and Networks? Like how we should think about the monetization model of Zelle and its contribution to both, I guess, size and growth of that segment? \nRobert Hau: Yes. I think overall, it's a relatively small piece. It's, call it, roughly 2% of the Payment segment. We've obviously seen good growth there and is part of the growth driver of the business. And as that continues to ramp, now we have a number of financial institutions, and therefore the number of users, as we see more and more ubiquity of that capability of that tool, i.e., more consumers making more payments, we'll continue to see good growth and so. \nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. \nTien-Tsin Huang: Congrats to Shub on the new role. I'm excited for her. On the -- I just want to upfront ask on the visibility side, if you don't mind. Just any interesting trends in July to call out? Are volumes and new sales ramping as expected? And same thing on the cost side. You have better visibility now on the cost to support this better revenue growth. \nFrank Bisignano: Yes, I'd say first of all, look at July volume. It's getting in line with Q2. The consumer remains resilient, fundamentally in line in volume and transaction standpoint also. So although the month's not over, this month seems to be continuing in the fashion. \n And visibility on the expense side is very, very clear. We have clear line of sight. Obviously, we made a bunch of decisions to grow this business, probably at a level that is where we like it. And we continue to see that opportunity, but we do see the opportunity to take down expenses on a run rate basis relative to margin, or productivity opportunity to put our productivities in front of us. Probably don't have to -- we know how to get it very [ well ]. \nRobert Hau: And Tien-Tsin, as I pointed out, and obviously, we expect inflation to subside a bit. We have the productivity of completing those integration projects. Those have been ramping down as of the kind of middle to end of second quarter. You see clear line of sight to see that continuing into Q3. And we see good opportunities to continue to invest, focused on sustainably growing this business much faster than it has in the past, taking our revenue guidance up this year from previously 7% to 9% to now 9% to 11%. And those opportunities that Frank talked about to increase our speed of execution and drive innovation not only is an impact to cash flow, but margin. And therefore, you saw us lower margin a bit even though we took up EPS given stronger growth. \nTien-Tsin Huang: Got it. Overall encouraging for sure. Just my quick follow-up, just with your target leverage now. You bought a lot of stock, it sounds like, in July. Curious on the appetite to continue with the buybacks versus doing deals. It seems like there are some payment fintech properties for sale out there. So just curious if there's any change in thinking. \nRobert Hau: No. I would say no change in thinking. The strength of our balance sheet and our cash flow gives us the opportunity to both buy back shares and look for value-accretive acquisitions, and we'll continue to do that. \n If you look, we did about $1.4 billion through yesterday or so, through July so far. But we also completed a number of acquisitions. And in fact, what, over the last call it, 15, 18 months, 7 different acquisitions for about $2 billion while we're also buying back shares. \n So we'll continue to do both. As you know, we're in the market regularly. We clearly believe there's real opportunity in the value of our stock, so we'll buy back. But we also look for value-accretive acquisitions. \nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. \nDarrin Peller: Could we revisit the revenue growth strength we saw? I mean, really across all 3 segments, but if we hone in on merchant for a minute. Again, I mean, this kind of 17% growth was definitely well above what anyone, anybody expected. And when we look at the sustainability to that, is there something -- anything anomalistic in growth in this segment in the quarter, or for that matter either of the other 2 segments, that wouldn't be sustainable in your mind? \n And maybe medium term, is this a sign of things to come in terms of elevated growth, first? \n And then just to revisit again the spread between revenue and volume. You talked about value-added services, I think, and again, SMB. But is that kind of a spread? Really, do you expect revenue to outperform volume consistently now? \nFrank Bisignano: I'd start on merchant. We purposely had investor conference to talk about how we saw it over the longer haul. And obviously, we do believe in driving up our penetration rate of software services. You saw that go up 350 basis points. at 15%. We talk about moving that over the longer haul to 25%. So ARPU is clearly a focus of ours. \n Our ability to also continue to expand in markets. You hear us talk about Colombia, Argentina, Mexico, along with our vertical of -- and we feel very, very strong about our capabilities we're going to build out over the long haul in the restaurant vertical and then move into the services verticals. So we feel our partnerships continue to grow. We believe we're the partner of choice in that business. \n And what you see in there, obviously, we had a couple of points of inflation in there. But what you really see is the strong growth of the investments we've made, the businesses we've bought and integration capability of the total franchise. I mean, I do believe that we get leverage from our bank partners and other partners in a way that only we can. \n And of course, Clover and Carat are 2 leading products in the industry that we continue to invest heavily. And so I think the sustainability, minus inflation, is right in front of us. And we've been driving this for a long time and I have talked about for a long time, and you're seeing the fruits of the labor. \nDarrin Peller: Okay. And Bob, just a quick follow-up on the yield again, if you don't mind. \nRobert Hau: Sure. Yes. So obviously, very positive yield this quarter, was last quarter. There's always variability quarter-to-quarter, and so we try not to get too myopically focused on that calculation within a given quarter. We think it kind of evens out over time. As we continue to provide value-added services, we'll continue to see improvements. We are very focused on adding merchants to our portfolio, i.e., signing up more merchants. We're very focused on selling more products to those merchants. That lifts our PO and drives revenue and margins for the company. \nDarrin Peller: Okay. Guys, just very quickly, the free cash and margin profile. I mean, the business is obviously growing notably faster. So should we expect maybe a more moderate margin story going forward, or free cash conversion, just to support this kind of growth? Or is it just the anomaly-stic items around inventory build and restructuring, and either way, you should get back to that 95% longer term? \nRobert Hau: Yes. I'm not ready to update our medium-term or long-term outlook. Obviously, the crystal ball these days is a little bit fuzzy in what '22, '23, '24, '25 is going to look like. Look, at the end of the day, we're focused on driving sustainable growth in our revenue. We're up significantly from where we've been historically. \n We took up this year -- we said the merchant business, the medium-term outlook was 9% to 12% in our last full investor conference at the end of 2020. In March of this year, we actually took that up and extended it. So we went out to 2025 and said we believe we'll be at 11%. \n So we're driving for sustainable growth. That obviously helps the top line. It's growing the bottom line. We took our EPS growth up this quarter for the full year and we'll continue to look for those opportunities to drive overall value by growing the top line, bottom line and generating great free cash flow. \nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. \nRamsey El-Assal: I wanted to ask about the competitive environment. And along the lines of it's sort of hard to argue, over the past few years, we haven't seen a lot of profitless, irrational competition. Are you seeing or do you expect to see any improvement in the competitive environment? I guess primarily driven by fintechs who maybe have a harder time raising capital to compete with you with. \nFrank Bisignano: I mean, the way I think about it is we run a large enterprise. We have competition in every country. We have competition in every business. I think our solutions are world-class and leading. And I think ultimately, this is about how we provide our clients an opportunity to grow their businesses, whether it's a small business, a community bank or large enterprise. \n So I don't really look at it as anything other than our job is to be the best and provide the best. And from a competition standpoint, there's a lot of great competitors out there, but we feel when you look at our numbers and you look at what's going on, that we're gaining market share. \nRobert Hau: And Ramsey, maybe the thing I'd add to punctuate is, at the end of the day, we believe profitable, scaled businesses will perform over time. And competition comes and goes. We'll continue to execute, we'll continue to perform for our clients, and we'll continue to win. \nRamsey El-Assal: Got it. Okay. Follow-up for me is, I was wondering if you could give us an update on how mix is trending in your acceptance segment. And I mean that from both an online, off-line as well as credit versus debit? \n And I guess the broader question is, do you think the mix in your business has sort of stabilized at this point? Or is there still some sort of post-pandemic readjustments that need to occur in order to get back to that stabilized place? \nFrank Bisignano: I think from a debit, credit, it's stabilized. I think it's been stabilized. Maybe there's a percentage point, 2, delta from when we started pre-pandemic to now in that credit, debit mix. But I think we're at a normalized rate there. And obviously, we keep driving e-comm, we keep driving car, and that trends up. But we do have a very large footprint globally, so those move in small increments relative to the size of our merchant business. \nRamsey El-Assal: Great. And online, offline, same story? \nFrank Bisignano: Yes. \nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. \nJason Kupferberg: Just wanted to start on the revenue side. Obviously, nice to see the upside there and the raise in the outlook. Can you give us just a little more detail on how to think about the segment level outlook for the year? I think I heard you say, for payments that you'd be comfortably within the 5% to 8%. Just a little bit more color across the board there would be great. \nRobert Hau: Yes, Jason, thank you. If you look at the 3 segments, obviously, we've lifted the full company from 7% to 9% previous outlook to 9% to 11%. So we're above the year -- we're above the midpoint of the -- excuse me, above the medium-term outlook that we've given in the past. In the payment segment, as you pointed out, we said during the prepared remarks that we think it's well within the range of a 5% to 8%. \n Merchant, we had previously guided or provided an outlook of 9% to 12%, which is in line with our medium-term outlook. At this point, obviously, given we're 18% year-to-date, we're off to a good start in the third quarter with volumes in July continue to be in line. So we expect that to be above the guidance range or above that 9% to 12% outlook. \n And fintech at 4% to 6%, we're 6% year-to-date. I would expect that to be in the range for the full year basis. There are obviously some ebbs and flows with periodic revenue. But overall, we feel good about the growth rate of all 3 of our segments to be at or better than our previous outlook. \nJason Kupferberg: Okay. And just a follow-up on costs. Can you just comment on your ability to pass some of these inflationary items on the labor material side on to your customers, perhaps with some sort of lag? It seems like that's probably the biggest driver of the 50 basis point reduction in the margin outlook for the year. \nRobert Hau: Yes. I think -- so it varies by segments and varies by business within that segment. If you think about the overall impact of inflation, Obviously, we've got some revenue growth or revenue growth driven by that inflation, but bigger impact from an expense standpoint. We do see that flowing down for the balance of the year. So both a little bit less benefit on the top line but a little less hit on the expense side. So we'll see some margin improvement into the second half of the year. That is the large driver of that, combined with those investments that we're seeing, are driving the reduced growth in our margin. Still up 100 basis points over the prior -- at least 100 basis points over the prior year, but inflation and those investments are certainly driving some of that. \nOperator: Our next question comes from James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. \nJames Faucette: Thanks for all the color and detail. You mentioned the cloudy crystal ball right now. Can you just Give us a little bit of insight of how you're thinking about kind hof macro assumptions and what you're seeing maybe right now that's influencing those in terms of how you're formulating outlook for the rest of this year? \nFrank Bisignano: What -- if you go back to how we've guided. Really at the low end, you'd have to think -- you heard the comment I had made that, that assumes some macro slowdown, and that would be 400 basis points deceleration in the second half. Now I just gave in July quarter to -- month-to-date which isn't exactly showing that yet. But that look is a look of really caution relative to going on both in inflation, what's happening in the workforce dynamics, where we see interest rates. Obviously, that's the low end. \n If you go to the high end of that, it's continuing the way we're continuing right now. We're not looking for anything go much better, We think and we do believe that we have a great opportunity with the M&A coming out, getting the benefit to that, and improved productivity, having put in the merger behind us, where in fact you go back in. So those are really the assumptions inside here from a macro standpoint. \n Bob, anything you'd like to add? \nRobert Hau: James, obviously, if you read the Wall Street Journal or pick up any news report with interest rates and inflation and, obviously, a headwind. Unemployment is quite low, that's remarkably resilient. The consumer balance sheet is quite strong. So overall, we feel pretty good about the visibility near term. It's the '23, '25, we're just kicking off our 2023 budgeting cycle. \n At the end of the day, I think one of the keys to think about is the demonstrated resilience of this company in every cycle. So if we were to hit a recession, which I think some people believe we're technically in right now, how deep does that recession go? How long does it last? What's the overall input? Is it a job-full recession? All of that creates some of that murkiness. \n But at the end of the day, we have proven to be incredibly resilient throughout those cycles. We've got levers we can pull right now. We are making a decision given the strength of the top line, the ability to invest, and make sure that we are providing continued innovation for our clients. A little bit lower in margin, but actually raising EPS, we think, is the right near term, midterm and long-term decision. But if things were to suddenly go very soft, we've got levers to pull, we'll drive productivity and we'll continue to deliver. \nJames Faucette: Appreciate that. And quickly for you, Bob, just with that rising interest rates are recapturing the impact -- potential impact on your interest cost appropriately? Or is anything that you would call out that we should keep in mind there? \nRobert Hau: Yes. I think 2 things there. One, we're about 85% fixed debt, 15% variable. The -- look, by far, the biggest chunk of that is commercial paper, and there's a balance of commercial paper both in U.S. dollar and euro. Obviously, that's going up, but that is quite a bit lower than fixed rate debt. So we're in good shape there. \n And of course, as a company, we have a bit of a natural hedge. We have interest with variable rate debt, but we also have float revenue. So we have cash on the balance sheet that actually generates interest that roughly offsets that variable rate. So overall, rising interest rates, net-net, are actually good for us within reason, given that we're naturally hedged. And higher interest rates are good for our financial institution clients and therefore provide opportunity for us. \nOperator: And our final question comes from Vasu Govil from KBW. \nVasundhara Govil: I think most of my questions were answered. I just wanted to get more color, and Bob, you alluded to it a little bit in the last answer. But just as we think, market's is obviously worried about macro concerns, so maybe you could help remind us how each of your segments would behave in a recession? Where you expect to feel most pressure, where you would see more resiliency. And then also on the margin front, what kind of cost levers you have going into a potential recession. \nRobert Hau: Yes. I think if you look at the 3 segments kind of in order of what might see impact in a meaningful downturn: Merchant first, followed by payments, followed by fintech. Overall though, we think we proved quite resilient. Obviously, even in 2020, which was a very difficult year by all accounts, we managed to well flat revenue, grow earnings per share double digits, up 12%. And so to the earlier comment I made, we have levers to pull, we have investments, we can mitigate and manage the overall bottom line. \n This is the 37th year of double-digit earnings, assuming we deliver on our guidance for the year, which obviously we fully expect to do. That's through lots of different cycles, both good and bad. And so we believe broadly that we'll do quite well. If we see a sudden shock, go back to Q2 of 2020, obviously, at the height of pandemic, everybody took a hit, and we sustained quite well overall. So we feel good about our opportunities to weather storms. \nVasundhara Govil: Excellent. And just one quick modeling one on FX. Obviously, FX headwinds are trending a little bit worse. Can you update us on what the expectation on that is for the year? \nRobert Hau: Yes. We've previously had been expecting about 100 basis points headwind on revenue from FX. That's now up to 200 basis points, clearly driven by euro and Lat Am, Latin America, largely Argentine peso conversion. But in general, certainly a headwind that everybody is facing. \nFrank Bisignano: I'd like to thank everyone for their time, and we look forward to talking to you. Appreciate it. Have a great day. \nOperator: Thank you all for participating in the Fiserv 2022 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. That concludes today's call. Please disconnect at this time, and have a great rest of your day.",

            "name": "Frank Bisignano",
            "content": "Thank you, Shub. And thank you all for listening in as we share our results for the quarter and highlight the progress against our growth agenda. As you know, we serve as the operating system for commerce and money movement across our client base of banks, credit unions, fintechs and businesses, ranging from SMBs to mid-market or large enterprises. \n We help our clients grow by extending our platform to capture new services and new money flows. Our relentless pursuit of innovation for our clients yet again won us several accolades in the quarter. Fiserv was named a leader among merchant payment providers for the Carat operating system by Forrester Wave. Fiserv was also awarded the prestigious Webby Award for our Developer studio, a platform, which provides rich and expansive API integrations. \n Now moving to our second quarter results. We delivered a strong 12% total company organic revenue growth, once again exceeding the 7% to 9% guidance range we provided for the year. The terrific performance on the top line resulted in 14% adjusted EPS growth to $1.56, bringing our year-to-date adjusted EPS growth to 17%, at the high end of the 15% to 17% guidance range provided for the full year. We attained $180 million of actioned revenue synergies in the quarter, reaching $700 million since the merger, exceeding the increased commitment of $600 million 2 years ahead of our original commitment. The impact of high inflation and our continued investment in the business resulted in adjusted operating margin of 33.5%, down 40 basis points from second quarter last year. \n We continue to see opportunities to innovate for our clients. through our recent acquisitions, such as Ondot, BentoBox and Finxact, as well as organic investments across our portfolio. Additionally, these investments and accelerated revenue growth resulted in higher capital expenditures and working capital, leading to free cash flow of $658 million for the quarter and $1.3 billion year-to-date. \n Looking into the remainder of the year, our year-to-date organic revenue growth outperformance of 11% puts us in a very good position to beat our prior organic revenue growth guidance for the full year. Given the strength in the first half of the year, we are raising our full year organic revenue growth outlook to a range of 9% to 11%, up from 7% to 9% previously. The low end of this revised growth outlook assumes a macro slowdown in the second half versus the first half of the year. \n With this higher organic revenue outlook and the year-to-date adjusted EPS performance of 17% growth, we are raising the lower end about full year adjusted EPS guidance range by $0.05 to a new range of $6.45 to $6.55, representing growth of 16% to 17% over 2021. Given the elevated inflation environment, unfavorable foreign exchange and our plans to continue to invest in innovation for our clients. We now expect our full year adjusted margin expansion to be at least 100 basis points. \n Now turning to the business strategy. Fiserv solutions are geared towards merchants and financial institutions, including fintechs. Starting with merchants, we are transforming from selling merchants individual point solutions to offering operating systems: Clover for small- to medium-sized merchants and Carat for large enterprises. This operating system approach expands the size of our total addressable market and makes us more valuable to our customers. \n We grow and create value in 3 ways: First, attracting more merchants to our operating systems; second, expanding the relationship we have with our merchants by encouraging adoption of more software and services modules; and third, benefiting from the growth of our existing customer base. \n Turning to our financial institution clients. We remain committed to continuously innovate for our clients and broaden our total addressable market. Since we closed the acquisition of Finxact, a leading developer of cloud-native banking solutions in early April, we have been focused on 3 key areas: Integrating our existing digital surrounds into Finxact; selling Finxact to our existing clients as an innovation platform or sidecar core; and winning new logo sales on the Finxact solution. The feedback from both existing and new clients has been very positive. \n Now let's dive deeper into our performance in the quarter by business segment. Let me start with merchant acceptance. We posted very strong organic revenue growth of 17% for the quarter. Merchant volume and transactions grew 10% and 7%, respectively. Our global active merchant accounts grew 5% in the second quarter, continuing the positive trend since the start of 2021. \n Results were strong across all regions. North America was led by the strength in SMBs, particularly within the restaurant vertical as well as strength in enterprise verticals, such as travel and petro. \n Our international regions also had very strong performance on a local currency basis, in part offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. Spending across the EMEA region accelerated during the quarter, driven by strength in hospitality, restaurant and retail verticals. \n Our merchant business in Latin America was very strong in the quarter as we continue to make significant progress in the Argentina market. And in Brazil, onboarding merchants throughout exclusive merchant-acquiring mandate from Caixa. We are also expanding our presence rapidly in Mexico and Colombia. \n Spending trends in APAC were strong, driven by a rebound in the economic activity across nearly all markets, as well as new wins and implementations. \n Moving to our merchant operating systems. Clover and Carat both continue to gain significant traction with clients. \n Clover global revenue grew 24% in the quarter, driven by volume growth of 27%, as well as growth in software and services penetration to 15%, up over 350 basis points. Clover's vertical-focused strategy continues to deliver in market with BentoBox now fully integrated into Clover for all e-commerce payments. When Bento and Clover are sold together, we see an over 3x increase in average revenue per user versus a Clover-only restaurant. In addition, UberEats was launched in the second quarter as another integrated delivery partner for our restaurant merchants. \n Carat, our omni-commerce operating system for enterprise clients, grew revenue 22%. We saw a broad-based growth across verticals, including petro and quick service restaurants. In the quarter, Carat made several strides in further strengthening its positioning within the petro vertical. Among the notable wins include a contract with Wawa, a large chain of convenience stores and gas stations. Additionally, we expanded our relationship with a long-standing client to introduce a customized dealer settlement and reporting platform supporting over 10,000 retail locations in North America. \n In keeping with Carat's mission to continuously innovate for our clients, Carat launched pay by plate, enabling our petro partners to facilitate transactions based on license plate recognition for customers that opt in, replacing the need for a physical card. \n Carat continues to capture new payment flows and has made significant progress across digital payouts and EBT online, with transactions growing 69% and 54%, respectively, in the quarter. Further bolstering its capabilities, Carat launched new payout options in the quarter to include digital checks, prepaid cards and crypto wallets. \n We also had some notable wins within our enterprise business in North America during the quarter. We expanded our partnership with Walmart to facilitate onetime digital payouts to consumers and won a contract with Sodexo, a leading global facilities management company, to digitize consumer and employee payouts. \n Turning to our international merchant business. We continue to show strong momentum with the following highlights in the second quarter. In EMEA, Fiserv signed a deal with Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, one of the largest banks in the region with over $115 billion in assets and a significant presence across the retail, corporate and SMB space with over 24,000 POS terminals deployed today. Fiserv will be providing it's acquiring as a service suite of solutions, including our automated onboarding solution and omnichannel acceptance platform, with SoftPOS-enabled deployment. The bank will also benefit from Fiserv's enhanced risk, real-time broad management solutions, our merchant portal and reporting capabilities. \n In APAC, we went live with Sportsbet, the market leader in online sports betting across Australia; and boarded 10,000 submerchants from MYOB, a leading provider of digital business accounting services to small businesses in Australia. \n Moving to the Payments and Network segment. Organic revenue grew 8% in the quarter. This growth was enabled by a variety of drivers across our business lines. Our North American credit active accounts on file grew 14% versus Q2 of last year. This growth was driven by both new business onboarding and a favorable credit environment. \n As a reminder, in the second quarter, we completed the onboarding of Bread Financial, formerly ADS, the largest of the 3 top 25 credit issuing wins we announced in 2020. Bread was the third of the 3 wins to onboard, completing the $120 million in annual revenue related to new wins we announced at our last investor conference. Looking forward, our current implementation and sales pipeline remains very robust. \n Our international issuing business grew strong double digits, driven by macroeconomic improvement as well as onboarding of new clients. Our debit business continues to post solid growth, driven by new client wins on our debit networks, STAR and Accel, even as debit transaction growth continues to normalize industry-wide following the stimulus-driven high debit volumes last year. \n Our market-leading digital solutions, including CardHub and SpendTrack, have become key differentiators in our new business pursuits and serve to drive more cards into our debit network, more opportunities for Fiserv to offer risk, fraud, digital banking and account processing solutions, demonstrating an attractive flywheel effect. \n We continue to see growth in digital payments driven by Zelle, which posted transaction growth of a strong 35% in the quarter. Our 1,000th Zelle client went live during the quarter, a feat we accomplished in under 4 years of commencing Zelle implementations. And we expect this momentum to continue with line of sight into doubling our Zelle client base over the next 2 years. \n Fiserv recently won a competitive bid to support the state of California's middle-class tax refund program. Fiserv will manage the program and distribute prepaid debit cards to qualified program recipients. This win reinforces our position as a leading provider of government programs, an area of expanding opportunity. \n We had a notable win in the student loan processing space which will considerably extend our position as a provider of choice to student loan servicers. \n We continue to win credit processing mandates globally. In the second quarter, we expanded our relationship with a U.K.-based financial services company, NewDay, to provide processing and other services as they relaunch the John Lewis Partnership card, one of the U.K.'s most popular retail rewards credit cards. \n Moving to the Financial Technology segment. We posted another strong quarter with organic revenue growth of 7%, driven by strength in our account processing and digital activity as well as the timing benefit of periodic revenue. We had 7 core wins in the quarter, including 4 competitive takeaways. \n Sales of digital surround solutions continue to grow at a healthy clip, driven by our 3-pronged approach. Our proprietary online and digital banking solutions with integrated surround solutions, such as CardHub, Zelle and SpendTrack, offer a leading modern banking experience for our clients and users. In keeping with our open sourced approach to serving our clients, we are also pre-integrating third-party digital solutions into our cores and making these solutions discoverable to clients their our app marketplace. \n Last but definitely not least, we are making our platform attractive to the developer community by exposing our microservice APIs through our Developer Studio with the goal of becoming the destination of choice for the embedded finance ecosystem, including card issuing and processing, merchant and core banking integrations. \n And Finxact further cements our lead in next-generation banking. Our Finxact product was selected by Colorado-based National Bank Holdings to utilize Finxact's modern core to pursue an SMB-focused digital-only greenfield initiative called 2UniFi as part of their initial modernization effort. \n As an example of cross-selling Finxact into Fiserv's existing core clients, Massachusetts-based Martha's Vineyard Bank will utilize Finxact's open APIs to deliver innovative new products and services across all channels, including highly personalized experiences for its customers. \n The combination of Finxact's technology and Fiserv's size and scale, ecosystem of digital surrounds and knowledge of banking, is winning over other competing offers in the market. Together, we are delivering value to our clients by accelerating their modernization journey. \n Now let me pass the discussion to Bob for more detail on our financial results. Thanks, Bob. I'm very proud of the results we've accomplished, with another quarter of double-digit growth in both adjusted revenue and adjusted EPS. In the second quarter, we published our 2021 CSR report, which included a number of key enhancements to add disclosures and respond to new reporting standards on environmental impact and corporate governance. We are proud to share our ESG journey as we continue to optimize the business while generating value to shareholders and communities. \n In June, we expand our back-to-business program in Nebraska. In addition to a $10,000 grant, businesses receive access to innovative business management technology from Clover, ongoing community support and small business resources. Our program in Nebraska is expected to award $1 million in grants for small diverse businesses. \n We are incorporating green building design principles as a priority for our offices and facilities. In the second quarter, Fiserv received LEED Gold green building certification for our Downtown Manhattan location. And we are working toward LEED status at the completion of our Berkeley Heights, New Jersey and Dublin, Ireland hubs. \n Finally, before I turn it over to the operator for Q&A, I'd like to thank Shub for her terrific work as our Head of Investor Relations for the last 18 months. Shub is taking on a new assignment as our Head of Strategy, and I look forward to continuing to work with her. \n I'm pleased to welcome Julie Chariell, who is with us today, as our new Head of Investor Relations. Welcome, Julie. \n I will close by thanking our more than 40,000 hard-working Fiserv associates around the world for working relentlessly to serve our clients and you, our shareholders. \n With that, operator, please open the line for questions. Yes, I would just add. We've had tremendous opportunity for greater product build-out, organic opportunities and market opportunities. We didn't look at it -- I now look at Finxact, Bento and Ondot as 3 examples where I think we are very, very pleasantly surprised by the opportunity to have a much larger footprint on those. Finxact would be a perfect example. We're building into industrial strength at a much faster speed. \n And I think one of the other items I highlight is we have increased our speed of execution. You see in our revenue numbers, it does affect our CapEx number also. But if you look at the speed at which we implement, the size and scope of which we operate, it's been a very, very good, strong trajectory, increased speed and execution. Yes, I'd say first of all, look at July volume. It's getting in line with Q2. The consumer remains resilient, fundamentally in line in volume and transaction standpoint also. So although the month's not over, this month seems to be continuing in the fashion. \n And visibility on the expense side is very, very clear. We have clear line of sight. Obviously, we made a bunch of decisions to grow this business, probably at a level that is where we like it. And we continue to see that opportunity, but we do see the opportunity to take down expenses on a run rate basis relative to margin, or productivity opportunity to put our productivities in front of us. Probably don't have to -- we know how to get it very [ well ]. I'd start on merchant. We purposely had investor conference to talk about how we saw it over the longer haul. And obviously, we do believe in driving up our penetration rate of software services. You saw that go up 350 basis points. at 15%. We talk about moving that over the longer haul to 25%. So ARPU is clearly a focus of ours. \n Our ability to also continue to expand in markets. You hear us talk about Colombia, Argentina, Mexico, along with our vertical of -- and we feel very, very strong about our capabilities we're going to build out over the long haul in the restaurant vertical and then move into the services verticals. So we feel our partnerships continue to grow. We believe we're the partner of choice in that business. \n And what you see in there, obviously, we had a couple of points of inflation in there. But what you really see is the strong growth of the investments we've made, the businesses we've bought and integration capability of the total franchise. I mean, I do believe that we get leverage from our bank partners and other partners in a way that only we can. \n And of course, Clover and Carat are 2 leading products in the industry that we continue to invest heavily. And so I think the sustainability, minus inflation, is right in front of us. And we've been driving this for a long time and I have talked about for a long time, and you're seeing the fruits of the labor. I mean, the way I think about it is we run a large enterprise. We have competition in every country. We have competition in every business. I think our solutions are world-class and leading. And I think ultimately, this is about how we provide our clients an opportunity to grow their businesses, whether it's a small business, a community bank or large enterprise. \n So I don't really look at it as anything other than our job is to be the best and provide the best. And from a competition standpoint, there's a lot of great competitors out there, but we feel when you look at our numbers and you look at what's going on, that we're gaining market share. I think from a debit, credit, it's stabilized. I think it's been stabilized. Maybe there's a percentage point, 2, delta from when we started pre-pandemic to now in that credit, debit mix. But I think we're at a normalized rate there. And obviously, we keep driving e-comm, we keep driving car, and that trends up. But we do have a very large footprint globally, so those move in small increments relative to the size of our merchant business. Yes. What -- if you go back to how we've guided. Really at the low end, you'd have to think -- you heard the comment I had made that, that assumes some macro slowdown, and that would be 400 basis points deceleration in the second half. Now I just gave in July quarter to -- month-to-date which isn't exactly showing that yet. But that look is a look of really caution relative to going on both in inflation, what's happening in the workforce dynamics, where we see interest rates. Obviously, that's the low end. \n If you go to the high end of that, it's continuing the way we're continuing right now. We're not looking for anything go much better, We think and we do believe that we have a great opportunity with the M&A coming out, getting the benefit to that, and improved productivity, having put in the merger behind us, where in fact you go back in. So those are really the assumptions inside here from a macro standpoint. \n Bob, anything you'd like to add? I'd like to thank everyone for their time, and we look forward to talking to you. Appreciate it. Have a great day."

            "name": "Robert Hau",
            "content": "Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. If you're following along on our slides, I will cover additional detail on total company and segment performance, starting with our financial metrics and trends on Slide 4. We had a strong second quarter thanks to our execution across the business and our broad portfolio of products and services. \n Total company organic revenue growth was 12% in the quarter with strong growth across all segments. Notably the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 17%. Year-to-date, total company organic revenue grew 11%, also led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 18%. \n Second quarter total company adjusted revenue grew 10% to $4.2 billion and adjusted operating income grew 8% to $1.4 billion, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 33.5%, a decrease of 40 basis points versus the prior year. For the first half of the year, adjusted revenue grew 10% to $8.1 billion and adjusted operating income increased 10% to $2.7 billion, resulting in adjusted operating margin of 32.7%, consistent with the first half of last year. \n The adjusted margin was impacted by a combination of factors, including: First, cost inflation for both labor and material, including point-of-sale terminals for our Merchant Acceptance segment and paper and plastic for our Payments segment; second, investments related to new acquisitions, including BentoBox and Finxact; and third, continued reinvestment into the business, including wrapping up of the Fiserv-First Data integration projects. As we previously indicated, these began ramping down late in the second quarter and into the third quarter. This will lead to improved margins as we complete the spending and as the benefits of those projects materialize in the second half of the year, particularly in Q4, leading to a strong exit rate for 2023. \n Second quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 14% to $1.56 compared to $1.37 in the prior year. Through June 30, adjusted earnings per share increased 17% to $2.96, at the high end of the 15% to 17% guidance range which we provided for the full year. \n Free cash flow came in at $658 million for the quarter and $1.3 billion for the first 6 months of the year. Free cash flow conversion was 65% to adjusted net income this quarter and year-to-date. The free cash flow conversion was driven by a combination of: First, increased capital expenditures, particularly in the areas of innovation and integration of newly acquired capabilities; second, increased working capital investment, driven by the very strong revenue growth, including growth in anticipation revenue in Latin America; third, increased inventory to minimize any potential impact to our clients given the risk of supply chain disruption; and fourth, continued investment in software and application development to drive sustainably higher growth across the business. \n As we look forward, we expect the free cash flow conversion to improve meaningfully to end the year at 90% to 95%, which is slightly below our previous outlook of 95% to 100%. We are focused on serving our clients with innovative solutions and sustainably stepping up our growth rate for the company to high single digits or even better this year from historic levels of mid-single digits. \n Now looking to our segment results, starting on Slide 5. Organic revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was a strong 17% in the quarter and 18% year-to-date. Adjusted revenue growth in the quarter was 14% and 16% for the first half. Merchant volume and transactions grew 7% and 5%, respectively. When excluding the loss of a processing client mid last year, which we will fully cycle through in the third quarter, merchant volume and transactions grew 10% and 7% in the quarter, respectively. \n Clover, our operating system for small and medium-sized businesses, continues to build on the strength of its product offering to attract and retain more merchants and expand relationships with them. Clover posted a strong 24% revenue growth for the quarter and 30% year-to-date. Quarterly Clover GPV was $58 billion or $233 billion on an annualized basis, up 27%. Our ISV volume in the quarter through Clover Connect grew 39% and 44% year-to-date. We signed 45 ISVs this quarter, bringing our total signed to 89 year-to-date. \n Carat, our omnicommerce operating system for enterprise clients, grew revenue 22% in the second quarter. \n Adjusted operating income in the Acceptance segment increased 13% to $593 million in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was down 20 basis points to 31.2%. This was driven by inflation and continued investments in the business for growth. Year-to-date adjusted operating income improved 17% to $1.1 billion and adjusted operating margin grew 20 basis points to 29.9%. We expect adjusted margin in the Merchant Acceptance segment to improve in the second half of the year as we see the benefit of lower inflation, continued strength in revenue and productivity. \n Turning to Slide 6. The Payments and Network segment posted organic revenue growth of 8% in the quarter, at the high end of the 5% to 8% medium-term guidance range. Notable growth drivers in this segment include active accounts on file in our North American credit processing business; the output solutions business; our debit networks, STAR and Accel; and Zelle, led by an increase in the number of clients and transaction growth. We expect the momentum in this segment to continue through the rest of the year, resulting in the full year organic revenue growth rate to come well within our medium-term outlook of 5% to 8%. \n Adjusted operating income for the segment was up 5% to $668 million, and adjusted operating margin was down 80 basis points to 43.8%, driven by a combination of inflation and investments in the quarter. Year-to-date, adjusted operating income was up 6% to $1.3 billion and adjusted operating margin was up 20 basis points versus last year at 43.2%. \n Moving to Slide 7. The Financial Technology segment organic revenue grew at 7% in the second quarter, resulting in 6% growth for the first half, at the high end of our 4% to 6% medium-term guidance range. As Frank mentioned, we added 7 new core account processing clients in the quarter, including 4 competitive takeaways. The combination of Finxact's modern core and Fiserv's leading digital surrounds is winning in the client's office. \n Adjusted operating income was up 3% in the quarter to $281 million and up 7% to $556 million year-to-date. Adjusted operating margin in the segment decreased 120 basis points to 35% in the quarter, driven by investments in Finxact, which we acquired early in the quarter; as well as increased organic investments in the business. For the first half, the segment's adjusted operating margin grew 30 basis points to 35.2%. \n The adjusted corporate operating loss was $125 million in the quarter and $247 million year-to-date. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 21% and was 19% for the first half. We continue to expect 2022 adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 21% for the full year. \n Total debt outstanding was $21.5 billion on June 30, and debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 3.0x, in line with our target leverage. In June, we increased our bank revolver to $6 billion from $3.5 billion previously and extended the maturity to June 2027. The new revolver provides additional capacity and flexibility. \n During the quarter, we continued our disciplined capital allocation strategy, repurchasing 5.1 million shares for $500 million. We had 32 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase at the end of the quarter. Additionally, we have had nearly $400 million of share repurchases so far in July. We are fully committed to our long-standing capital allocation strategy, which includes maintaining a strong balance sheet, repurchasing shares and pursuing high-value and innovative acquisitions. \n With that, let me turn the call back to Frank. Thanks, Dave. Yes, Dave, thanks. As you heard us say over the last couple of quarters, we don't necessarily -- like to necessarily track yield. And the fact is we're not managing for yield, we're managing for revenue growth and overall margin. There's always quarter-to-quarter fluctuations. This quarter, last quarter are 2 examples where both yield is positive. As we continue to sell more value-added services, as we see more revenue per merchant, obviously, we see the benefit of yield. \n And yes, we see that it -- we believe our overall revenue growth is sustainable, and we'll continue to see good growth in the business. Some of that will be \"yield\" because of more value-added services. Some of that will be more transactions. Yes. I think you should expect the margin to improve into Q3 and more so into Q4. The combination of -- we do anticipate inflation to subside a bit from the very high levels we saw in the first half of the year. \n Additionally, as we've talked about in the prepared remarks as well as last quarter, we have this carryover work that we have going on from an integration standpoint. Last year, we dialed those costs out. We added them back to adjusted earnings. Beginning in January 1 of this year, we stopped dialing that back out. And therefore, you see those costs hit in Q1. \n In Q2, they started to ease. In the latter part of Q2, they will continue their easing rate. So those costs go away. In addition, you get the benefit or the productivity out of that integration work. And so you'll see a bigger improvement in fourth quarter than you do in third, and second half stronger than the first half. Yes. Lisa, so I think a couple of things there. One, we definitely see the improvement in inventory in the back half of the year. We have been buying significant amounts of inventory, both in terms of point-of-sale devices, but also in paper and plastic for our Payments segment, our output solutions business payments. We see that easing into the second half of the year. That was done not only the case of actual point-of-sale devices, but some components to protect our clients from having hardware available. And we see that easing in the second half of the year so we'll see an improvement there.  \n Overall, I believe working capital will improve into the second half as well as some improvement in CapEx from a timing standpoint. And then, finally, as we see improved margins, a bit more productivity to get more cash flow. And Lisa, I think those 2 last elements that Frank pointed out is really at the heart of why we've taken our full year outlook down from the 95% to 100%, now 90% to 95%. Continue to see those opportunities, and we want to work those opportunities. Yes. I think overall, it's a relatively small piece. It's, call it, roughly 2% of the Payment segment. We've obviously seen good growth there and is part of the growth driver of the business. And as that continues to ramp, now we have a number of financial institutions, and therefore the number of users, as we see more and more ubiquity of that capability of that tool, i.e., more consumers making more payments, we'll continue to see good growth and so. And Tien-Tsin, as I pointed out, and obviously, we expect inflation to subside a bit. We have the productivity of completing those integration projects. Those have been ramping down as of the kind of middle to end of second quarter. You see clear line of sight to see that continuing into Q3. And we see good opportunities to continue to invest, focused on sustainably growing this business much faster than it has in the past, taking our revenue guidance up this year from previously 7% to 9% to now 9% to 11%. And those opportunities that Frank talked about to increase our speed of execution and drive innovation not only is an impact to cash flow, but margin. And therefore, you saw us lower margin a bit even though we took up EPS given stronger growth. No. I would say no change in thinking. The strength of our balance sheet and our cash flow gives us the opportunity to both buy back shares and look for value-accretive acquisitions, and we'll continue to do that. \n If you look, we did about $1.4 billion through yesterday or so, through July so far. But we also completed a number of acquisitions. And in fact, what, over the last call it, 15, 18 months, 7 different acquisitions for about $2 billion while we're also buying back shares. \n So we'll continue to do both. As you know, we're in the market regularly. We clearly believe there's real opportunity in the value of our stock, so we'll buy back. But we also look for value-accretive acquisitions. Sure. Yes. So obviously, very positive yield this quarter, was last quarter. There's always variability quarter-to-quarter, and so we try not to get too myopically focused on that calculation within a given quarter. We think it kind of evens out over time. As we continue to provide value-added services, we'll continue to see improvements. We are very focused on adding merchants to our portfolio, i.e., signing up more merchants. We're very focused on selling more products to those merchants. That lifts our PO and drives revenue and margins for the company. Yes. I'm not ready to update our medium-term or long-term outlook. Obviously, the crystal ball these days is a little bit fuzzy in what '22, '23, '24, '25 is going to look like. Look, at the end of the day, we're focused on driving sustainable growth in our revenue. We're up significantly from where we've been historically. \n We took up this year -- we said the merchant business, the medium-term outlook was 9% to 12% in our last full investor conference at the end of 2020. In March of this year, we actually took that up and extended it. So we went out to 2025 and said we believe we'll be at 11%. \n So we're driving for sustainable growth. That obviously helps the top line. It's growing the bottom line. We took our EPS growth up this quarter for the full year and we'll continue to look for those opportunities to drive overall value by growing the top line, bottom line and generating great free cash flow. And Ramsey, maybe the thing I'd add to punctuate is, at the end of the day, we believe profitable, scaled businesses will perform over time. And competition comes and goes. We'll continue to execute, we'll continue to perform for our clients, and we'll continue to win. Yes, Jason, thank you. If you look at the 3 segments, obviously, we've lifted the full company from 7% to 9% previous outlook to 9% to 11%. So we're above the year -- we're above the midpoint of the -- excuse me, above the medium-term outlook that we've given in the past. In the payment segment, as you pointed out, we said during the prepared remarks that we think it's well within the range of a 5% to 8%. \n Merchant, we had previously guided or provided an outlook of 9% to 12%, which is in line with our medium-term outlook. At this point, obviously, given we're 18% year-to-date, we're off to a good start in the third quarter with volumes in July continue to be in line. So we expect that to be above the guidance range or above that 9% to 12% outlook. \n And fintech at 4% to 6%, we're 6% year-to-date. I would expect that to be in the range for the full year basis. There are obviously some ebbs and flows with periodic revenue. But overall, we feel good about the growth rate of all 3 of our segments to be at or better than our previous outlook. Yes. I think -- so it varies by segments and varies by business within that segment. If you think about the overall impact of inflation, Obviously, we've got some revenue growth or revenue growth driven by that inflation, but bigger impact from an expense standpoint. We do see that flowing down for the balance of the year. So both a little bit less benefit on the top line but a little less hit on the expense side. So we'll see some margin improvement into the second half of the year. That is the large driver of that, combined with those investments that we're seeing, are driving the reduced growth in our margin. Still up 100 basis points over the prior -- at least 100 basis points over the prior year, but inflation and those investments are certainly driving some of that. James, obviously, if you read the Wall Street Journal or pick up any news report with interest rates and inflation and, obviously, a headwind. Unemployment is quite low, that's remarkably resilient. The consumer balance sheet is quite strong. So overall, we feel pretty good about the visibility near term. It's the '23, '25, we're just kicking off our 2023 budgeting cycle. \n At the end of the day, I think one of the keys to think about is the demonstrated resilience of this company in every cycle. So if we were to hit a recession, which I think some people believe we're technically in right now, how deep does that recession go? How long does it last? What's the overall input? Is it a job-full recession? All of that creates some of that murkiness. \n But at the end of the day, we have proven to be incredibly resilient throughout those cycles. We've got levers we can pull right now. We are making a decision given the strength of the top line, the ability to invest, and make sure that we are providing continued innovation for our clients. A little bit lower in margin, but actually raising EPS, we think, is the right near term, midterm and long-term decision. But if things were to suddenly go very soft, we've got levers to pull, we'll drive productivity and we'll continue to deliver. Yes. I think 2 things there. One, we're about 85% fixed debt, 15% variable. The -- look, by far, the biggest chunk of that is commercial paper, and there's a balance of commercial paper both in U.S. dollar and euro. Obviously, that's going up, but that is quite a bit lower than fixed rate debt. So we're in good shape there. \n And of course, as a company, we have a bit of a natural hedge. We have interest with variable rate debt, but we also have float revenue. So we have cash on the balance sheet that actually generates interest that roughly offsets that variable rate. So overall, rising interest rates, net-net, are actually good for us within reason, given that we're naturally hedged. And higher interest rates are good for our financial institution clients and therefore provide opportunity for us. Yes. I think if you look at the 3 segments kind of in order of what might see impact in a meaningful downturn: Merchant first, followed by payments, followed by fintech. Overall though, we think we proved quite resilient. Obviously, even in 2020, which was a very difficult year by all accounts, we managed to well flat revenue, grow earnings per share double digits, up 12%. And so to the earlier comment I made, we have levers to pull, we have investments, we can mitigate and manage the overall bottom line. \n This is the 37th year of double-digit earnings, assuming we deliver on our guidance for the year, which obviously we fully expect to do. That's through lots of different cycles, both good and bad. And so we believe broadly that we'll do quite well. If we see a sudden shock, go back to Q2 of 2020, obviously, at the height of pandemic, everybody took a hit, and we sustained quite well overall. So we feel good about our opportunities to weather storms. Yes. We've previously had been expecting about 100 basis points headwind on revenue from FX. That's now up to 200 basis points, clearly driven by euro and Lat Am, Latin America, largely Argentine peso conversion. But in general, certainly a headwind that everybody is facing."

        "content": "Operator: Welcome to the Fiserv 2022 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. \n At this time, I will turn the call over to Shub Mukherjee, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. \nShub Mukherjee: Thank you, and good morning. With me on the call today are Frank Bisignano, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. \n Our earnings release and supplemental materials for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Please refer to these materials for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this call, along with the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. Unless otherwise stated, performance references are year-over-year comparisons.  \n Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results and strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. You should refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. \n And now over to Frank. \nFrank Bisignano: Thank you, Shub, and thank you all for listening in as we share our results for the quarter and highlight the progress against our growth agenda. As you know, we serve as the operating system for commerce and money movement across our client base of banks, credit unions, fintechs and businesses ranging from SMBs to mid-market to large enterprises. We help our clients grow by extending our platform to capture new services and new money flows. Our relentless pursuit of innovation for our clients has placed us on the list of the world's Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company for the second consecutive year. \n We've entered 2022 with strong momentum. We delivered 11% total company organic revenue growth in the first quarter. We expanded adjusted operating margin by 60 basis points to 32%. We also achieved 20% adjusted EPS growth to $1.40. \n We attained $40 million of actioned revenue synergies in the quarter, reaching $520 million since the merger, 87% of the increased commitment of $600 million for the 5-year period following the merger, and now expect to hit that goal by the end of this year. As we shared with you on our year-end 2021 earnings call, we concluded our cost synergy program, having actioned the promised $1.2 billion of synergies since the closing of the merger. As we invested to accelerate growth, free cash flow came in at $603 million. \n The outperformance on the top and bottom line versus our full year guidance ranges puts us in a good position to meet or exceed our full year outlook. As we evaluate the year ahead, we believe it is prudent to leave our 2022 guidance unchanged, given the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop with high inflation, rising interest rates and geopolitical issues looming. Accordingly, we are maintaining our 2022 outlook for organic revenue growth of 7% to 9% and adjusted earnings per share in a range of $6.40 to $6.55, representing growth of 15% to 17% for 2022. \n Now turning to our business strategy. Fiserv solutions are geared towards merchants and financial institutions, including fintechs. Starting with merchants, we are transforming from selling merchants individual point solutions to offering operating systems, Clover for small- to medium-sized merchants and Carat for large enterprises. \n This operating systems approach expands the size of our total addressable market and makes us more valuable to our customers. We grow and create value in 3 ways. First, attracting more merchants to our operating systems; second, expanding the relationship we have with our merchants by encouraging adoption of more software and services modules; and third, benefiting from the organic growth of our existing customer base. \n Turning to our financial institution clients. We remain steadfast in our commitment to continuously innovate for our clients and broaden our total addressable market. In early April, we closed the acquisition of Finxact, a leading developer of cloud-native banking solutions. We have already seen a tremendous amount of interest in the platform from existing and new clients. We believe this acquisition will augment our ability to enrich and accelerate the delivery of digital solutions to existing clients as well as broaden our client base to include large financial institutions and fintechs through banking as a service and embedded finance opportunities.  \n We advanced our strategic focus on data and analytics. This quarter, we announced partnerships with Equifax, Finicity and MX, which will utilize our vast and highly valuable real-time data to create insights to strengthen and create new offerings across fraud, risk and marketing. While early in the journey, we expect data and analytics to be a new growth driver for us.  \n Next, diving deeper into our performance in the quarter by business segment. Let me start with Merchant Acceptance. We posted a very strong organic revenue growth of 20% year-over-year. Global merchant volume and transactions grew 11% and 8%, respectively. Our global active merchant accounts grew 6% year-over-year in the first quarter, continuing a positive trend since the start of 2021.  \n Results were strong across all regions. North America was led by strength in SMBs, particularly within the restaurant vertical as well as strength in enterprise verticals such as travel and petro. Spending across EMEA was strong in the quarter as restrictions were lifted in the U.K. and The Netherlands in early January, followed by Ireland, Poland and Germany later in the quarter. Travel was particularly strong, followed by restaurants and hospitality. \n Our merchant business in LatAm was also very strong in the quarter. We've made significant progress in on-boarding merchants through exclusive merchant acquiring mandate from Caixa in Brazil with 140,000 merchants currently on-boarded. In just 1 year since signing the agreement, we are also expanding our presence rapidly in Mexico and Colombia. Spending trends in APAC were very strong as key markets such as India and Australia continue to resume normalcy, fueling discretionary spend in verticals such as travel, retail and restaurant. In addition to the cyclical rebound, the region has continued to win and implement new business.  \n Moving to our merchant operating systems. Clover and Carat continue to gain significant traction with clients. Clover's global revenue grew 39% in the quarter, driven by volume growth of 39% as well as close to 200 basis points of sequential growth in software and services penetration of revenue to 15%.  \n We continue to make progress on our vertical focus. Starting with restaurants. The integration of BentoBox into Clover is well underway, and the early proof points in both lead conversion rate and ARPU are all very positive. Within the services and retail verticals we are offering merchants leading solutions to address key business functions through a combination of pre-installed apps and tailored vertical SaaS offerings.  \n Carat, the omni-commerce operating system for enterprise clients, grew revenue 20%. We saw broad-based growth across verticals, including travel, government, technology and quick-serve restaurants. In the quarter, we had some impressive wins across omni and e-com acquiring, including a card-not-present acquiring mandate for the leading fantasy sports player, DraftKings; an extension of our long-standing omnichannel partnership with Chick-fil-A; a mandate for fast food brand Jersey Mike's Subs.  \n Within new payment flows, Carat's leadership and digital payouts continues with the doubling of disbursement volume processed in the quarter. During the quarter, we extended our contract with Coinbase to support their launch of an NFT marketplace. We are making rapid inroads into the high-growth markets such as payment facilitators and platforms. The November acquisition of NetPay gives us a differentiated solution in the market, including fully managed on-boarding, risk and funding services to support these high-growth platform businesses. We have seen rapid growth in this end market with new clients signing nearly doubling transactions in the past year.  \n Finally, before closing out the merchant segment, an update on the progress of our point-of-sale lending offering. Our strategy all along has been to leverage our position as the operating platform for businesses, small, medium and large, to offer a range of buy now, pay later options. We are simplifying the merchant experience through an integration into the Carat operating system for large enterprises and enabling BNPL app downloads through the Clover app market for small and midsized businesses. By enabling our clients to easily connect to BNPL providers of their choice, we are making it possible for them to offer their customers in-demand payment options in an easy-to-manage cost-effective way.  \n Moving to Payments and Network segment. Organic revenue grew 5% in the quarter. This growth was enabled by a variety of drivers for cross-sell business lines. Our North American credit active accounts on file grew 10% versus Q1 of last year. This growth was driven by new business on-boarding and our favorable credit environment. We fully ramped Genesis Financial onto our platform in the quarter, which along with the on-boarding of Atlanticus last year, marked the on-boarding of 2 of the 3 major credit processing mandates we announced in 2020.  \n We had solid growth in our debit networks, STAR and Accel; and debit processing businesses, driven by new wins despite the stimulus-induced tough growth comparisons in the year ago. We've seen impressive growth in engagement metrics across our FIs, driven by market-leading digital solutions like CardHub, SpendTrack, our loyalty platform and our AI-based fraud system. These surrounds not only greatly enhance the competitiveness of our credit and debit card processing offering but also serve to drive more cards into our debit network and more opportunities for Fiserv to offer risk and fraud, digital banking and account processing solutions, demonstrating an attractive flywheel effect. We continue to see growth in digital payments driven by Zelle, which posted transaction growth of a strong 40% in the quarter.  \n Finally, while we still see softness in our bill payments business, sequential growth rates continue to improve as we create new use cases like bill pay for fintechs, including crypto digital wallets; and enter long-term renewals with large clients, notably U.S. Bank and Regions Bank. Additionally, this summer, we will launch a revamped bill pay interface to elevate the customer experience. \n Looking ahead, our sales and product pipeline gives us confidence in our ability to grow the payments segment in the 5% to 8% medium-term organic revenue range. Our client wins in the quarter support this momentum. We signed a long-term renewal with a highly valued client, Synchrony, spanning across issuer processing, bank services and merchant acquiring, reinforcing our commitment to providing best-in-class solutions to our clients. \n We continue to win credit processing mandates globally. In the first quarter, we signed a new installment loan provider, Flexiti Financial, in Canada. The debit wins in the quarter included a processing win extending our relationship with KeyBanc; and an integrated debit processing, network and digital surround solutions win with Heritage Federal Credit Union, a $900 million asset size client. These wins showcase the breadth and reach of our debit processing capabilities, spanning from smaller credit unions to some of the nation's largest financial institutions.  \n We also continue to show the power of our enterprise offering and our competitive advantage when working with fintechs. This quarter, we signed an enterprise agreement with a new digital financial services company across bank services, credit and debit processing and output services. We will also fully on-board Bread Financial, previously known as Alliance Data, for card processing in the second quarter of this year. The tailwinds from our large-grade implementations, recent debit wins like KeyBanc this quarter, Chime and Great Southern over the last couple of quarters and the investments in our digital surround solutions gives us confidence of continued growth in Payments and Network segment.  \n Moving to the Financial Technology segment. We posted strong organic revenue growth of 6% in the quarter. We had 12 core wins in the quarter, including 4 competitive takeaways. \n Sales of digital surround solutions continue to grow at a healthy clip, driven by the increased digital focus of our financial institution clients and the success of Abiliti,  our modern online and mobile banking platform. Sales to existing clients help us deepen the penetration of our fully integrated digital surrounds, such as CardHub, Zelle and SpendTrack, thereby creating stickier clients. The competitive landscape continues to evolve quickly, and we believe that our fintech strategy combined with Finxact's modern core capabilities positions us uniquely to offer a full stack of offerings aimed at expanding the addressable market for embedded finance and banking as a service.  \n The linchpin of our fintech strategy is our open finance initiative. In the third quarter of 2021, we launched our new developer portal called the Developer Studio, a platform for exposing our microservice APIs for the developer community with the goal of becoming the destination of choice for the embedded finance ecosystem, including card issuing and processing, merchant and core banking integrations. Our banking as a service capability enables financial institutions to expose modern fintech solutions to their client base to increase engagement and relevance while extending their reach into new market segments.  \n Our banking as a service capability is also a turnkey solution for fintechs and merchants wanting to offer banking and payment services. We believe we are best positioned to power the ongoing revolution in banking as a service and embedded finance due to our footprint of community financial institutions and breadth of banking and payment capabilities. \n Now let me pass the discussion to Bob for more detail on our financial results. \nRobert Hau: Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. I'll cover some additional operating detail on our 3 segments. If you are following along on our slides, I'm starting with our financial metrics and trends on Slide 4.  \n As Frank said, we started off the year strong. Total company organic revenue was up 11% in the quarter with growth across all segments, led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 20%. Total company adjusted revenue grew 10% to over $3.9 billion. \n Our adjusted operating income was up 12% to $1.2 billion, and adjusted operating margin expanded 60 basis points to 32%, in line with our expectations. As a reminder, we delivered 360 basis points of margin expansion in the year-ago quarter, resulting in 420 basis points of expansion over the last 2 years. We reaffirm our outlook to deliver at least 150 basis points of adjusted margin expansion for the year. \n First quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 20% to $1.40. Free cash flow was $603 million for the quarter, resulting in a conversion rate of 65%, driven by a combination of: first, increased capital expenditures in the areas of technology and integration of newly acquired capabilities; second, increased working capital investment, driven by revenue growth, including growth in anticipation revenue in Latin America; third, increased hardware inventory to minimize any potential disruption to our clients given the supply constraints; and finally, timing factors impacting cash from one quarter to the next. We reaffirm our outlook to achieve 95% to 100% free cash flow conversion for the full year. \n Now looking to our segment results, starting on Slide 5. Organic revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was a very strong 20% in the quarter. Adjusted revenue growth was 18% year-over-year. Global merchant volume and transactions grew 11% and 8%, respectively. Excluding the loss of a processing client mid last year, global merchant volume and transactions grew 15% and 10% in the quarter, respectively.  \n Clover, our operating system for small and medium-sized businesses, continues to build on the strength of its product offering to attract and retain more merchants and expand relationships with them. In the quarter, Clover posted a strong 39% revenue growth, and quarterly GPV was $49 billion or $197 billion on an annualized basis, 39%. Our ISV volume in the quarter through Clover Connect grew 51% year-over-year. We signed 44 ISVs this quarter. Carat, our omni-commerce operating system for enterprise clients, grew revenue 20% in the first quarter. \n Adjusted operating income in the acceptance segment increased 21% to $470 million, and adjusted operating margin was up 70 basis points to 28.4% as we balanced efficiency gains with continued investment for growth. In the quarter, we completed the sale of certain merchant contracts from an Alliance joint venture that we disclosed last year. As we shared with you on the fourth quarter 2021 earnings call, the impact of this sale is estimated to be under 50 basis points of total company adjusted revenue. It is fully contemplated in our full year 2022 outlook.  \n Turning to Slide 6. The Payments and Network segment posted organic revenue growth of 5% in the quarter, within our guided range of 5% to 8% for the year. As expected, our credit issuer solutions business saw strong growth, driven by the growth in credit active accounts on file as well as the impact of new clients coming onboard. Our debit processing and network businesses continued to perform well, driven by the compelling value proposition of our digital surrounds even as debit transaction growth decelerated to 3% year-over-year against a very difficult year-ago comparison. \n Consumer demand for account-to-account and P2P offerings continued with all transactions up 40%, and the number of clients live on Zelle was up 57% in the quarter. The offsets in the quarter were the prepaid business, which faced very tough stimulus-driven year-ago comps and bill pay. Adjusted operating income for the segment was up 7% to $625 million, and adjusted operating margin was up 110 basis points to 42.5% in the quarter.  \n Turning to Slide 7. The Financial Technology segment organic revenue grew 6% in the first quarter, including 100 basis points from periodic revenue. Adjusted operating income was up 12% in the quarter to $275 million, resulting in adjusted operating margin expansion of 200 basis points to 35.4%. \n The adjusted corporate operating loss was $122 million in the quarter, in line with the average of the last 4 quarters. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 17.3%, 10 basis points higher than last year. The 2022 adjusted effective tax rate should continue at the same quarterly pacing as last year and is expected to be approximately 21% for the full year. \n Additionally, we returned $500 million to shareholders through share repurchases this quarter. We have more than 37 million shares of repurchase authorization remaining. Total debt outstanding was $21 billion on March 31, and the debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio decreased to 3.0x as we approach our target leverage level. \n Turning to a new slide, Slide 8. We highlight our balance sheet performance and capital allocation results over time. We've made meaningful strides to lower our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio by over 0.5 turn from Q1 last year and a full turn since the merger. \n Over the last 2 years, we've generated $7 billion of free cash flow and have allocated $4.9 billion towards a combination of M&A and share repurchases, representing 5% of shares outstanding. Additionally, we have deployed $2.1 billion over that time towards debt repayment and integrations, both of which are expected to significantly decline as we completed the integration of the First Data and Fiserv merger at the end of last year and approach our goal of under 3x debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage. This will allow us to allocate even more capital to value-creating acquisitions and share repurchase.  \n Finally, turning to Slide 9. Although we outperformed on adjusted revenue and EPS for the first quarter, we feel it's prudent to keep our 2022 outlook unchanged. Given that it is still early in the year and the macroeconomic backdrop remains uncertain. \n With that, let me turn the call back to Frank. \nFrank Bisignano: Thanks, Bob. I am very proud of the results we've accomplished this quarter. As diversity and inclusion continues to be at the top of our CSR agenda, we are focused on ensuring alignment and investment into our employee and community engagement strategies.  \n In the first quarter, in addition to the Fast Company most innovative recognition I mentioned earlier, Fiserv was named as a 2022 Great Place to Work in Argentina, Uruguay, Colombia and Mexico. For the second consecutive year, Fiserv has been designated by VETS Indexes as a 5-star employer. In addition, our Nenagh technology center in Ireland has been recognized as a Great Place to Work for the fourth consecutive year. \n Fiserv has activated several initiatives in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, including financial grants for our associates, direct donations to local not-for-profit organizations and other humanitarian programs for civilians displaced in the region. We've also activated a matching donation campaign in support of American Red Cross efforts.  \n A quick note that our 2021 CSR report will be finalized and published in the coming weeks. As I close, I would like to thank all 40,000-plus hardworking associates around the world for working relentlessly to service our clients and you, our shareholders.  \n With that, operator, please open the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. . \nTien-Tsin Huang: I had a couple of questions. The first one, on the acceptance segment, obviously, very strong there. It looks like volume growth matched Visa's but the revenue growth did exceed that. So what's driving the higher revenue spread to volume in this quarter? And what should we expect here going -- as we go through the balance of the year? And I had a quick follow-up, if you don't mind. \nRobert Hau: Yes, Tien-Tsin. I think there's -- like we saw in previous quarters, there are a number of differences between our volumes and Visa's volumes and the international mix and cross-border mix, et cetera, et cetera. So as you said, we're in line from a volume standpoint. We had good revenue growth overall. \n As we've talked, yield is a metric that ebbs and flows quarter-to-quarter. The last couple of quarters, the math has been a little bit weaker. This quarter, it's quite strong. I think there's a lot of variation in there. And it's one of the things we continue to point to, that we're quite focused on revenue growth and margin expansion, a little less so on the yield because of that quarterly variation. Clearly very pleased with the performance of our merchant segment with good, very strong growth continuing in Clover, good growth in Carat and across the board. Having a 20% organic revenue growth for the segment in the quarter is a great start to the year. \nTien-Tsin Huang: Yes. So let me ask my quick follow-up, if you don't mind, just on the free cash conversion. I heard the CapEx and opportunistically buying some terminals here, but you're keeping the full year at 95% to 100% the same. So what's the outlook for some of the moving pieces here to drive that confidence in getting to that 95% to 100%  for the full year? \nFrank Bisignano: I think -- it's Frank. First of all, it was way more than physical terminals. It was component parts also, and we thought it was a very prudent and smart move to buy ahead into the supply chain given the volume opportunities we have across the board which drive growth. So that would be clearly in the one-timer inventory category. \n Obviously, we see -- as we reiterate our confidence on margin also, we see the ability to grow and expand margins as part of the confidence story going forward. And obviously, these are ebbs and flows quarter-to-quarter also and timing of capital. So I think about it in those manners. We feel great about the growth. We feel good about our ability to expand the margins. And we feel good about the ability of what we bought ahead actually thrive, grow and not have that expenditure going forward. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. \nLisa Dejong Ellis: I'll take payments and networks, I guess, which came in at the lower end of your long-term outlook of 5% to 8% there. I know there's a lot of moving pieces within payments and networks. You highlighted, I think, both some lapping effects of stimulus hitting the prepaid business and the debit business but then also the bill payment business, which has been a bit of a struggle coming out of the pandemic. Can you just parse those apart a little bit, meaning what was sort of onetime versus lapping issues related to stimulus in the quarter versus where we might see more of a protracted drag as we go throughout the year? And then I have a quick follow-up as well. \nRobert Hau: Sure, Lisa. So within the payments segment, stimulus certainly created a tough compare to Q1 of last year with our prepaid business. And as we saw really late '20 and into '21, a consumer shift of credit to debit, which we think was stimulus-driven, we're now starting to see that kind of revert back to mean or to norm with more move to credit than it is debit. \n Of course, as you know, we get paid on a per transaction basis on the debit side, but on a credit processing side in the payments segment, we're paid on gross active accounts. And so now we're seeing a nice lift in the number of accounts, but the transaction shift from debit to credit doesn't manifest itself in revenue directly. So good growth in our credit business this quarter versus Q1, still had growth in debit but not as high as we had all of last year. Debit Q1 of last year was quite weak and came back throughout the year. \n And then in the bill pay and biller side, we've actually seen an improvement of the headwind. So it's still an issue for us. And we talked to a couple of things that we see, things beginning to improve over probably the last 2 quarters. The rate of growth decline has improved quite a bit. And as we go live with a number of new clients, particularly in the fintech space, and as we launch the new user interface this summer, we see continued opportunity to improve both in the bill pay/biller business but also in payments overall. And of course, as we now have implemented 2 of the big 3 credit issuers, with the third one going live here late second quarter, you'll see accelerating growth from the credit issuer side of the business. \nLisa Dejong Ellis: Got it. Okay. A quick just follow-up maybe for Frank on the new -- I guess, new highlight around advanced data and analytics with these partnerships with Equifax and Finicity, et cetera. Can you just give maybe a little bit of color or examples of the types of offerings there? And is this kind of new revenue stream or is this more of a win rate stickiness dynamic in the bank base? Just elaborate a bit... \nFrank Bisignano: No, it's a new revenue stream. We've always believed that we had a data advantage. And we did some things organizationally, maybe you remember, at the top of the house where we've dedicated talent against it, and it is manifesting itself. We have a pretty good road map to capabilities to offer to our clients and then to jointly offer with partners and combining capabilities. That is why we believe when we come into the latter part of this year and then going into next year, a completely new revenue stream with high margins in those capabilities in providing real-time data, in providing decisioning data, and that's what we have right now. \n We do see the opportunity, as we said, in marketing and other information. We yet -- haven't proved out that proof of concept yet, but the others have been proved. And we expect to be in market at the latter quarter of this year. \nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. \nDarrin Peller: First, on the growth side, on the top line, I just want to touch on both -- first, the fintech segment. When we look at the growth, it does seem like mid-single digits seem pretty resilient now. And on top of the Finxact acquisition and what that can do, I'd love to hear more thoughts on what that can actually do to add to business given the pipelines you're seeing. But CPI price escalators potentially built in, to what extent do you expect to push those through this year? And can that also contribute? \nFrank Bisignano: The one I'd talk about, I think the team in fintech and their maniacal focus on how to serve the client and growth is showing up. We had an expectation that we would get to these type of levels. And when we laid it out in December of 2020, I think the action plans in that team and the product innovation and bringing all the components of the company where we think we have a strategic advantage actually got us to where we are today. \n I think our digital assets play very, very well. So I talked about those surrounds. Our ability to have a good digital lens really is a strategic advantage. And then you saw us do things like bringing Ondot into Mobiliti, which also is a one-of-a-kind offering. And when that all comes together in the client's office, it gets us to where we are today. \n I think thinking beyond today, Finxact is very strategic. It -- as we had said, we think it expands our TAM capability. And we think over the long haul, a combo of our assets plus Finxact, allow us to get to other markets we weren't intending to before. \n So when you look at it, we feel great about the job the team has done. The Finxact acquisition, as you know, 20-plus days closed, and that's moving along very, very well. The integration of the team and the ability to deliver what we expect over the next few years from that, we have clear line of sight, we believe. And I think that's how we think about the totality of our current business, our digital offerings and our future digital offerings and expanding the total addressable market that we were addressing around that segment. \nRobert Hau: And Darrin, in terms of CPI, we do get -- particularly in our core account processing business, a typical contract does allow for annual CPI changes. Those are very typically annual items. So at the end of the year, we calculate the CPI index and apply it to the next year's billing. \n And contracts vary. Some have caps, some have full CPI, and it varies across the board. But that is fully baked into, first of all, our guidance. You're seeing it in the Q1 results. And because it's an annual bill, that's locked for the year. \nDarrin Peller: I have one quick follow-up -- that's helpful. But Frank, just from an M&A standpoint, when we think about what you just said, the leverage level now below 3. Obviously, opportunistic buybacks make a ton of sense. But at the same time, there's definitely valuations coming in across the market. So can you just revisit your preference in terms of capital allocation going forward and what types of assets? \nFrank Bisignano: Yes. I think we've demonstrated a pretty balanced approach to our capital allocation, both if you look at what we did with Finxact or if you look what we've done with BentoBox or Ondot. And you'd find all of them really leaning into helping our clients grow their business with their clients in a digital framework. So I put that out there because it is largely about addressing new markets, new opportunities and how, in fact, we help our clients grow their business, which, in fact, would become the beneficiary also. \n And you should expect that mindset around future acquisitions, which is just another form of investing for growth. You just saw and Bob talked through that 29% over the last 24 months of our capital allocation went into merchant integration expense and debt paydowns. And that capital is now deployable, and obviously, we will continue to have a better growth rate. \n And I think you should expect that we will use the same methodology of investing for growth where we believe we can leverage our assets inside the house to bring other market opportunities, and we'll be buying back the shares opportunistically and returning those dollars to our shareholders as we always have in that tried and true methodology. And we feel kind of great about what we've done so far on the capital allocation. Hope you guys do, too. And we feel even stronger about it going forward. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Dave Koning from Baird. \nDavid Koning: Great job. And I guess my first question, you had the investor meeting a few -- a handful of weeks ago and talked about 11.5% growth in merchant over time. Should we expect that every quarter of the year? And I guess, kind of behind that, it seems like we're entering a period maybe we'll get into smaller tickets, inflation. Pricing seems to be getting better in the industry. Now all those things contributing -- are all those fair assumptions? And then that 11.5% question. \nRobert Hau: So from a quarterly flow standpoint, obviously, first quarter closing after going through that merchant conference, we put up a 20% number. So we certainly don't expect 11.5% every year or 11.5% every quarter. Obviously, a great first quarter out of a 5-year projection, lots left to do, in very good shape in terms of executing on the multiple elements of growth that we talked about during that conference. Clover and Carat continued to perform well. We continue to invest in new capabilities there. So I feel like we're off to a great start. \n Of course, that conference, I think, was in early March. So we're early into the process, but we're in a very good position, and we think we've got a great set of assets in terms of operating systems to bring to both our enterprise and small business clients. We've got a great distribution system, our global reach and geography. Frank talked about in his prepared remarks how well Caixa is going and the strength in Latin America. So I think we're hitting on all cylinders. And we're quite pleased with where we are so far, but plenty more to go. \nDavid Koning: Yes. Great, great. And then just one follow-up. The margin cadence through the year, Q1 was a little slower than the guidance. Q2 a little slower, too. Is that fair and then the back half is when you get maybe above the full year guidance? \nRobert Hau: Yes, that's exactly where we're at. And I believe we said in prepared remarks, we're up 60 basis points for the first quarter. That's right in line with our internal expectations, and obviously, our internal expectations have us achieving the 150 for the full year. And we continue to execute. And it's not really \"a hockey stick.\" It's a matter of the tempo of the business. \n We did, as you know, a significant amount of integration work in the last couple of years. We ended merger and integration treatment, i.e., we're no longer adding back to our adjusted results for merger and acquisition -- merger and integration spending. And we still have some of those projects going on as we finish up the, what, 2-plus years now since we merged. That will ease in -- over the next couple of quarters, those costs will be reduced, and we'll continue to get good growth and fall-through into the business. So you'll see the 150 come in over the course of the year. \nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. \nJason Kupferberg: I just wanted to come back to the payments segment for a second. It sounds like you're seeing some positive signals there. You've got some newer wins coming down the pike. But just so that our expectations are calibrated properly, I know you're talking about the medium-term range of 5% to 8% being good for this year, but should we think about more of the lower half to maybe the midpoint just given that we're starting the year at 5%? I just want to make sure that we've kind of got the right cadence in our thought process because I know the comps get tougher from here on out. \nFrank Bisignano: Comps do get tougher, but pipeline comes in over time, too. And I think we talked about the elements of it. Obviously, we've talked a whole bunch leading into this year about $120 million of issuer wins, and we're beginning to see them in our numbers. We also feel the assets are very, very strong assets. And you heard us talk about a change in direction on bill pay from where we were a year ago. So we feel -- we don't feel at all that we're at the low end in our range on that in the go forward. \nJason Kupferberg: Okay. That's good to hear, sure. And just a follow-up on the Finxact acquisition. How much revenue do you expect it to contribute to the fintech segment this year? And can you just go a little deeper maybe into the go-to-market strategy there and the kind of synergy that Fiserv is going to bring to this asset? \nFrank Bisignano: Yes. Well, you won't -- Bob can talk about more, but you won't see anything in this year's numbers. So we change structurally our growth rate. Obviously, these are long cycle sales. \n But the go-to-market strategy has multi prongs. One is the ability to bring to our clients today a digital sidecar if they want to. If they want to build crypto or digital bank capability, we have the ability to do that. So that expands the TAM of what we can do and I think doing that given the fact that you won't see anything in the economics for this year. But that's one element of it. \n The second element is the combination of DNA and Finxact together being able to bring an unbelievable offering to a number of clients in a different manner. The third is standing up fintechs and digital banks and other embedded finance. And you hear us talk about our open finance initiative and how well Finxact complements that. \n And then I think Finxact has a great demonstration of a current base that they've sold into that, in some cases, would be larger than where maybe our lifetime sweet spot was. But you should expect that to be more TAM opportunity. We go to market together in a very concerted fashion. And when the assets on our surrounds all come to it, it becomes a very, very strong offering. I think you'll see that growth in the outer years, not in this year, but you should expect it to be highly accretive to our growth rate over time. \nRobert Hau: Just to hit the point home on revenue this year. Of course, it would all be inorganic. So it is -- it wouldn't impact our 7% to 9% for the total company or the 4% to 6% for the fintech segment. But overall, very small from an adjusted revenue standpoint also. \nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. \nRamsey El-Assal: Can you guys share your updated view on consumer spending trends? Are you seeing any sign across the business that inflation or higher fuel prices or other macro factors are sort of tipping from tailwind to headwind? Any kind of clues that the robust spending levels that we've seen will prove sustainable? \nFrank Bisignano: Well, I mean, I would say if you looked at April, it fundamentally looks the same with maybe some places having a little more and some places having a little less. Obviously, areas like petro services and restaurants are holding up at the same level, maybe a little bit on travel and retail. \n But clearly, we've been conscious of the consumer. And as we think about the future, we factored in what would happen if this slowdown did occur, and that's really -- that's in our prepared remarks. We talked about our prudence and prudent management around the thought process. So very little change right now, but we're very guarded and we're managing in a guarded fashion. \nRamsey El-Assal: Okay. And I also was wondering if you could give us a little more color on the revamped bill pay interface that you mentioned that would be rolling out, I believe, in the summer. What kinds of things can you do with that business to kind of continue the nice inflection that I think you're seeing back in the right direction? \nFrank Bisignano: Yes. I think it's really about the user experience. It's all about the user experience and about giving them capabilities that were refreshing in that environment. It allows our bank partners to then be able to actually increase their bill pay capability with their clients. \n So remember, we're always focused. And you hear it in my M&A comments. You hear it in how we run the business, on how we give our clients the opportunity to do more business with their clients. So think about it as a very good, easy, usable front end that actually will be the most modern you can touch, that allow much more ability for that end user to be able to navigate versus what they had before. And our banks and us believe -- that change, as we've completely built it with our banks in mind and their conversation, we believe that it allows them to get more user capability, which will equal more usage and higher engagement by the client base. \nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. \nJames Faucette: I wanted to touch on the fintech segment first. Just obviously, the -- and try to get a sense of appetite of banks to spend and continue to upgrade their systems, especially given what looks to be a strong earnings period and potential for them as interest rates change, et cetera. So just what's your feel right now for opportunity sets there? And are you seeing any changes or improvements in appetite? \nFrank Bisignano: Yes. Having spent a fair amount of time in charge of the spending of banks around these assets and now having been here, what I find is that the appetite is very, very strong. The appetite being strong means if they can get digital capabilities, if they can serve their clients better, if they believe that the change is actually going to help them grow and do a better job, they're completely committed. \n We've seen a lot of those DNA wins. We've seen it from small to tall, as I would like to say. And the addition of Finxact, in my mind, just has opened a lot of our current banks' eyes and a lot of our nonbanks', that we're not serving in that space, eyes towards the capabilities we can bring to them in the here and now. So I find it to be a tremendously encouraging time for that business. \nJames Faucette: Got it. Got it. And as you think about -- obviously, there's lots of focus always on the merchant business and that kind of thing. But consistent with the Finxact acquisition and when you think about M&A, is there place where you feel like, okay, we need to prioritize if we're going to look at potential acquisitions on merchant versus fintech? Or based on what your -- where you're seeing traction and where you feel like there's opportunity, are you leaning in one direction or another as you're evaluating acquisitions? \nFrank Bisignano: Well, I think Finxact was a very, very big acquisition which gave us, in my opinion, the most modern platform in the industry that can tremendously scale. So I think that, that was very important and sets us up for the long haul. \n If you go back to my comments earlier, I think we're very focused on helping our clients grow in places we're not -- weren't or we're not in manner. If you look at BentoBox, it allows us to move to be in the front of the store capability. What that does to ARPU for us in our restaurant business is very, very strong. And so you should expect us to deploy our capital in acquisitions more in the space of how to better serve our clients in markets that we're not collecting revenue, so investing for growth as opposed to back-end synergies and really a digital eye on all of it. \nRobert Hau: James, the one thing I'd add is, I guess, I don't think about it and I don't think Frank thinks about it as which should we do. I think given the capital we have available to deploy, we think we can do both. In the last 15 months, I think we've done 8 different acquisitions, both focused on digital as well as on our merchant business. Those digital investments benefited our merchant segment, they benefited our fintech segment, and they benefited our payments segment. And ultimately, as Frank pointed out, it's all about how can we better serve our customers so that they can better serve their customers. \nOperator: And our final question comes from Jamie Friedman from Susquehanna. \nJames Friedman: This Slide 25 on the annual guide is super helpful. But Bob, I was wondering if there were any call-outs specific to the Q2 of '22. For example, are there any standouts that we should be aware of from the Q2 of '21, like periodic or anything else that we should keep in mind? \nRobert Hau: No. I guess the thing to think about is within every individual quarter last year, we had ebbs and flows of the pandemic recovery. We had a big stimulus push in Q1 of last year. Not only did we benefit by having more cash into the U.S. consumer, but we actually helped put the cash into the consumer, i.e., we issued the cards. That was a Q1 activity. And then Q2 and Q3, we saw -- and Q4 for that matter, we saw the benefit of the consumer using that cash. \n But overall, if you look at the Q2 growth rate last year, it's a pretty difficult compare. We did 18% growth, in particular very strong merchant business, but that was off of a recovery of a very difficult Q2 of 2020. So -- and we feel good about the overall growth of the business, and we expect all 3 of our segments to continue to perform well. \nJames Friedman: Any similar comment about the Q2 margin expectation? \nRobert Hau: Yes. We talked a little bit about this earlier. We get various flows. We actually, I think, said this back in Q4 when we first gave the 150 basis -- at least 150 basis points expansion for the full year. Because of some of the timing of the investments we're making, because of the ramping down of some of the integration work that we're no longer adding back from an adjusted operating margin standpoint, you'll see margins improve in the second half. \n Obviously, we still improved this quarter; in fact, a little bit better than we expected at 60 basis points. But you'll see us reach that 150 for the full year throughout the year but more expansive, I guess, in the second half. \nFrank Bisignano: Thank you. Thank you, everybody, for your attention today. Please feel free to reach out to our IR department and team with any questions. And have a great day, and I look forward to talking to you in the future. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you all for participating in the Fiserv 2022 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. That concludes today's call. Please disconnect at this time, and have a great rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Frank Bisignano",
            "content": "Thank you, Shub, and thank you all for listening in as we share our results for the quarter and highlight the progress against our growth agenda. As you know, we serve as the operating system for commerce and money movement across our client base of banks, credit unions, fintechs and businesses ranging from SMBs to mid-market to large enterprises. We help our clients grow by extending our platform to capture new services and new money flows. Our relentless pursuit of innovation for our clients has placed us on the list of the world's Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company for the second consecutive year. \n We've entered 2022 with strong momentum. We delivered 11% total company organic revenue growth in the first quarter. We expanded adjusted operating margin by 60 basis points to 32%. We also achieved 20% adjusted EPS growth to $1.40. \n We attained $40 million of actioned revenue synergies in the quarter, reaching $520 million since the merger, 87% of the increased commitment of $600 million for the 5-year period following the merger, and now expect to hit that goal by the end of this year. As we shared with you on our year-end 2021 earnings call, we concluded our cost synergy program, having actioned the promised $1.2 billion of synergies since the closing of the merger. As we invested to accelerate growth, free cash flow came in at $603 million. \n The outperformance on the top and bottom line versus our full year guidance ranges puts us in a good position to meet or exceed our full year outlook. As we evaluate the year ahead, we believe it is prudent to leave our 2022 guidance unchanged, given the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop with high inflation, rising interest rates and geopolitical issues looming. Accordingly, we are maintaining our 2022 outlook for organic revenue growth of 7% to 9% and adjusted earnings per share in a range of $6.40 to $6.55, representing growth of 15% to 17% for 2022. \n Now turning to our business strategy. Fiserv solutions are geared towards merchants and financial institutions, including fintechs. Starting with merchants, we are transforming from selling merchants individual point solutions to offering operating systems, Clover for small- to medium-sized merchants and Carat for large enterprises. \n This operating systems approach expands the size of our total addressable market and makes us more valuable to our customers. We grow and create value in 3 ways. First, attracting more merchants to our operating systems; second, expanding the relationship we have with our merchants by encouraging adoption of more software and services modules; and third, benefiting from the organic growth of our existing customer base. \n Turning to our financial institution clients. We remain steadfast in our commitment to continuously innovate for our clients and broaden our total addressable market. In early April, we closed the acquisition of Finxact, a leading developer of cloud-native banking solutions. We have already seen a tremendous amount of interest in the platform from existing and new clients. We believe this acquisition will augment our ability to enrich and accelerate the delivery of digital solutions to existing clients as well as broaden our client base to include large financial institutions and fintechs through banking as a service and embedded finance opportunities.  \n We advanced our strategic focus on data and analytics. This quarter, we announced partnerships with Equifax, Finicity and MX, which will utilize our vast and highly valuable real-time data to create insights to strengthen and create new offerings across fraud, risk and marketing. While early in the journey, we expect data and analytics to be a new growth driver for us.  \n Next, diving deeper into our performance in the quarter by business segment. Let me start with Merchant Acceptance. We posted a very strong organic revenue growth of 20% year-over-year. Global merchant volume and transactions grew 11% and 8%, respectively. Our global active merchant accounts grew 6% year-over-year in the first quarter, continuing a positive trend since the start of 2021.  \n Results were strong across all regions. North America was led by strength in SMBs, particularly within the restaurant vertical as well as strength in enterprise verticals such as travel and petro. Spending across EMEA was strong in the quarter as restrictions were lifted in the U.K. and The Netherlands in early January, followed by Ireland, Poland and Germany later in the quarter. Travel was particularly strong, followed by restaurants and hospitality. \n Our merchant business in LatAm was also very strong in the quarter. We've made significant progress in on-boarding merchants through exclusive merchant acquiring mandate from Caixa in Brazil with 140,000 merchants currently on-boarded. In just 1 year since signing the agreement, we are also expanding our presence rapidly in Mexico and Colombia. Spending trends in APAC were very strong as key markets such as India and Australia continue to resume normalcy, fueling discretionary spend in verticals such as travel, retail and restaurant. In addition to the cyclical rebound, the region has continued to win and implement new business.  \n Moving to our merchant operating systems. Clover and Carat continue to gain significant traction with clients. Clover's global revenue grew 39% in the quarter, driven by volume growth of 39% as well as close to 200 basis points of sequential growth in software and services penetration of revenue to 15%.  \n We continue to make progress on our vertical focus. Starting with restaurants. The integration of BentoBox into Clover is well underway, and the early proof points in both lead conversion rate and ARPU are all very positive. Within the services and retail verticals we are offering merchants leading solutions to address key business functions through a combination of pre-installed apps and tailored vertical SaaS offerings.  \n Carat, the omni-commerce operating system for enterprise clients, grew revenue 20%. We saw broad-based growth across verticals, including travel, government, technology and quick-serve restaurants. In the quarter, we had some impressive wins across omni and e-com acquiring, including a card-not-present acquiring mandate for the leading fantasy sports player, DraftKings; an extension of our long-standing omnichannel partnership with Chick-fil-A; a mandate for fast food brand Jersey Mike's Subs.  \n Within new payment flows, Carat's leadership and digital payouts continues with the doubling of disbursement volume processed in the quarter. During the quarter, we extended our contract with Coinbase to support their launch of an NFT marketplace. We are making rapid inroads into the high-growth markets such as payment facilitators and platforms. The November acquisition of NetPay gives us a differentiated solution in the market, including fully managed on-boarding, risk and funding services to support these high-growth platform businesses. We have seen rapid growth in this end market with new clients signing nearly doubling transactions in the past year.  \n Finally, before closing out the merchant segment, an update on the progress of our point-of-sale lending offering. Our strategy all along has been to leverage our position as the operating platform for businesses, small, medium and large, to offer a range of buy now, pay later options. We are simplifying the merchant experience through an integration into the Carat operating system for large enterprises and enabling BNPL app downloads through the Clover app market for small and midsized businesses. By enabling our clients to easily connect to BNPL providers of their choice, we are making it possible for them to offer their customers in-demand payment options in an easy-to-manage cost-effective way.  \n Moving to Payments and Network segment. Organic revenue grew 5% in the quarter. This growth was enabled by a variety of drivers for cross-sell business lines. Our North American credit active accounts on file grew 10% versus Q1 of last year. This growth was driven by new business on-boarding and our favorable credit environment. We fully ramped Genesis Financial onto our platform in the quarter, which along with the on-boarding of Atlanticus last year, marked the on-boarding of 2 of the 3 major credit processing mandates we announced in 2020.  \n We had solid growth in our debit networks, STAR and Accel; and debit processing businesses, driven by new wins despite the stimulus-induced tough growth comparisons in the year ago. We've seen impressive growth in engagement metrics across our FIs, driven by market-leading digital solutions like CardHub, SpendTrack, our loyalty platform and our AI-based fraud system. These surrounds not only greatly enhance the competitiveness of our credit and debit card processing offering but also serve to drive more cards into our debit network and more opportunities for Fiserv to offer risk and fraud, digital banking and account processing solutions, demonstrating an attractive flywheel effect. We continue to see growth in digital payments driven by Zelle, which posted transaction growth of a strong 40% in the quarter.  \n Finally, while we still see softness in our bill payments business, sequential growth rates continue to improve as we create new use cases like bill pay for fintechs, including crypto digital wallets; and enter long-term renewals with large clients, notably U.S. Bank and Regions Bank. Additionally, this summer, we will launch a revamped bill pay interface to elevate the customer experience. \n Looking ahead, our sales and product pipeline gives us confidence in our ability to grow the payments segment in the 5% to 8% medium-term organic revenue range. Our client wins in the quarter support this momentum. We signed a long-term renewal with a highly valued client, Synchrony, spanning across issuer processing, bank services and merchant acquiring, reinforcing our commitment to providing best-in-class solutions to our clients. \n We continue to win credit processing mandates globally. In the first quarter, we signed a new installment loan provider, Flexiti Financial, in Canada. The debit wins in the quarter included a processing win extending our relationship with KeyBanc; and an integrated debit processing, network and digital surround solutions win with Heritage Federal Credit Union, a $900 million asset size client. These wins showcase the breadth and reach of our debit processing capabilities, spanning from smaller credit unions to some of the nation's largest financial institutions.  \n We also continue to show the power of our enterprise offering and our competitive advantage when working with fintechs. This quarter, we signed an enterprise agreement with a new digital financial services company across bank services, credit and debit processing and output services. We will also fully on-board Bread Financial, previously known as Alliance Data, for card processing in the second quarter of this year. The tailwinds from our large-grade implementations, recent debit wins like KeyBanc this quarter, Chime and Great Southern over the last couple of quarters and the investments in our digital surround solutions gives us confidence of continued growth in Payments and Network segment.  \n Moving to the Financial Technology segment. We posted strong organic revenue growth of 6% in the quarter. We had 12 core wins in the quarter, including 4 competitive takeaways. \n Sales of digital surround solutions continue to grow at a healthy clip, driven by the increased digital focus of our financial institution clients and the success of Abiliti,  our modern online and mobile banking platform. Sales to existing clients help us deepen the penetration of our fully integrated digital surrounds, such as CardHub, Zelle and SpendTrack, thereby creating stickier clients. The competitive landscape continues to evolve quickly, and we believe that our fintech strategy combined with Finxact's modern core capabilities positions us uniquely to offer a full stack of offerings aimed at expanding the addressable market for embedded finance and banking as a service.  \n The linchpin of our fintech strategy is our open finance initiative. In the third quarter of 2021, we launched our new developer portal called the Developer Studio, a platform for exposing our microservice APIs for the developer community with the goal of becoming the destination of choice for the embedded finance ecosystem, including card issuing and processing, merchant and core banking integrations. Our banking as a service capability enables financial institutions to expose modern fintech solutions to their client base to increase engagement and relevance while extending their reach into new market segments.  \n Our banking as a service capability is also a turnkey solution for fintechs and merchants wanting to offer banking and payment services. We believe we are best positioned to power the ongoing revolution in banking as a service and embedded finance due to our footprint of community financial institutions and breadth of banking and payment capabilities. \n Now let me pass the discussion to Bob for more detail on our financial results. Thanks, Bob. I am very proud of the results we've accomplished this quarter. As diversity and inclusion continues to be at the top of our CSR agenda, we are focused on ensuring alignment and investment into our employee and community engagement strategies.  \n In the first quarter, in addition to the Fast Company most innovative recognition I mentioned earlier, Fiserv was named as a 2022 Great Place to Work in Argentina, Uruguay, Colombia and Mexico. For the second consecutive year, Fiserv has been designated by VETS Indexes as a 5-star employer. In addition, our Nenagh technology center in Ireland has been recognized as a Great Place to Work for the fourth consecutive year. \n Fiserv has activated several initiatives in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, including financial grants for our associates, direct donations to local not-for-profit organizations and other humanitarian programs for civilians displaced in the region. We've also activated a matching donation campaign in support of American Red Cross efforts.  \n A quick note that our 2021 CSR report will be finalized and published in the coming weeks. As I close, I would like to thank all 40,000-plus hardworking associates around the world for working relentlessly to service our clients and you, our shareholders.  \n With that, operator, please open the line for questions. I think -- it's Frank. First of all, it was way more than physical terminals. It was component parts also, and we thought it was a very prudent and smart move to buy ahead into the supply chain given the volume opportunities we have across the board which drive growth. So that would be clearly in the one-timer inventory category. \n Obviously, we see -- as we reiterate our confidence on margin also, we see the ability to grow and expand margins as part of the confidence story going forward. And obviously, these are ebbs and flows quarter-to-quarter also and timing of capital. So I think about it in those manners. We feel great about the growth. We feel good about our ability to expand the margins. And we feel good about the ability of what we bought ahead actually thrive, grow and not have that expenditure going forward. No, it's a new revenue stream. We've always believed that we had a data advantage. And we did some things organizationally, maybe you remember, at the top of the house where we've dedicated talent against it, and it is manifesting itself. We have a pretty good road map to capabilities to offer to our clients and then to jointly offer with partners and combining capabilities. That is why we believe when we come into the latter part of this year and then going into next year, a completely new revenue stream with high margins in those capabilities in providing real-time data, in providing decisioning data, and that's what we have right now. \n We do see the opportunity, as we said, in marketing and other information. We yet -- haven't proved out that proof of concept yet, but the others have been proved. And we expect to be in market at the latter quarter of this year. The one I'd talk about, I think the team in fintech and their maniacal focus on how to serve the client and growth is showing up. We had an expectation that we would get to these type of levels. And when we laid it out in December of 2020, I think the action plans in that team and the product innovation and bringing all the components of the company where we think we have a strategic advantage actually got us to where we are today. \n I think our digital assets play very, very well. So I talked about those surrounds. Our ability to have a good digital lens really is a strategic advantage. And then you saw us do things like bringing Ondot into Mobiliti, which also is a one-of-a-kind offering. And when that all comes together in the client's office, it gets us to where we are today. \n I think thinking beyond today, Finxact is very strategic. It -- as we had said, we think it expands our TAM capability. And we think over the long haul, a combo of our assets plus Finxact, allow us to get to other markets we weren't intending to before. \n So when you look at it, we feel great about the job the team has done. The Finxact acquisition, as you know, 20-plus days closed, and that's moving along very, very well. The integration of the team and the ability to deliver what we expect over the next few years from that, we have clear line of sight, we believe. And I think that's how we think about the totality of our current business, our digital offerings and our future digital offerings and expanding the total addressable market that we were addressing around that segment. Yes. I think we've demonstrated a pretty balanced approach to our capital allocation, both if you look at what we did with Finxact or if you look what we've done with BentoBox or Ondot. And you'd find all of them really leaning into helping our clients grow their business with their clients in a digital framework. So I put that out there because it is largely about addressing new markets, new opportunities and how, in fact, we help our clients grow their business, which, in fact, would become the beneficiary also. \n And you should expect that mindset around future acquisitions, which is just another form of investing for growth. You just saw and Bob talked through that 29% over the last 24 months of our capital allocation went into merchant integration expense and debt paydowns. And that capital is now deployable, and obviously, we will continue to have a better growth rate. \n And I think you should expect that we will use the same methodology of investing for growth where we believe we can leverage our assets inside the house to bring other market opportunities, and we'll be buying back the shares opportunistically and returning those dollars to our shareholders as we always have in that tried and true methodology. And we feel kind of great about what we've done so far on the capital allocation. Hope you guys do, too. And we feel even stronger about it going forward. Comps do get tougher, but pipeline comes in over time, too. And I think we talked about the elements of it. Obviously, we've talked a whole bunch leading into this year about $120 million of issuer wins, and we're beginning to see them in our numbers. We also feel the assets are very, very strong assets. And you heard us talk about a change in direction on bill pay from where we were a year ago. So we feel -- we don't feel at all that we're at the low end in our range on that in the go forward. Yes. Well, you won't -- Bob can talk about more, but you won't see anything in this year's numbers. So we change structurally our growth rate. Obviously, these are long cycle sales. \n But the go-to-market strategy has multi prongs. One is the ability to bring to our clients today a digital sidecar if they want to. If they want to build crypto or digital bank capability, we have the ability to do that. So that expands the TAM of what we can do and I think doing that given the fact that you won't see anything in the economics for this year. But that's one element of it. \n The second element is the combination of DNA and Finxact together being able to bring an unbelievable offering to a number of clients in a different manner. The third is standing up fintechs and digital banks and other embedded finance. And you hear us talk about our open finance initiative and how well Finxact complements that. \n And then I think Finxact has a great demonstration of a current base that they've sold into that, in some cases, would be larger than where maybe our lifetime sweet spot was. But you should expect that to be more TAM opportunity. We go to market together in a very concerted fashion. And when the assets on our surrounds all come to it, it becomes a very, very strong offering. I think you'll see that growth in the outer years, not in this year, but you should expect it to be highly accretive to our growth rate over time. Well, I mean, I would say if you looked at April, it fundamentally looks the same with maybe some places having a little more and some places having a little less. Obviously, areas like petro services and restaurants are holding up at the same level, maybe a little bit on travel and retail. \n But clearly, we've been conscious of the consumer. And as we think about the future, we factored in what would happen if this slowdown did occur, and that's really -- that's in our prepared remarks. We talked about our prudence and prudent management around the thought process. So very little change right now, but we're very guarded and we're managing in a guarded fashion. Yes. I think it's really about the user experience. It's all about the user experience and about giving them capabilities that were refreshing in that environment. It allows our bank partners to then be able to actually increase their bill pay capability with their clients. \n So remember, we're always focused. And you hear it in my M&A comments. You hear it in how we run the business, on how we give our clients the opportunity to do more business with their clients. So think about it as a very good, easy, usable front end that actually will be the most modern you can touch, that allow much more ability for that end user to be able to navigate versus what they had before. And our banks and us believe -- that change, as we've completely built it with our banks in mind and their conversation, we believe that it allows them to get more user capability, which will equal more usage and higher engagement by the client base. Yes. Having spent a fair amount of time in charge of the spending of banks around these assets and now having been here, what I find is that the appetite is very, very strong. The appetite being strong means if they can get digital capabilities, if they can serve their clients better, if they believe that the change is actually going to help them grow and do a better job, they're completely committed. \n We've seen a lot of those DNA wins. We've seen it from small to tall, as I would like to say. And the addition of Finxact, in my mind, just has opened a lot of our current banks' eyes and a lot of our nonbanks', that we're not serving in that space, eyes towards the capabilities we can bring to them in the here and now. So I find it to be a tremendously encouraging time for that business. Well, I think Finxact was a very, very big acquisition which gave us, in my opinion, the most modern platform in the industry that can tremendously scale. So I think that, that was very important and sets us up for the long haul. \n If you go back to my comments earlier, I think we're very focused on helping our clients grow in places we're not -- weren't or we're not in manner. If you look at BentoBox, it allows us to move to be in the front of the store capability. What that does to ARPU for us in our restaurant business is very, very strong. And so you should expect us to deploy our capital in acquisitions more in the space of how to better serve our clients in markets that we're not collecting revenue, so investing for growth as opposed to back-end synergies and really a digital eye on all of it. Thank you. Thank you, everybody, for your attention today. Please feel free to reach out to our IR department and team with any questions. And have a great day, and I look forward to talking to you in the future. Thank you."

            "name": "Robert Hau",
            "content": "Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. I'll cover some additional operating detail on our 3 segments. If you are following along on our slides, I'm starting with our financial metrics and trends on Slide 4.  \n As Frank said, we started off the year strong. Total company organic revenue was up 11% in the quarter with growth across all segments, led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 20%. Total company adjusted revenue grew 10% to over $3.9 billion. \n Our adjusted operating income was up 12% to $1.2 billion, and adjusted operating margin expanded 60 basis points to 32%, in line with our expectations. As a reminder, we delivered 360 basis points of margin expansion in the year-ago quarter, resulting in 420 basis points of expansion over the last 2 years. We reaffirm our outlook to deliver at least 150 basis points of adjusted margin expansion for the year. \n First quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 20% to $1.40. Free cash flow was $603 million for the quarter, resulting in a conversion rate of 65%, driven by a combination of: first, increased capital expenditures in the areas of technology and integration of newly acquired capabilities; second, increased working capital investment, driven by revenue growth, including growth in anticipation revenue in Latin America; third, increased hardware inventory to minimize any potential disruption to our clients given the supply constraints; and finally, timing factors impacting cash from one quarter to the next. We reaffirm our outlook to achieve 95% to 100% free cash flow conversion for the full year. \n Now looking to our segment results, starting on Slide 5. Organic revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was a very strong 20% in the quarter. Adjusted revenue growth was 18% year-over-year. Global merchant volume and transactions grew 11% and 8%, respectively. Excluding the loss of a processing client mid last year, global merchant volume and transactions grew 15% and 10% in the quarter, respectively.  \n Clover, our operating system for small and medium-sized businesses, continues to build on the strength of its product offering to attract and retain more merchants and expand relationships with them. In the quarter, Clover posted a strong 39% revenue growth, and quarterly GPV was $49 billion or $197 billion on an annualized basis, 39%. Our ISV volume in the quarter through Clover Connect grew 51% year-over-year. We signed 44 ISVs this quarter. Carat, our omni-commerce operating system for enterprise clients, grew revenue 20% in the first quarter. \n Adjusted operating income in the acceptance segment increased 21% to $470 million, and adjusted operating margin was up 70 basis points to 28.4% as we balanced efficiency gains with continued investment for growth. In the quarter, we completed the sale of certain merchant contracts from an Alliance joint venture that we disclosed last year. As we shared with you on the fourth quarter 2021 earnings call, the impact of this sale is estimated to be under 50 basis points of total company adjusted revenue. It is fully contemplated in our full year 2022 outlook.  \n Turning to Slide 6. The Payments and Network segment posted organic revenue growth of 5% in the quarter, within our guided range of 5% to 8% for the year. As expected, our credit issuer solutions business saw strong growth, driven by the growth in credit active accounts on file as well as the impact of new clients coming onboard. Our debit processing and network businesses continued to perform well, driven by the compelling value proposition of our digital surrounds even as debit transaction growth decelerated to 3% year-over-year against a very difficult year-ago comparison. \n Consumer demand for account-to-account and P2P offerings continued with all transactions up 40%, and the number of clients live on Zelle was up 57% in the quarter. The offsets in the quarter were the prepaid business, which faced very tough stimulus-driven year-ago comps and bill pay. Adjusted operating income for the segment was up 7% to $625 million, and adjusted operating margin was up 110 basis points to 42.5% in the quarter.  \n Turning to Slide 7. The Financial Technology segment organic revenue grew 6% in the first quarter, including 100 basis points from periodic revenue. Adjusted operating income was up 12% in the quarter to $275 million, resulting in adjusted operating margin expansion of 200 basis points to 35.4%. \n The adjusted corporate operating loss was $122 million in the quarter, in line with the average of the last 4 quarters. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 17.3%, 10 basis points higher than last year. The 2022 adjusted effective tax rate should continue at the same quarterly pacing as last year and is expected to be approximately 21% for the full year. \n Additionally, we returned $500 million to shareholders through share repurchases this quarter. We have more than 37 million shares of repurchase authorization remaining. Total debt outstanding was $21 billion on March 31, and the debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio decreased to 3.0x as we approach our target leverage level. \n Turning to a new slide, Slide 8. We highlight our balance sheet performance and capital allocation results over time. We've made meaningful strides to lower our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio by over 0.5 turn from Q1 last year and a full turn since the merger. \n Over the last 2 years, we've generated $7 billion of free cash flow and have allocated $4.9 billion towards a combination of M&A and share repurchases, representing 5% of shares outstanding. Additionally, we have deployed $2.1 billion over that time towards debt repayment and integrations, both of which are expected to significantly decline as we completed the integration of the First Data and Fiserv merger at the end of last year and approach our goal of under 3x debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage. This will allow us to allocate even more capital to value-creating acquisitions and share repurchase.  \n Finally, turning to Slide 9. Although we outperformed on adjusted revenue and EPS for the first quarter, we feel it's prudent to keep our 2022 outlook unchanged. Given that it is still early in the year and the macroeconomic backdrop remains uncertain. \n With that, let me turn the call back to Frank. Yes, Tien-Tsin. I think there's -- like we saw in previous quarters, there are a number of differences between our volumes and Visa's volumes and the international mix and cross-border mix, et cetera, et cetera. So as you said, we're in line from a volume standpoint. We had good revenue growth overall. \n As we've talked, yield is a metric that ebbs and flows quarter-to-quarter. The last couple of quarters, the math has been a little bit weaker. This quarter, it's quite strong. I think there's a lot of variation in there. And it's one of the things we continue to point to, that we're quite focused on revenue growth and margin expansion, a little less so on the yield because of that quarterly variation. Clearly very pleased with the performance of our merchant segment with good, very strong growth continuing in Clover, good growth in Carat and across the board. Having a 20% organic revenue growth for the segment in the quarter is a great start to the year. Sure, Lisa. So within the payments segment, stimulus certainly created a tough compare to Q1 of last year with our prepaid business. And as we saw really late '20 and into '21, a consumer shift of credit to debit, which we think was stimulus-driven, we're now starting to see that kind of revert back to mean or to norm with more move to credit than it is debit. \n Of course, as you know, we get paid on a per transaction basis on the debit side, but on a credit processing side in the payments segment, we're paid on gross active accounts. And so now we're seeing a nice lift in the number of accounts, but the transaction shift from debit to credit doesn't manifest itself in revenue directly. So good growth in our credit business this quarter versus Q1, still had growth in debit but not as high as we had all of last year. Debit Q1 of last year was quite weak and came back throughout the year. \n And then in the bill pay and biller side, we've actually seen an improvement of the headwind. So it's still an issue for us. And we talked to a couple of things that we see, things beginning to improve over probably the last 2 quarters. The rate of growth decline has improved quite a bit. And as we go live with a number of new clients, particularly in the fintech space, and as we launch the new user interface this summer, we see continued opportunity to improve both in the bill pay/biller business but also in payments overall. And of course, as we now have implemented 2 of the big 3 credit issuers, with the third one going live here late second quarter, you'll see accelerating growth from the credit issuer side of the business. And Darrin, in terms of CPI, we do get -- particularly in our core account processing business, a typical contract does allow for annual CPI changes. Those are very typically annual items. So at the end of the year, we calculate the CPI index and apply it to the next year's billing. \n And contracts vary. Some have caps, some have full CPI, and it varies across the board. But that is fully baked into, first of all, our guidance. You're seeing it in the Q1 results. And because it's an annual bill, that's locked for the year. So from a quarterly flow standpoint, obviously, first quarter closing after going through that merchant conference, we put up a 20% number. So we certainly don't expect 11.5% every year or 11.5% every quarter. Obviously, a great first quarter out of a 5-year projection, lots left to do, in very good shape in terms of executing on the multiple elements of growth that we talked about during that conference. Clover and Carat continued to perform well. We continue to invest in new capabilities there. So I feel like we're off to a great start. \n Of course, that conference, I think, was in early March. So we're early into the process, but we're in a very good position, and we think we've got a great set of assets in terms of operating systems to bring to both our enterprise and small business clients. We've got a great distribution system, our global reach and geography. Frank talked about in his prepared remarks how well Caixa is going and the strength in Latin America. So I think we're hitting on all cylinders. And we're quite pleased with where we are so far, but plenty more to go. Yes, that's exactly where we're at. And I believe we said in prepared remarks, we're up 60 basis points for the first quarter. That's right in line with our internal expectations, and obviously, our internal expectations have us achieving the 150 for the full year. And we continue to execute. And it's not really \"a hockey stick.\" It's a matter of the tempo of the business. \n We did, as you know, a significant amount of integration work in the last couple of years. We ended merger and integration treatment, i.e., we're no longer adding back to our adjusted results for merger and acquisition -- merger and integration spending. And we still have some of those projects going on as we finish up the, what, 2-plus years now since we merged. That will ease in -- over the next couple of quarters, those costs will be reduced, and we'll continue to get good growth and fall-through into the business. So you'll see the 150 come in over the course of the year. Just to hit the point home on revenue this year. Of course, it would all be inorganic. So it is -- it wouldn't impact our 7% to 9% for the total company or the 4% to 6% for the fintech segment. But overall, very small from an adjusted revenue standpoint also. James, the one thing I'd add is, I guess, I don't think about it and I don't think Frank thinks about it as which should we do. I think given the capital we have available to deploy, we think we can do both. In the last 15 months, I think we've done 8 different acquisitions, both focused on digital as well as on our merchant business. Those digital investments benefited our merchant segment, they benefited our fintech segment, and they benefited our payments segment. And ultimately, as Frank pointed out, it's all about how can we better serve our customers so that they can better serve their customers. No. I guess the thing to think about is within every individual quarter last year, we had ebbs and flows of the pandemic recovery. We had a big stimulus push in Q1 of last year. Not only did we benefit by having more cash into the U.S. consumer, but we actually helped put the cash into the consumer, i.e., we issued the cards. That was a Q1 activity. And then Q2 and Q3, we saw -- and Q4 for that matter, we saw the benefit of the consumer using that cash. \n But overall, if you look at the Q2 growth rate last year, it's a pretty difficult compare. We did 18% growth, in particular very strong merchant business, but that was off of a recovery of a very difficult Q2 of 2020. So -- and we feel good about the overall growth of the business, and we expect all 3 of our segments to continue to perform well. Yes. We talked a little bit about this earlier. We get various flows. We actually, I think, said this back in Q4 when we first gave the 150 basis -- at least 150 basis points expansion for the full year. Because of some of the timing of the investments we're making, because of the ramping down of some of the integration work that we're no longer adding back from an adjusted operating margin standpoint, you'll see margins improve in the second half. \n Obviously, we still improved this quarter; in fact, a little bit better than we expected at 60 basis points. But you'll see us reach that 150 for the full year throughout the year but more expansive, I guess, in the second half."

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session begins following the presentation. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, I will turn the call over to Julie Chariell, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv.\nJulie Chariell: Thank you, and good morning. With me on the call today are Frank Bisignano, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and supplemental materials for the quarter and full year are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Please refer to these materials for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call, along with the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. Unless otherwise stated, performance references are year-over-year comparisons. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results and strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. You should refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. And now over to Frank.\nFrank Bisignano: Thank you, Julie, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss another double-digit growth year for Fiserv in both organic revenue and adjusted earnings per share. In 2023, we continue to demonstrate our leadership as proven by our financial performance. 12% organic revenue growth, more than 200 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion, 16% growth in adjusted earnings per share, $4 billion of free cash flow and $4.7 billion return to our shareholders through share repurchase. These results are possible because Fiserv possesses a set of assets that's unparalleled in our industry. From our vast and diverse client base, product portfolio and distribution network, to technology and capital resources, to a deep bench empowered with strategic vision and operational excellence. This combination of assets is how we plan to sustain strong performance. A fundamental aspect of our culture is that we are not satisfied and we continue to push for more. We know that great opportunity remains for continued revenue growth and improved productivity. We laid out several growth strategies at our investor conference in November and we are executing on those every day. At the same time, we continue to identify ways to drive further productivity. Five years ago, we announced the plan to merge First Data in Fiserv. Today, we are a 4.5 year-old company with a 38-year track record of double digit adjusted earnings per share growth. Under our new structure, half of our company, Merchant Solutions, is a leader in the high growth payments market where SMBs and enterprises are embracing the benefits of an operating system with seamless integration of value-added solutions. The other half, financial solutions is a leader in the high recurring revenue financial IT software and services market, helping small and medium sized financial institutions level the playing field with larger banks and helping larger banks migrate to next generation technology. This combination of growth and consistency has served us well. And our business model is even more compelling at the intersection of these two businesses. We continue to see strong opportunity to cross sell and integrate merchant and financial solutions to help financial institutions better serve their merchant customers and enable merchants to retain customers with new financial services offerings. Fiserv is unique in its positioning at the center of these two important ecosystems. Let's take a step back and review our 2023 results. They highlight another important aspect of our culture, delivering on our commitments. In late 2020, we set formidable financial and operational targets for the subsequent three years. We delivered on those and more. For 2023, we started with organic revenue growth guidance of 7% to 9% and delivered 12%. We started with a goal of at least 125 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement and delivered 220 basis points. And we started with adjusted EPS guidance of $7.25 to $7.40 or 12 to 14% growth. And we delivered $7.52 or 16% growth. In the fourth quarter, we achieved organic revenue growth of 12% and adjusted operating margin of 40.7% up 150 basis points from fourth quarter 2022, which itself was an exceptionally strong quarter. Our adjusted earnings per share of $2.19 was ahead of expectations on the strength of our merchant revenue and payments margin. Free cash flow was also very strong at $1.3 billion. And we repurchased 8.6 million shares, ending the year with 5% fewer average diluted shares outstanding than last year. Our Merchant Acceptance segment generated organic revenue growth of 24% and 19% in the quarter and full year, respectively, exceeding our expectations at the start of the year. Clover revenue growth accelerated 30% in the quarter as SMBs remained healthy and restaurants in particular continuing to outperform. Our distribution partners globally continued to embrace our platform. Value-added solutions revenue grew more than 40% in 2023 to end the year at a 19% penetration rate. Carat's revenue growth rebounded to 11% in the quarter or 15%, excluding the client that took processing in-house mid last year. Growth was driven by the ramp of recent wins by key clients, which has continued into this year. We expanded our global acquiring capability by adding India's UPI and Japan's JCB as payment methods for clients in more than 35 markets. In the energy sector, we complemented our leadership position with a new deal to provide seamless unattended payment experiences for drivers using one of the country's largest networks of charging stations. Outside the U.S., we were pleased to have signed several new deals in EMEA during Q4 and into January. They included a major new merchant acquiring relationship with a leading apparel and equipment retailer and a renewal and extension of business with a leading QSR. Additionally, our Vert joint venture with Deutsche Bank is now beginning to hit its stride with accelerated Clover merchant sign-ups. In Asia-Pac, we signed a new merchant acquiring deal with Vistara, a domestic airline in India and went live with more payout options for consumers in the region. In Latin America, we continue to ramp up merchant acquiring in Brazil for CaixaBank, along with payment acceptance at its BillPay outlets. We've laid the groundwork to support more fee-based PIX transactions for our merchant clients with the acquisition of SLED in Q4. SLED is a software solutions company that will allow Fiserv to operate as a direct payment service provider, expanding our reach into the full PIX instant payments universe. In April, we will be rolling out Clover, which we expect to further advance our leading position in Brazil. In Argentina, we're building on our 4-year Clover lead with acceleration in new merchant growth. With more Clover merchants engaging in more anticipation activity, our growth in Argentina continues beyond the macro factors of high inflation and interest rates. The payment segment achieved the top end of its medium-term guidance range with 4% organic revenue growth in the quarter and 8% for the year. We added nearly 20 large e-commerce merchants to our debit network, STAR and Accel, in the wake of Reg II, including eBay and HelloFresh in Q4 and Uber, Lyft and others earlier in the year. Several of these are new clients to Fiserv. In 2023, we signed well over 200 of our financial institution clients to our NOW Network to expand their payment routes to include FedNow for real-time payments. In BillPay, the bill and directory behind our market-leading consumer BillPay business is proving valuable in the SMB space as we complete the build-out of our new small business accounts receivable and payable offering, cash flow essential. We won our first client in the fourth quarter, Washington Federal Bank, with $23 billion in assets. And just last week, Fiserv expanded its long-standing digital money movement relationship with U.S. Bank to now include cash flow essential. These two important wins came just a few months after formally announcing the product. The pipeline is growing rapidly with strong interest and demand from financial institutions, including many of the largest. At our investor conference, we talked about value-added solutions and new verticals in our issuing business. We made significant progress on both during 2023 and early Q1. One of our value-added services, an AI-based fraud prevention tool called Advanced Defense, grew volume nearly 5x over 2022. Now, Synchrony is in the process of upgrading to Advanced Defense across its portfolio of more than 70 million accounts. We're excited to be rolling out the California Employment Development Department plan for our Money Network prepaid cards. This largest-of-its-kind state program for unemployment and other benefits will go live later this month. We have a pipeline of other opportunities in the government sector to deliver on our strategy to grow in this vertical. This also extends to healthcare, where we converted a significant portion of Health Equity's card portfolio onto our platform in the fourth quarter, with the remainder scheduled for later this year. In EMEA, we signed our first global OpenFX issuer deal with Absa, one of Africa's largest diversified financial services groups. This new currency solution enables issuers to take control of their FX, mitigate FX exposure and bring more value to their cardholders. With Truworths, one of the leading retailers in South Africa, we upgraded to a VisionPLUS license, attaching more value-added solutions. In Asia-Pac, we added a new India issuer processing client, Equitas Small Finance Bank. They will launch their retail and corporate card programs using our FirstVision India processing hub, with a full-stack offering that includes UPI, loyalty, offers, and real-time fraud management. The FinTech segment recorded a 1% decline in organic revenue for the quarter and a 2% increase for the full year. Organic growth excluding periodic revenue for the year was 4%. While we knew we had a very difficult comparison with high periodic revenue in Q4 '22, we had visibility to achieve our growth goal. In large part from the level of client engagement we saw at Forum, our client conference in June. And those discussions continued. Separately, the pace of new core wins remains healthy at 12 in Q4, and clients are demonstrating two important trends. First, they are migrating from one Fiserv core operating system to another. A positive sign that they are finding the answers to their changing needs right here within the Fiserv portfolio. Second, while M&A activity among financial institutions slowed in 2023, we believe that M&A activity is good for us, as we can compete at any level with any institution without platforms and it creates an opportunity to provide more services to the combined institution. Prosperity Bank, a Texas-based regional bank with $38.5 billion in assets, decided in Q4 to migrate to our cloud-enabled DNA platform and signed up for our CardHub value-added solution. Old National Bank, a $49 billion bank in Indiana, is a core system client that has been growing with us as it has been making acquisitions. And we continue to grow our relationship with Old National in the fourth quarter with the addition of debit processing, Accel, CardHub, and other value-added solutions. These are also two examples of our financial technology segment clients buying our value-added solutions in the payment segment. This ongoing trend of clients buying services across these two segments is a key reason why we are creating a single new segment, Financial Solutions. Turning to the outlook for 2024, we expect total company organic revenue growth of 15% to 17%, inclusive of an estimated 7 points of growth from excess revenue in Argentina, driven by significantly higher inflation and interest in the Argentina merchant business, following the government's steep peso devaluation in mid-December. We expect continued margin improvement in 2024 with at least 100 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion. And adjusted earnings per share should grow 14% to 16%, reaching $8.55 to $8.70. This adjusted EPS growth outlook is in the middle of the range we provided at our investor conference in November, and it's meant to be a prudent reflection of the macroeconomic outlook. Economist consensus calls for U.S. personal consumption growth and consumer savings to be lower in 2024, creating a modest headwind to the merchant business. Against a potentially softer backdrop, we remain confident in our ability to grow Clover and Carat as we add more merchants, sell more to existing clients and add to our portfolio and penetration of value-added solutions. Our discussions with banks and credit unions indicate that they remain poised to spend to retain and grow deposits. We are meeting their changing needs every day with our operating system approach that offers the most integrated platforms and broadest suite of value-added solutions in the business. We are encouraged by our newest financial solutions initiatives in SMB payments with Cashflow Central, our new integrated digital banking platform experience digital and the power of Finxact to win over larger banks and existing clients. We expect all of these to ramp over the course of 2024 and set the stage for stronger growth in subsequent years. To summarize, our outlook for 2024 is positive as we anticipate another year of double-digit organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings per share as well as strong adjusted operating margin expansion. Our optimism for sustained growth level is tempered only by the economic backdrop of modestly slower GDP growth and geopolitical tensions. We remain confident in our ability to control our growth trajectory at the top and bottom lines through our strong positioning, innovation, good stewardship of capital and plain hard work. We rely on our resilient business model with its diverse client mix serving non-discretionary spending categories and our high recurring revenue to continue investing at a pace that supports our competitive strengths. For more details on our financial results, I'll pass the discussion on to Bob.\nRobert Hau: Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. If you\u2019re following along on our slides, I'll additional cover details on total company and segment performance, starting with our financial metrics and trends on Slide 4. Fourth quarter and full year results reflected our focus on delivering on our commitments with momentum across the business. Total company organic revenue growth was 12% in the quarter with ongoing strength in our Merchant Acceptance and payments and network segments, offset by a decline in the Fintech segment against a very difficult compare. For the full year, total company organic revenue also grew 12% ahead of the guidance we provided in October and November. This performance was led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 19%. Fourth quarter total company adjusted revenue grew 6% to $4.6 billion and adjusted operating income grew 10% to $1.9 billion, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 40.7%, an increase of 150 basis points versus the prior year and a sequential improvement of 260 basis points. The 40.7% represents a post-merger high for Fiserv. Our fourth quarter performance brought the full year adjusted operating margin to 37.3%, an increase of 220 basis points over 2022. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 15% to $2.19 compared to $1.91 in the prior year. Full year adjusted earnings per share increased 16% to $7.52. Those adjusted EPS results do not include $0.12 per share in expense relating to the significant devaluation of the Argentine peso as part of the government reform package on December 12 last year. This one-day move led to a non-operating, non-cash foreign exchange loss for the revaluation of our local balance sheet as required under GAAP rules for hyperinflation accounting. All other Argentine foreign exchange losses throughout 2023 are included in the adjusted EPS results. Free cash flow came in at $1.3 billion for the quarter and $4 billion for the full year, an increase of 14% over last year. Now looking to our segment results starting on Slide 6. Organic revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was 24% in the quarter and 19% for the full year, well ahead of our previous medium-term segment guidance of 9% to 12%. This includes an 8 point benefit to the full year organic growth from the transitory revenue driven by above-average interest and inflation in Argentina. Adjusted revenue growth was 14% in the quarter and 12% for the full year. You can see from the spread between organic and adjusted revenue growth that currency headwinds from the devaluation of the Argentine peso offset the benefit of the country's very high inflation and interest for the full year in adjusted revenue. Global merchant volume and transactions in the quarter grew 5% and 8%, excluding wholesale processing respectively. Clover revenue grew 30% in the fourth quarter, an annualized payment volume growth of 17%. For the full year, Clover revenue was up 25%. The spread between revenue and volume growth comes from higher penetration of value-added solutions, channel mix shifts and some pricing. VAS penetration reached 19% in Q4, up from 16% in the year-ago period and on pace to meet our 27% target by 2026. Carat also had a strong quarter with revenue growing 11%. For the year, Carat revenue grew 9%, excluding the loss of a Latin American processing client that moved in-house. Revenue growth was 15% for both the quarter and the year. Adjusted operating income in the Merchant Acceptance segment increased 26% to $819 million in the quarter, with margin up 400 basis points to 38.8%. Full year adjusted operating income improved 23% to $2.9 billion and margin grew 330 basis points to 35.1%. Over the last couple of quarters, some of you have noted that our revenue includes anticipation in LatAm, but the cost of that anticipation interest is not included in operating margin, as it is reported as interest expense below the operating income line on the income statement. If we were to take that interest from anticipation and pro forma it back to operating income, merchant margins would still have expanded a very strong 220 basis points for the quarter and 260 basis points for the year. Looking at 2024, January's overall volume growth, excluding processing, was similar to December's pace. Difficult weather throughout large portions of the U.S. did slow volume growth for a 2-week period in mid-January, but we've seen clear improvement in volume growth since then. The Fiserv Small Business Index also points to steady spending and a healthy environment for small businesses in January. We reported the index on February 2, with a value of 138, representing year-over-year growth of 1.7% and one-tenth of 1% growth from December on a seasonally adjusted basis. The Fiserv Small Business Index measures U.S. small business activity and is not a direct indicator of Fiserv results, but rather a measure of general pace of activity and health of this key Fiserv client base. Turning to Slide 7, on the payments and network segment. Organic revenue grew 4% in the quarter. This growth was enabled by a variety of drivers across our business lines. We have well over 200 financial institutions live or implementing FedNow and saw continued strength in Zelle, with transactions and number of clients growing at 44% and 23%, respectively for the quarter. Full-year organic revenue growth of 8% was at the upper end of our medium-term outlook range of 5% to 8%. Fourth quarter adjusted operating income for the segment was up 8% to $877 million and margin was up 250 basis points to 51%, driven by operating leverage and some third-party productivity we had been working on throughout the year that came in through the fourth quarter. For the full year, adjusted operating income was up 13% to $3.2 billion and margin expanded 250 basis points to 47.8%. Moving to Slide 8, in the financial technology segment. We posted a 1% organic revenue decline for the quarter and 2% growth for the full year. Organic revenue, excluding periodic revenue, grew 4% for the full year, and client momentum continued with 12 core wins in the quarter, reaching 42 wins for the year. We had expected some strong license sales in the quarter to reach the bottom end of our full-year guidance, but in several cases, these did not materialize as clients instead chose our application service provider, or ASP model. This is where we host the software in our data centers instead of clients purchasing their own software licenses. It had the effect of lowering in-quarter revenue in Q4 and instead spreading it out as monthly payments over multiple years. Adjusted operating income was down 11% in the quarter to $303 million and flat at $1.2 billion for the year. Adjusted operating margin in the segment decreased 340 basis points to 37.9% in the quarter. Full-year margin increased 10 basis points to 36.6% with the lower periodic revenue. The corporate adjusted operating loss was $110 million in the quarter and $494 million for the full year. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 18.7% and was 19.3% for the year. We expect the 2024 adjusted effective tax rate will be approximately 20% for the full year. Total debt outstanding was $23.1 billion on December 31st. The debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio dropped another tenth of a turn to 2.7 times within our target leverage range. We have approximately 10% of our debt in variable rate instruments. During the quarter, we repurchased 8.6 million shares for $1 billion, bringing our total 2023 share repurchase to $4.7 billion and nearly $10 billion in the last three years. The diluted average share count fell 5% from 2022 levels. We have 52 million shares remaining authorized for share repurchase at the end of the quarter. Our longstanding capital allocation strategy will continue in 2024, defined by a strong balance sheet, share repurchases and complementary and innovative acquisitions. Turning to Slide 9. As Frank said earlier, we expect organic revenue growth of 15% to 17%, with adjusted operating margin expansion of more than 100 basis points. This translates to adjusted earnings per share of $8.55 to $8.70 or 14% to 16% growth over 2023 and would represent our 39th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. In Merchant Solutions, we anticipate organic revenue growth in the 25% to 28% range, including 14 percentage points of transitory revenue growth in Argentina. This is higher than the outlook given at our investor conference in November due to the effects of the steep devaluation of the Argentine peso mid-December. For Financial Solutions, we continue to expect 5% to 7% organic revenue growth this year. We continue to estimate approximately $4.5 billion of free cash flow for 2024. In the second half of 2023, we launched a new initiative to purchase green tax credits where we buy tax credits at a discount from companies who earned but cannot use them. This reduces the net cash tax paid and in many cases defers the cash payment by a quarter or two. A recent new rule codified this practice for 10 years, so we expect to continue to benefit from it. This will bring more variability to our quarterly cash flows. In 2024, there will be a headwind in the first quarter and first half when we paid for the credits and a tailwind in the second half when some of the tax refunds are received. While we do anticipate some shifts in timing, we continue to expect full year free cash flow of approximately $4.5 billion. With that, let me turn the call back to Frank for some closing remarks.\nFrank Bisignano: Thanks, Bob. I'd like to spend a few minutes highlighting Fiserv's commitment to corporate social responsibility, which we align with business operations and employee engagement to maximize impact. Our next CSR report will be published in the second quarter and will demonstrate continued development of our employee resource groups, the Fiserv Cares Foundation, and our back-to-business program that awards grants to small businesses. To better serve our minority depository institution clients and their communities, we formed an MDI Advisory Council, which includes eight clients and other members. The council in part of our efforts to better collaborate and deliver value through our MDI clients and the communities they serve. Institutional Investor recognized Fiserv for its CSR efforts as the top ESG performer in the payments, processing and IT services sector, a first for the company. Our programmatic efforts earned recognition from prestigious indices like Bloomberg's Gender-Equality Index and the Human Rights Campaign's Equality Index. We also ranked number 1 on the Military Times Best for Vets Employers list. And just last week, we were named one of Fortune's World's Most Admired Companies for 2024, marking the 9th time in 10 years that we received this honorable distinction. While we scored highly in many categories, among the highest was innovation. We are particularly proud of this category recognition as well as other standouts for people leadership, product and service quality, global competitiveness and long-term investment value. As we look ahead to what's coming in 2024, the ongoing advancement of AI is not driven solely by the expanding capabilities of technology but also by the underlying proliferation of data to feed that generative engine. For Fiserv, our data and AI-powered intelligence put us on a path to be an effective user and enabler of AI. We're in the early innings of using it to optimize our own operations and deliver actionable insights for our clients as well with significant benefits to come in quality, productivity and growth. Fiserv already manages one of the most valuable information stores in the industry and we start from a position of strength based simply on the sheer amount of data that runs through our systems each year. Over $4 trillion of payment volume globally across more than six million merchant locations, plus 1.6 billion card accounts on file, 325 million deposit loan accounts and 20 million BillPay users across nearly 10,000 financial institutions. The power of our data fueling AI applications is already helping us throughout our business in areas such as enhanced customer service, analytics on the Clover and Carat dashboards and fraud mitigation tools. Let me share with you three ways we are turning data into an increasingly potent AI asset. First, we're creating better service and insights for our clients by helping them harness data in actionable ways. As an example, 85% of technical service calls were resolved unassisted through the use of data and AI with high client satisfaction rates. Additionally, over the last year, more than two million of the highest-level technical support inquiries resolved online through AI assisted learning. Second, we're embedding our data and AI capabilities into value-added solutions such as Advance Defense being used to combat fraud and other security risks. And third, we're packaging our rich data assets to build next-gen products. Earlier this year, for instance, we launched the Fiserv Small Business Index, a real-time assessment of consumer spending at SMBs published monthly, enabling new valuable insights for financial institutions, policymakers, investors and businesses of all sizes. Bob discussed, the results of our January index, which we released on February 2, making it an extremely timely measure of the current environment. As Bob and I like to say, intellectual honesty with analytical rigor is, how we run the company. Data is the enabler for us to apply this in all that we do, serving our clients, choosing our partners, assessing our competition, prioritizing our investments, understanding our performance, and communicating it to investors. With the many assets, I discussed on this call, including our data, along with our dedicated associates worldwide, adopting as fundamental practice of intellectual honesty with analytical rigor, I'm confident that Fiserv will continue to extend its reach, and sustain our leadership through 2024 and beyond. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] For our first question, we'll go to the line of David Togut from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. Good morning. Good to see the continued acceleration of Clover growth. I'll ask my question in the follow-up, both upfront. So first is a 4 PPT increase in the organic revenue growth guide for 2024, it looks like about three points of that relate specifically to an increase in Argentina inflation. So if that's correct, could you walk through how your operating organic revenue growth assumptions, have changed by segment versus the initial guide - at the November Investor Day? Thanks.\nRobert Hau: Yes, David, good morning. And your assessment is right on the mark. The total company organic revenue growth went up from back in November. We said 11% to 13%. We now expect 15% to 17%. We previously indicated the impact, the favorable impact of higher than normal interest and inflation in Argentina, would drive about six points of growth, to the Merchant segment, or about three points to the total company. We now expect that excess inflation and interest, is about seven points of growth, to the total company. So essentially, the growth - the increase in organic revenue growth, is really attributed, to higher inflation and interest expense, out of Argentina. The underlying, \"more normal organic growth\" of the Merchant segment and of the company remain consistent with what we expected and saw back in November. The other element, of course, as we talked about in November is, there is a natural counterbalance in our adjusted revenue, and in our income statement that higher excess inflation and interest rate, also drives a higher currency variation, or FX headwind. And that also increased about four points from the November. So net, our adjusted revenue, our EPS, our operating margins, very consistent, isolating out just that Argentina impact.\nDavid Togut: Thanks for that. And then just a quick follow-up. What are your expectations for Clover revenue growth in 2024? Would you expect continued acceleration? And then if so, any call-outs? I know, Frank, you mentioned Brazil rollout in April?\nRobert Hau: Yes. From a Clover standpoint, you saw the acceleration of revenue in the fourth quarter to 30%. We've talked quite a bit about the Clover growth rate, accelerating into our Investor Day commitment. Actually, both back in our March of 2022 call-out where we really focused in on Clover overall, where we gave an outlook to 2025. We updated that back in November to 2026. So adding another year of our outlook, we continue to believe, obviously, that we'll deliver against that $10 billion for the total company and $3.5 billion for Clover in 2025. And then $4.5 billion for Clover in 2026. We feel good about the trajectory. I wouldn't suggest that we're going to get 30% every single quarter, but there's a lot of elements that are driving that growth, and we feel good about the overall trajectory.\nFrank Bisignano: I would just say, we talked about Brazil. We've worked on that for a long time. You should expect us, to have further country rollouts. You heard us talk about - the Deutsche Bank JV Vert, which has begun to hit some strides and getting traction. You've always heard us talk about beginning to proliferate the ISV channel, and that fundamentally, there was nothing about our back book in that set of numbers, either of course we have done natural 90% new ad and some back book that just converts centrally. And I also would highlight the pen rate, is the number we talked about. We definitely were about growing ARPU, and you see that pen rate up at 19%, which kind of tracks exactly we'll be laying out to the path we believe we're on. So Clover continues to do its job. The distribution networks we have are unparalleled, and we're bringing more function into it, and more geography into it so David.\nDavid Togut: Thanks so much.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hi, thanks. Wanted to follow-on with David's question just on the merchant side with volume and transaction growth. The spread there is really still quite favorable, both total and with Clover. So looking out, should we expect some kind of cyclical mean reversion with that, tightening plus under this value-added services promotions, and you mentioned pricing as well. So, what can we assume there since we're all trying to do the benchmarking exercise? Thanks.\nRobert Hau: Yes, Tien-Tsin. I think certainly, we've continued to see that spread, between volume and revenue, and it's something that is actually part of our strategic plan to grow to that $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion in Clover and $10 billion to $12 billion for merchant by '25 and '26. I think ultimately what it comes down to is, as we continue to sell more software, more value-added services more additional capabilities, to our merchants. You're going to see revenue grow faster than volume. The spread will ebb and flow across different quarters, but we continue to see good opportunity to sell value-added services. That penetration reached 19% in the quarter, up about three, four points from a year ago, as we march towards the 27% by 2026. You'll continue to see great revenue growth overall. And certainly, there's the channel mix, more direct and ISV relative to where we are today, and that will continue to benefit that.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Right, right more retail stuff, that's good. Glad to hear revenue faster than volume. Just my quick follow-up, then just I mean Frank and Bob you both talked about a lot of good wins, across all the lines here. Just thinking about the outlook for new deal activity in 2024, should we expect, or do you see a lot of large deals, or is it more of a cross-selling wins with some of the new products? What do you see for this coming year here? Thank you.\nFrank Bisignano: Well I mean, I think it's all of the above. I mean, I suppose you might be also referring to those CashFlow Central wins we talked about, new product rollout, tremendous opportunity there. It's another area where we're helping out banks generate revenue, deliver better technology products, to their client base. And then we also believe that we have a lot of cross-sell opportunity, but we have a very large pipeline of just play on new wins. And you should expect us, to continue doing what we've been doing. And our expectation is we'll always do more.\nRobert Hau: And Tien-Tsin, the term cross-sell, is obviously something we use internally quite a bit. We talked to you folks about, ultimately, we have a very wide swath of clients. The U.S. bank deal that we announced this morning on CashFlow Central, that's a big transaction with a large bank, but it's a cross-sell. They are a large client of ours. They currently use CheckFree for their consumers. They'll now expand to CashFlow Central, for their businesses and merchants. And so, we'll continue to see lots of opportunities. It'll sometimes be, \"new logos\", but also selling additional capabilities to our existing client base.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Good, good, Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nDarrin Peller: Guys, thanks. It's great to see the merchant strength. I do want to touch on a couple of the other segments real quickly. And on the Fintech side, just to start, I know you expected tough comps, and you obviously called out the software license sales, to the ASP side impacting revenues. When we think about, what that means in terms of spreading out revenues, across a period of time now, in terms of more recurring revenues, maybe just help us understand your anticipation, for that segment again. I know you had initially raised the combined Payments in Fintech outlook a little bit when you had your Investor Day. So is that still on track? And if you could just revisit the drivers giving you confidence, really in both segments.\nRobert Hau: Yes, Darrin, good morning. So a couple of things. One, when we sign a license deal, typically that's a three or five-year license. You get a large license transaction. December is always a pretty high month for license activity, and you get ongoing maintenance, but license is certainly the big chunk. When you convert, or when a client instead goes to an ASP contract, you book that over the five-year period every single month. On a per account basis, or per transaction per user basis, depending on the product, and depending on the client contracting. We feel good. Ultimately, that's actually a better economic transaction for us. So, we like that transition. If you look at 2023's results and you combine the two bank and credit union facing segments, Fintech and payments and network, we did about 6% organic growth on a combined basis. If you look at our outlook for 2024, we reiterated what we said back in November. We expect that combined segment or the new segment financial solutions, which is largely a combination of the existing Fintech and payment, to be in that 5% to 7% range. And actually accelerate into 2025 and beyond up to 6% to 8%. So feel good about the overall growth of that business. The product portfolio, adding things like CashFlow Central, selling more payment solutions, benefits of Fintech as that goes live and gets deeper into the marketplace. We feel good about overall, our ability to continue to grow our capability selling into the banks and credit unions.\nDarrin Peller: Okay. That's helpful. And then just quick follow-up on the merchant side again. Frank, you've talked a lot about the VAS side having a big penetration opportunity up to the mid-20% plus range. I think you had a nice jump this quarter. So, maybe just touch on what drove that, combined with - if you think you have the right assets now, or there's a lot more chatter over potential for tuck-in's and M&A again this year as rates may change. So anything on the horizon for you guys? Thanks guys.\nFrank Bisignano: Yes. I mean, we really do like our hands across the Board in the company. You've seen us add things like Fintech, which I think really compliments our ability to compete anywhere, anyhow, along with DNA, which has really proved itself. If you go to a merchant business, we're still largely focused on building out more verticals. That would be retail and services and continuing to complement, what we're doing in Bento. I think - our software stack is strong and we're continuing to add functionality to it. We think our pen rate will continue, to do what we've forecasted. Obviously, we're always looking at opportunities to invest, as a minority investor and you've seen us do that and things like Bento and Fintech and others. Ondot, which ended up being in more than a thousand institutions, tagged to our mobility product to - give an unbelievable experience to a thousand banks. So I think we feel good about our hand. We're always looking at can we add software functionality, and you should expect us to continue, to be great stewards of capital deployment, as I hope you all feel we have been.\nDarrin Peller: Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line from Timothy Chiodo from UBS. Please go ahead.\nTimothy Chiodo: Thanks a lot for taking the question. You mentioned in the prepared remarks a little bit of channel mix shift for Clover. I was hoping you could provide some directional color broad strokes across the 2023 cohort, of new merchants, or volume that came on to Clover, whether it be just kind of order of magnitude across direct sales, bank partners, whether they be JV or non-JV. And then of course, wholesale and retail ISO. And I ask partially, because clearly the differentiation, is partially due to the distribution here, but also so that we could get a better sense, on the portion of revenues that are, hitting adjusted revenue versus, maybe being netted out, or coming below the line in the equity income line?\nRobert Hau: Yes, I think we tried to give pretty significant transparency around, the last part of that question with \"excess inflation\" in interest on in Argentina. Just as a side note, our LatAm business in Argentina business is a great business. Obviously, we've got this variation going on, on the \"excess\", but that's a tremendous business. LatAm overall growth in Clover as we bring Clover down to Brazil. We'll add Mexico later in the year. So, we feel very good about our overall capabilities there. To the first part of the question, I would say broadly we continue to expand our distribution capabilities. We have a long track record of ISO and ISV partners, bank channel partners. We have traditionally not had a big direct business. That continues to grow, but we also continue to grow pretty meaningfully in the ISV channels - with expansion of ISV capability into Clover. And having that Clover asset makes us a pretty significant partner of choice, not only for ISVs, but also the bank channels. We see growth there. As a percent of growth, our direct business, is probably growing the fastest, but a little bit of it's the smallest piece. It's the newest piece of the organization, but we're seeing good growth across the board.\nTimothy Chiodo: Excellent. Thank you for that.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Dan Dolev from Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.\nDan Dolev: Hi, guys. Great results here. My quick first question is on, again, back to the value-added services. Really impressive 40% growth. Can you maybe talk a little bit about the split in '23 between software and capital?\nRobert Hau: You're asking about 2023?\nDan Dolev: Yes, the 40% growth that you mentioned in '23.\nRobert Hau: So, I wouldn't necessarily have a split for you in my fingertips. So, we can look to get that for you. And I think - I would tell you that it's been pretty consistent. Obviously, we always have a relatively large software capital software spending, given the nature of our business, and I think that remains relatively consistent.\nFrank Bisignano: Dan, were you asking, if you look at the 40%, what component was largely software and what component was Clover capital? Was that the question you're asking?\nDan Dolev: Yes, exactly on the value-added service.\nFrank Bisignano: It's software dominated. I mean it would be, I'd call it, large majority software.\nRobert Hau: Sorry, I heard CapEx spending.\nDan Dolev: Oh, I'm sorry, yes, it's my Israeli accent.\nFrank Bisignano: That's okay.\nDan Dolev: No, it's really excellent.\nFrank Bisignano: That's why we got four years here.\nDan Dolev: And then just my quick follow-up, really impressed by the opportunities in Reg II. I mean, one of the networks commented that this was drag. I would imagine this is a big benefit for Fiserv. Can you maybe talk about the size the opportunity here for STAR and Accel?\nFrank Bisignano: Well, as I continue to say, we have been committed to debit network, STAR and Accel, their strategic assets within the company. As Reg II turns into reality. You've heard us talk about nearly 20 wins. Obviously, we compete at every level. There's fabulous competition out there for these transactions. But embedded in what we're looking at is, obviously more opportunity than we had before Reg II and the fact that some of those household names that, you heard like HelloFresh or Lyft, or others give us that opportunity. So, I think it's off to a decent start. It remains to be determined over the longer haul, but we feel good about the Reg II opportunity.\nDan Dolev: Amazing. Thank you so much.\nFrank Bisignano: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJason Kupferberg: Good morning, guys. I just wanted to follow-up on the Fintech segment and the dynamic you saw there, where you switched kind of from the - or the clients wanted to switch kind of from the license model to more the recurring ASP model. Do you see this as kind of a one-off development with a handful of clients? Is this a broader trend? Just anything you can give us maybe around where that segment sits now in terms of percentage of revenue that's kind of more periodic versus recurring and what you're projecting on that front going forward?\nFrank Bisignano: Yes. I think there's a series of factors. I'd go back on the full year 4%, with non-periodic revenue. And clearly, we ultimately sign a number of transactions, but they became ASP instead of license, which we thought we had visibility license. We also like to remind everybody that fourth quarter historically, is where fourth quarter in the last month is where these things happen and going down to the wire. Like it wouldn't any software sales, as I know, having been a large buyer of software for years and jobs I have done. So, I think that - it's not necessarily a trend, but it does have clients, and we saw it last year, too, in different ways. Clients who believe that given regulatory, given cyber, giving a series of factors. The ASP model will help their P&L, and their ability to perform better than the license would have. I think it's an institution-by-institution choice. It's not the first time we've seen it. And I think a lot remains to be determined.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay. Good color. Just on a separate note, we saw last month, Fiserv applied for a bank charter in Georgia. Can you just talk about the steps, potential time line to get that application approved, what the benefit to Fiserv would potentially be, whether that's on the cost side, or ability to provide additional solutions to merchants? Thanks.\nFrank Bisignano: Well, yes, let me bring pure clarity to what that is, because there's clearly lots of questions about why Fiserv is applying for a bank license. And obviously, before we did that, we talked to the ABA, we communicate to our clients. It's a very specific purpose license that allows for sponsorship of merchant acquiring. Historically, you needed a bank and that's within the Visa and MasterCard rules. And our ability to be able to have an institution for that sole purpose that will allow us, to be a sponsor for our own merchant acquiring in certain instances, will be valuable as we can control more of the outcome than we could before. Very specific purpose very clear to our banks. We're not competing with them. We have great bank partners, as you know, probably the largest bank portfolio in the world. When you take merchant business and all our other businesses, and where our business to help our banks grow. This ultimately supports our smaller banks, who do not have sponsorship and we can bring it. It became more, clear in the merger when we were able to cross-sell, to our community banks and others, which we would have not have that First Data that our ability them ourselves would be very valuable.\nJason Kupferberg: Thank you, Frank.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dave Koning from Baird. Please go ahead.\nDavid Koning: Yes. Hi, guys. Great year. And I guess my question on merchant. So you guided 25% to 28% organic. And then you talked about 14% benefit from FX and inflation. So, you're down to a core of kind of 11% to 14%, do both North America and international grow in that range, which presumably is taking quite a bit of share?\nRobert Hau: Yes. So the merchant business overall, obviously, good growth. Our international regions Europe, Latin America, APAC, all growing very nicely. EMEA larger than Latin America, growing a bit slower from an organic standpoint. Broadly our North American business, very high single-digit growth rate. And obviously, the international business is growing meaningfully higher than that given the size of the business and the opportunity to continue to grow and add merchants and sell more services there also. But good business, most definitely in all four regions.\nDavid Koning: Got you. And just a quick follow-up. FX losses, will you not add those back again through 2024? I know Q4 seems like the anomaly, you won't add those back. And maybe how big do you expect that to be an interest expense in 2024?\nRobert Hau: Yes. So let me be - make sure we're clear. What we adjusted out was actually not fourth quarter, not December, it was December 12. It was the one day devaluation that the new President of Argentina, put into place to a - little more than a 50% deval, and it was only the impact of revaluing the balance sheet, which in most currencies stays on the balance sheet. But because Argentina is hyperinflation, or highly inflationary, the accounting rules require you to revalue the balance sheet through the income statement. We did that every day of 2022. We did it every day of 2023, with the exception of the one-time significant transact, or significant move that, we felt was really non-normal course, non-operational. So, we dialed that piece out only. All of the other 364 days went through the income statement. And in fact, were larger than what we took in that one day. We have that that will occur in 2024. Obviously, if there's other - another significant deval, we may evaluate that. We're not anticipating that. We think things are \"more stabilizing\" in Argentina remains to be seen. It's a unique economy. We've got some great leadership down there, that are running our Latin America business that have been through these cycles multiple times, over decades of leadership. So, we feel very good about being able to handle, the kind of ongoing normal things. This one-time one-day deval is what we dialed out.\nDavid Koning: Got you. Thanks, guys. Great job.\nRobert Hau: Thank you.\nOperator: And for our final question, we'll go to the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Please go ahead.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Thank you. Hi Frank, hi Bob. I guess my question is, with regards to the cadence of segment revenues and segment margins, what should we expect through the year? Because there are, I think, a couple of factors at least with regards to how, I guess, Argentina impact plays out? Does it reduce through the course of the year? And then Carat, I would imagine, much better back half of the year, because the lack of comp, tough comp, factors like that. I mean, how should we think of cadence through the course of the year?\nRobert Hau: Yes. I think, first off, broadly, across the company. I don't see a big variation from quarter-to-quarter or first half to second half. There are obviously some specific comparisons within individual segments, or individual margins. But broadly, generally in line across the board with the one nuance in our merchant acceptance business. I would expect organic revenue, to be higher in the first half of the year than in the second half of the year. Because we do anticipate, some improvement in interest rates and inflation in the second half relative, to what's going on there, as the economy deals with some of the things that the government is putting in place hopefully with their expectation that, they ease inflation and interest rates remains to be seen. But of course, that's offset by FX. So on an adjusted revenue basis, from a margin standpoint and EPS, relatively stable. The other thing I would just reiterate, we talked a bit about it in our prepared remarks. Cash flow will definitely have some variation with tailwinds in the second half of the year after some headwinds in the first half. But again, we have a good degree of confidence in the $4.5 billion for the full year.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Got it. And then the quick follow-up is Fiserv's small business index, I guess, how indicative is it, of the health of Fiserv's own client base? And can you comment, generally speaking, on small business health? It seemed to me like your economic assumptions call for more or less a soft landing, but I just want to clarify.\nRobert Hau: Yes. First off, the latter part, yes, I would agree. We are anticipating, I think, like the rest of the world at this point, a soft landing things seem to be on track for that. A bit softer macro environment, modestly slower GDP in 2024. The FSBI is based upon a very broad set of data that we have across our company that we then extrapolate to the entire U.S. market. So, it is not a direct indication of Fiserv activity. If there are differences in region mix of - we're very strong in restaurant. We might have more restaurants than, we do nail salons, or so we go through the NAICS codes across the country, different industry weightings, different regions. When we take our data and extrapolate it, across the U.S. So it's very much a very real-time indicator of the health of small businesses. Now relative to our performance, we're the largest merchant acquirer in the country. So, if there's variation in the FSBI, you're likely to see variation in Fiserv's results relative to some nuances of different regions, industry weightings, et cetera. But certainly, a strong FSBI indicator index would be good for us, a weaker index would be a headwind for us. We're actually quite proud of that capability not only is it using all of the data we have, by the way, including cash transactions, which obviously, don't manifest themselves in our numbers for merchant acquiring, but we have the data, and it's very real time. We're able to provide that information two days after the month ends. It's not a perfect proxy, but it's a proxy.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Got it. Thank you for all the information.\nRobert Hau: Thanks.\nFrank Bisignano: Well, thank you, everyone, for your attention today. Please feel free to reach out to IR team with any questions. And have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you all for participating in the Fiserv fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. That concludes today's call. Please disconnect at this time, and have a great rest of your day.",

            "name": "Frank Bisignano",
            "content": "Thank you, Julie, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss another double-digit growth year for Fiserv in both organic revenue and adjusted earnings per share. In 2023, we continue to demonstrate our leadership as proven by our financial performance. 12% organic revenue growth, more than 200 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion, 16% growth in adjusted earnings per share, $4 billion of free cash flow and $4.7 billion return to our shareholders through share repurchase. These results are possible because Fiserv possesses a set of assets that's unparalleled in our industry. From our vast and diverse client base, product portfolio and distribution network, to technology and capital resources, to a deep bench empowered with strategic vision and operational excellence. This combination of assets is how we plan to sustain strong performance. A fundamental aspect of our culture is that we are not satisfied and we continue to push for more. We know that great opportunity remains for continued revenue growth and improved productivity. We laid out several growth strategies at our investor conference in November and we are executing on those every day. At the same time, we continue to identify ways to drive further productivity. Five years ago, we announced the plan to merge First Data in Fiserv. Today, we are a 4.5 year-old company with a 38-year track record of double digit adjusted earnings per share growth. Under our new structure, half of our company, Merchant Solutions, is a leader in the high growth payments market where SMBs and enterprises are embracing the benefits of an operating system with seamless integration of value-added solutions. The other half, financial solutions is a leader in the high recurring revenue financial IT software and services market, helping small and medium sized financial institutions level the playing field with larger banks and helping larger banks migrate to next generation technology. This combination of growth and consistency has served us well. And our business model is even more compelling at the intersection of these two businesses. We continue to see strong opportunity to cross sell and integrate merchant and financial solutions to help financial institutions better serve their merchant customers and enable merchants to retain customers with new financial services offerings. Fiserv is unique in its positioning at the center of these two important ecosystems. Let's take a step back and review our 2023 results. They highlight another important aspect of our culture, delivering on our commitments. In late 2020, we set formidable financial and operational targets for the subsequent three years. We delivered on those and more. For 2023, we started with organic revenue growth guidance of 7% to 9% and delivered 12%. We started with a goal of at least 125 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement and delivered 220 basis points. And we started with adjusted EPS guidance of $7.25 to $7.40 or 12 to 14% growth. And we delivered $7.52 or 16% growth. In the fourth quarter, we achieved organic revenue growth of 12% and adjusted operating margin of 40.7% up 150 basis points from fourth quarter 2022, which itself was an exceptionally strong quarter. Our adjusted earnings per share of $2.19 was ahead of expectations on the strength of our merchant revenue and payments margin. Free cash flow was also very strong at $1.3 billion. And we repurchased 8.6 million shares, ending the year with 5% fewer average diluted shares outstanding than last year. Our Merchant Acceptance segment generated organic revenue growth of 24% and 19% in the quarter and full year, respectively, exceeding our expectations at the start of the year. Clover revenue growth accelerated 30% in the quarter as SMBs remained healthy and restaurants in particular continuing to outperform. Our distribution partners globally continued to embrace our platform. Value-added solutions revenue grew more than 40% in 2023 to end the year at a 19% penetration rate. Carat's revenue growth rebounded to 11% in the quarter or 15%, excluding the client that took processing in-house mid last year. Growth was driven by the ramp of recent wins by key clients, which has continued into this year. We expanded our global acquiring capability by adding India's UPI and Japan's JCB as payment methods for clients in more than 35 markets. In the energy sector, we complemented our leadership position with a new deal to provide seamless unattended payment experiences for drivers using one of the country's largest networks of charging stations. Outside the U.S., we were pleased to have signed several new deals in EMEA during Q4 and into January. They included a major new merchant acquiring relationship with a leading apparel and equipment retailer and a renewal and extension of business with a leading QSR. Additionally, our Vert joint venture with Deutsche Bank is now beginning to hit its stride with accelerated Clover merchant sign-ups. In Asia-Pac, we signed a new merchant acquiring deal with Vistara, a domestic airline in India and went live with more payout options for consumers in the region. In Latin America, we continue to ramp up merchant acquiring in Brazil for CaixaBank, along with payment acceptance at its BillPay outlets. We've laid the groundwork to support more fee-based PIX transactions for our merchant clients with the acquisition of SLED in Q4. SLED is a software solutions company that will allow Fiserv to operate as a direct payment service provider, expanding our reach into the full PIX instant payments universe. In April, we will be rolling out Clover, which we expect to further advance our leading position in Brazil. In Argentina, we're building on our 4-year Clover lead with acceleration in new merchant growth. With more Clover merchants engaging in more anticipation activity, our growth in Argentina continues beyond the macro factors of high inflation and interest rates. The payment segment achieved the top end of its medium-term guidance range with 4% organic revenue growth in the quarter and 8% for the year. We added nearly 20 large e-commerce merchants to our debit network, STAR and Accel, in the wake of Reg II, including eBay and HelloFresh in Q4 and Uber, Lyft and others earlier in the year. Several of these are new clients to Fiserv. In 2023, we signed well over 200 of our financial institution clients to our NOW Network to expand their payment routes to include FedNow for real-time payments. In BillPay, the bill and directory behind our market-leading consumer BillPay business is proving valuable in the SMB space as we complete the build-out of our new small business accounts receivable and payable offering, cash flow essential. We won our first client in the fourth quarter, Washington Federal Bank, with $23 billion in assets. And just last week, Fiserv expanded its long-standing digital money movement relationship with U.S. Bank to now include cash flow essential. These two important wins came just a few months after formally announcing the product. The pipeline is growing rapidly with strong interest and demand from financial institutions, including many of the largest. At our investor conference, we talked about value-added solutions and new verticals in our issuing business. We made significant progress on both during 2023 and early Q1. One of our value-added services, an AI-based fraud prevention tool called Advanced Defense, grew volume nearly 5x over 2022. Now, Synchrony is in the process of upgrading to Advanced Defense across its portfolio of more than 70 million accounts. We're excited to be rolling out the California Employment Development Department plan for our Money Network prepaid cards. This largest-of-its-kind state program for unemployment and other benefits will go live later this month. We have a pipeline of other opportunities in the government sector to deliver on our strategy to grow in this vertical. This also extends to healthcare, where we converted a significant portion of Health Equity's card portfolio onto our platform in the fourth quarter, with the remainder scheduled for later this year. In EMEA, we signed our first global OpenFX issuer deal with Absa, one of Africa's largest diversified financial services groups. This new currency solution enables issuers to take control of their FX, mitigate FX exposure and bring more value to their cardholders. With Truworths, one of the leading retailers in South Africa, we upgraded to a VisionPLUS license, attaching more value-added solutions. In Asia-Pac, we added a new India issuer processing client, Equitas Small Finance Bank. They will launch their retail and corporate card programs using our FirstVision India processing hub, with a full-stack offering that includes UPI, loyalty, offers, and real-time fraud management. The FinTech segment recorded a 1% decline in organic revenue for the quarter and a 2% increase for the full year. Organic growth excluding periodic revenue for the year was 4%. While we knew we had a very difficult comparison with high periodic revenue in Q4 '22, we had visibility to achieve our growth goal. In large part from the level of client engagement we saw at Forum, our client conference in June. And those discussions continued. Separately, the pace of new core wins remains healthy at 12 in Q4, and clients are demonstrating two important trends. First, they are migrating from one Fiserv core operating system to another. A positive sign that they are finding the answers to their changing needs right here within the Fiserv portfolio. Second, while M&A activity among financial institutions slowed in 2023, we believe that M&A activity is good for us, as we can compete at any level with any institution without platforms and it creates an opportunity to provide more services to the combined institution. Prosperity Bank, a Texas-based regional bank with $38.5 billion in assets, decided in Q4 to migrate to our cloud-enabled DNA platform and signed up for our CardHub value-added solution. Old National Bank, a $49 billion bank in Indiana, is a core system client that has been growing with us as it has been making acquisitions. And we continue to grow our relationship with Old National in the fourth quarter with the addition of debit processing, Accel, CardHub, and other value-added solutions. These are also two examples of our financial technology segment clients buying our value-added solutions in the payment segment. This ongoing trend of clients buying services across these two segments is a key reason why we are creating a single new segment, Financial Solutions. Turning to the outlook for 2024, we expect total company organic revenue growth of 15% to 17%, inclusive of an estimated 7 points of growth from excess revenue in Argentina, driven by significantly higher inflation and interest in the Argentina merchant business, following the government's steep peso devaluation in mid-December. We expect continued margin improvement in 2024 with at least 100 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion. And adjusted earnings per share should grow 14% to 16%, reaching $8.55 to $8.70. This adjusted EPS growth outlook is in the middle of the range we provided at our investor conference in November, and it's meant to be a prudent reflection of the macroeconomic outlook. Economist consensus calls for U.S. personal consumption growth and consumer savings to be lower in 2024, creating a modest headwind to the merchant business. Against a potentially softer backdrop, we remain confident in our ability to grow Clover and Carat as we add more merchants, sell more to existing clients and add to our portfolio and penetration of value-added solutions. Our discussions with banks and credit unions indicate that they remain poised to spend to retain and grow deposits. We are meeting their changing needs every day with our operating system approach that offers the most integrated platforms and broadest suite of value-added solutions in the business. We are encouraged by our newest financial solutions initiatives in SMB payments with Cashflow Central, our new integrated digital banking platform experience digital and the power of Finxact to win over larger banks and existing clients. We expect all of these to ramp over the course of 2024 and set the stage for stronger growth in subsequent years. To summarize, our outlook for 2024 is positive as we anticipate another year of double-digit organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings per share as well as strong adjusted operating margin expansion. Our optimism for sustained growth level is tempered only by the economic backdrop of modestly slower GDP growth and geopolitical tensions. We remain confident in our ability to control our growth trajectory at the top and bottom lines through our strong positioning, innovation, good stewardship of capital and plain hard work. We rely on our resilient business model with its diverse client mix serving non-discretionary spending categories and our high recurring revenue to continue investing at a pace that supports our competitive strengths. For more details on our financial results, I'll pass the discussion on to Bob. Thanks, Bob. I'd like to spend a few minutes highlighting Fiserv's commitment to corporate social responsibility, which we align with business operations and employee engagement to maximize impact. Our next CSR report will be published in the second quarter and will demonstrate continued development of our employee resource groups, the Fiserv Cares Foundation, and our back-to-business program that awards grants to small businesses. To better serve our minority depository institution clients and their communities, we formed an MDI Advisory Council, which includes eight clients and other members. The council in part of our efforts to better collaborate and deliver value through our MDI clients and the communities they serve. Institutional Investor recognized Fiserv for its CSR efforts as the top ESG performer in the payments, processing and IT services sector, a first for the company. Our programmatic efforts earned recognition from prestigious indices like Bloomberg's Gender-Equality Index and the Human Rights Campaign's Equality Index. We also ranked number 1 on the Military Times Best for Vets Employers list. And just last week, we were named one of Fortune's World's Most Admired Companies for 2024, marking the 9th time in 10 years that we received this honorable distinction. While we scored highly in many categories, among the highest was innovation. We are particularly proud of this category recognition as well as other standouts for people leadership, product and service quality, global competitiveness and long-term investment value. As we look ahead to what's coming in 2024, the ongoing advancement of AI is not driven solely by the expanding capabilities of technology but also by the underlying proliferation of data to feed that generative engine. For Fiserv, our data and AI-powered intelligence put us on a path to be an effective user and enabler of AI. We're in the early innings of using it to optimize our own operations and deliver actionable insights for our clients as well with significant benefits to come in quality, productivity and growth. Fiserv already manages one of the most valuable information stores in the industry and we start from a position of strength based simply on the sheer amount of data that runs through our systems each year. Over $4 trillion of payment volume globally across more than six million merchant locations, plus 1.6 billion card accounts on file, 325 million deposit loan accounts and 20 million BillPay users across nearly 10,000 financial institutions. The power of our data fueling AI applications is already helping us throughout our business in areas such as enhanced customer service, analytics on the Clover and Carat dashboards and fraud mitigation tools. Let me share with you three ways we are turning data into an increasingly potent AI asset. First, we're creating better service and insights for our clients by helping them harness data in actionable ways. As an example, 85% of technical service calls were resolved unassisted through the use of data and AI with high client satisfaction rates. Additionally, over the last year, more than two million of the highest-level technical support inquiries resolved online through AI assisted learning. Second, we're embedding our data and AI capabilities into value-added solutions such as Advance Defense being used to combat fraud and other security risks. And third, we're packaging our rich data assets to build next-gen products. Earlier this year, for instance, we launched the Fiserv Small Business Index, a real-time assessment of consumer spending at SMBs published monthly, enabling new valuable insights for financial institutions, policymakers, investors and businesses of all sizes. Bob discussed, the results of our January index, which we released on February 2, making it an extremely timely measure of the current environment. As Bob and I like to say, intellectual honesty with analytical rigor is, how we run the company. Data is the enabler for us to apply this in all that we do, serving our clients, choosing our partners, assessing our competition, prioritizing our investments, understanding our performance, and communicating it to investors. With the many assets, I discussed on this call, including our data, along with our dedicated associates worldwide, adopting as fundamental practice of intellectual honesty with analytical rigor, I'm confident that Fiserv will continue to extend its reach, and sustain our leadership through 2024 and beyond. With that, operator, please open the line for questions. I would just say, we talked about Brazil. We've worked on that for a long time. You should expect us, to have further country rollouts. You heard us talk about - the Deutsche Bank JV Vert, which has begun to hit some strides and getting traction. You've always heard us talk about beginning to proliferate the ISV channel, and that fundamentally, there was nothing about our back book in that set of numbers, either of course we have done natural 90% new ad and some back book that just converts centrally. And I also would highlight the pen rate, is the number we talked about. We definitely were about growing ARPU, and you see that pen rate up at 19%, which kind of tracks exactly we'll be laying out to the path we believe we're on. So Clover continues to do its job. The distribution networks we have are unparalleled, and we're bringing more function into it, and more geography into it so David. Well I mean, I think it's all of the above. I mean, I suppose you might be also referring to those CashFlow Central wins we talked about, new product rollout, tremendous opportunity there. It's another area where we're helping out banks generate revenue, deliver better technology products, to their client base. And then we also believe that we have a lot of cross-sell opportunity, but we have a very large pipeline of just play on new wins. And you should expect us, to continue doing what we've been doing. And our expectation is we'll always do more. Yes. I mean, we really do like our hands across the Board in the company. You've seen us add things like Fintech, which I think really compliments our ability to compete anywhere, anyhow, along with DNA, which has really proved itself. If you go to a merchant business, we're still largely focused on building out more verticals. That would be retail and services and continuing to complement, what we're doing in Bento. I think - our software stack is strong and we're continuing to add functionality to it. We think our pen rate will continue, to do what we've forecasted. Obviously, we're always looking at opportunities to invest, as a minority investor and you've seen us do that and things like Bento and Fintech and others. Ondot, which ended up being in more than a thousand institutions, tagged to our mobility product to - give an unbelievable experience to a thousand banks. So I think we feel good about our hand. We're always looking at can we add software functionality, and you should expect us to continue, to be great stewards of capital deployment, as I hope you all feel we have been. Dan, were you asking, if you look at the 40%, what component was largely software and what component was Clover capital? Was that the question you're asking? It's software dominated. I mean it would be, I'd call it, large majority software. That's okay. That's why we got four years here. Well, as I continue to say, we have been committed to debit network, STAR and Accel, their strategic assets within the company. As Reg II turns into reality. You've heard us talk about nearly 20 wins. Obviously, we compete at every level. There's fabulous competition out there for these transactions. But embedded in what we're looking at is, obviously more opportunity than we had before Reg II and the fact that some of those household names that, you heard like HelloFresh or Lyft, or others give us that opportunity. So, I think it's off to a decent start. It remains to be determined over the longer haul, but we feel good about the Reg II opportunity. Thank you. Yes. I think there's a series of factors. I'd go back on the full year 4%, with non-periodic revenue. And clearly, we ultimately sign a number of transactions, but they became ASP instead of license, which we thought we had visibility license. We also like to remind everybody that fourth quarter historically, is where fourth quarter in the last month is where these things happen and going down to the wire. Like it wouldn't any software sales, as I know, having been a large buyer of software for years and jobs I have done. So, I think that - it's not necessarily a trend, but it does have clients, and we saw it last year, too, in different ways. Clients who believe that given regulatory, given cyber, giving a series of factors. The ASP model will help their P&L, and their ability to perform better than the license would have. I think it's an institution-by-institution choice. It's not the first time we've seen it. And I think a lot remains to be determined. Well, yes, let me bring pure clarity to what that is, because there's clearly lots of questions about why Fiserv is applying for a bank license. And obviously, before we did that, we talked to the ABA, we communicate to our clients. It's a very specific purpose license that allows for sponsorship of merchant acquiring. Historically, you needed a bank and that's within the Visa and MasterCard rules. And our ability to be able to have an institution for that sole purpose that will allow us, to be a sponsor for our own merchant acquiring in certain instances, will be valuable as we can control more of the outcome than we could before. Very specific purpose very clear to our banks. We're not competing with them. We have great bank partners, as you know, probably the largest bank portfolio in the world. When you take merchant business and all our other businesses, and where our business to help our banks grow. This ultimately supports our smaller banks, who do not have sponsorship and we can bring it. It became more, clear in the merger when we were able to cross-sell, to our community banks and others, which we would have not have that First Data that our ability them ourselves would be very valuable. Well, thank you, everyone, for your attention today. Please feel free to reach out to IR team with any questions. And have a great day."

            "name": "Robert Hau",
            "content": "Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. If you're following along on our slides, I'll additional cover details on total company and segment performance, starting with our financial metrics and trends on Slide 4. Fourth quarter and full year results reflected our focus on delivering on our commitments with momentum across the business. Total company organic revenue growth was 12% in the quarter with ongoing strength in our Merchant Acceptance and payments and network segments, offset by a decline in the Fintech segment against a very difficult compare. For the full year, total company organic revenue also grew 12% ahead of the guidance we provided in October and November. This performance was led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 19%. Fourth quarter total company adjusted revenue grew 6% to $4.6 billion and adjusted operating income grew 10% to $1.9 billion, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 40.7%, an increase of 150 basis points versus the prior year and a sequential improvement of 260 basis points. The 40.7% represents a post-merger high for Fiserv. Our fourth quarter performance brought the full year adjusted operating margin to 37.3%, an increase of 220 basis points over 2022. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 15% to $2.19 compared to $1.91 in the prior year. Full year adjusted earnings per share increased 16% to $7.52. Those adjusted EPS results do not include $0.12 per share in expense relating to the significant devaluation of the Argentine peso as part of the government reform package on December 12 last year. This one-day move led to a non-operating, non-cash foreign exchange loss for the revaluation of our local balance sheet as required under GAAP rules for hyperinflation accounting. All other Argentine foreign exchange losses throughout 2023 are included in the adjusted EPS results. Free cash flow came in at $1.3 billion for the quarter and $4 billion for the full year, an increase of 14% over last year. Now looking to our segment results starting on Slide 6. Organic revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was 24% in the quarter and 19% for the full year, well ahead of our previous medium-term segment guidance of 9% to 12%. This includes an 8 point benefit to the full year organic growth from the transitory revenue driven by above-average interest and inflation in Argentina. Adjusted revenue growth was 14% in the quarter and 12% for the full year. You can see from the spread between organic and adjusted revenue growth that currency headwinds from the devaluation of the Argentine peso offset the benefit of the country's very high inflation and interest for the full year in adjusted revenue. Global merchant volume and transactions in the quarter grew 5% and 8%, excluding wholesale processing respectively. Clover revenue grew 30% in the fourth quarter, an annualized payment volume growth of 17%. For the full year, Clover revenue was up 25%. The spread between revenue and volume growth comes from higher penetration of value-added solutions, channel mix shifts and some pricing. VAS penetration reached 19% in Q4, up from 16% in the year-ago period and on pace to meet our 27% target by 2026. Carat also had a strong quarter with revenue growing 11%. For the year, Carat revenue grew 9%, excluding the loss of a Latin American processing client that moved in-house. Revenue growth was 15% for both the quarter and the year. Adjusted operating income in the Merchant Acceptance segment increased 26% to $819 million in the quarter, with margin up 400 basis points to 38.8%. Full year adjusted operating income improved 23% to $2.9 billion and margin grew 330 basis points to 35.1%. Over the last couple of quarters, some of you have noted that our revenue includes anticipation in LatAm, but the cost of that anticipation interest is not included in operating margin, as it is reported as interest expense below the operating income line on the income statement. If we were to take that interest from anticipation and pro forma it back to operating income, merchant margins would still have expanded a very strong 220 basis points for the quarter and 260 basis points for the year. Looking at 2024, January's overall volume growth, excluding processing, was similar to December's pace. Difficult weather throughout large portions of the U.S. did slow volume growth for a 2-week period in mid-January, but we've seen clear improvement in volume growth since then. The Fiserv Small Business Index also points to steady spending and a healthy environment for small businesses in January. We reported the index on February 2, with a value of 138, representing year-over-year growth of 1.7% and one-tenth of 1% growth from December on a seasonally adjusted basis. The Fiserv Small Business Index measures U.S. small business activity and is not a direct indicator of Fiserv results, but rather a measure of general pace of activity and health of this key Fiserv client base. Turning to Slide 7, on the payments and network segment. Organic revenue grew 4% in the quarter. This growth was enabled by a variety of drivers across our business lines. We have well over 200 financial institutions live or implementing FedNow and saw continued strength in Zelle, with transactions and number of clients growing at 44% and 23%, respectively for the quarter. Full-year organic revenue growth of 8% was at the upper end of our medium-term outlook range of 5% to 8%. Fourth quarter adjusted operating income for the segment was up 8% to $877 million and margin was up 250 basis points to 51%, driven by operating leverage and some third-party productivity we had been working on throughout the year that came in through the fourth quarter. For the full year, adjusted operating income was up 13% to $3.2 billion and margin expanded 250 basis points to 47.8%. Moving to Slide 8, in the financial technology segment. We posted a 1% organic revenue decline for the quarter and 2% growth for the full year. Organic revenue, excluding periodic revenue, grew 4% for the full year, and client momentum continued with 12 core wins in the quarter, reaching 42 wins for the year. We had expected some strong license sales in the quarter to reach the bottom end of our full-year guidance, but in several cases, these did not materialize as clients instead chose our application service provider, or ASP model. This is where we host the software in our data centers instead of clients purchasing their own software licenses. It had the effect of lowering in-quarter revenue in Q4 and instead spreading it out as monthly payments over multiple years. Adjusted operating income was down 11% in the quarter to $303 million and flat at $1.2 billion for the year. Adjusted operating margin in the segment decreased 340 basis points to 37.9% in the quarter. Full-year margin increased 10 basis points to 36.6% with the lower periodic revenue. The corporate adjusted operating loss was $110 million in the quarter and $494 million for the full year. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 18.7% and was 19.3% for the year. We expect the 2024 adjusted effective tax rate will be approximately 20% for the full year. Total debt outstanding was $23.1 billion on December 31st. The debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio dropped another tenth of a turn to 2.7 times within our target leverage range. We have approximately 10% of our debt in variable rate instruments. During the quarter, we repurchased 8.6 million shares for $1 billion, bringing our total 2023 share repurchase to $4.7 billion and nearly $10 billion in the last three years. The diluted average share count fell 5% from 2022 levels. We have 52 million shares remaining authorized for share repurchase at the end of the quarter. Our longstanding capital allocation strategy will continue in 2024, defined by a strong balance sheet, share repurchases and complementary and innovative acquisitions. Turning to Slide 9. As Frank said earlier, we expect organic revenue growth of 15% to 17%, with adjusted operating margin expansion of more than 100 basis points. This translates to adjusted earnings per share of $8.55 to $8.70 or 14% to 16% growth over 2023 and would represent our 39th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. In Merchant Solutions, we anticipate organic revenue growth in the 25% to 28% range, including 14 percentage points of transitory revenue growth in Argentina. This is higher than the outlook given at our investor conference in November due to the effects of the steep devaluation of the Argentine peso mid-December. For Financial Solutions, we continue to expect 5% to 7% organic revenue growth this year. We continue to estimate approximately $4.5 billion of free cash flow for 2024. In the second half of 2023, we launched a new initiative to purchase green tax credits where we buy tax credits at a discount from companies who earned but cannot use them. This reduces the net cash tax paid and in many cases defers the cash payment by a quarter or two. A recent new rule codified this practice for 10 years, so we expect to continue to benefit from it. This will bring more variability to our quarterly cash flows. In 2024, there will be a headwind in the first quarter and first half when we paid for the credits and a tailwind in the second half when some of the tax refunds are received. While we do anticipate some shifts in timing, we continue to expect full year free cash flow of approximately $4.5 billion. With that, let me turn the call back to Frank for some closing remarks. Yes, David, good morning. And your assessment is right on the mark. The total company organic revenue growth went up from back in November. We said 11% to 13%. We now expect 15% to 17%. We previously indicated the impact, the favorable impact of higher than normal interest and inflation in Argentina, would drive about six points of growth, to the Merchant segment, or about three points to the total company. We now expect that excess inflation and interest, is about seven points of growth, to the total company. So essentially, the growth - the increase in organic revenue growth, is really attributed, to higher inflation and interest expense, out of Argentina. The underlying, \"more normal organic growth\" of the Merchant segment and of the company remain consistent with what we expected and saw back in November. The other element, of course, as we talked about in November is, there is a natural counterbalance in our adjusted revenue, and in our income statement that higher excess inflation and interest rate, also drives a higher currency variation, or FX headwind. And that also increased about four points from the November. So net, our adjusted revenue, our EPS, our operating margins, very consistent, isolating out just that Argentina impact. Yes. From a Clover standpoint, you saw the acceleration of revenue in the fourth quarter to 30%. We've talked quite a bit about the Clover growth rate, accelerating into our Investor Day commitment. Actually, both back in our March of 2022 call-out where we really focused in on Clover overall, where we gave an outlook to 2025. We updated that back in November to 2026. So adding another year of our outlook, we continue to believe, obviously, that we'll deliver against that $10 billion for the total company and $3.5 billion for Clover in 2025. And then $4.5 billion for Clover in 2026. We feel good about the trajectory. I wouldn't suggest that we're going to get 30% every single quarter, but there's a lot of elements that are driving that growth, and we feel good about the overall trajectory. Yes, Tien-Tsin. I think certainly, we've continued to see that spread, between volume and revenue, and it's something that is actually part of our strategic plan to grow to that $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion in Clover and $10 billion to $12 billion for merchant by '25 and '26. I think ultimately what it comes down to is, as we continue to sell more software, more value-added services more additional capabilities, to our merchants. You're going to see revenue grow faster than volume. The spread will ebb and flow across different quarters, but we continue to see good opportunity to sell value-added services. That penetration reached 19% in the quarter, up about three, four points from a year ago, as we march towards the 27% by 2026. You'll continue to see great revenue growth overall. And certainly, there's the channel mix, more direct and ISV relative to where we are today, and that will continue to benefit that. And Tien-Tsin, the term cross-sell, is obviously something we use internally quite a bit. We talked to you folks about, ultimately, we have a very wide swath of clients. The U.S. bank deal that we announced this morning on CashFlow Central, that's a big transaction with a large bank, but it's a cross-sell. They are a large client of ours. They currently use CheckFree for their consumers. They'll now expand to CashFlow Central, for their businesses and merchants. And so, we'll continue to see lots of opportunities. It'll sometimes be, \"new logos\", but also selling additional capabilities to our existing client base. Yes, Darrin, good morning. So a couple of things. One, when we sign a license deal, typically that's a three or five-year license. You get a large license transaction. December is always a pretty high month for license activity, and you get ongoing maintenance, but license is certainly the big chunk. When you convert, or when a client instead goes to an ASP contract, you book that over the five-year period every single month. On a per account basis, or per transaction per user basis, depending on the product, and depending on the client contracting. We feel good. Ultimately, that's actually a better economic transaction for us. So, we like that transition. If you look at 2023's results and you combine the two bank and credit union facing segments, Fintech and payments and network, we did about 6% organic growth on a combined basis. If you look at our outlook for 2024, we reiterated what we said back in November. We expect that combined segment or the new segment financial solutions, which is largely a combination of the existing Fintech and payment, to be in that 5% to 7% range. And actually accelerate into 2025 and beyond up to 6% to 8%. So feel good about the overall growth of that business. The product portfolio, adding things like CashFlow Central, selling more payment solutions, benefits of Fintech as that goes live and gets deeper into the marketplace. We feel good about overall, our ability to continue to grow our capability selling into the banks and credit unions. Yes, I think we tried to give pretty significant transparency around, the last part of that question with \"excess inflation\" in interest on in Argentina. Just as a side note, our LatAm business in Argentina business is a great business. Obviously, we've got this variation going on, on the \"excess\", but that's a tremendous business. LatAm overall growth in Clover as we bring Clover down to Brazil. We'll add Mexico later in the year. So, we feel very good about our overall capabilities there. To the first part of the question, I would say broadly we continue to expand our distribution capabilities. We have a long track record of ISO and ISV partners, bank channel partners. We have traditionally not had a big direct business. That continues to grow, but we also continue to grow pretty meaningfully in the ISV channels - with expansion of ISV capability into Clover. And having that Clover asset makes us a pretty significant partner of choice, not only for ISVs, but also the bank channels. We see growth there. As a percent of growth, our direct business, is probably growing the fastest, but a little bit of it's the smallest piece. It's the newest piece of the organization, but we're seeing good growth across the board. You're asking about 2023? So, I wouldn't necessarily have a split for you in my fingertips. So, we can look to get that for you. And I think - I would tell you that it's been pretty consistent. Obviously, we always have a relatively large software capital software spending, given the nature of our business, and I think that remains relatively consistent. Sorry, I heard CapEx spending. Yes. So the merchant business overall, obviously, good growth. Our international regions Europe, Latin America, APAC, all growing very nicely. EMEA larger than Latin America, growing a bit slower from an organic standpoint. Broadly our North American business, very high single-digit growth rate. And obviously, the international business is growing meaningfully higher than that given the size of the business and the opportunity to continue to grow and add merchants and sell more services there also. But good business, most definitely in all four regions. Yes. So let me be - make sure we're clear. What we adjusted out was actually not fourth quarter, not December, it was December 12. It was the one day devaluation that the new President of Argentina, put into place to a - little more than a 50% deval, and it was only the impact of revaluing the balance sheet, which in most currencies stays on the balance sheet. But because Argentina is hyperinflation, or highly inflationary, the accounting rules require you to revalue the balance sheet through the income statement. We did that every day of 2022. We did it every day of 2023, with the exception of the one-time significant transact, or significant move that, we felt was really non-normal course, non-operational. So, we dialed that piece out only. All of the other 364 days went through the income statement. And in fact, were larger than what we took in that one day. We have that that will occur in 2024. Obviously, if there's other - another significant deval, we may evaluate that. We're not anticipating that. We think things are \"more stabilizing\" in Argentina remains to be seen. It's a unique economy. We've got some great leadership down there, that are running our Latin America business that have been through these cycles multiple times, over decades of leadership. So, we feel very good about being able to handle, the kind of ongoing normal things. This one-time one-day deval is what we dialed out. Thank you. Yes. I think, first off, broadly, across the company. I don't see a big variation from quarter-to-quarter or first half to second half. There are obviously some specific comparisons within individual segments, or individual margins. But broadly, generally in line across the board with the one nuance in our merchant acceptance business. I would expect organic revenue, to be higher in the first half of the year than in the second half of the year. Because we do anticipate, some improvement in interest rates and inflation in the second half relative, to what's going on there, as the economy deals with some of the things that the government is putting in place hopefully with their expectation that, they ease inflation and interest rates remains to be seen. But of course, that's offset by FX. So on an adjusted revenue basis, from a margin standpoint and EPS, relatively stable. The other thing I would just reiterate, we talked a bit about it in our prepared remarks. Cash flow will definitely have some variation with tailwinds in the second half of the year after some headwinds in the first half. But again, we have a good degree of confidence in the $4.5 billion for the full year. Yes. First off, the latter part, yes, I would agree. We are anticipating, I think, like the rest of the world at this point, a soft landing things seem to be on track for that. A bit softer macro environment, modestly slower GDP in 2024. The FSBI is based upon a very broad set of data that we have across our company that we then extrapolate to the entire U.S. market. So, it is not a direct indication of Fiserv activity. If there are differences in region mix of - we're very strong in restaurant. We might have more restaurants than, we do nail salons, or so we go through the NAICS codes across the country, different industry weightings, different regions. When we take our data and extrapolate it, across the U.S. So it's very much a very real-time indicator of the health of small businesses. Now relative to our performance, we're the largest merchant acquirer in the country. So, if there's variation in the FSBI, you're likely to see variation in Fiserv's results relative to some nuances of different regions, industry weightings, et cetera. But certainly, a strong FSBI indicator index would be good for us, a weaker index would be a headwind for us. We're actually quite proud of that capability not only is it using all of the data we have, by the way, including cash transactions, which obviously, don't manifest themselves in our numbers for merchant acquiring, but we have the data, and it's very real time. We're able to provide that information two days after the month ends. It's not a perfect proxy, but it's a proxy. Thanks."

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session begins following the presentation. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded at this time. At this time, I will turn the call over to Julie Chariell, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv.\nJulie Chariell: Thank you, and good morning. With me on the call today are Frank Bisignano, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and supplemental materials for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Please refer to these materials for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this call, along with the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. Unless otherwise stated, performance references are year-over-year comparisons. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results and strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. You should refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Frank.\nFrank Bisignano: Thank you, Julie, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss how Fiserv continues to deliver very strong results. For the third quarter, we posted 12% organic revenue growth with margin expansion of 290 basis points to 38.1% on an adjusted basis. These results reflect an acceleration in our Merchant Acceptance and Fintech segment organic revenue growth to 20% and 6%, respectively. While all three segments contributed to higher margin, adjusted earnings per share of $1.96 was up 20%. Cash flow was strong as well with $1.3 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $2.7 billion year-to-date. Once again, strong quarterly results point to full year performance ahead of our prior guidance. In the closing month of 2023, market projections in consumer spending and card account growth in the U.S. point to consistency versus third quarter levels, which would mean some softening year-over-year. Macro uncertainty remains high, but we are confident in our ability to continue to add new clients, grow with and retain existing ones and expand our share of wallet with all of them. Because of this, we expect to close the year with growth similar to the year-to-date results. We also look to the more durable characteristics of our business to support our optimism. Nearly half of our volume in our Merchant business is in nondiscretionary spending categories. Approximately 85% of our financial institutions revenue is recurring. Our solutions in both areas service essential functions for our clients. Our customer base and distribution network are industry-leading. Our incremental margins are high, and our expense base benefits from technology-driven efficiencies and discretionary investment that we can adjust to match market conditions. It is these characteristics that helped us deliver 37 consecutive years of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth, and 2023 year-to-date results point to this being our 38th year. Our strong execution across these factors leads us to raise our guidance for the remainder of the year. We now expect 2023 organic revenue growth to reach 11%, the top end of our prior range of 9% to 11%; and our adjusted operating margin to improve more than 175 basis points this year, up from our prior expectation of at least 150 basis points of expansion. With this, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to a new range of $7.47 to $7.52, up $0.05 at the midpoint and representing growth of 15% to 16% over 2022. We are also raising our free cash flow guidance from $3.8 billion to approximately $4 billion this year. The third quarter marked our tenth consecutive quarter of double-digit organic revenue growth, and we are focused on sustaining this momentum. Last quarter, I talked about five powerful opportunities that can help us do this. So I\u2019ll share some proof points we achieved in the third quarter. Let\u2019s start with Clover, our market-leading cloud-based SaaS operating system for small and medium-sized businesses. Revenue growth accelerated in the third quarter to 26% from 23% in Q2 on $272 billion in annualized payment volume, up 15%. We released a new Clover dashboard with improved user experience that expedites navigation to our top apps, including reporting and analytics. We added other features that speeds the buying process Clover.com and improved the application process for new merchant prospects. We expect this functionality to open opportunities for Clover with a long tail of merchants growing our addressable market. Value-added solutions penetration continues to grow, reaching 17% in the quarter. We see plenty of white space still ahead, including with vertical-specific solutions, horizontal value-added services and software in international markets. We\u2019re retaining line of sight to an acceleration of revenue growth that results in $3.5 billion-plus in Clover revenue by 2025, the target laid out at our March 2022 investor presentation. Moving to Carat, our unified commerce offering for omnichannel merchants. We added several new enterprise clients and relationship extensions, including a large petrol seller and a major grocery chain, adding to our nondiscretionary spending categories. We continue to drive value-added solutions with enterprise clients. And wins in the quarter came from products addressing feedbacks and platforms, foreign currency translation, fraud and hotel and restaurants with BentoBox. We\u2019re pleased to announce that PayPal has selected Fiserv as its core U.S. partner for payment services across both PayPal and Braintree assets. This is a new direct strategic multiyear partnership covering several products and services and millions of merchant locations that builds on a long-standing base of business between our two companies. International expansion continues with Carat, and we had several wins in the quarter across our regions. In EMEA, we won a competitive bid to help Compass Group, the world\u2019s largest contract foodservice company, built unattended food retail services across 14 countries in Europe. We are providing acquiring, local payment methods and real-time inventory data across our single Carat omnichannel platform for Europe. Our differentiation was in our functionality around data normalization, real-time access, visualization and reporting depth and breadth. Asia Pacific, we extended our global merchant acquiring relationship with Avis Budget, one of the world\u2019s largest car rental providers, into Australia and New Zealand. And lastly, an emerging opportunity for us in the enterprise space is Open Data. We logged two important wins in this area in the third quarter that demonstrate strong demand for access to our vast alternative data assets. One of the major credit bureaus will use our account-level data to add micro-indicators to a consumer\u2019s credit profile, particularly relevant for the underbanked. Secondly, we\u2019re partnering with Dun & Bradstreet to add information from our merchant volume database to supplement its small business credit reports. This solution can optimize credit decisioning for lenders and access to capital for small businesses. Finally, in the area of Payments in open banking, we signed a deal with Plaid for API access to bank data, allowing the company to move further away from screen-scraping and generating revenue for us and our connected banking credit union clients. We can further penetrate this data market opportunity by contributing in areas such as ID verification, account verification, loan origination and security and fraud services. Latin America represents another standout growth opportunity. The region is about 6% of total company adjusted revenue, and in Merchant Acceptance, it\u2019s 10% of adjusted revenue. It\u2019s largely driven by Argentina and Brazil, followed by Mexico, Colombia, Uruguay and the Caribbean. Argentina inflation anticipation revenue have grabbed much of the attention here. But our business in the region is well diversified with multiple growth drivers across products and countries. Even as we look to presumably less inflation and slower anticipation growth in Argentina next year, we see plenty of opportunities for strong growth in the region. These include instant payments in Brazil and Argentina, revenue growth on our Software Express rails for expanding the payments functionality for this leading retail software business that we acquired in 2018. We expanded on this opportunity earlier this month when we acquired Skytef, the largest distributor of Software Express in Brazil. With it, we added hundreds of ISV partners, 27,000 merchants and the ability to cross-sell multiple value-added solutions: Ramping up new business with Caixa Bank, including acceptance at 13,000 bill payment facilities across Brazil; rolling out Clover more broadly in Brazil next year; and expanding our issuer processing footprint with FirstVision in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. Elevated inflation and high interest anticipation revenue in Latin America have contributed to the high teens growth we are posting this year in our Merchant business, well ahead of our medium-term guidance of 9% to 12%. The macro forces contributing to this greater than anticipated growth will likely ease over time, and this assumption is fully incorporated in our plan to achieve $10 billion of Merchant revenue by 2025. And finally, in the area of digital payments, we were very happy to introduce yesterday our partnership with Melio, a leading B2B payments platform. This marks a significant step forward for Fiserv in this very large and growing market. Together with Melio, we will enable financial institutions to better meet the payment needs of small businesses and level the playing field with emerging software-led competitors. We will combine Melio\u2019s well-known, easy-to-use accounts payable and receivable workflows with Fiserv\u2019s market-leading biller and merchant network, plus payment capabilities. By summer 2024, we will go to market with CashFlow Central by Fiserv, an integrated accounts payable and receivable solution for small businesses through Fiserv financial institution clients. This exclusive distribution agreement includes more than 3,500 FIs currently using check-free from Fiserv for bill payment and will allow the solution to scale rapidly. Furthermore, in the near future, we will reach merchants directly with this product through Clover and our ISV channel. Now let me turn the discussion over to Bob for more detail on our financial results.\nRobert Hau: Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. If you\u2019re following along on our slides, I will cover details on total company and segment performance, starting with our financial metrics and trends on Slide 4. As Frank said, our third quarter was very strong. We are confident in our new 2023 outlook and ability to continue to deliver attractive levels of growth and profitability. Total company organic revenue growth was 12% in the quarter with strong growth across Merchant Acceptance and a solid recovery in growth in the Fintech segment. Year-to-date, total company organic revenue grew 11%, led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 17%. Total company adjusted revenue of $4.6 billion grew 8% for the quarter despite a meaningful foreign currency headwind. Adjusted operating income grew 17% in the quarter to $1.8 billion, resulting in adjusted operating margin of 38.1%, an increase of 290 basis points. Year-to-date, adjusted revenue grew 8% to $13.4 billion, and adjusted operating income increased 16% to $4.8 billion, resulting in adjusted operating margin of 36.1%, an increase of 250 basis points. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter increased 20% to $1.96 compared to $1.63 in the prior year. Year-to-date, adjusted earnings per share increased 16% to $5.34, at the high end of the 14% to 16% annual prior guidance range. Our adjusted earnings per share growth is particularly noteworthy given the impact of foreign currency translation. Mostly due to the sharp devaluation of the Argentine peso relative to the dollar, our earnings per share includes a headwind of $0.24 for the quarter versus prior year. Free cash flow reached $1.3 billion for the quarter, up 48% versus the prior year and $2.7 billion for the first 9 months of the year, up 29%. We are raising our free cash flow guidance and now expect to reach $4 billion this year, reflecting the typical strength in our cash flow generation in the second half of the year. Now looking to our segment results starting on Slide 5. Organic revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was a strong 20% in the quarter and 17% year-to-date. We now anticipate organic revenue growth to be in the high teens for the full year. Adjusted revenue growth was 12% in the quarter and 11% year-to-date. Organic revenue growth in this segment is running well ahead of our medium-term guidance for 9% to 12% growth, driven by growth in Clover, our ISV channel and our international businesses as well as several transitory factors that we expect will ease in future years. The elevated Argentine inflation, which is running well above 100% this year, contributed about 2 points of organic growth for the segment on a year-to-date basis. Additionally, high interest rates in Argentina have contributed to a stronger growth in anticipation revenue. But even as rates normalize, we expect demand for these prepayments to be healthy given the extended settlement periods here as well as in Brazil and Uruguay. Turning to volume performance in the quarter. Merchant volume grew 2% overall and 6% excluding wholesale processing. Similarly, transactions grew 1% overall and 9% excluding processing. Recall that a large portion of our volume comes from traditional wholesale processing. However, over the last several years, we\u2019ve been evolving from providing processing services alone to offering full acquiring services and more recently software and other value-added solutions. This transition changes our business model for the better. Our SMB and enterprise acquiring businesses carry much higher revenue per dollar volume compared to the wholesale processing business. So as acquiring grows and wholesale processing becomes a smaller portion of our volume, we are seeing a widening positive spread with revenue growth outpacing volume growth in large part due to value-added services. Going forward, processing volume will ebb and flow. As a reminder, we projected $10 billion of revenue in this Merchant Acceptance segment in 2025 with processing revenue roughly flat from 2021 to 2025. We expect overall revenue growth will continue to outpace volume growth as we increase penetration of software and services, which means more revenue per unit of volume. Clover continues to build on the strength of its growing product offering, distribution partnerships, expanded direct sales and value-added solutions. It posted a strong 26% revenue growth for the quarter and 23% year-to-date. Quarterly Clover GPV was $68 billion or $272 billion on an annualized basis, up 15%. Value-added services penetration was 17%, over 2 points above year-ago levels and on track to achieve our 25% target by 2025. Carat, our omni-commerce operating system for enterprise clients, grew 14% excluding the loss of a large merchant aggregator, as discussed last quarter. On an unadjusted basis, Carat revenue grew 2%. We had two large wins that included our Commerce Hub product, the new single orchestration layer that enables easy access to all our products and services. First with Curb Mobility, the taxi-hailing service; and second, with Autobooks, an accounting and bookkeeping system provider to small business. Adjusted operating income in the Acceptance segment increased 24% to $757 million in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was up 350 basis points to 35.9%. Year-to-date, adjusted operating income improved 22% to $2 billion and adjusted operating margin grew 300 basis points to 33.8%. Turning to Slide 6, the Payments and Network segment. Organic revenue growth in the segment was 6% in the quarter and 9% year-to-date. Adjusted revenue growth in the quarter was 5% and 8% year-to-date. Growth drivers in this segment include North American credit active accounts on file, though growth here slowed a bit to 3%. And Zelle transactions grew 44%, which continued to benefit from new uptake of Zelle for Business. Our debit networks, STAR and Accel, added several new merchant customers, including some household names in e-commerce, in part to take advantage of Reg II benefits. These and prior new client adds represent a strong pipeline of prospects for the Merchant Acceptance business. We also won a deal to support Pinnacle, a $42 billion bank by assets, in a combined debit processing and network win, demonstrating our ability to successfully support and sell to larger banks. Outside the U.S., we closed a 5-year deal with a Tier 1 U.K. bank to support the launch of a new buy now, pay later solution to be delivered using a combination of our FirstVision processing technology and our new suite of digital solutions. We also won a contract with Bandhan Bank, India\u2019s eighth-largest bank, further cementing our position as a market leader in credit processing in India, bringing the number of Indian banks on our FirstVision processing platform to 10. As we\u2019ve said, we expected tougher comparisons through the second half of the year given the anniversary of the onboarding of several large clients through mid-2022. We continue to anticipate the full year organic revenue growth rate to be toward the high end of our medium-term outlook of 5% to 8%. Adjusted operating income for the segment was up 12% to $832 million and adjusted operating margin was up 270 basis points to 48.6% in the quarter, driven by favorable mix and greater productivity. Year-to-date, adjusted operating income was up 14% to $2.3 billion, and adjusted operating margin was up 260 basis points to 46.7%. Moving to Slide 7, the Financial Technology segment. Organic revenue growth in the segment was 6% in the quarter and 3% year-to-date. Adjusted revenue growth in the quarter was 4% and 1% year-to-date, impacted by the divestiture of our financial reconciliation product announced at the beginning of the quarter. For the year, we expect organic growth to reach the low end of our guidance range of 4% to 6%. Adjusted operating income was up 11% in the quarter to $291 million and up 5% to $856 million year-to-date. Adjusted operating margin in the segment increased 260 basis points to 36.7% for the quarter. For the first 9 months, the segment\u2019s adjusted operating margin grew 130 basis points to 36.1%. We added eight new core account processing clients in the quarter, including three wins with financial institutions whose assets exceeded $1 billion. Two wins came from growing credit unions, including Noble-Federal, that saw the benefits of upgrading to DNA, our industry-leading cloud-enabled core for both credit unions and banks. The adjusted corporate operating loss was $120 million in the quarter and $384 million year-to-date. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.2% and was 19.6% for the first 9 months. We continue to expect the adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 20% for the full year. Total debt outstanding was $23.3 billion on September 30, and the debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio dropped to 2.8x. During the third quarter, we issued $2 billion of 5-year and 10-year senior notes to replace the notes that matured in October and reduced our commercial paper program balances. Variable rate debt sits at 7% of total. During the quarter, we continued executing capital allocation strategy, repurchasing 9.6 million shares for $1.2 billion and 31.4 million shares for $3.7 billion over the last 9 months. We had 60.5 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase at the end of the quarter. We are fully committed to our long-standing disciplined approach to capital allocation, which includes investing in our business organically, maintaining a strong balance sheet, returning cash to shareholders through share repurchase and pursuing high-value and innovative acquisitions. And wrapping up on Slide 8. Year-to-date, organic revenue growth is at the top end of our prior guidance for the full year, and we expect the level of business activity in the fourth quarter to be similar to the third. While consumer spending is forecast to be slower in the second half of the year relative to the first, the consumer has remained resilient and unemployment levels remain low. Bank and credit union IT spending continues at a healthy pace as higher interest rates have been a tailwind for profitability. The combined scenario gives us confidence to raise our full year organic revenue growth to 11%, the top end of our previous guidance range of 9% to 11%. Based on this higher anticipated organic revenue growth and strong third quarter results, we are raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance range once again from the previous $7.40 to $7.50 to a new range of $7.47 to $7.52, representing growth of 15% to 16% over 2022. This includes a higher adjusted operating margin, now expected to improve more than 175 basis points this year, up from our prior guidance of at least 150 basis points. We look forward to seeing you at our Investor Day on November 15. Space is limited, so for those of you who cannot attend in person, please take advantage of the webcast from our Investor Relations website. With that, let me turn the call back to Frank.\nFrank Bisignano: Thanks, Bob. I\u2019ll provide a brief update on our CSR activities and most recent recognitions before we wrap up and move to Q&A. During the quarter, we continued to expand our focus on minority depository institutions, or MDIs. In September, we hosted our inaugural MDI Advisory Council meeting, where we discussed future save products and strategies and how to better integrate Fiserv solutions at council members\u2019 banks to help them grow and better serve their clients. We were active on the back-to-business front as well. So far this year, Fiserv\u2019s back-to-business program has funded almost 200 grants totaling nearly $2 million for small, diverse merchant businesses. Also, in the third quarter, our leadership position in Fintech was affirmed when IDC ranked Fiserv number one on its top 100 ranking of global financial technology providers. CNBC also named us a top Fintech company. And Time Magazine included Fiserv on its list of World\u2019s Best Companies in 2023. I\u2019d like to conclude my formal remarks with what to expect from our upcoming investor conference on November 15. This will be our first full business review in 3 years. Our work to integrate First Data and Fiserv is not only done, but is driving real value in the marketplace across merchants and financial institutions in a way that only this combined company can. Our assets are now unmatched when you consider that we have a large and diverse client base from financial institutions of all sizes, to small businesses, to large enterprises around the world, spanning all sectors and containing many leaders in their respective industries; a global footprint in over 100 countries organized by region and known for deep local expertise; a modern stack computing environment with private and public cloud capability; scale-based leadership in merchant acquiring, driven in part by a superior distribution model; the largest SMB SaaS payment platform by volume with Clover; the leading credit card issuing platform offering cutting-edge cardholder experiences; the number three debit network; our NOW network that optimizes connections between our bank and credit union clients and payment rails of all types, from cards, to ACH, to real time; the best bank and credit union account processing platforms; and the broadest set of value-added surround solutions. And finally, cross-platform opportunities that expand our addressable market and that Fiserv is uniquely positioned to deliver. This includes our new SMB accounts payable and receivable market opportunity and our embedded finance offering, where our newest Fintech platform, Finxact, is enabling banking services offered by merchants, starting with one of the world\u2019s largest retailers. We\u2019ll expand on these opportunities and more in a few weeks\u2019 time, and we\u2019ll share a compelling 3-year forward plan that will help you understand how we intend to defend and extend our lead in Fintech. Thank you to our teams who come to work every day and build and deliver on this plan. And thank you all for your time and attention today. And now operator, please open the lines for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We would now like to open the phone lines for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Timothy Chiodo from UBS. Please go ahead.\nTimothy Chiodo: Thanks a lot for taking the question. I want to touch on enterprise e-commerce competition, very topical in the market right now, and you mentioned many new Carat wins. Maybe you could talk a little bit about STAR and Accel and how bundling those networks is helping you to win share? But not just STAR and Accel, some of the other services that are more frequently appealing to the enterprise e-comm merchants as you win these RFPs, I would appreciate that.\nFrank Bisignano: Thank you, Tim. Good to hear from you. I\u2019d start at the top, right? We committed to the build-out of our omni-channel capability and we brought in Commerce Hub as fundamentally a centerpiece of that. And that really gets to the point that you bring, which is what I would call more value-added services than just fee account volume. Our debit routing capability is very, very strong, and it allows us to, also with the debit network, to be able to give our clients the opportunity to work on lowering the cost of acceptance, a platform that we\u2019ve thought about across the business for a very long time. Created other value-added services, like our prepaid products and gift, also gives us what we believe is a strategic advantage. So in many of our businesses, you\u2019ll hear us talk about it across \u2013 we\u2019ll have the fundamental processing capability and acquiring capability, but then bringing across the other value-added services. And that\u2019s the benefit of this company, it gives us a strategic advantage. So I think about it in those aspects, really. And I think when you look at PayPal and the like, it gives us a really good hand to be able to do more with them besides only e-comm, and also for other clients, it\u2019s the omnichannel experience that we bring to them across the enterprise.\nTimothy Chiodo: Excellent. Thank you, Frank.\nFrank Bisignano: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Dave Togut from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. Good to see the acceleration in Clover revenue growth and the increased penetration of value-added services. Could you just drill down into what you see as the biggest drivers of growth in value-added services going forward, taking you to the model you\u2019ve laid out for 2025?\nFrank Bisignano: I mean, for us, it\u2019s software stacks against verticals, and then there\u2019s a horizontal capability. Obviously, employee management, everything from timekeeping systems to the way, in fact, they\u2019re managing their workforce is a capability that gets used horizontally. If you look at other pieces, it will be inventory for some specific businesses. And I think if you look at our penetration rate, it continues to grow because the bundles continue to get stickier. You heard us then today announce Melio \u2013 or yesterday announce Melio, I should say. And that will be another \u2013 it goes beyond Merchant, and we can talk about that later if you all like. But it will be in their offering to our merchant base in total, and that would be an example of bringing in capabilities that we didn\u2019t have for them before that we will. So I think we started \u2013 if you remember, we started Clover with the concept of an app store. We converted that into understanding what are the natural characteristics of specific verticals and then what is the horizontal capability that we will bring across it. And we feel good about the growth and we see the trajectory of both signing up new merchants and also the ability to bring more product to our current merchants.\nDavid Togut: And just as a quick follow-up. Bob, good to see the free cash flow up 48% year-over-year in the third quarter. CapEx was down 17%. Are we moving toward lower capital intensity going forward? Or is this just a function of an easy comparison?\nRobert Hau: Yes. I would definitely, David, point to really timing of the capital spending and comparisons. I would expect full year 2023 to be in line with last year\u2019s spending overall. And I think we\u2019ve said in the past, as we look forward, we think the capital levels that we\u2019ve got right now are about correct going forward. We\u2019ll see a growth in revenue, and therefore, as a percent of revenue, perhaps some easing. But order of magnitude, that $1.5 billion for the full year is right in line with what we\u2019d expect.\nDavid Togut: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Thank you. Great results here. On the Acceptance side in Lat Am specifically, I\u2019m curious with the anticipation revenue likely to ease there, and you gave some disclosure. I\u2019m just curious, what do you see replacing that growth in Lat Am? How does the deal pipeline look there?\nRobert Hau: Yes. Tien-Tsin, I think, we pointed out in our prepared remarks, we\u2019re definitely seeing some \"transitory benefits\" in Latin America, particularly in Argentina, around higher-than-normal inflation and higher-than-normal interest rates. That is definitely giving us a lift from an anticipation standpoint. I think we basically are anticipating cash into the merchant. We\u2019re in the middle of the payment flow. And so we\u2019re able to provide that as a service to our merchants so that they can settle their transactions earlier than the typical 30-day cycle in that region. Interest rates, we get a spread on the interest. And of course, we\u2019re able to borrow at a cheaper rate than our merchants might be able to borrow. So that\u2019s a good business for us, very low risk because we\u2019re in the middle of that flow. If you anticipate interest rates to ease into the future, which I would expect they will, you\u2019ll see some easing of the revenue, but not in the spread. And so it remains a very good business for us. And of course, the debate will be at what rate does either inflation and/or interest rates ease. An important element, though, is a very correlated number to both inflation and interest rates is FX. And while, from an organic standpoint, we don\u2019t have FX because our organic results are at constant currency, it\u2019s certainly in our adjusted revenue and our EPS. And so we\u2019ll see some easing of that transitory inflation and interest impact will also see some easing about FX impact, net-net. Overall results on an adjusted revenue basis and an adjusted EPS basis will remain strong. About Latin America, it\u2019s a tremendous franchise for us, not only in Argentina, but in Brazil. We continue to grow and expand in Uruguay and Mexico, in the Caribbean. It\u2019s a tremendous capability for us and providing a good growth in the recent history and expect it to continue into the future.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Glad to hear, Bob. Just real quick, if you don\u2019t mind me asking another one just on Fintech. You mentioned medium bank \u2013 and overall bank spending has been healthy on the IT side. How about new deal activity, large deals, et cetera? Do you see that continuing here as we cross into the new calendar year? I\u2019m just curious where the appetite is for new spend in the banking community.\nFrank Bisignano: I think \u2013 yes. I think the dialogue is robust. I think Finxact has definitely added to that dialogue from where we were before. In my prepared remarks, I talk about our platform serving bank and credit union. I have a deep belief, and I think the market has a deep belief, that DNA and Finxact are industry leaders in capabilities. We had always talked about going further up market. Obviously, I think if you look at total banks that run on a system, we\u2019re the market leader. But we\u2019re also driving north and I think those two assets really help us. And there\u2019s lots of robust dialogue, now we need to turn the robust dialogue into closed deals and then we\u2019ve got to convert it. But I feel good about the long term. We\u2019ll talk about it clearly on November 15. I also think, when we look at FIs in total, which is the way ultimately we look at it, when you look at how we\u2019ve performed in Fintech and Payments, if you want to think about it that way, we\u2019ve been very, very strong. The ability to bring our surrounds, that\u2019s probably a year-to-date 7% number. We\u2019ve been able to bring our surrounds in our banking platforms, and that\u2019s really what attracts the new book, so to speak. So we\u2019re in deep dialogues on big deals. And I have not seen a slowdown in banks\u2019 appetite at all for the things we have.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Terrific. Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJason Kupferberg: Good morning, guys. Thanks. So on the Acceptance segment, it doesn\u2019t sound like your Q4 guide is really contemplating any material change in the trajectory of overall consumer spending. I was hoping you could maybe give a little insight into what you\u2019ve seen in October, both with regard to volume and transaction data ex-wholesale versus September, let\u2019s say? And any shifts in discretionary versus nondiscretionary spend categories in the past month? Thanks.\nRobert Hau: Yes, Jason, overall, so far, what we\u2019ve seen in October is very similar to what we saw through the third quarter. Consumer continues to be quite resilient. Quite frankly, I\u2019m tired of using the word uncertain. We\u2019ve lived in a pretty uncertain environment for the last 3-plus years and probably a lot earlier than that. There are certainly some verticals within our overall merchant book that are softer than others. Roughly half of our merchant volume is \u2013 or merchant revenue is discretionary \u2013 in nondiscretionary, so we\u2019re nicely balanced there. We\u2019re certainly seeing some softness in retail. The restaurants continue to be quite steady. So overall, obviously, we\u2019re very early in the quarter. And as you know, holiday spending in December month is a big part of the quarter, but so far, right in line with what we saw in Q3.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay. Good to hear. And just on the Fintech segment, it looks like you need to see maybe a little bit of organic growth acceleration in Q4 against a bit of a tougher comp to get to the low end of that 4% to 6% guide. Can you just parse out some of the drivers there and your visibility on that?\nRobert Hau: Yes. I think in order to reach the low end of that guidance that we talked about, the low end of the 4% to 6%, we\u2019ve got to repeat the 6% organic growth that we saw in the fourth quarter. To your point, yes, it\u2019s against a tougher comparison in Q4 versus Q3 of last year. Obviously, we\u2019ve got some implementations. These are long-cycle implementations. And as those go live, you get some ramp on that revenue, and that does take time. So some of it went live in Q3, and we\u2019ll see acceleration into Q4. We\u2019ll see new clients going live in Q4. Obviously, there\u2019s ongoing swings or variability in the periodic revenue in order to deliver that 4% on a full year basis. And I think as Frank pointed out, our financial institutions clients look to us for a broad suite of software and services, and the combined Fintech and Payments business, which is really where we go to market with our financial institution clients, is up 7% organically on a year-to-date basis. Pretty steady, stronger Q1, a good Q2, good Q3. We expect to close out the year at that rate, that level. And overall, financial institution clients continue to look to us to provide services, and anticipate that continuing in fourth quarter and into next year.\nJason Kupferberg: Thanks, Bob.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Dan Dolev from Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.\nDan Dolev: Hey, great quarter. Congrats. I was particularly interested in the Melio partnership. Frank, can you maybe give us some more color, if you think like 2, 3 years out, how could this change the way people think of Fiserv in terms of kind of its B2B capability, Zelle, all the projects that you\u2019re hopefully planning to do with them? Thank you.\nFrank Bisignano: Yes. I\u2019m not \u2013 I\u2019m thinking if I necessarily want them to think about us change or think about this is who we are, the ability to distribute great capability to our outstanding client base. And I want to make the point that this product works really, really well with our bill pay CheckFree product and allows us to go to our SMBs exclusively in the FI channel with it, and allow our banks to actually, ultimately, have a new offering that will increase their fee revenue and in fact increase our revenue. So I think it\u2019s solidifying our position in SMB. Yes, it will also be distributed to our ISV clients and our Clover clients. But there are many clients that do not receive payments via card, and this is taking something to the whole swath of them that we did not have. You should expect us in market in the summer of \u201824 on it. And once again, we\u2019re helping our bank partners bring more product and grow their revenue, much like we do in the merchant business, and we\u2019re adding to the stickiness of our SMB portfolio.\nDan Dolev: Great. Thank you, and congrats again on the amazing quarter.\nFrank Bisignano: Thanks, Dan. Good to hear from you.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Dave Koning from Baird. Please go ahead.\nDavid Koning: Yes. Hey, guys, great job. And maybe on just the merchant acquiring industry, there\u2019s been the fears of commoditization. But if anything, you\u2019ve shown the strongest growth in years, your yields have been going up, not down. But what about churn? Like have you seen noticeable improvement in churn or retention really over the last few quarters as well?\nFrank Bisignano: Yes. But I think it\u2019s good to step back for a second here because we\u2019ve been in a multiyear transformation that has allowed us to produce what we\u2019re producing today. That would include Clover. That will include building a business in Brazil. That will include bringing Clover to Argentina, right? So there\u2019s a lot of dimensions to how we are where we are. The ability to drive ARPU in our base, we get a wholesale processing business, which we talked about being $1 billion of revenue and flat, but that business is like 40% of our volume. In that core direct business that we continue to grow, you should continue us to bring more product in and just make those relationships stickier. And what we see is when we have 3 to 4 products in a client, the churn is best-in-class. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re so focused on ARPU and more clients. Yes, in single-dimensional clients that aren\u2019t Clover, you see higher churn.\nDavid Koning: Great. Thanks. And one quick follow-up. What was the Q2 number for \u2013 with Q3, the volume ex processing of 6%. What was that number in Q2?\nRobert Hau: Dave, I actually don\u2019t have that right at my fingertips. It\u2019s not a number we\u2019ve disclosed previously. Let me get that. But I think one of the elements or one of the reasons we disclosed that and brought that to everybody this year \u2013 or excuse me, this quarter, is to talk about exactly what Frank just pointed out, is this long-term transition from years ago, being a processing-only business, to now a full service capability merchant acquirer. In our March 2022 investor conference on our Merchant business, we talked extensively about building out that Clover software value-added services capability, becoming an operating system. We have an operating system for SMB clients. We have an operating system for enterprise clients. And so as the processing eases a bit from a volume standpoint, the impact to the revenue is a fraction of the processing volume delta. And in many cases, that processing volume becomes merchant acquiring volume at a much better value point for the company because, not only are we doing merchant acquiring, but we\u2019re selling the value-added services. And that delta you saw in Q3 from an overall volume to essentially an enterprise plus SMB volume at 6% is more representative of the overall volume opportunity for the company. And that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing a very strong organic growth rate in the Merchant segment this quarter, last quarter, last year, the previous year.\nDavid Koning: Yes. All good. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi, thanks so much for taking my question this morning. I wanted to ask about the margin outperformance you guys are seeing. And taking a step back, thinking about it in terms of how much is driven by a better business mix, meaning more Clover software, Zelle, et cetera, versus sort of a more active expense management or expense control. And I\u2019m just asking in the context of thinking about how sustainable the margin drivers you\u2019re seeing this year may be kind of over time, if that makes sense.\nFrank Bisignano: Yes. I would say we\u2019re always working on how to make things better, right? That\u2019s just every day, we get up, how do we make it better? How do we make it better for our clients? How do we eliminate work that\u2019s not necessary? How do we deliver better quality? How do we do all that? And that\u2019s an element of it. The other element of it is high-quality revenue growth. And our incremental drop-through is very, very strong. So I would say investment, we\u2019ve been completely plowed into, meaning we\u2019re continuing to build our business and invest in our business and deploy resource to it. We have \u2013 we always are working on productivity and quality. We talk about a year of operational excellence. But our incremental drop-through rate is very, very strong on the business we have. So I would take it as a mix element. We\u2019re never going to be just one or the other. As I said in my remarks, we do have a lot of discretionary investment, but we feel great about that. And that\u2019s why the Melio product will be out in the summer of \u201824, as an example. So high-quality revenue, good incremental drop-through, continually driving better client stats and productivity. So it\u2019s got to be all of it. We don\u2019t do just one.\nRamsey El-Assal: Okay. So sort of all of the above. A quick follow-up for me. On the Acceptance volumes, how should we think about that wholesale part of the business evolving over time? Do you see kind of a point of stabilization coming? Or is this a business that we should sort of think of kind of winding down very gradually over a long period of time?\nFrank Bisignano: Well, first of all, we talked about it as flat, right? We talked about you should expect it to be fundamentally flat by $10 billion. Now that may mean less volume, even better yield in there, right? There\u2019s a big mix of what\u2019s in processing. We have an ISO business and we have a bank processing business. And by the way, tomorrow, we could bid on another piece of processing. I view it, as I\u2019ve always said, and maybe this is just my heritage and it won\u2019t ring with everybody, as running a correspondent clearing business and running a wholesale broker dealer. I\u2019m never going to get the correspondent clearing business to be a high growth, but it definitely is $1 billion for us that covers a lot of fixed. But our emphasis is on growing our direct business. So I\u2019ll turn over to Bob. And I want you to have that picture. We don\u2019t see it as zero, we said it\u2019d be flat in \u201825.\nRobert Hau: Ramsey, that flat that Frank is referring to is when we guided to $10 billion of merchant revenue by 2025. In what, 2 \u2013 almost 2 years ago now, we were doing about $900 million to $1 billion worth of processing revenue. Our $10 billion outlook assumed that, that would remain flat over that time period. There will be shifts to volume, you\u2019ll get a little bit of price, there will be adds, there will be deletes, there\u2019s some \u2013 I think I used the term ebbs and flows in the processing volume. But overall, I anticipate it to be about that $1 billion, which means it was, order of magnitude, 13%, 14% of our revenue. By 2025, it will end up being 10% of our revenue as we grow the full merchant acquiring capability and continue to grow that at a much faster pace than our processing. But that\u2019s a nice $1 billion revenue business for us that we\u2019re happy to have and we\u2019ll continue to manage that effectively. And then before we go to the next question, just going back to David, your question around the enterprise and SMB volume or volume ex processing, it is an acceleration. That 6% that we\u2019re seeing in Q3 is a bit of an acceleration from Q2 levels. So continue to see good growth, and that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the top line for us. We\u2019ll move to the next question.\nOperator: Yes, absolutely. And for our final question, we\u2019ll go to Vasu Govil from KBW. Please go ahead.\nVasundhara Govil: Hi, thank you for taking my questions and congrats on the great quarter. I guess, my first one for Frank. Frank, CFPB just released these open banking regulation proposal. Assuming that goes into effect some time next year, is that a revenue opportunity for Fiserv as banks have to comply? Or do you think that was sort of already happened organically, and so not that meaningful...\nFrank Bisignano: I think it was really organically going on. I mean \u2013 but if you look at what we just did with Plaid, we\u2019re always going to veer in to bringing more capability to out bank partners. We\u2019re a client business. We run a huge client franchise. We\u2019re out talking to them every day, whether it was what we did at Forum with 3,000 clients, or what we do at [AGBA] or what we do by having 29 women CEOs here for an all-day conference, we want to listen to our clients. And so open banking has been going on, and we\u2019re continuing to align in a way that try our client for franchise.\nVasundhara Govil: Great. And then quick one for you, Bob. Just I know last year, towards the end of the year, you guys had some pricing benefit that helped revenue growth. Just how should we think about the fourth quarter in terms of spreads versus volume growth in the Acceptance segment?\nRobert Hau: I think \u2013 yes, I think you\u2019ll continue to see good revenue growth as we continue to have deeper penetration of value-added services, not only in the small business, but also in the enterprise space. We\u2019ll continue to put up very good growth. And as we said, we expect the full year to be in the high teens. On a year-to-date basis, we\u2019re at 17% organic, so we see another strong quarter ahead of us.\nVasundhara Govil: Thank you very much.\nFrank Bisignano: Thank you for your participation, everybody. We really appreciate your time and attention. Please feel free to reach out to our IR team with any questions, and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you all for participating in the Fiserv 2023 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. That concludes today\u2019s call. Please disconnect at this time, and have a great rest of your day.",

For the third quarter, we posted 12% organic revenue growth with margin expansion of 290 basis points to 38.1% on an adjusted basis. These results reflect an acceleration in our Merchant Acceptance and Fintech segment organic revenue growth to 20% and 6%, respectively. While all three segments contributed to higher margin, adjusted earnings per share of $1.96 was up 20%. Cash flow was strong as well with $1.3 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $2.7 billion year-to-date. Once again, strong quarterly results point to full year performance ahead of our prior guidance. In the closing month of 2023, market projections in consumer spending and card account growth in the U.S. point to consistency versus third quarter levels, which would mean some softening year-over-year. Macro uncertainty remains high, but we are confident in our ability to continue to add new clients, grow with and retain existing ones and expand our share of wallet with all of them. Because of this, we expect to close the year with growth similar to the year-to-date results. We also look to the more durable characteristics of our business to support our optimism. Nearly half of our volume in our Merchant business is in nondiscretionary spending categories. Approximately 85% of our financial institutions revenue is recurring. Our solutions in both areas service essential functions for our clients. Our customer base and distribution network are industry-leading. Our incremental margins are high, and our expense base benefits from technology-driven efficiencies and discretionary investment that we can adjust to match market conditions. It is these characteristics that helped us deliver 37 consecutive years of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth, and 2023 year-to-date results point to this being our 38th year. Our strong execution across these factors leads us to raise our guidance for the remainder of the year. We now expect 2023 organic revenue growth to reach 11%, the top end of our prior range of 9% to 11%; and our adjusted operating margin to improve more than 175 basis points this year, up from our prior expectation of at least 150 basis points of expansion. With this, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to a new range of $7.47 to $7.52, up $0.05 at the midpoint and representing growth of 15% to 16% over 2022. We are also raising our free cash flow guidance from $3.8 billion to approximately $4 billion this year. The third quarter marked our tenth consecutive quarter of double-digit organic revenue growth, and we are focused on sustaining this momentum. Last quarter, I talked about five powerful opportunities that can help us do this. So I'll share some proof points we achieved in the third quarter. Let's start with Clover, our market-leading cloud-based SaaS operating system for small and medium-sized businesses. Revenue growth accelerated in the third quarter to 26% from 23% in Q2 on $272 billion in annualized payment volume, up 15%. We released a new Clover dashboard with improved user experience that expedites navigation to our top apps, including reporting and analytics. We added other features that speeds the buying process Clover.com and improved the application process for new merchant prospects. We expect this functionality to open opportunities for Clover with a long tail of merchants growing our addressable market. Value-added solutions penetration continues to grow, reaching 17% in the quarter. We see plenty of white space still ahead, including with vertical-specific solutions, horizontal value-added services and software in international markets. We're retaining line of sight to an acceleration of revenue growth that results in $3.5 billion-plus in Clover revenue by 2025, the target laid out at our March 2022 investor presentation. Moving to Carat, our unified commerce offering for omnichannel merchants. We added several new enterprise clients and relationship extensions, including a large petrol seller and a major grocery chain, adding to our nondiscretionary spending categories. We continue to drive value-added solutions with enterprise clients. And wins in the quarter came from products addressing feedbacks and platforms, foreign currency translation, fraud and hotel and restaurants with BentoBox. We're pleased to announce that PayPal has selected Fiserv as its core U.S. partner for payment services across both PayPal and Braintree assets. This is a new direct strategic multiyear partnership covering several products and services and millions of merchant locations that builds on a long-standing base of business between our two companies. International expansion continues with Carat, and we had several wins in the quarter across our regions. In EMEA, we won a competitive bid to help Compass Group, the world's largest contract foodservice company, built unattended food retail services across 14 countries in Europe. We are providing acquiring, local payment methods and real-time inventory data across our single Carat omnichannel platform for Europe. Our differentiation was in our functionality around data normalization, real-time access, visualization and reporting depth and breadth. Asia Pacific, we extended our global merchant acquiring relationship with Avis Budget, one of the world's largest car rental providers, into Australia and New Zealand. And lastly, an emerging opportunity for us in the enterprise space is Open Data. We logged two important wins in this area in the third quarter that demonstrate strong demand for access to our vast alternative data assets. One of the major credit bureaus will use our account-level data to add micro-indicators to a consumer's credit profile, particularly relevant for the underbanked. Secondly, we're partnering with Dun & Bradstreet to add information from our merchant volume database to supplement its small business credit reports. This solution can optimize credit decisioning for lenders and access to capital for small businesses. Finally, in the area of Payments in open banking, we signed a deal with Plaid for API access to bank data, allowing the company to move further away from screen-scraping and generating revenue for us and our connected banking credit union clients. We can further penetrate this data market opportunity by contributing in areas such as ID verification, account verification, loan origination and security and fraud services. Latin America represents another standout growth opportunity. The region is about 6% of total company adjusted revenue, and in Merchant Acceptance, it's 10% of adjusted revenue. It's largely driven by Argentina and Brazil, followed by Mexico, Colombia, Uruguay and the Caribbean. Argentina inflation anticipation revenue have grabbed much of the attention here. But our business in the region is well diversified with multiple growth drivers across products and countries. Even as we look to presumably less inflation and slower anticipation growth in Argentina next year, we see plenty of opportunities for strong growth in the region. These include instant payments in Brazil and Argentina, revenue growth on our Software Express rails for expanding the payments functionality for this leading retail software business that we acquired in 2018. We expanded on this opportunity earlier this month when we acquired Skytef, the largest distributor of Software Express in Brazil. With it, we added hundreds of ISV partners, 27,000 merchants and the ability to cross-sell multiple value-added solutions: Ramping up new business with Caixa Bank, including acceptance at 13,000 bill payment facilities across Brazil; rolling out Clover more broadly in Brazil next year; and expanding our issuer processing footprint with FirstVision in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. Elevated inflation and high interest anticipation revenue in Latin America have contributed to the high teens growth we are posting this year in our Merchant business, well ahead of our medium-term guidance of 9% to 12%. The macro forces contributing to this greater than anticipated growth will likely ease over time, and this assumption is fully incorporated in our plan to achieve $10 billion of Merchant revenue by 2025. And finally, in the area of digital payments, we were very happy to introduce yesterday our partnership with Melio, a leading B2B payments platform. This marks a significant step forward for Fiserv in this very large and growing market. Together with Melio, we will enable financial institutions to better meet the payment needs of small businesses and level the playing field with emerging software-led competitors. We will combine Melio's well-known, easy-to-use accounts payable and receivable workflows with Fiserv's market-leading biller and merchant network, plus payment capabilities. By summer 2024, we will go to market with CashFlow Central by Fiserv, an integrated accounts payable and receivable solution for small businesses through Fiserv financial institution clients. This exclusive distribution agreement includes more than 3,500 FIs currently using check-free from Fiserv for bill payment and will allow the solution to scale rapidly. Furthermore, in the near future, we will reach merchants directly with this product through Clover and our ISV channel. Now let me turn the discussion over to Bob for more detail on our financial results. Thanks, Bob. I'll provide a brief update on our CSR activities and most recent recognitions before we wrap up and move to Q&A. During the quarter, we continued to expand our focus on minority depository institutions, or MDIs. In September, we hosted our inaugural MDI Advisory Council meeting, where we discussed future save products and strategies and how to better integrate Fiserv solutions at council members' banks to help them grow and better serve their clients. We were active on the back-to-business front as well. So far this year, Fiserv's back-to-business program has funded almost 200 grants totaling nearly $2 million for small, diverse merchant businesses. Also, in the third quarter, our leadership position in Fintech was affirmed when IDC ranked Fiserv number one on its top 100 ranking of global financial technology providers. CNBC also named us a top Fintech company. And Time Magazine included Fiserv on its list of World's Best Companies in 2023. I'd like to conclude my formal remarks with what to expect from our upcoming investor conference on November 15. This will be our first full business review in 3 years. Our work to integrate First Data and Fiserv is not only done, but is driving real value in the marketplace across merchants and financial institutions in a way that only this combined company can. Our assets are now unmatched when you consider that we have a large and diverse client base from financial institutions of all sizes, to small businesses, to large enterprises around the world, spanning all sectors and containing many leaders in their respective industries; a global footprint in over 100 countries organized by region and known for deep local expertise; a modern stack computing environment with private and public cloud capability; scale-based leadership in merchant acquiring, driven in part by a superior distribution model; the largest SMB SaaS payment platform by volume with Clover; the leading credit card issuing platform offering cutting-edge cardholder experiences; the number three debit network; our NOW network that optimizes connections between our bank and credit union clients and payment rails of all types, from cards, to ACH, to real time; the best bank and credit union account processing platforms; and the broadest set of value-added surround solutions. And finally, cross-platform opportunities that expand our addressable market and that Fiserv is uniquely positioned to deliver. This includes our new SMB accounts payable and receivable market opportunity and our embedded finance offering, where our newest Fintech platform, Finxact, is enabling banking services offered by merchants, starting with one of the world's largest retailers. We'll expand on these opportunities and more in a few weeks' time, and we'll share a compelling 3-year forward plan that will help you understand how we intend to defend and extend our lead in Fintech. Thank you to our teams who come to work every day and build and deliver on this plan. And thank you all for your time and attention today. And now operator, please open the lines for questions. Thank you, Tim. Good to hear from you. I'd start at the top, right? We committed to the build-out of our omni-channel capability and we brought in Commerce Hub as fundamentally a centerpiece of that. And that really gets to the point that you bring, which is what I would call more value-added services than just fee account volume. Our debit routing capability is very, very strong, and it allows us to, also with the debit network, to be able to give our clients the opportunity to work on lowering the cost of acceptance, a platform that we've thought about across the business for a very long time. Created other value-added services, like our prepaid products and gift, also gives us what we believe is a strategic advantage. So in many of our businesses, you'll hear us talk about it across \u2013 we'll have the fundamental processing capability and acquiring capability, but then bringing across the other value-added services. And that's the benefit of this company, it gives us a strategic advantage. So I think about it in those aspects, really. And I think when you look at PayPal and the like, it gives us a really good hand to be able to do more with them besides only e-comm, and also for other clients, it's the omnichannel experience that we bring to them across the enterprise. Thank you. I mean, for us, it's software stacks against verticals, and then there's a horizontal capability. Obviously, employee management, everything from timekeeping systems to the way, in fact, they're managing their workforce is a capability that gets used horizontally. If you look at other pieces, it will be inventory for some specific businesses. And I think if you look at our penetration rate, it continues to grow because the bundles continue to get stickier. You heard us then today announce Melio \u2013 or yesterday announce Melio, I should say. And that will be another \u2013 it goes beyond Merchant, and we can talk about that later if you all like. But it will be in their offering to our merchant base in total, and that would be an example of bringing in capabilities that we didn't have for them before that we will. So I think we started \u2013 if you remember, we started Clover with the concept of an app store. We converted that into understanding what are the natural characteristics of specific verticals and then what is the horizontal capability that we will bring across it. And we feel good about the growth and we see the trajectory of both signing up new merchants and also the ability to bring more product to our current merchants. I think \u2013 yes. I think the dialogue is robust. I think Finxact has definitely added to that dialogue from where we were before. In my prepared remarks, I talk about our platform serving bank and credit union. I have a deep belief, and I think the market has a deep belief, that DNA and Finxact are industry leaders in capabilities. We had always talked about going further up market. Obviously, I think if you look at total banks that run on a system, we're the market leader. But we're also driving north and I think those two assets really help us. And there's lots of robust dialogue, now we need to turn the robust dialogue into closed deals and then we've got to convert it. But I feel good about the long term. We'll talk about it clearly on November 15. I also think, when we look at FIs in total, which is the way ultimately we look at it, when you look at how we've performed in Fintech and Payments, if you want to think about it that way, we've been very, very strong. The ability to bring our surrounds, that's probably a year-to-date 7% number. We've been able to bring our surrounds in our banking platforms, and that's really what attracts the new book, so to speak. So we're in deep dialogues on big deals. And I have not seen a slowdown in banks' appetite at all for the things we have. Yes. I'm not \u2013 I'm thinking if I necessarily want them to think about us change or think about this is who we are, the ability to distribute great capability to our outstanding client base. And I want to make the point that this product works really, really well with our bill pay CheckFree product and allows us to go to our SMBs exclusively in the FI channel with it, and allow our banks to actually, ultimately, have a new offering that will increase their fee revenue and in fact increase our revenue. So I think it's solidifying our position in SMB. Yes, it will also be distributed to our ISV clients and our Clover clients. But there are many clients that do not receive payments via card, and this is taking something to the whole swath of them that we did not have. You should expect us in market in the summer of \u201824 on it. And once again, we're helping our bank partners bring more product and grow their revenue, much like we do in the merchant business, and we're adding to the stickiness of our SMB portfolio. Thanks, Dan. Good to hear from you. Yes. But I think it's good to step back for a second here because we've been in a multiyear transformation that has allowed us to produce what we're producing today. That would include Clover. That will include building a business in Brazil. That will include bringing Clover to Argentina, right? So there's a lot of dimensions to how we are where we are. The ability to drive ARPU in our base, we get a wholesale processing business, which we talked about being $1 billion of revenue and flat, but that business is like 40% of our volume. In that core direct business that we continue to grow, you should continue us to bring more product in and just make those relationships stickier. And what we see is when we have 3 to 4 products in a client, the churn is best-in-class. And that's why we're so focused on ARPU and more clients. Yes, in single-dimensional clients that aren't Clover, you see higher churn. Yes. I would say we're always working on how to make things better, right? That's just every day, we get up, how do we make it better? How do we make it better for our clients? How do we eliminate work that's not necessary? How do we deliver better quality? How do we do all that? And that's an element of it. The other element of it is high-quality revenue growth. And our incremental drop-through is very, very strong. So I would say investment, we've been completely plowed into, meaning we're continuing to build our business and invest in our business and deploy resource to it. We have \u2013 we always are working on productivity and quality. We talk about a year of operational excellence. But our incremental drop-through rate is very, very strong on the business we have. So I would take it as a mix element. We're never going to be just one or the other. As I said in my remarks, we do have a lot of discretionary investment, but we feel great about that. And that's why the Melio product will be out in the summer of \u201824, as an example. So high-quality revenue, good incremental drop-through, continually driving better client stats and productivity. So it's got to be all of it. We don't do just one. Well, first of all, we talked about it as flat, right? We talked about you should expect it to be fundamentally flat by $10 billion. Now that may mean less volume, even better yield in there, right? There's a big mix of what's in processing. We have an ISO business and we have a bank processing business. And by the way, tomorrow, we could bid on another piece of processing. I view it, as I've always said, and maybe this is just my heritage and it won't ring with everybody, as running a correspondent clearing business and running a wholesale broker dealer. I'm never going to get the correspondent clearing business to be a high growth, but it definitely is $1 billion for us that covers a lot of fixed. But our emphasis is on growing our direct business. So I'll turn over to Bob. And I want you to have that picture. We don't see it as zero, we said it'd be flat in \u201825. I think it was really organically going on. I mean \u2013 but if you look at what we just did with Plaid, we're always going to veer in to bringing more capability to out bank partners. We're a client business. We run a huge client franchise. We're out talking to them every day, whether it was what we did at Forum with 3,000 clients, or what we do at [AGBA] or what we do by having 29 women CEOs here for an all-day conference, we want to listen to our clients. And so open banking has been going on, and we're continuing to align in a way that try our client for franchise. Thank you for your participation, everybody. We really appreciate your time and attention. Please feel free to reach out to our IR team with any questions, and have a great day."

            "name": "Robert Hau",
            "content": "Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. If you're following along on our slides, I will cover details on total company and segment performance, starting with our financial metrics and trends on Slide 4. As Frank said, our third quarter was very strong. We are confident in our new 2023 outlook and ability to continue to deliver attractive levels of growth and profitability. Total company organic revenue growth was 12% in the quarter with strong growth across Merchant Acceptance and a solid recovery in growth in the Fintech segment. Year-to-date, total company organic revenue grew 11%, led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 17%. Total company adjusted revenue of $4.6 billion grew 8% for the quarter despite a meaningful foreign currency headwind. Adjusted operating income grew 17% in the quarter to $1.8 billion, resulting in adjusted operating margin of 38.1%, an increase of 290 basis points. Year-to-date, adjusted revenue grew 8% to $13.4 billion, and adjusted operating income increased 16% to $4.8 billion, resulting in adjusted operating margin of 36.1%, an increase of 250 basis points. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter increased 20% to $1.96 compared to $1.63 in the prior year. Year-to-date, adjusted earnings per share increased 16% to $5.34, at the high end of the 14% to 16% annual prior guidance range. Our adjusted earnings per share growth is particularly noteworthy given the impact of foreign currency translation. Mostly due to the sharp devaluation of the Argentine peso relative to the dollar, our earnings per share includes a headwind of $0.24 for the quarter versus prior year. Free cash flow reached $1.3 billion for the quarter, up 48% versus the prior year and $2.7 billion for the first 9 months of the year, up 29%. We are raising our free cash flow guidance and now expect to reach $4 billion this year, reflecting the typical strength in our cash flow generation in the second half of the year. Now looking to our segment results starting on Slide 5. Organic revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was a strong 20% in the quarter and 17% year-to-date. We now anticipate organic revenue growth to be in the high teens for the full year. Adjusted revenue growth was 12% in the quarter and 11% year-to-date. Organic revenue growth in this segment is running well ahead of our medium-term guidance for 9% to 12% growth, driven by growth in Clover, our ISV channel and our international businesses as well as several transitory factors that we expect will ease in future years. The elevated Argentine inflation, which is running well above 100% this year, contributed about 2 points of organic growth for the segment on a year-to-date basis. Additionally, high interest rates in Argentina have contributed to a stronger growth in anticipation revenue. But even as rates normalize, we expect demand for these prepayments to be healthy given the extended settlement periods here as well as in Brazil and Uruguay. Turning to volume performance in the quarter. Merchant volume grew 2% overall and 6% excluding wholesale processing. Similarly, transactions grew 1% overall and 9% excluding processing. Recall that a large portion of our volume comes from traditional wholesale processing. However, over the last several years, we've been evolving from providing processing services alone to offering full acquiring services and more recently software and other value-added solutions. This transition changes our business model for the better. Our SMB and enterprise acquiring businesses carry much higher revenue per dollar volume compared to the wholesale processing business. So as acquiring grows and wholesale processing becomes a smaller portion of our volume, we are seeing a widening positive spread with revenue growth outpacing volume growth in large part due to value-added services. Going forward, processing volume will ebb and flow. As a reminder, we projected $10 billion of revenue in this Merchant Acceptance segment in 2025 with processing revenue roughly flat from 2021 to 2025. We expect overall revenue growth will continue to outpace volume growth as we increase penetration of software and services, which means more revenue per unit of volume. Clover continues to build on the strength of its growing product offering, distribution partnerships, expanded direct sales and value-added solutions. It posted a strong 26% revenue growth for the quarter and 23% year-to-date. Quarterly Clover GPV was $68 billion or $272 billion on an annualized basis, up 15%. Value-added services penetration was 17%, over 2 points above year-ago levels and on track to achieve our 25% target by 2025. Carat, our omni-commerce operating system for enterprise clients, grew 14% excluding the loss of a large merchant aggregator, as discussed last quarter. On an unadjusted basis, Carat revenue grew 2%. We had two large wins that included our Commerce Hub product, the new single orchestration layer that enables easy access to all our products and services. First with Curb Mobility, the taxi-hailing service; and second, with Autobooks, an accounting and bookkeeping system provider to small business. Adjusted operating income in the Acceptance segment increased 24% to $757 million in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was up 350 basis points to 35.9%. Year-to-date, adjusted operating income improved 22% to $2 billion and adjusted operating margin grew 300 basis points to 33.8%. Turning to Slide 6, the Payments and Network segment. Organic revenue growth in the segment was 6% in the quarter and 9% year-to-date. Adjusted revenue growth in the quarter was 5% and 8% year-to-date. Growth drivers in this segment include North American credit active accounts on file, though growth here slowed a bit to 3%. And Zelle transactions grew 44%, which continued to benefit from new uptake of Zelle for Business. Our debit networks, STAR and Accel, added several new merchant customers, including some household names in e-commerce, in part to take advantage of Reg II benefits. These and prior new client adds represent a strong pipeline of prospects for the Merchant Acceptance business. We also won a deal to support Pinnacle, a $42 billion bank by assets, in a combined debit processing and network win, demonstrating our ability to successfully support and sell to larger banks. Outside the U.S., we closed a 5-year deal with a Tier 1 U.K. bank to support the launch of a new buy now, pay later solution to be delivered using a combination of our FirstVision processing technology and our new suite of digital solutions. We also won a contract with Bandhan Bank, India's eighth-largest bank, further cementing our position as a market leader in credit processing in India, bringing the number of Indian banks on our FirstVision processing platform to 10. As we've said, we expected tougher comparisons through the second half of the year given the anniversary of the onboarding of several large clients through mid-2022. We continue to anticipate the full year organic revenue growth rate to be toward the high end of our medium-term outlook of 5% to 8%. Adjusted operating income for the segment was up 12% to $832 million and adjusted operating margin was up 270 basis points to 48.6% in the quarter, driven by favorable mix and greater productivity. Year-to-date, adjusted operating income was up 14% to $2.3 billion, and adjusted operating margin was up 260 basis points to 46.7%. Moving to Slide 7, the Financial Technology segment. Organic revenue growth in the segment was 6% in the quarter and 3% year-to-date. Adjusted revenue growth in the quarter was 4% and 1% year-to-date, impacted by the divestiture of our financial reconciliation product announced at the beginning of the quarter. For the year, we expect organic growth to reach the low end of our guidance range of 4% to 6%. Adjusted operating income was up 11% in the quarter to $291 million and up 5% to $856 million year-to-date. Adjusted operating margin in the segment increased 260 basis points to 36.7% for the quarter. For the first 9 months, the segment's adjusted operating margin grew 130 basis points to 36.1%. We added eight new core account processing clients in the quarter, including three wins with financial institutions whose assets exceeded $1 billion. Two wins came from growing credit unions, including Noble-Federal, that saw the benefits of upgrading to DNA, our industry-leading cloud-enabled core for both credit unions and banks. The adjusted corporate operating loss was $120 million in the quarter and $384 million year-to-date. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.2% and was 19.6% for the first 9 months. We continue to expect the adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 20% for the full year. Total debt outstanding was $23.3 billion on September 30, and the debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio dropped to 2.8x. During the third quarter, we issued $2 billion of 5-year and 10-year senior notes to replace the notes that matured in October and reduced our commercial paper program balances. Variable rate debt sits at 7% of total. During the quarter, we continued executing capital allocation strategy, repurchasing 9.6 million shares for $1.2 billion and 31.4 million shares for $3.7 billion over the last 9 months. We had 60.5 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase at the end of the quarter. We are fully committed to our long-standing disciplined approach to capital allocation, which includes investing in our business organically, maintaining a strong balance sheet, returning cash to shareholders through share repurchase and pursuing high-value and innovative acquisitions. And wrapping up on Slide 8. Year-to-date, organic revenue growth is at the top end of our prior guidance for the full year, and we expect the level of business activity in the fourth quarter to be similar to the third. While consumer spending is forecast to be slower in the second half of the year relative to the first, the consumer has remained resilient and unemployment levels remain low. Bank and credit union IT spending continues at a healthy pace as higher interest rates have been a tailwind for profitability. The combined scenario gives us confidence to raise our full year organic revenue growth to 11%, the top end of our previous guidance range of 9% to 11%. Based on this higher anticipated organic revenue growth and strong third quarter results, we are raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance range once again from the previous $7.40 to $7.50 to a new range of $7.47 to $7.52, representing growth of 15% to 16% over 2022. This includes a higher adjusted operating margin, now expected to improve more than 175 basis points this year, up from our prior guidance of at least 150 basis points. We look forward to seeing you at our Investor Day on November 15. Space is limited, so for those of you who cannot attend in person, please take advantage of the webcast from our Investor Relations website. With that, let me turn the call back to Frank. Yes. I would definitely, David, point to really timing of the capital spending and comparisons. I would expect full year 2023 to be in line with last year's spending overall. And I think we've said in the past, as we look forward, we think the capital levels that we've got right now are about correct going forward. We'll see a growth in revenue, and therefore, as a percent of revenue, perhaps some easing. But order of magnitude, that $1.5 billion for the full year is right in line with what we'd expect. Yes. Tien-Tsin, I think, we pointed out in our prepared remarks, we're definitely seeing some \"transitory benefits\" in Latin America, particularly in Argentina, around higher-than-normal inflation and higher-than-normal interest rates. That is definitely giving us a lift from an anticipation standpoint. I think we basically are anticipating cash into the merchant. We're in the middle of the payment flow. And so we're able to provide that as a service to our merchants so that they can settle their transactions earlier than the typical 30-day cycle in that region. Interest rates, we get a spread on the interest. And of course, we're able to borrow at a cheaper rate than our merchants might be able to borrow. So that's a good business for us, very low risk because we're in the middle of that flow. If you anticipate interest rates to ease into the future, which I would expect they will, you'll see some easing of the revenue, but not in the spread. And so it remains a very good business for us. And of course, the debate will be at what rate does either inflation and/or interest rates ease. An important element, though, is a very correlated number to both inflation and interest rates is FX. And while, from an organic standpoint, we don't have FX because our organic results are at constant currency, it's certainly in our adjusted revenue and our EPS. And so we'll see some easing of that transitory inflation and interest impact will also see some easing about FX impact, net-net. Overall results on an adjusted revenue basis and an adjusted EPS basis will remain strong. About Latin America, it's a tremendous franchise for us, not only in Argentina, but in Brazil. We continue to grow and expand in Uruguay and Mexico, in the Caribbean. It's a tremendous capability for us and providing a good growth in the recent history and expect it to continue into the future. Yes, Jason, overall, so far, what we've seen in October is very similar to what we saw through the third quarter. Consumer continues to be quite resilient. Quite frankly, I'm tired of using the word uncertain. We've lived in a pretty uncertain environment for the last 3-plus years and probably a lot earlier than that. There are certainly some verticals within our overall merchant book that are softer than others. Roughly half of our merchant volume is \u2013 or merchant revenue is discretionary \u2013 in nondiscretionary, so we're nicely balanced there. We're certainly seeing some softness in retail. The restaurants continue to be quite steady. So overall, obviously, we're very early in the quarter. And as you know, holiday spending in December month is a big part of the quarter, but so far, right in line with what we saw in Q3. Yes. I think in order to reach the low end of that guidance that we talked about, the low end of the 4% to 6%, we've got to repeat the 6% organic growth that we saw in the fourth quarter. To your point, yes, it's against a tougher comparison in Q4 versus Q3 of last year. Obviously, we've got some implementations. These are long-cycle implementations. And as those go live, you get some ramp on that revenue, and that does take time. So some of it went live in Q3, and we'll see acceleration into Q4. We'll see new clients going live in Q4. Obviously, there's ongoing swings or variability in the periodic revenue in order to deliver that 4% on a full year basis. And I think as Frank pointed out, our financial institutions clients look to us for a broad suite of software and services, and the combined Fintech and Payments business, which is really where we go to market with our financial institution clients, is up 7% organically on a year-to-date basis. Pretty steady, stronger Q1, a good Q2, good Q3. We expect to close out the year at that rate, that level. And overall, financial institution clients continue to look to us to provide services, and anticipate that continuing in fourth quarter and into next year. Dave, I actually don't have that right at my fingertips. It's not a number we've disclosed previously. Let me get that. But I think one of the elements or one of the reasons we disclosed that and brought that to everybody this year \u2013 or excuse me, this quarter, is to talk about exactly what Frank just pointed out, is this long-term transition from years ago, being a processing-only business, to now a full service capability merchant acquirer. In our March 2022 investor conference on our Merchant business, we talked extensively about building out that Clover software value-added services capability, becoming an operating system. We have an operating system for SMB clients. We have an operating system for enterprise clients. And so as the processing eases a bit from a volume standpoint, the impact to the revenue is a fraction of the processing volume delta. And in many cases, that processing volume becomes merchant acquiring volume at a much better value point for the company because, not only are we doing merchant acquiring, but we're selling the value-added services. And that delta you saw in Q3 from an overall volume to essentially an enterprise plus SMB volume at 6% is more representative of the overall volume opportunity for the company. And that's why you're seeing a very strong organic growth rate in the Merchant segment this quarter, last quarter, last year, the previous year. Ramsey, that flat that Frank is referring to is when we guided to $10 billion of merchant revenue by 2025. In what, 2 \u2013 almost 2 years ago now, we were doing about $900 million to $1 billion worth of processing revenue. Our $10 billion outlook assumed that, that would remain flat over that time period. There will be shifts to volume, you'll get a little bit of price, there will be adds, there will be deletes, there's some \u2013 I think I used the term ebbs and flows in the processing volume. But overall, I anticipate it to be about that $1 billion, which means it was, order of magnitude, 13%, 14% of our revenue. By 2025, it will end up being 10% of our revenue as we grow the full merchant acquiring capability and continue to grow that at a much faster pace than our processing. But that's a nice $1 billion revenue business for us that we're happy to have and we'll continue to manage that effectively. And then before we go to the next question, just going back to David, your question around the enterprise and SMB volume or volume ex processing, it is an acceleration. That 6% that we're seeing in Q3 is a bit of an acceleration from Q2 levels. So continue to see good growth, and that's what's driving the top line for us. We'll move to the next question. I think \u2013 yes, I think you'll continue to see good revenue growth as we continue to have deeper penetration of value-added services, not only in the small business, but also in the enterprise space. We'll continue to put up very good growth. And as we said, we expect the full year to be in the high teens. On a year-to-date basis, we're at 17% organic, so we see another strong quarter ahead of us."

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session begins following the presentation. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Julie Chariell, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv.\nJulie Chariell: Thank you, and good morning. With me on the call today are Frank Bisignano, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and supplemental materials for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Please refer to these materials for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this call, along with the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. Unless otherwise stated, performance references are year-over-year comparisons. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results and strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from our actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. You should refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Frank.\nFrank Bisignano: Thank you, Julie, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss another very good quarter for Fiserv. Our results continue to demonstrate strong performance in revenue and operating income with second quarter organic revenue growth of 10%, led by performance in Merchant Acceptance, particularly in our international regions, and our Payments and Network segment. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.81 was up 16%, and adjusted operating margin of 36.5% was up 300 basis points. All three measures are tracking ahead of our previous guidance for the full year. As we look to the remainder of 2023, we note that economists\u2019 expectations have improved for GDP and consumer spending relative to the start of the year. But those economists also forecast a modest macro slowdown from the first half, in part due to higher anticipated unemployment and the reinstatement of student loan repayment. Among our financial institution customers, spending and spending intentions remain healthy even as net interest margins narrow and lending activity eases. Card and non-card payment services, digital banking, IT modernization and data analytics are high-demand services, and financial institutions are looking to us to deliver. With the outperformance in the second quarter, we are once again raising our outlook for the full year. We now expect 2023 organic revenue growth in the range of 9% to 11%, up from 8% to 9% previously. Adjusted operating margin is now forecast to improve at least 150 basis points this year, up from our prior expectation of greater than 125 basis points. With the year-to-date adjusted EPS growth of 14% and the improved revenue and operating margin performance, we are raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance by $0.10 to a new range of $7.40 to $7.50, representing growth of 14% to 16% over 2022. These second quarter results marked our ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit organic revenue growth. We have also repurchased nearly 6% of our shares outstanding over the last 12 months. I am incredibly proud of the strong performance and the hard work, foresight and collaboration that it took to get here. Now I\u2019m focused on sustaining this momentum. There are multiple parts of our business that I consider future growth accelerants. I will touch on five of these today, and then we\u2019ll add and elaborate on them at our Investor Day later this year. Bob will provide more details on this later in the call. The first success story with a continuing growth outlook is Clover, our market-leading cloud-based SaaS operating system for small and medium-sized businesses. Revenue is growing more than 20% on $267 billion in annualized payment volume. This is a testament not only to the appeal of the product offering, but to the power of our vast distribution network. Clover has only begun to scratch the surface on the opportunity in vertical-specific solutions, horizontal value-added services and software and international markets. In the restaurant vertical, we expect to offer the full suite of value-added services and point-of-sale solutions for restaurants and QSRs of all sizes next year. And we\u2019ve begun to build out vertical specialized software solutions for retail and professional services, including partnerships to manage inventory, improve SKU level analytics and manage appointment scheduling. We\u2019re also continuing to enhance our ISV partner program, giving our ISVs access to Clover hardware and processing alongside our value-added services. This will support our growth among additional verticals, including businesses in our back book. An example of this is our integration with SalonUltimate, a vertical software platform provider focused on the salon and spa industry, that will provide a broader combined offering to its large merchant base. Clover now accounts for approximately 25% of our Merchant revenue and remains on track to reach 35% by 2025, in line with our targets for $10 billion in total Merchant revenue and $3.5 billion in Clover revenue by 2025, implying an expected growth acceleration. Following in the footsteps of Clover is Carat, our unified commerce offering for omni-channel merchants. Like Clover, Carat is an operating system that delivers both payments and experiences, but instead of small businesses, Carat is for the world\u2019s leading brands and large enterprises. Carat has been posting revenue growth in the mid-teens on the strength of Fiserv\u2019s scale, flexibility and customization capability, plus key integrated services and broad payment options. We recently released our two biggest differentiators for Carat: Commerce Hub, which is the orchestration layer that enables easy client access to our products and services; and a data and insights command center that lets clients manage their data in real-time to better engage end customers and improve operating efficiencies. Over time, as with Clover, we\u2019ll add more first and third-party value-added services and payment flows and increase accessibility around the world. A third area of growth is digital payments and the intersection with digital banking. CardHub is our card account product for debit card issuers that offers all of the newest features for cardholders to manage their accounts. It helps out small and midsized bank issuer clients offer their customers the same cutting-edge functionality as the largest independent card issuers. We\u2019re about halfway through migrating financial institution clients onto CardHub where they can integrate with our digital mobile banking product, Mobiliti, and with competing digital banking providers. This migration has shown a doubling of customer adoption on CardHub in the first year, which means greater card usage, reduced call center activity and better security. Ensuring new clients to our digital banking solutions, we then tend to bundle our debit processing, debit network and risk services. The full integration of CardHub and Mobiliti is an investment unique at Fiserv because it spans two operating segments, Payments and Fintech, where others don\u2019t participate. Our card solution was strengthened by two acquisitions, Ondot and SpendLabs, in 2021. And it\u2019s just one example of the many cross-selling opportunities specific to Fiserv given our integration work and breadth of capability. A fourth growth area is Latin America. Although we haven\u2019t spoken in depth about our international operations, Latin America has been a standout grower in recent quarters, and we believe it can remain so for the long term. We\u2019ve built a leading franchise across multiple countries and leading financial institutions that spans our product set from merchant acceptance to card issuing to fintech. The region is about 6% of total company adjusted revenue. And in Merchant Acceptance, it\u2019s 10% of adjusted revenue. It\u2019s largely driven by Argentina and Brazil followed by Mexico, Colombia and several others. Argentina has garnered attention lately for 100%-plus inflation. And while this has certainly contributed to some of our Merchant segment\u2019s strength, a bigger and more sustainable part of the growth comes from anticipation revenue, also known as merchant prepayments. This is where we help merchants navigate the long settlement variance in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay by funding their payment receivables early at a discounted rate. Businesses get better liquidity, and we receive a spread that carries low risk. Other parts of our LatAm business shows strong momentum as well. We will be expanding our relationship with our partner, Caixa Econ\u00f4mica Federal, enabling card payment for their more than 13,000 bill payment agencies throughout Brazil. Fiserv solution will allow agencies to extend bill payment options from only cash and Caixa debit cards today to all credit, debit and prepaid cards. The opportunity is meaningful when considering that in 2022, this agent network enabled bill payments equal to about 11% of all credit and debit payments in Brazil. We are also enabling PIX transactions in Brazil in the P2B space, utilizing our Software Express platform and expanding our presence in PIX beyond P2B. We have also made PIX payments capability available in our large acquiring network in Argentina, supporting Brazilians visiting this neighboring country. We\u2019re excited for the opportunities presented by PIX, and it has already exceeded total card sales volume in Brazil in a short period of time. A fifth opportunity is Finxact. Finxact is the acquisition we made in April of last year to offer a next-generation core banking system that\u2019s cloud-native. It gives us the opportunity to compete and win with financial institutions of all sizes and across geographies, expanding our total addressable market. Our three-prong strategy is to win digital-first banks, provide next-generation core banking through our existing FI clients and add larger banks as clients often starting as they launch new products in the cloud. Another opportunity in Finxact that\u2019s coming together now actually started many years ago. We were an initial investor in Finxact when it began raising money in 2017 because we saw value in marrying a merchant processing platform with a back-office banking platform. Today, that\u2019s called embedded finance, and we are beginning to tap into the opportunity as merchants look to offer banking services to their customers. Their goal is typically to provide more purchasing power and payment flexibility to their customers while creating deeper relationships. Embedded finance will add to the many payment and banking solutions that merchants want to offer and we already provide. Here are some examples. We deliver stored value and gift card solutions to many of the world\u2019s leading brands. We\u2019re the largest private label credit card provider, and we are the processor behind most HSA and FSA accounts. Finxact is the single ledger and issuing platform for products like debit cards and DDAs. And from here, we\u2019re investing in the connectivity between platforms to create a more seamless experience for our clients and their end customers. Now let me turn the discussion over to Bob for more detail on our financial results.\nRobert Hau: Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. If you\u2019re following along on our slides, I\u2019ll cover details on total company and segment performance, starting with our financial metrics and trends on Slide 4. As Frank said, our second quarter was a very good one and marked our ninth quarter in a row of double-digit organic revenue growth. Total company organic revenue growth was 10% in the quarter with strong growth across Merchant Acceptance and Payments and Network. Year-to-date, total company organic revenue grew 11%, led by the Merchant Acceptance segment which grew 16%. Our three international regions also continued to perform well, growing 31% organically in the second quarter. We saw strong growth in the issuer solutions revenue across all three regions and robust gains in Latin America for our Merchant segment. As Frank explained, while Argentina inflation grabs the headlines, the bigger driver of our growth here is anticipation revenue, reflecting a newer business for us in Merchant prepayments. In the near future, inflation in Argentina may ease, but it\u2019s likely to stay persistently high relative to the rest of the world. Our broad franchise, new lines of business and strong growth in the rest of the region should balance out any single country\u2019s macroeconomic issues. Second quarter total company adjusted revenue grew 6% to $4.5 billion and adjusted operating income grew 16% to $1.6 billion, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 36.5%, an increase of 300 basis points versus the prior year. For the first half of the year, adjusted revenue grew 8% to $8.8 billion and adjusted operating income increased 16% to $3.1 billion, resulting in adjusted operating margin of 35.1%, an increase of 240 basis points versus last year and tracking ahead of our 2023 guidance. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter increased 16% to $1.81 compared to $1.56 in the prior year. Year-to-date through June 30, adjusted earnings per share increased 14% to $3.38 at the high end of our 12% to 14% annual guidance range. Free cash flow came in at $608 million for the quarter and $1.5 billion for the first six months of the year, up 16% year-to-date. Our free cash flow remains on track to reach $3.8 billion this year, and we\u2019ve retained line of sight to accelerating cash flow generation in the second half as is typical for our business. Now looking to our segment results starting on Slide 5. Organic revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was a strong 14% in the quarter and 16% year-to-date. Adjusted revenue growth in the quarter was 9% and 10% for the first half. Merchant volume and transactions grew 1% compared to prior year. This lower volume performance reflects two temporary factors. First is the decline in retail fuel prices of 27% on average in the quarter, which creates a tough comparison for petrol merchant volume growth. The second is related to some strategic realignment among large processing clients that\u2019s impacting their volumes and represents a large portion of our processing-only volume. Excluding these two isolated factors, volume growth would have been 4%. It\u2019s important to note that volume changes for both petrol and processing-only clients had very little impact on our revenue since petrol clients typically pay per transaction and processing carries very low fees. Nevertheless, they are big contributors to volume and thus the spread between our volume growth and revenue growth is particularly wide now. This should moderate over time. Other factors contributing to the wider spread are rising penetration of software and services and pricing benefits from both higher inflation and added value. We expect these to be positive contributors to revenue on an ongoing basis. Clover, our operating system for small- and medium-sized businesses, continues to build on the strength of its growing product offering to attract and retain more merchants and expand our revenue opportunity with them. Clover posted a strong 23% revenue growth for the quarter and 22% year-to-date. Quarterly Clover GPV was $67 billion and $267 billion on an annualized basis, up 15%. Value-added services penetration was 16%, 1 point above year-ago levels and on track to achieve our 25% target by 2025. We signed 40 ISVs this quarter, bringing our total signed to 77 year-to-date. Our momentum is starting to build with PayFac as well with the signing of Waystar and Pay Theory during the second quarter. Clover Sport added a relationship with a large service provider for the Cleveland Browns Stadium and other venues. Carat, our omni-commerce operating system for enterprise clients, grew revenue 6% in the second quarter. Excluding the loss of a Latin America processing client that began taking its business in-house, Carat grew 14%. While our relationship with the client remains good, we\u2019re focused on growing our higher-value direct business. The underlying Carat business remains strong. We\u2019ve expanded our merchant processing relationship with Inspire Brands, the second-largest restaurant company in the United States, to include several more of their restaurant concepts while continuing our relationship with their Dunkin\u2019, Baskin-Robbins and Sonic brands. The agreement will add several thousand additional restaurant locations to our processing portfolio. Adjusted operating income in the Acceptance segment increased 21% to $718 million in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was up 350 basis points to 34.7%. Year-to-date, adjusted operating income improved 20% to $1.3 billion, and adjusted operating margin grew 280 basis points to 32.7%. Turning to Slide 6. The Payments and Network segment posted organic revenue growth of 9% in the quarter, once again above the high end of the 5% to 8% medium-term guidance range. Notable growth drivers in the segment included active accounts on file in North American credit processing business; the Output Solutions business; our debit networks, STAR and Accel; and Zelle, led by continued growth in both the number of clients and transaction growth. As we\u2019ve said, we expect tough comparisons through the rest of the year as we anniversary a large new client onboarding completed in mid-2022. Still, we anticipate the full year organic revenue growth rate to be towards the high end of our medium-term outlook of 5% to 8%. Also notable for this segment, two new payments initiatives took effect this month, offering incremental revenue opportunities for Fiserv over time. First, July 1 was the effective date of the Fed\u2019s final rule clarifying parts of Regulation II to make explicit that at least two debit network routing options are required for card-not-present transactions. For our STAR and Accel debit networks, which have been supporting CNP for years, this led to more than 80 of our current issuing clients enabling card-not-present, adding active cards for e-commerce transactions. This is a growth opportunity that we did not previously have. We also won several large e-commerce merchants as clients, including, in the second quarter, Lyft, ADT and T-Mobile. Last week, the Fed launched its real-time payment system, FedNow. So we are now live with six banks in the pilot phase and more than 70 committed to go live so far this year. We are encouraged by the opportunity to add more financial institutions since more than 1,000 of them are already connected to our NOW Network for Zelle, providing a single point of integration that could be leveraged by FIs to easily add new rails. That\u2019s a major differentiator for Fiserv. But the key to FedNow adoption is compelling use cases, which we think will grow over time, most likely in commercial payments and bill pay spaces. Adjusted operating income for the segment was up 17% to $782 million and adjusted operating margin was up 360 basis points to 47.4% in the quarter, driven by our strong revenue growth and productivity. Year-to-date, adjusted operating income was up 16% to $1.5 billion and adjusted operating margin was up 240 basis points to 45.6%. Moving to Slide 7. Organic revenue in the Financial Technology segment declined 1% in the second quarter, resulting in 1% growth for the first half. High periodic revenue in the second quarter of 2022 drove a difficult comparison this quarter, creating a 3-point headwind. We continue to expect organic growth within the guidance range of 4% to 6% this year as in-year revenue is booked and implementation work on prior wins is completed. Adjusted operating income was up 1% in the quarter to $285 million and up 2% to $565 million year-to-date. Adjusted operating margin in the segment increased 130 basis points to 36.3% in the quarter. For the first half, the segment\u2019s adjusted operating margin grew 60 basis points to 35.8%. We added 10 new core account processing clients in the quarter, including four wins for DNA, our market-recognized leading modern core banking platform for banks and credit unions. Fintech showcased its extensibility as an enabler of embedded finance with the win at Pay Theory. This payment facilitator serves the education and the health care sectors and plans to enable a suite of banking-as-a-service and money movement capabilities for its vertical SaaS partners. We are integrating Fintech with our merchant PFAC platform to enable Pay Theory to extend its vertical SaaS capability to banking and payments. Our goal is to provide a single integration for vertical SaaS providers who want to leverage assets across our banking, payments and merchant businesses. The adjusted corporate operating loss was $142 million in the quarter and $264 million year-to-date. The slight increase over the first half last year is largely impacted by expenses tied to our client conference, which we held in-person for the first time since the pandemic. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 20.6% and was 19.8% for the first half. We continue to expect the adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 20% for the full year. Total outstanding debt was $23.2 billion on June 30, and the debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio was 2.9 times. During the second quarter, we issued \u20ac800 million of eight-year senior notes to replace notes that matured in early July and reduced our commercial paper program balances. Variable rate debt sits at 13% of total. During the quarter, we continued our disciplined capital allocation strategy, repurchasing 8.6 million shares for $1 billion and 21.8 million shares for $2.5 billion over the last six months. We had 70.1 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase at the end of the quarter. As we continue to optimize our vast product portfolio for value and strategic fit, yesterday, we completed the sale of two financial reconciliation products to Trintech for roughly $230 million. We are fully committed to our longstanding disciplined approach to capital allocation, which includes investing in our businesses organically, maintaining a strong balance sheet, returning cash to shareholders through share repurchase and pursuing high-value and innovative acquisitions. And wrapping up on Slide 8. First half organic revenue growth was well ahead of our prior guidance for the full year, so we are again raising the range from 8% to 9%, to 9% to 11%, which considers economists\u2019 range of second half outcomes. Based on the strong second quarter results and higher anticipated organic revenue growth, we are raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance range once again from the previous $7.30 to $7.40 to a new range of $7.40 to $7.50, representing growth of 14% to 16% over 2022. This includes a higher adjusted operating margin now expected to improve at least 150 basis points this year, up from our prior guidance of greater than 125 basis points. Lastly, we\u2019re excited to announce our upcoming Investor Day in New York City on Wednesday, November 15, so please save the date. We\u2019ll spend time going deeper on our growth strategies, and you\u2019ll see how they factor into our outlook when we update our medium-term guidance. It will be a great opportunity to get to know our management team and see some of our products in action. With that, let me turn the call back to Frank.\nFrank Bisignano: Thanks, Bob. I\u2019d like to acknowledge our corporate social responsibility programming because it continues to support better outcomes for our clients, shareholders and associates. You\u2019ll find many examples in our annual CSR report published in May. Highlights this quarter include growth in our employee resource groups and internal mobility; additional grants for small business under our back-to-business program; and awards and recognition as a top employer for veterans and National Guard members. We\u2019re also in the process of submitting data to the Carbon Disclosure Project, or CDP, for the third straight year. Finally, I\u2019d like to leave you with some important perspective from our annual client conference, Forum, which we hosted in June. For the first time since the pandemic, we were able to meet with thousands of clients and prospects in person. Together, they represented over 50% of our revenue from financial institution clients. We hosted education sessions on real-time payments, embedded finance and cloud modernization, and an experience center that showcased key products like CardHub, Digital Banking, Finxact and the new Clover Kitchen Display System. As gratifying as this was, the more meaningful takeaways for me can be summed up in three themes I heard from clients again and again. One, they love our products and they\u2019re ready to spend. Our core banking systems, especially Premier for community banks and DNA, our most modern cloud-enabled core, are coveted by bank and credit union CIOs. Our smaller clients remain largely untouched by the March banking turmoil. And our larger clients have one eye on the regulatory environment and the other on how we can help them accelerate their growth. Two, they are rooting for our innovations. Small and midsized financial institutions see Fiserv as their champion for the latest technology solutions. They\u2019re relying on us for their digital and mobile banking, top-tier features in card services, and data and analytics. Three, they have noted our improved service. We\u2019ve already made strong progress in client service with our relationship management model over the past year. Most recently, as an example of our operational excellence initiative this year, we launched a commitment tracker where clients can view the deliverables we promised and track their progress. It\u2019s the first-of-its-kind in the industry for transparency and accountability, and financial institutions now have one more reason to choose Fiserv. So to conclude, as we approach the anniversary of our merger exactly four years ago this week, we are gratified that our vision and execution have proven out with results that exceeded expectations. From here, the combination of our investment, innovation and talented workforce mean the next four years tend to be even better. And now, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We would now like to open the phone lines for questions. [Operator Instructions] For our first question, we\u2019ll go to the line of Dave Togut from Evercore ISI.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. Good morning. Good to see the acceleration in Clover revenue growth. Noting the long-term plan to continue to accelerate Clover revenue growth, if we zoom in a little closer on to the next, let\u2019s say, 6 to 12 months, would you expect this trend to continue?\nFrank Bisignano: Yes. Thanks, Dave. I mean as you\u2019ve heard us talk over time, we continue to have tons of opportunity, both in the ISV and our day-to-day operating business itself, we expect it to have an acceleration. You\u2019ll see us bringing more software into the product set, vertical solutions. We believe we have a long, long opportunity set in front of us. Remember, we haven\u2019t gone to the back book at all. That\u2019s an opportunity. It\u2019s not anywhere in our guide, that back book opportunity. You should expect us also to continue to add services, and that\u2019s really driving that penetration. So in our vision and in our visibility, we see a continuing acceleration of Clover growth and then we also have international.\nDavid Togut: Thanks for that. Just as a quick follow-up, the 80 issuers that you enabled for card-not-present on STAR and Accel, is there any way you can quantify potential volume from those issuers over the next year or so?\nFrank Bisignano: Well, I\u2019ve been super guarded on this item. As I like to say, we\u2019re in early innings. We can only get volume without enablement. So step 1 is enablement. Step 2 is also, as you heard us talking about, merchants wanting it. And you heard us talked to a few today of large players there. I think as we come closer and we talk at Investor Day, you\u2019ll get better visibility to this. It\u2019s not even early innings, it\u2019s the first at bat, really. But we have demand, we have issuer compliance with us on it and we have opportunity in front of us. And fundamentally, I\u2019d like to say, none of this is in today\u2019s set of numbers or the guide that we\u2019re talking to you about.\nDavid Togut: Understood. Thanks so much.\nFrank Bisignano: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nDarrin Peller: Guys, thanks. Frank, I know you touched on the Forum, but I\u2019d love to just hear your thoughts on demand from the banks right now and just in the context of the environment we\u2019re in going into this quarter as well as volume trends in just merchant, more importantly, consumer trends into July, what you\u2019re seeing across the ecosystem domestically and maybe internationally also.\nFrank Bisignano: Let me talk about Forum because it was our really first post-merger physical Forum. We had done virtual ones, but demand gen at a virtual conference is not very high. The ability for our leadership team to touch thousands of clients, and we made a point of that, lots of listening sessions, lots of meetings. And that\u2019s why I go through those three bullets that their desire to engage and spend is very high. Their desire to have us be part of their embedded strategy to help them grow their bank is very high. We watch the response to the commitment tracker. The fact that we want to lead the industry and meeting our commitments, you could hear somebody who is at the conference like Banc of California yesterday talk on their merger call about the strategic partnership they have with us. Their CIO was there. I heard from their CEO yesterday and their CIO. So we\u2019re part of our clients\u2019 growth strategy. We love driving it. It\u2019s not a core-only play, it\u2019s everything we bring around it. When you look at the acquisitions we\u2019ve done, the receptivity to CardHub through Ondot, then I think you\u2019d find the core competency in this company no longer for tuck-ins, but for acquisitions that we could do at a size and then turn it into a completely different capability. So demand is high, super high. Finxact, the amount of time Finxact got attention at Forum was off the charts. And it is the industry leader in current instances in the space it plays. I think relative to the consumer, they have a lot weighing on them now. They have the student debt issue. They have rising interest rates, and you\u2019ve seen a moderation in volume. You\u2019ve heard it and I think you\u2019ll hear it across the industry, our business \u2013 July is similar to what we saw in the quarter. But our business mix has allowed us to deliver so many other services, leading with Clover, following with the other value-added services that allows us to be able to be in a position we are and we think we\u2019re fortunate and blessed.\nRobert Hau: Darrin, just to add on Forum, as a guy who went to three or four of them pre-merger, so the last time we had in-person, the tone of the conversation and the depth of the conversations was quite different this time. Deep innovation, partnership conversations, a change in customer service that is being experienced by our clients and echo the \u2013 Frank talked about the commitment tracker, our willingness to be very transparent on what we\u2019re doing and why we\u2019re doing it and the openness of our solution, enabling much wider breadth of capability, not only stuff that we bring, and that\u2019s increased over time with our Payments and Fintech segment, both serving financial institutions, but having those open APIs and the Developer Studio that we announced a couple of quarters ago, giving our clients [Multiple Speakers] this.\nFrank Bisignano: Yes, there\u2019s probably \u2013 I\u2019ll just add one other item, maybe two. One is our clients\u2019 willingness to want to engage and talk to us about their innovation needs. It can only \u2013 I\u2019ve said for a long time, innovation happens in the client\u2019s office, not in our Sunnyvale office. And two, needless to say, when you\u2019re in that environment, your pipeline build opportunity in the current and the future is very, very strong, and the amount of follow-up meetings are ever off the charts.\nDarrin Peller: That\u2019s great. Guys, when we \u2013 just my quick follow-up is just back to the spread between volume and revenue at Merchant. If we just took out the things out of your control like gas prices and process and the inflation, for example, and we just focused on pricing and software as a penetration, maybe even just focusing on the customers that are \u2013 you\u2019re just processing for and have low revenue, how do we think about sustainability of those factors driving better revenue and for how long?\nRobert Hau: Look, obviously, we believe the opportunity to continue to add value-added services and deepen that penetration. In our Merchant investor call, geez, a little more than a year ago now, we talked about Clover mass penetration reaching 25% by 2025. We\u2019re off to a good start. We continue to focus on it. We continue to develop new capabilities there, and so we see that as an ongoing growth engine. And in terms of pricing, it\u2019s about value-add pricing. It\u2019s delivering the value to the client and then getting paid for that. So value-add pricing is sustainable. There\u2019s certainly an element of a benefit of inflation in a different environment today. But we\u2019re, quite frankly, we\u2019re much more focused on creating that value for our clients and then being paid for it.\nFrank Bisignano: Yes. And I mean just a very simple way of thinking here, we like to add merchants and we like to add them with multiple products and continue to sell products into our back book also.\nDarrin Peller: Makes sense. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hey, thanks. Nice results here. Frank, I know you called out LatAm as a standout. You guys have had good results there. I mean just love your thoughts on some of the recent M&A in the region with Visa buying Pismo. I think EVERTEC also bought a fintech platform. Is there anything going on there that might change things competitively?\nFrank Bisignano: Well, I\u2019d go back to our Brazil business, which really is the largest business in Latin America and the rest of the region keys off of, in many ways, was created from scratch organically. And we built that business organically and then done some strategic things. I mean you hear us talking about Software Express, that was a very, very small acquisition that we believe could transcend our business throughout Latin America. We added tremendous banking franchises. I mean you look at what we talked about on Caixa here, right, we talked about the first leg of that, which was a very large deal that put us in fundamentally every city in Brazil with the leading bank in terms of size and scale. And then we came back \u2013 because of such a good job that we did, right, they came back and we went to work on what fundamentally are, call it, their lottery agencies. And BillPay is taking it and came up with a strategy that would take us to 11% of the payments. So we have great organic capability in Latin America. We brought Clover to Argentina. And we spent a lot of time, and the Argentinian platform changed and allowed it to be a dual acquirer as opposed to a single acquirer. And so those are all strategic things that happened there. So I guess what I\u2019m really saying at the core is when we came into Brazil, we were actually the only U.S. player because everybody had retreated. And we had a deep belief with good leadership on the ground would in fact \u2013 remember, we don\u2019t run an international business. We run three regional businesses, and then we dropped down to a model where country hedge drives the P&L there, but we run global business solutions. So I think our model is strong. I think that the action in these countries has always been going on, Darrin [sic] [Tien-Tsin]. And I think we like our hand, and we believe that these are strategic and will be opportunities for more, Tien-Tsin. So thank you.\nTien-Tsin Huang: No, I appreciate that answer, and I know you guys have really upsold Caixa, so it\u2019s a great case study. My quick follow-up then for Bob, just thinking about the raised revenue and the margins, but no raise in the free cash flow, is this a timing issue given the higher working capital, the CAPI software investments in some of these growth areas? And can we expect free cash conversion to improve beyond fiscal \u201823?\nRobert Hau: Yes, Tien-Tsin, you hit it right on the head. Obviously, we\u2019ve raised the revenue guidance, and so that will bring additional working capital. And of course, as we continue to see opportunities to grow the top line with now nine quarters of consecutive double-digit growth, there\u2019s investment opportunity out there. So we continue to feel quite good at delivering the approximately $3.8 billion and see the benefit of that as working capital comes in and gets collected.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Yep. Well done. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nLisa Ellis: Hi, good morning. Thanks, guys. I wanted to ask about Carat. You highlighted Carat was up 6% as reported, 14% excluding the one client roll-off there. Can you give us a little additional color, one, on just how we should be thinking about the scale of Carat within the Merchant business, either on sort of a revenue or a volume basis? I know it\u2019s like a subset of the enterprise segment, which you\u2019ve disclosed. And then also just elaborate a little bit on competitively how you see this platform is differentiated and whether or not Carat is \u2013 what this \u2013 is this mostly like new client sales? Or is a lot of this migrating existing enterprise clients onto an omni-platform? Just a little bit of elaboration there would be great. Thank you.\nFrank Bisignano: Hey, thanks, Lisa. Thank you very much. I think, first of all, think of Carat as a go-to-market product for both our current book coming over, but that has not been where we\u2019ve focused the growth effort. Sitting under it is an orchestration layer, which is created as Commerce Hub. And those first migrations will begin probably in the fourth quarter through the rest of time. And those will be new client migrations, right? This is a customized solution for the client that gives them total flexibility. I mean, look, we think it\u2019s a double-digit \u2013 clear double-digit growth engine for us. We think it will scale over time. You should think about it, as we talked about over time, what type of e-com business we have total, obviously, enterprise piece is smaller than our total piece that we\u2019ve talked about to you all. And I think you should think about it as a business that will continue to be powerful, call it several hundred millions of dollars growing double digits. And so hopefully, that frames the size of the opportunity. We have a large pipeline on it. We\u2019re in execution mode. And we think, much like we believe Clover has become an industry leader, we believe Carat will be the industry leader.\nLisa Ellis: Great. Thank you. And then my follow-up, also just staying within Merchant for a second. If I think back to the deep dive you did on Merchant a year-and-a-half ago, I think you were expecting the processing piece of Merchant to be sort of flattish through 2025. In light of what you called out today, the sort of roll-off of one of \u2013 or at least a portion of one of your big processing clients, does that sort of change that outlook? Or maybe taking a step back sort of strategically, how are you thinking about the role of your processing business within Merchant going forward as you\u2019re seeing such strong growth from Clover? Thank you.\nFrank Bisignano: Yes. I think nothing has changed in our point of view. And maybe we could step back here to the day that Stripe left us. Maybe I remember it more, I announced to you that Stripe is leaving as a processing client within a JV. And I think people really thought, wow, but it ended up fine. If you think back, we continue to add processing clients. In many cases, sometimes we help processing clients grow and they leave other services with us. So I treat processing like it\u2019s that $1 billion business and it\u2019s fundamentally flat, and there\u2019s been adds. And you have large scale to lease, but it has very little processing revenue impact because of how you all \u2013 why I always try to talk us off this volume versus revenue issue because we have a lot of processing volume, but it\u2019s not the largest part of our business. So I would think about it exactly how we presented it. We will have volume leave on a quarter and we add volume back at other points in time. Does that make sense?\nLisa Ellis: Yes. Thank you. Thanks a lot.\nFrank Bisignano: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJason Kupferberg: Thanks, guys. I just wanted to stay on Merchant to start. Can you put a finer point on where you expect Merchant revenue growth to land for the full year? And just as we start tuning back half of the year models, how much will this spread between revenue growth and volume growth potentially shrink in Q4 as you lap some of the discrete pricing actions you have taken?\nRobert Hau: Yes, Jason, from an overall standpoint outlook for the balance \u2013 or for the full year, we previously guided 10% to 13% for 2023 on an organic basis. Now given the strength that we\u2019ve seen in the first half and an improved outlook for the second half of the year and people still talking about recession, but more people are talking about a recession in 2024, the term soft landing is starting to come into lexicon periodically. I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re quite there yet, but we\u2019ll see what the Fed does today. But things have certainly modestly improved in terms of the expectation for the second half of the year. So we now think the full year will be in the, call it, the 14% to 17% organic growth rate for our Merchant business. Continue to see good performance across the gamut with Clover continuing to perform quite well in terms of continuing the value-added service capability and the penetration of BaaS into the Clover portfolio and some of the things you\u2019ve heard us talk about, both in the prepared remarks and earlier in the Q&A around the Carat and international growth providing a nice lift there.\nJason Kupferberg: And just on that spread narrowing potentially in Q4, just any modeling help you want to give us on that, so we don\u2019t get caught offside there?\nRobert Hau: In terms of volume versus revenue spread?\nJason Kupferberg: Yes, exactly, just because some of the discrete pricing actions you took last year, I believe, in Q4.\nRobert Hau: Yes. And obviously, there\u2019s lots of puts and takes, and then we continue to try to drive folks into focusing on revenue. There\u2019s more and more revenue that is not tied directly to volume, and we\u2019ve now been showing that quarter in and quarter out. So I think I\u2019ll stick to the 14% to 17% full year outlook, and I feel pretty good about that.\nJason Kupferberg: And just as a follow-up on Fintech, just the visibility on the second half acceleration, I guess, implied in the reiteration of the full year guide and maybe some color on how you see Q3 versus Q4 because I know the comps are pretty lumpy during the back half of the year. Thank you.\nRobert Hau: Yes, definitely. And so we do have good visibility into this space. And to your point, there\u2019s lumpy quarters, as you may recall, and this will play in this \u2013 the third quarter and the fourth quarter. On a comparison this year, we had a what was felt by many as a difficult third quarter last year. And during the third quarter earnings call, we reiterated our full year outlook at 4% to 6% then. Fully expected the fourth quarter to rebound given the timing of both periodic revenue and some \"one-time type\" nonrecurring revenue that we see, what we refer to as in-year activity, particularly when clients are implementing. And we obviously have good visibility into the backlog of our implementation cycle. So we feel good about being able to deliver that 4% to 6%. We recovered and delivered last year quite well. That will drive different comparisons. First half was actually a more difficult comparison than second half last year. And then within the second half, third quarter will be an easier compare than fourth quarter, and so you\u2019ll see some continued lumpiness there. But we feel good about the overall visibility and our ability to deliver that range.\nJason Kupferberg: Thanks, Bob.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Dave Koning from Baird.\nDavid Koning: Yes. Hey, guys, congrats on four years. Great job.\nRobert Hau: Thanks, Dave.\nDavid Koning: And yes, I guess one of the key highlights to me in the quarter, the margins in Merchant, you had one of the best probably ever incremental margins, both year-over-year and sequentially, about 75% of the revenue growth hit the profit line. And I\u2019m just wondering if \u2013 is that sustainable? And what exactly drove that \u2013 what drove such \u2013 is it mix? Or what was that?\nRobert Hau: Yes, we\u2019ve definitely had a good fall-through on that incremental. We saw similar levels fourth quarter of last year and definitely had continuing good fall-through over the last several years as we continue to expand margin pretty meaningfully. And it\u2019s the benefit of overall volume and a scaled business, a very scaled business. And it\u2019s the benefit of productivity, and we continue to drive productivity. Back in \u201819 and \u201820, we used the term synergy, which really is a synonym to productivity in many cases, particularly inside the Merchant business that didn\u2019t have a lot of direct cost synergy as we merged. We drove real productivity, and we continue to do that. So we feel good about margin expansion overall, delivering 150 basis points margin expansion or better this year, up from the 125, and we think there\u2019s continued opportunity here going forward.\nDavid Koning: Great. Thanks. And just a quick follow-up. Clover revenue, about 8% above volume growth. So that\u2019s part of the spread. Is that both product and pricing? And is that sustainable, too?\nRobert Hau: Yes, absolutely. Again, we have a long path of continued penetration of value-added services that very much adds to that \"spread\" between revenue and volume at 16% this quarter, headed to 25% in 2025. And as we continue to provide value to our business customers and allow them to focus on running their business versus handling the payments and all of the ancillary services that are available on our Clover software operating system, that value translates into pricing opportunity and margin for us.\nDavid Koning: Gotcha. Thanks, guys. Great job.\nFrank Bisignano: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBryan Keane: Hi, guys, and let me echo, congratulations on the strong results. Frank, one of the secrets has been the growth you guys have gotten through acquisitions and value-added services and especially looking at the Merchant segment. What\u2019s the pipeline look like for M&A? And are there deals out there you want to make to continue to add and push up revenue growth above volume growth through acquisitions and value-added services?\nFrank Bisignano: Well, I mean we\u2019ve been looking at our history, whether it\u2019s BentoBox, whether it\u2019s Finxact, whether it\u2019s Ondot, right, Software Express, right? That\u2019s why I made my comment, they\u2019re no longer tuck-ins, they\u2019re more horizontal leverage. We have lots of minority investments that we hang out with, we get to know. I think that\u2019s why our success rate. So if you went to the people at Ondot, they\u2019re so delighted on how they integrated into a mobile banking platform that would have never been where they were headed. They were card control only. If you want to get BentoBox, their ability to come across in total. So we stay close to a lot of start-ups. We make minority investments in start-ups. We get to know them and then we get a really good shot at turning them into way more value. We have a fabulous track record of keeping founders. I\u2019m darn proud of that. They become part of the fabric of the company. So yes, I think you should expect us to do more of those, less talk goes on here.\nBryan Keane: Okay, great. I know we\u2019re running a little long. So I\u2019ll pass the line. Thanks.\nFrank Bisignano: Thanks, Bryan.\nRobert Hau: Thanks, Bryan.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Please go ahead.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Thank you. Let me add my congratulations as well on the good quarter. If I can ask, Frank, you mentioned a couple of times over the last few quarters, Clover isn\u2019t necessarily being applied to the back book. Could you talk about the opportunity there? It seems to me, the yield that you\u2019re increasingly getting from Clover, as the capability set increases, is better and better. So if you could talk through that plan, that would be great.\nFrank Bisignano: Yes. I mean, first of all, I think what you\u2019re asking \u2013 you broke up a little bit, but I want to make sure I understood. Are you asking about what we\u2019re going to do at Clover into the back book?\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Yes, that\u2019s what I\u2019m asking, Frank.\nFrank Bisignano: What\u2019s the size of that prize? Well, start at a, when we did our March Investor Day on the Merchant business, there was no Clover back book consideration into that. There was consideration from going into the back book and selling more value-added services. But you should expect us, at some point, to strategically lean in, but that\u2019s an opportunity in front of us. I think we see the ability to actually go into our current Clover client base and bring more software services. And we think, obviously, that continues driving the spread between volume and revenue growth in Clover. But I\u2019ve been on the Clover journey 10 years back to \u2013 maybe it\u2019s really heading to 11-plus years, but really counted right, sorry about that, and that started with a few engineers and a few patents. I still believe we\u2019re in the super early innings in the amount of real estate we have that we can utilize with Clover and the amount of real estate we have inside our client base that can allow us to bring Clover. But go back to it\u2019s fundamentally not in our guide that we gave in last year, and you should expect us to give you a super-duper deep dive on this at Investor Day.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Great. And then a quick question with regard to the sale of the financial reconciliation business. I might have missed it, but what\u2019s the revenue and profit impact of that? I did see the proceeds, $230 million.\nFrank Bisignano: Yes. Let me make a point on that. You will always look at us looking at our strategic position. We believe we\u2019re an industry leader. We have to be a top three player. We want to be prudent about capital allocation and where we deploy our internal capital. And for us and our clients, we were not the industry leader. We did a good job for them. It is not a future growth engine of the company. And so that\u2019s fundamentally how that decision gets made, right? And you will continue to see us do this. You saw us do that with Korea. So I want you to have that framework.\nRobert Hau: And Ashwin, in terms of size, this is a very small business. Order of magnitude, it\u2019s less than 0.2% of last year\u2019s revenue.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nFrank Bisignano: Well, thank you, everyone. Thank you for your attention today. Please feel free to reach out to our IR team with any questions. Look forward to talking to you in the future, and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you all for participating in today\u2019s second quarter earnings conference call. That concludes the call for today. Please disconnect at this time, and have a great rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Frank Bisignano",
            "content": "Thank you, Julie, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss another very good quarter for Fiserv. Our results continue to demonstrate strong performance in revenue and operating income with second quarter organic revenue growth of 10%, led by performance in Merchant Acceptance, particularly in our international regions, and our Payments and Network segment. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.81 was up 16%, and adjusted operating margin of 36.5% was up 300 basis points. All three measures are tracking ahead of our previous guidance for the full year. As we look to the remainder of 2023, we note that economists' expectations have improved for GDP and consumer spending relative to the start of the year. But those economists also forecast a modest macro slowdown from the first half, in part due to higher anticipated unemployment and the reinstatement of student loan repayment. Among our financial institution customers, spending and spending intentions remain healthy even as net interest margins narrow and lending activity eases. Card and non-card payment services, digital banking, IT modernization and data analytics are high-demand services, and financial institutions are looking to us to deliver. With the outperformance in the second quarter, we are once again raising our outlook for the full year. We now expect 2023 organic revenue growth in the range of 9% to 11%, up from 8% to 9% previously. Adjusted operating margin is now forecast to improve at least 150 basis points this year, up from our prior expectation of greater than 125 basis points. With the year-to-date adjusted EPS growth of 14% and the improved revenue and operating margin performance, we are raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance by $0.10 to a new range of $7.40 to $7.50, representing growth of 14% to 16% over 2022. These second quarter results marked our ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit organic revenue growth. We have also repurchased nearly 6% of our shares outstanding over the last 12 months. I am incredibly proud of the strong performance and the hard work, foresight and collaboration that it took to get here. Now I'm focused on sustaining this momentum. There are multiple parts of our business that I consider future growth accelerants. I will touch on five of these today, and then we'll add and elaborate on them at our Investor Day later this year. Bob will provide more details on this later in the call. The first success story with a continuing growth outlook is Clover, our market-leading cloud-based SaaS operating system for small and medium-sized businesses. Revenue is growing more than 20% on $267 billion in annualized payment volume. This is a testament not only to the appeal of the product offering, but to the power of our vast distribution network. Clover has only begun to scratch the surface on the opportunity in vertical-specific solutions, horizontal value-added services and software and international markets. In the restaurant vertical, we expect to offer the full suite of value-added services and point-of-sale solutions for restaurants and QSRs of all sizes next year. And we've begun to build out vertical specialized software solutions for retail and professional services, including partnerships to manage inventory, improve SKU level analytics and manage appointment scheduling. We're also continuing to enhance our ISV partner program, giving our ISVs access to Clover hardware and processing alongside our value-added services. This will support our growth among additional verticals, including businesses in our back book. An example of this is our integration with SalonUltimate, a vertical software platform provider focused on the salon and spa industry, that will provide a broader combined offering to its large merchant base. Clover now accounts for approximately 25% of our Merchant revenue and remains on track to reach 35% by 2025, in line with our targets for $10 billion in total Merchant revenue and $3.5 billion in Clover revenue by 2025, implying an expected growth acceleration. Following in the footsteps of Clover is Carat, our unified commerce offering for omni-channel merchants. Like Clover, Carat is an operating system that delivers both payments and experiences, but instead of small businesses, Carat is for the world's leading brands and large enterprises. Carat has been posting revenue growth in the mid-teens on the strength of Fiserv's scale, flexibility and customization capability, plus key integrated services and broad payment options. We recently released our two biggest differentiators for Carat: Commerce Hub, which is the orchestration layer that enables easy client access to our products and services; and a data and insights command center that lets clients manage their data in real-time to better engage end customers and improve operating efficiencies. Over time, as with Clover, we'll add more first and third-party value-added services and payment flows and increase accessibility around the world. A third area of growth is digital payments and the intersection with digital banking. CardHub is our card account product for debit card issuers that offers all of the newest features for cardholders to manage their accounts. It helps out small and midsized bank issuer clients offer their customers the same cutting-edge functionality as the largest independent card issuers. We're about halfway through migrating financial institution clients onto CardHub where they can integrate with our digital mobile banking product, Mobiliti, and with competing digital banking providers. This migration has shown a doubling of customer adoption on CardHub in the first year, which means greater card usage, reduced call center activity and better security. Ensuring new clients to our digital banking solutions, we then tend to bundle our debit processing, debit network and risk services. The full integration of CardHub and Mobiliti is an investment unique at Fiserv because it spans two operating segments, Payments and Fintech, where others don't participate. Our card solution was strengthened by two acquisitions, Ondot and SpendLabs, in 2021. And it's just one example of the many cross-selling opportunities specific to Fiserv given our integration work and breadth of capability. A fourth growth area is Latin America. Although we haven't spoken in depth about our international operations, Latin America has been a standout grower in recent quarters, and we believe it can remain so for the long term. We've built a leading franchise across multiple countries and leading financial institutions that spans our product set from merchant acceptance to card issuing to fintech. The region is about 6% of total company adjusted revenue. And in Merchant Acceptance, it's 10% of adjusted revenue. It's largely driven by Argentina and Brazil followed by Mexico, Colombia and several others. Argentina has garnered attention lately for 100%-plus inflation. And while this has certainly contributed to some of our Merchant segment's strength, a bigger and more sustainable part of the growth comes from anticipation revenue, also known as merchant prepayments. This is where we help merchants navigate the long settlement variance in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay by funding their payment receivables early at a discounted rate. Businesses get better liquidity, and we receive a spread that carries low risk. Other parts of our LatAm business shows strong momentum as well. We will be expanding our relationship with our partner, Caixa Econo\u0302mica Federal, enabling card payment for their more than 13,000 bill payment agencies throughout Brazil. Fiserv solution will allow agencies to extend bill payment options from only cash and Caixa debit cards today to all credit, debit and prepaid cards. The opportunity is meaningful when considering that in 2022, this agent network enabled bill payments equal to about 11% of all credit and debit payments in Brazil. We are also enabling PIX transactions in Brazil in the P2B space, utilizing our Software Express platform and expanding our presence in PIX beyond P2B. We have also made PIX payments capability available in our large acquiring network in Argentina, supporting Brazilians visiting this neighboring country. We're excited for the opportunities presented by PIX, and it has already exceeded total card sales volume in Brazil in a short period of time. A fifth opportunity is Finxact. Finxact is the acquisition we made in April of last year to offer a next-generation core banking system that's cloud-native. It gives us the opportunity to compete and win with financial institutions of all sizes and across geographies, expanding our total addressable market. Our three-prong strategy is to win digital-first banks, provide next-generation core banking through our existing FI clients and add larger banks as clients often starting as they launch new products in the cloud. Another opportunity in Finxact that's coming together now actually started many years ago. We were an initial investor in Finxact when it began raising money in 2017 because we saw value in marrying a merchant processing platform with a back-office banking platform. Today, that's called embedded finance, and we are beginning to tap into the opportunity as merchants look to offer banking services to their customers. Their goal is typically to provide more purchasing power and payment flexibility to their customers while creating deeper relationships. Embedded finance will add to the many payment and banking solutions that merchants want to offer and we already provide. Here are some examples. We deliver stored value and gift card solutions to many of the world's leading brands. We're the largest private label credit card provider, and we are the processor behind most HSA and FSA accounts. Finxact is the single ledger and issuing platform for products like debit cards and DDAs. And from here, we're investing in the connectivity between platforms to create a more seamless experience for our clients and their end customers. Now let me turn the discussion over to Bob for more detail on our financial results. Thanks, Bob. I'd like to acknowledge our corporate social responsibility programming because it continues to support better outcomes for our clients, shareholders and associates. You'll find many examples in our annual CSR report published in May. Highlights this quarter include growth in our employee resource groups and internal mobility; additional grants for small business under our back-to-business program; and awards and recognition as a top employer for veterans and National Guard members. We're also in the process of submitting data to the Carbon Disclosure Project, or CDP, for the third straight year. Finally, I'd like to leave you with some important perspective from our annual client conference, Forum, which we hosted in June. For the first time since the pandemic, we were able to meet with thousands of clients and prospects in person. Together, they represented over 50% of our revenue from financial institution clients. We hosted education sessions on real-time payments, embedded finance and cloud modernization, and an experience center that showcased key products like CardHub, Digital Banking, Finxact and the new Clover Kitchen Display System. As gratifying as this was, the more meaningful takeaways for me can be summed up in three themes I heard from clients again and again. One, they love our products and they're ready to spend. Our core banking systems, especially Premier for community banks and DNA, our most modern cloud-enabled core, are coveted by bank and credit union CIOs. Our smaller clients remain largely untouched by the March banking turmoil. And our larger clients have one eye on the regulatory environment and the other on how we can help them accelerate their growth. Two, they are rooting for our innovations. Small and midsized financial institutions see Fiserv as their champion for the latest technology solutions. They're relying on us for their digital and mobile banking, top-tier features in card services, and data and analytics. Three, they have noted our improved service. We've already made strong progress in client service with our relationship management model over the past year. Most recently, as an example of our operational excellence initiative this year, we launched a commitment tracker where clients can view the deliverables we promised and track their progress. It's the first-of-its-kind in the industry for transparency and accountability, and financial institutions now have one more reason to choose Fiserv. So to conclude, as we approach the anniversary of our merger exactly four years ago this week, we are gratified that our vision and execution have proven out with results that exceeded expectations. From here, the combination of our investment, innovation and talented workforce mean the next four years tend to be even better. And now, operator, please open the line for questions. Yes. Thanks, Dave. I mean as you've heard us talk over time, we continue to have tons of opportunity, both in the ISV and our day-to-day operating business itself, we expect it to have an acceleration. You'll see us bringing more software into the product set, vertical solutions. We believe we have a long, long opportunity set in front of us. Remember, we haven't gone to the back book at all. That's an opportunity. It's not anywhere in our guide, that back book opportunity. You should expect us also to continue to add services, and that's really driving that penetration. So in our vision and in our visibility, we see a continuing acceleration of Clover growth and then we also have international. Well, I've been super guarded on this item. As I like to say, we're in early innings. We can only get volume without enablement. So step 1 is enablement. Step 2 is also, as you heard us talking about, merchants wanting it. And you heard us talked to a few today of large players there. I think as we come closer and we talk at Investor Day, you'll get better visibility to this. It's not even early innings, it's the first at bat, really. But we have demand, we have issuer compliance with us on it and we have opportunity in front of us. And fundamentally, I'd like to say, none of this is in today's set of numbers or the guide that we're talking to you about. Thank you. Let me talk about Forum because it was our really first post-merger physical Forum. We had done virtual ones, but demand gen at a virtual conference is not very high. The ability for our leadership team to touch thousands of clients, and we made a point of that, lots of listening sessions, lots of meetings. And that's why I go through those three bullets that their desire to engage and spend is very high. Their desire to have us be part of their embedded strategy to help them grow their bank is very high. We watch the response to the commitment tracker. The fact that we want to lead the industry and meeting our commitments, you could hear somebody who is at the conference like Banc of California yesterday talk on their merger call about the strategic partnership they have with us. Their CIO was there. I heard from their CEO yesterday and their CIO. So we're part of our clients' growth strategy. We love driving it. It's not a core-only play, it's everything we bring around it. When you look at the acquisitions we've done, the receptivity to CardHub through Ondot, then I think you'd find the core competency in this company no longer for tuck-ins, but for acquisitions that we could do at a size and then turn it into a completely different capability. So demand is high, super high. Finxact, the amount of time Finxact got attention at Forum was off the charts. And it is the industry leader in current instances in the space it plays. I think relative to the consumer, they have a lot weighing on them now. They have the student debt issue. They have rising interest rates, and you've seen a moderation in volume. You've heard it and I think you'll hear it across the industry, our business \u2013 July is similar to what we saw in the quarter. But our business mix has allowed us to deliver so many other services, leading with Clover, following with the other value-added services that allows us to be able to be in a position we are and we think we're fortunate and blessed. Yes, there's probably \u2013 I'll just add one other item, maybe two. One is our clients' willingness to want to engage and talk to us about their innovation needs. It can only \u2013 I've said for a long time, innovation happens in the client's office, not in our Sunnyvale office. And two, needless to say, when you're in that environment, your pipeline build opportunity in the current and the future is very, very strong, and the amount of follow-up meetings are ever off the charts. Yes. And I mean just a very simple way of thinking here, we like to add merchants and we like to add them with multiple products and continue to sell products into our back book also. Well, I'd go back to our Brazil business, which really is the largest business in Latin America and the rest of the region keys off of, in many ways, was created from scratch organically. And we built that business organically and then done some strategic things. I mean you hear us talking about Software Express, that was a very, very small acquisition that we believe could transcend our business throughout Latin America. We added tremendous banking franchises. I mean you look at what we talked about on Caixa here, right, we talked about the first leg of that, which was a very large deal that put us in fundamentally every city in Brazil with the leading bank in terms of size and scale. And then we came back \u2013 because of such a good job that we did, right, they came back and we went to work on what fundamentally are, call it, their lottery agencies. And BillPay is taking it and came up with a strategy that would take us to 11% of the payments. So we have great organic capability in Latin America. We brought Clover to Argentina. And we spent a lot of time, and the Argentinian platform changed and allowed it to be a dual acquirer as opposed to a single acquirer. And so those are all strategic things that happened there. So I guess what I'm really saying at the core is when we came into Brazil, we were actually the only U.S. player because everybody had retreated. And we had a deep belief with good leadership on the ground would in fact \u2013 remember, we don't run an international business. We run three regional businesses, and then we dropped down to a model where country hedge drives the P&L there, but we run global business solutions. So I think our model is strong. I think that the action in these countries has always been going on, Darrin [sic] [Tien-Tsin]. And I think we like our hand, and we believe that these are strategic and will be opportunities for more, Tien-Tsin. So thank you. Hey, thanks, Lisa. Thank you very much. I think, first of all, think of Carat as a go-to-market product for both our current book coming over, but that has not been where we've focused the growth effort. Sitting under it is an orchestration layer, which is created as Commerce Hub. And those first migrations will begin probably in the fourth quarter through the rest of time. And those will be new client migrations, right? This is a customized solution for the client that gives them total flexibility. I mean, look, we think it's a double-digit \u2013 clear double-digit growth engine for us. We think it will scale over time. You should think about it, as we talked about over time, what type of e-com business we have total, obviously, enterprise piece is smaller than our total piece that we've talked about to you all. And I think you should think about it as a business that will continue to be powerful, call it several hundred millions of dollars growing double digits. And so hopefully, that frames the size of the opportunity. We have a large pipeline on it. We're in execution mode. And we think, much like we believe Clover has become an industry leader, we believe Carat will be the industry leader. Yes. I think nothing has changed in our point of view. And maybe we could step back here to the day that Stripe left us. Maybe I remember it more, I announced to you that Stripe is leaving as a processing client within a JV. And I think people really thought, wow, but it ended up fine. If you think back, we continue to add processing clients. In many cases, sometimes we help processing clients grow and they leave other services with us. So I treat processing like it's that $1 billion business and it's fundamentally flat, and there's been adds. And you have large scale to lease, but it has very little processing revenue impact because of how you all \u2013 why I always try to talk us off this volume versus revenue issue because we have a lot of processing volume, but it's not the largest part of our business. So I would think about it exactly how we presented it. We will have volume leave on a quarter and we add volume back at other points in time. Does that make sense? Thank you. Thank you. Well, I mean we've been looking at our history, whether it's BentoBox, whether it's Finxact, whether it's Ondot, right, Software Express, right? That's why I made my comment, they're no longer tuck-ins, they're more horizontal leverage. We have lots of minority investments that we hang out with, we get to know. I think that's why our success rate. So if you went to the people at Ondot, they're so delighted on how they integrated into a mobile banking platform that would have never been where they were headed. They were card control only. If you want to get BentoBox, their ability to come across in total. So we stay close to a lot of start-ups. We make minority investments in start-ups. We get to know them and then we get a really good shot at turning them into way more value. We have a fabulous track record of keeping founders. I'm darn proud of that. They become part of the fabric of the company. So yes, I think you should expect us to do more of those, less talk goes on here. Thanks, Bryan. Yes. I mean, first of all, I think what you're asking \u2013 you broke up a little bit, but I want to make sure I understood. Are you asking about what we're going to do at Clover into the back book? What's the size of that prize? Well, start at a, when we did our March Investor Day on the Merchant business, there was no Clover back book consideration into that. There was consideration from going into the back book and selling more value-added services. But you should expect us, at some point, to strategically lean in, but that's an opportunity in front of us. I think we see the ability to actually go into our current Clover client base and bring more software services. And we think, obviously, that continues driving the spread between volume and revenue growth in Clover. But I've been on the Clover journey 10 years back to \u2013 maybe it's really heading to 11-plus years, but really counted right, sorry about that, and that started with a few engineers and a few patents. I still believe we're in the super early innings in the amount of real estate we have that we can utilize with Clover and the amount of real estate we have inside our client base that can allow us to bring Clover. But go back to it's fundamentally not in our guide that we gave in last year, and you should expect us to give you a super-duper deep dive on this at Investor Day. Yes. Let me make a point on that. You will always look at us looking at our strategic position. We believe we're an industry leader. We have to be a top three player. We want to be prudent about capital allocation and where we deploy our internal capital. And for us and our clients, we were not the industry leader. We did a good job for them. It is not a future growth engine of the company. And so that's fundamentally how that decision gets made, right? And you will continue to see us do this. You saw us do that with Korea. So I want you to have that framework. Well, thank you, everyone. Thank you for your attention today. Please feel free to reach out to our IR team with any questions. Look forward to talking to you in the future, and have a great day."

            "name": "Robert Hau",
            "content": "Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. If you're following along on our slides, I'll cover details on total company and segment performance, starting with our financial metrics and trends on Slide 4. As Frank said, our second quarter was a very good one and marked our ninth quarter in a row of double-digit organic revenue growth. Total company organic revenue growth was 10% in the quarter with strong growth across Merchant Acceptance and Payments and Network. Year-to-date, total company organic revenue grew 11%, led by the Merchant Acceptance segment which grew 16%. Our three international regions also continued to perform well, growing 31% organically in the second quarter. We saw strong growth in the issuer solutions revenue across all three regions and robust gains in Latin America for our Merchant segment. As Frank explained, while Argentina inflation grabs the headlines, the bigger driver of our growth here is anticipation revenue, reflecting a newer business for us in Merchant prepayments. In the near future, inflation in Argentina may ease, but it's likely to stay persistently high relative to the rest of the world. Our broad franchise, new lines of business and strong growth in the rest of the region should balance out any single country's macroeconomic issues. Second quarter total company adjusted revenue grew 6% to $4.5 billion and adjusted operating income grew 16% to $1.6 billion, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 36.5%, an increase of 300 basis points versus the prior year. For the first half of the year, adjusted revenue grew 8% to $8.8 billion and adjusted operating income increased 16% to $3.1 billion, resulting in adjusted operating margin of 35.1%, an increase of 240 basis points versus last year and tracking ahead of our 2023 guidance. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter increased 16% to $1.81 compared to $1.56 in the prior year. Year-to-date through June 30, adjusted earnings per share increased 14% to $3.38 at the high end of our 12% to 14% annual guidance range. Free cash flow came in at $608 million for the quarter and $1.5 billion for the first six months of the year, up 16% year-to-date. Our free cash flow remains on track to reach $3.8 billion this year, and we've retained line of sight to accelerating cash flow generation in the second half as is typical for our business. Now looking to our segment results starting on Slide 5. Organic revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was a strong 14% in the quarter and 16% year-to-date. Adjusted revenue growth in the quarter was 9% and 10% for the first half. Merchant volume and transactions grew 1% compared to prior year. This lower volume performance reflects two temporary factors. First is the decline in retail fuel prices of 27% on average in the quarter, which creates a tough comparison for petrol merchant volume growth. The second is related to some strategic realignment among large processing clients that's impacting their volumes and represents a large portion of our processing-only volume. Excluding these two isolated factors, volume growth would have been 4%. It's important to note that volume changes for both petrol and processing-only clients had very little impact on our revenue since petrol clients typically pay per transaction and processing carries very low fees. Nevertheless, they are big contributors to volume and thus the spread between our volume growth and revenue growth is particularly wide now. This should moderate over time. Other factors contributing to the wider spread are rising penetration of software and services and pricing benefits from both higher inflation and added value. We expect these to be positive contributors to revenue on an ongoing basis. Clover, our operating system for small- and medium-sized businesses, continues to build on the strength of its growing product offering to attract and retain more merchants and expand our revenue opportunity with them. Clover posted a strong 23% revenue growth for the quarter and 22% year-to-date. Quarterly Clover GPV was $67 billion and $267 billion on an annualized basis, up 15%. Value-added services penetration was 16%, 1 point above year-ago levels and on track to achieve our 25% target by 2025. We signed 40 ISVs this quarter, bringing our total signed to 77 year-to-date. Our momentum is starting to build with PayFac as well with the signing of Waystar and Pay Theory during the second quarter. Clover Sport added a relationship with a large service provider for the Cleveland Browns Stadium and other venues. Carat, our omni-commerce operating system for enterprise clients, grew revenue 6% in the second quarter. Excluding the loss of a Latin America processing client that began taking its business in-house, Carat grew 14%. While our relationship with the client remains good, we're focused on growing our higher-value direct business. The underlying Carat business remains strong. We've expanded our merchant processing relationship with Inspire Brands, the second-largest restaurant company in the United States, to include several more of their restaurant concepts while continuing our relationship with their Dunkin', Baskin-Robbins and Sonic brands. The agreement will add several thousand additional restaurant locations to our processing portfolio. Adjusted operating income in the Acceptance segment increased 21% to $718 million in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was up 350 basis points to 34.7%. Year-to-date, adjusted operating income improved 20% to $1.3 billion, and adjusted operating margin grew 280 basis points to 32.7%. Turning to Slide 6. The Payments and Network segment posted organic revenue growth of 9% in the quarter, once again above the high end of the 5% to 8% medium-term guidance range. Notable growth drivers in the segment included active accounts on file in North American credit processing business; the Output Solutions business; our debit networks, STAR and Accel; and Zelle, led by continued growth in both the number of clients and transaction growth. As we've said, we expect tough comparisons through the rest of the year as we anniversary a large new client onboarding completed in mid-2022. Still, we anticipate the full year organic revenue growth rate to be towards the high end of our medium-term outlook of 5% to 8%. Also notable for this segment, two new payments initiatives took effect this month, offering incremental revenue opportunities for Fiserv over time. First, July 1 was the effective date of the Fed's final rule clarifying parts of Regulation II to make explicit that at least two debit network routing options are required for card-not-present transactions. For our STAR and Accel debit networks, which have been supporting CNP for years, this led to more than 80 of our current issuing clients enabling card-not-present, adding active cards for e-commerce transactions. This is a growth opportunity that we did not previously have. We also won several large e-commerce merchants as clients, including, in the second quarter, Lyft, ADT and T-Mobile. Last week, the Fed launched its real-time payment system, FedNow. So we are now live with six banks in the pilot phase and more than 70 committed to go live so far this year. We are encouraged by the opportunity to add more financial institutions since more than 1,000 of them are already connected to our NOW Network for Zelle, providing a single point of integration that could be leveraged by FIs to easily add new rails. That's a major differentiator for Fiserv. But the key to FedNow adoption is compelling use cases, which we think will grow over time, most likely in commercial payments and bill pay spaces. Adjusted operating income for the segment was up 17% to $782 million and adjusted operating margin was up 360 basis points to 47.4% in the quarter, driven by our strong revenue growth and productivity. Year-to-date, adjusted operating income was up 16% to $1.5 billion and adjusted operating margin was up 240 basis points to 45.6%. Moving to Slide 7. Organic revenue in the Financial Technology segment declined 1% in the second quarter, resulting in 1% growth for the first half. High periodic revenue in the second quarter of 2022 drove a difficult comparison this quarter, creating a 3-point headwind. We continue to expect organic growth within the guidance range of 4% to 6% this year as in-year revenue is booked and implementation work on prior wins is completed. Adjusted operating income was up 1% in the quarter to $285 million and up 2% to $565 million year-to-date. Adjusted operating margin in the segment increased 130 basis points to 36.3% in the quarter. For the first half, the segment's adjusted operating margin grew 60 basis points to 35.8%. We added 10 new core account processing clients in the quarter, including four wins for DNA, our market-recognized leading modern core banking platform for banks and credit unions. Fintech showcased its extensibility as an enabler of embedded finance with the win at Pay Theory. This payment facilitator serves the education and the health care sectors and plans to enable a suite of banking-as-a-service and money movement capabilities for its vertical SaaS partners. We are integrating Fintech with our merchant PFAC platform to enable Pay Theory to extend its vertical SaaS capability to banking and payments. Our goal is to provide a single integration for vertical SaaS providers who want to leverage assets across our banking, payments and merchant businesses. The adjusted corporate operating loss was $142 million in the quarter and $264 million year-to-date. The slight increase over the first half last year is largely impacted by expenses tied to our client conference, which we held in-person for the first time since the pandemic. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 20.6% and was 19.8% for the first half. We continue to expect the adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 20% for the full year. Total outstanding debt was $23.2 billion on June 30, and the debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio was 2.9 times. During the second quarter, we issued \u20ac800 million of eight-year senior notes to replace notes that matured in early July and reduced our commercial paper program balances. Variable rate debt sits at 13% of total. During the quarter, we continued our disciplined capital allocation strategy, repurchasing 8.6 million shares for $1 billion and 21.8 million shares for $2.5 billion over the last six months. We had 70.1 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase at the end of the quarter. As we continue to optimize our vast product portfolio for value and strategic fit, yesterday, we completed the sale of two financial reconciliation products to Trintech for roughly $230 million. We are fully committed to our longstanding disciplined approach to capital allocation, which includes investing in our businesses organically, maintaining a strong balance sheet, returning cash to shareholders through share repurchase and pursuing high-value and innovative acquisitions. And wrapping up on Slide 8. First half organic revenue growth was well ahead of our prior guidance for the full year, so we are again raising the range from 8% to 9%, to 9% to 11%, which considers economists' range of second half outcomes. Based on the strong second quarter results and higher anticipated organic revenue growth, we are raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance range once again from the previous $7.30 to $7.40 to a new range of $7.40 to $7.50, representing growth of 14% to 16% over 2022. This includes a higher adjusted operating margin now expected to improve at least 150 basis points this year, up from our prior guidance of greater than 125 basis points. Lastly, we're excited to announce our upcoming Investor Day in New York City on Wednesday, November 15, so please save the date. We'll spend time going deeper on our growth strategies, and you'll see how they factor into our outlook when we update our medium-term guidance. It will be a great opportunity to get to know our management team and see some of our products in action. With that, let me turn the call back to Frank. Darrin, just to add on Forum, as a guy who went to three or four of them pre-merger, so the last time we had in-person, the tone of the conversation and the depth of the conversations was quite different this time. Deep innovation, partnership conversations, a change in customer service that is being experienced by our clients and echo the \u2013 Frank talked about the commitment tracker, our willingness to be very transparent on what we're doing and why we're doing it and the openness of our solution, enabling much wider breadth of capability, not only stuff that we bring, and that's increased over time with our Payments and Fintech segment, both serving financial institutions, but having those open APIs and the Developer Studio that we announced a couple of quarters ago, giving our clients [Multiple Speakers] this. Look, obviously, we believe the opportunity to continue to add value-added services and deepen that penetration. In our Merchant investor call, geez, a little more than a year ago now, we talked about Clover mass penetration reaching 25% by 2025. We're off to a good start. We continue to focus on it. We continue to develop new capabilities there, and so we see that as an ongoing growth engine. And in terms of pricing, it's about value-add pricing. It's delivering the value to the client and then getting paid for that. So value-add pricing is sustainable. There's certainly an element of a benefit of inflation in a different environment today. But we're, quite frankly, we're much more focused on creating that value for our clients and then being paid for it. Yes, Tien-Tsin, you hit it right on the head. Obviously, we've raised the revenue guidance, and so that will bring additional working capital. And of course, as we continue to see opportunities to grow the top line with now nine quarters of consecutive double-digit growth, there's investment opportunity out there. So we continue to feel quite good at delivering the approximately $3.8 billion and see the benefit of that as working capital comes in and gets collected. Yes, Jason, from an overall standpoint outlook for the balance \u2013 or for the full year, we previously guided 10% to 13% for 2023 on an organic basis. Now given the strength that we've seen in the first half and an improved outlook for the second half of the year and people still talking about recession, but more people are talking about a recession in 2024, the term soft landing is starting to come into lexicon periodically. I'm not sure we're quite there yet, but we'll see what the Fed does today. But things have certainly modestly improved in terms of the expectation for the second half of the year. So we now think the full year will be in the, call it, the 14% to 17% organic growth rate for our Merchant business. Continue to see good performance across the gamut with Clover continuing to perform quite well in terms of continuing the value-added service capability and the penetration of BaaS into the Clover portfolio and some of the things you've heard us talk about, both in the prepared remarks and earlier in the Q&A around the Carat and international growth providing a nice lift there. In terms of volume versus revenue spread? Yes. And obviously, there's lots of puts and takes, and then we continue to try to drive folks into focusing on revenue. There's more and more revenue that is not tied directly to volume, and we've now been showing that quarter in and quarter out. So I think I'll stick to the 14% to 17% full year outlook, and I feel pretty good about that. Yes, definitely. And so we do have good visibility into this space. And to your point, there's lumpy quarters, as you may recall, and this will play in this \u2013 the third quarter and the fourth quarter. On a comparison this year, we had a what was felt by many as a difficult third quarter last year. And during the third quarter earnings call, we reiterated our full year outlook at 4% to 6% then. Fully expected the fourth quarter to rebound given the timing of both periodic revenue and some \"one-time type\" nonrecurring revenue that we see, what we refer to as in-year activity, particularly when clients are implementing. And we obviously have good visibility into the backlog of our implementation cycle. So we feel good about being able to deliver that 4% to 6%. We recovered and delivered last year quite well. That will drive different comparisons. First half was actually a more difficult comparison than second half last year. And then within the second half, third quarter will be an easier compare than fourth quarter, and so you'll see some continued lumpiness there. But we feel good about the overall visibility and our ability to deliver that range. Thanks, Dave. Yes, we've definitely had a good fall-through on that incremental. We saw similar levels fourth quarter of last year and definitely had continuing good fall-through over the last several years as we continue to expand margin pretty meaningfully. And it's the benefit of overall volume and a scaled business, a very scaled business. And it's the benefit of productivity, and we continue to drive productivity. Back in \u201819 and \u201820, we used the term synergy, which really is a synonym to productivity in many cases, particularly inside the Merchant business that didn't have a lot of direct cost synergy as we merged. We drove real productivity, and we continue to do that. So we feel good about margin expansion overall, delivering 150 basis points margin expansion or better this year, up from the 125, and we think there's continued opportunity here going forward. Yes, absolutely. Again, we have a long path of continued penetration of value-added services that very much adds to that \"spread\" between revenue and volume at 16% this quarter, headed to 25% in 2025. And as we continue to provide value to our business customers and allow them to focus on running their business versus handling the payments and all of the ancillary services that are available on our Clover software operating system, that value translates into pricing opportunity and margin for us. Thanks, Bryan. And Ashwin, in terms of size, this is a very small business. Order of magnitude, it's less than 0.2% of last year's revenue."

At this time, I will turn the call over to Julie Chariell, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. \nJulie Chariell: Thank you, and good morning. With me on the call today are Frank Bisignano, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. \n Our earnings release and supplemental materials for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Please refer to these materials for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call, along with the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. Unless otherwise stated, performance references are year-over-year comparisons. \n Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results and strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. You should refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. \n And now over to Frank. \nFrank Bisignano: Thank you, Julie, and thank you all for joining us today. Fiserv is off to a strong start in 2023 with first quarter adjusted revenue growth of 10% and adjusted earnings per share of $1.58, up 13%. Adjusted operating margin of 33.6% was up 160 basis points. Organic revenue growth was 13%, above our 7% to 9% outlook for the full year, demonstrating our ability to sustain accelerated growth. \n Importantly, the growth was multidimensional. It included elevated contributions from card processing, noncard payments and digital banking solutions. Growth was also strong in all 3 of our international regions and in Merchant Acceptance. Investment on behalf of our clients and with our partners is paying off. \n We believe that accelerating our investment over the last 3 years, both organic and via M&A, has extended our leadership position among fintechs. This counters the narrative over the last few years that many start-ups in the payments and fintech space would disrupt and potentially replace the legacy companies. Our results show that our strategy to innovate and disrupt on behalf of, not in place of, our long-standing bank and merchant customers was on the mark. These competitors have indeed raised the bar for the tech and fintech, but we've met and, in some cases, exceeded that bar with our own investment and innovation. \n The power of our business model is in the virtuous cycle of generating revenue growth across a scaled business, leading to greater operating margins. That profit produces significant cash to reinvest in the business for faster organic growth and value-accretive acquisitions while the remainder is returned to shareholders through share repurchase. The market has shown that legacy companies across many industries with scale and willingness to innovate will offer sustainable value to clients and shareholders. \n Let's talk for a moment about how the benefits of our breadth, scale and investment have driven innovation. For small- and medium-sized businesses, we developed a cloud-based SaaS operating system for their payment needs with Clover. Now we're allowing these businesses to easily accept multiple payment types and we are seamlessly integrating software and services to address their broader business needs. \n For large enterprise businesses, we developed an integrated omnichannel system called Carat to manage payment needs across in-store and online sales channels, and we're adding SaaS-based solutions that improve our clients' efficiency and enhance their customers' experiences. \n For debit and credit issuers we've already built the most comprehensive suite of solutions, and we continue to innovate. CardHub was built off of the tools acquired with Ondot and now offers a comprehensive set of modern digital cardholder experiences. More than 1,000 financial institutions are now using CardHub, which can be fully integrated into their mobile banking app, allowing these issuers to offer their customers a unified digital card experience that only a few of the largest financial institutions can provide today. \n SpendTrack does for a bank's small- and medium-sized business clients what CardHub does for its retail customers. This differentiated mobile-first platform covers card management and AI-enabled expense management with workflows specific to their business needs. Built from our SpendLabs acquisition, SpendTrack has helped us win more credit, debit and network business with banks and issuers that cater to SMBs. \n For small- and medium-sized banks, we provide a full suite of the digital banking tools that help them compete with the largest banks from mobile apps, to spend management, to Zelle B2B payments. And in July, with the launch of FedNow will help them participate in the new wave of real-time payments, optimized on our NOW Network that connects banks to each other, to all payment rails and to essential applications. \n For banks of all sizes, we've built a path to the cloud through both our industry-leading DNA core platform, and now at Finxact, our native cloud solution acquired last year. \n And in support of our biggest investment of all, the combination of First Data and Fiserv, we are finding new opportunities across our client base that are aligned in ways that only Fiserv can enable. Here are just 3 examples of the power of our combined franchise. \n First, STAR and Accel, the third largest debit network in the country, helps card issuers and merchants realize attractive economics on debit transaction routing and satisfy new Reg II requirements for at least 2 unaffiliated networks on each card to route card-not-present transactions.  \n Second, our Finxact cloud-native banking core is laying the groundwork as an operating system at scale for financial institutions and merchants looking to offer embedded finance. \n Third, our Output Solutions business offers a full range of capabilities beyond what either a predecessor company had. For example, we are now able to offer communications and card manufacturing solutions to our entire client base from retail private label issuers to general purpose credit issuers, health care providers, banks and governments. \n As we look to the remainder of 2023, we start with a firm foundation of above-plan revenue and earnings. Still, we think it is wise to balance this strong start with the potential for macroeconomic headwinds in the second half of the year. So we are lifting the lower end of our prior 2023 guidance for both organic revenue growth and adjusted EPS and maintaining the upper end at this point. We now anticipate organic revenue growth of 8% to 9% and adjusted earnings per share of $7.30 to $7.40. \n Let's discuss the trends we are seeing in each of our segments now and for the rest of the year. Merchant Acceptance continues to be a very strong grower, posting 18% organic revenue growth in the first quarter, including significant strength in Latin America and Asia and continued gains in North America. This growth reflects overall consumer spending resilience but is also a testament to our strong distribution channels, ability to develop new products and services that resonate, success in selling more solutions to our existing merchants and the power of diversification across verticals, merchant size and geography. \n It's not yet clear whether broader macro headwinds are beginning to impact consumer spending, but we did see payment volume growth slow a bit late in the quarter. We continue to see good demand in the grocery vertical as well as in restaurants, especially QSRs. We've started to see consumers rotate towards nondiscretionary spending and reduced basket size. The decline in inflation is impacting volume growth, particularly in the petro vertical. This did not impact Fiserv revenue, which were large petro providers and other enterprise clients is based on transactions, not dollar volume. \n Our important advantages in this environment are our breadth of distribution, businesses both large and small, and a good mix of nondiscretionary spending, about half of our volume. Still, we are mindful that higher interest rates may weigh on consumers. And thus, we anticipate second quarter revenue growth in this segment to ease from the very strong first quarter levels. This, of course, is contemplated in our guidance. \n Clover revenue growth remains strong, up 22% in the quarter. We continue to add merchants at a healthy pace and extended value-added services penetration another point to 17%. Now 1 year since our Merchant Investor Day, we are on track to achieve the targets we set for 2025, $10 billion in Merchant Acceptance revenue; $3.5 billion in Clover revenue; and Clover value-added services penetration of 25%, where [ Clover ] a consistent average rate of growth over this time period was not in our calculus. Instead, the growth rate should accelerate over the next 3 years as we add more products, increase software penetration, and reach new markets. \n In the first quarter, for instance, we integrated bill pay and enhanced fraud management into Clover and improved access to Clover Capital via our client dashboard. In the past 12 months, we introduced upgraded Clover Mini and Clover Flex hardware. Later this year, we'll add a low-cost smart POS PIN pad to address the needs of smaller merchants who want simpler access to the Clover operating system and software. \n During the quarter, Fiserv launched support for Apple Tap to Pay on iPhone for SMBs on the Clover platform and for U.S. enterprise clients. This will enable businesses from large enterprises through medium and small businesses down to micro merchants, to securely accept contactless payments on iPhones without the need for additional hardware like an external card reader. As contactless payment usage rises, we are excited to enable new and existing clients to use this seamless and secure solution on iPhone to help run and grow their businesses. \n On our Carat platform, we continue to expand our capabilities in broad omnichannel solutions for enterprise merchants. We renewed and expanded our contract scope with several large merchants this quarter, including Fanatics and a major hotel chain. We also recently signed a Pay by Bank agreement with Walmart that includes traditional ACH processing and incorporates Fiserv's NOW Network and real-time payments capabilities. \n Our Payments and Network segment also had a very strong quarter, posting 13% organic revenue growth that included double-digit gains in all 3 business lines, issuer solutions primarily representing credit card issuing and output services. [ Card services ], including debit processing and our debit networks STAR and Accel, and our digital payment services, including Zelle and our bill pay business. This strong performance drove growth that was above our medium-term guidance of 5% to 8% and includes a couple of points of growth from a few discrete factors, which Bob will cover in more detail later. \n Positive trends continue and should carry full year growth towards the high end of the range. Several years of large card issuer wins in North America will drive revenue growth in the coming years with the pipeline that includes new win opportunities as well as follow-on sales to existing clients as we extend our value proposition. \n Our issuer clients have been active in deploying 3 highly innovative products: Advance Defense, our new AI-based fraud solution; new card controls and alerts developed by Ondot; and point-of-sale loan solutions that help issuers compete with BNPL providers. \n Recently, Citi signed on for our POS loan product and PNC went live. [ USAA ] is in the process of implementing Advance Defense, while [ One ] has signed on as well. \n International Issuer Solutions was another bright spot in the quarter with wins across all 3 of our regions. In Latin America, a leading Argentine fintech Uala chose Fiserv to provide credit card processing services for its new digital-first credit card product launch. It's already live in Mexico and will go live at Argentina and Colombia in the coming months. \n Uala shows our FirstVision platform for its local presence and global cloud API gateway that maximizes the digital user experience with APIs for instant card issuing, dynamic verification and installment payments among other services. We're excited about additional opportunities as we roll out the next-generation cloud-based FirstVision platform later this year. \n And in EMEA, we signed a contract with National Bank of Kuwait, the country's largest bank, to process their debit acquiring business on our FirstVision platform. This follows a fourth quarter win with this client for prepaid processing. \n Turning to [ bank ] services, our debit network and processing business. Growth remains strong as we continue to add new issuing business with our core and noncore bank clients and sign merchants for debit transaction routing via our networks. The adoption of Reg II has brought another large merchant, Uber, to our networks. We will provide Uber the benefit of the added choice that comes from the dual network mandate for card-not-present debit routing. We see many more merchants in our debit networks pipeline ahead of the new rules set to take effect July 1. \n Our digital payments activity continues to grow with Zelle implementations and transactions. We have over 1,200 financial institutions live on Zelle today, with the potential to add hundreds more to our installed base this year. Financial institutions that use us for Zelle services are connected to the Fiserv NOW Network, which also provides easy access to FedNow, the Federal Reserve's real-time payment system. We have 6 banks in the pilot phase and over 20 financial institutions committed to go live post FedNow launch in July. We're encouraged by the opportunity to add many more banks and credit unions, especially since we think our NOW Network as a single integration layer, offers the ideal way to access FedNow. \n NOW is a network of networks connecting financial institutions, billers, consumers and businesses with real-time money and data movement across all rails, including card, ACH, Zelle, FedNow and the clearinghouse. \n In Asia, we are working with leading banks across the region on digital transformation initiatives. This includes Bangkok Bank, the largest bank in Thailand, that will expand its mobility digital banking platform into new domains, and BDO, the largest bank in the Philippines, where we are bringing signature core banking micro services to enhance BDO's third-party systems integration. We're also working with National Payments Corporation of India to enable the unified payments interface on RuPay and credit cards for issuers on our India processing hub. \n Turning to our FinTech segment. Organic revenue growth of 3% was slightly below our medium-term guide of 4% to 6%, which we attribute to timing and a strong first quarter last year, creating a higher comparison point. Implementations from the healthy series of wins over the past few years will provide growth in the second half of this year. We continue to see organic growth in this segment within the guidance range. \n Importantly, we have not seen an extended disruption from the banking turmoil that arose in March. Thus far, there are no follow-on effects across our banking client base as we continue to monitor it with our enterprise risk framework. We see the opportunity to sell our regulatory suite to banks who may increasingly need them. And we are well positioned to be a net winner among acquirer banks, should M&A activity heat up. Many larger banks already use a variety of our services, and we've demonstrated the ability to scale our modern platforms. \n In April, we marked the 1-year anniversary of the Finxact acquisition and have been very happy with its progress. We've seen strong interest from new and existing clients, which has contributed to meaningful growth in our Fintech pipeline. \n Importantly, in the first quarter Fiserv renewed the Finxact partnership with One, a leading banking fintech backed by Walmart. Finxact will be the system of record for a growing number of One's expanding banking services. Ramping this opportunity will represent a high profile achievement and scale that could attract other banks and merchants to the proven Finxact solution. \n Now let me pass the discussion to Bob for more detail on our financial results. \nRobert Hau: Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. If you're following along on our slides, I will cover additional detail on total company and segment performance starting with our financial metrics and trends on Slide 4. \n First quarter results largely outpaced both internal and external expectations. Total company organic revenue growth was 13% in the quarter with strong performance in the Payments and Network segment and continued momentum in our Merchant Acceptance segment. \n Growth is tracking well ahead of initial guidance for the full year, so we are raising the lower end and now anticipate growth of 8% to 9%, which considers economist forecasts for slower consumer spending and bank lending in the second half of this year. We note, however, that we are not seeing signs that these measures are slowing meaningfully at this time. \n First quarter total company adjusted revenue grew 10% to $4.3 billion and adjusted operating income grew 15% to $1.4 billion, resulting in adjusted operating margin of 33.6%, an increase of 160 basis points. \n First quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 13% to $1.58 compared to $1.40 in the prior year. Free cash flow came in at $861 million for the quarter, up 43%, driven by improved working capital. We remain confident in achieving our outlook of $3.8 billion in free cash flow this year. Based on higher organic revenue growth, coupled with our focus on operational excellence, which supports our margin expansion outlook of more than 125 basis points, we are raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance range from the previous $7.25 to $7.40 to a new range of $7.30 to $7.40, representing growth of 12% to 14% over 2022. \n Now looking to our segment results starting on Slide 5. Organic revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was a strong 18% in the quarter, well ahead of our medium-term segment guidance of 9% to 12%. Adjusted revenue growth in the quarter was 12%. Merchant volume and transactions each grew 5%. \n Turning to our merchant operating systems, Clover and Carat. We continue to see gains across key metrics, including net new merchant adds, value-added services penetration and partner relationships. \n Clover revenue grew 22%, coming off one of our toughest comparisons with last year when the post-COVID return to normal was in full swing. Payment volume growth was 17%. Software and services penetration reached 17% of total Clover revenue, an increase of 150 basis points from a year ago and up 80 basis points sequentially with continued strength in services such as Clover Capital. \n Clover Connect for ISVs built on its momentum with very strong revenue growth in the quarter as we continue to execute on our vertical strategies, adding 37 ISV partners. We also delivered new client wins following product introductions last quarter for the payment facilitator or PayFac market. \n Carat also had a strong quarter with revenue growing 16%. International merchant operations represented 22% of segment revenue in the first quarter and grew 39% organically, led by Latin America. Adjusted operating income in the Acceptance segment increased 20% to $562 million and adjusted operating margin was up 210 basis points to 30.5%. The improvement reflects strong operating leverage and cost management. \n Turning to Slide 6 on the Payments and Network segment. Organic revenue grew 13% in the quarter and adjusted revenue growth was 11%. Organic growth was well above the high end of the 5% to 8% guidance range. As Frank mentioned, a few discrete items contributed a couple of points of growth. \n These included additional revenue carryover from state government stimulus work, above-average digital bank transfers in March and a slightly easier comparison against first quarter of last year. Even as year-over-year comparisons get tougher in the second half, we still expect 2023 growth to be at the high end of the segment's guidance range for the full year. \n The remaining growth was driven by a variety of impacts across our business lines. \n Our North American credit active accounts on file grew 12%, driven by both new business onboarding and a favorable credit environment. Our international issuing business continues to grow above segment average driven by macroeconomic improvement as well as onboarding of new clients. \n And our debit business continues to post solid growth, supported by new solutions and new client wins across processing and network. Adjusted operating income for the segment was up 15% to $717 million and adjusted operating margin was up 130 basis points to 43.8%. Operating leverage and a favorable mix shift towards debit network revenue helped drive the margin improvement, along with cost management. \n Moving to Slide 7. In the Financial Technology segment, we posted 3% organic growth for the quarter, just below our 4% to 6% medium-term guidance range. We expect to achieve growth within that guidance range this year as implementation work on prior wins is completed in the second half. Meanwhile, new customer momentum continues and we had 12 core wins in the quarter. \n Adjusted operating income was up 2% to $280 million. Adjusted operating margin in the segment was flat at 35.4% as we continue to invest in Finxact. We expect margin expansion to resume as we anniversary the Finxact acquisition in the second quarter. \n The adjusted corporate operating loss was $122 million, in line with the prior year. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 18.9%. We continue to expect full year 2023 adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 20%. \n Total debt outstanding was $22.4 billion on March 31. The debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio increased [ 0.1 of a turn ] to 2.9x and remains in our target range of less than 3x leverage. \n During the quarter, we issued $1.8 billion of 5- and 10-year senior notes to replace notes coming due later this year and reduce our commercial paper program balances. Variable rate debt sits at 14% of total. \n During the quarter, we significantly stepped up our share repurchases, buying back nearly $1.5 billion worth of stock. After receiving Board approval to repurchase up to an additional 75 million shares, we had 78.7 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase at the end of the quarter. We are fully committed to our long-standing capital allocation strategy, which includes investing in our business organically, maintaining a strong balance sheet, returning cash to shareholders through share repurchase and pursuing high-value and innovative acquisitions. \n With that, let me turn the call back to Frank. \nFrank Bisignano: Thanks, Bob. Before wrapping up, I want to discuss our ESG efforts. Our approach to corporate, social, responsibility and ESG is one of the ways our business produces better outcomes for our clients, shareholders and associates. Let me share some highlights of our soon-to-be published annual CSR report. \n First, our ongoing dedication to the progress of our associates through professional development. In 2022, we filled 45% of exempt roles with internal Fiserv associates. \n Second, our continued investment in minority, women, veteran, ethnically diverse, LGBTQ+ and disability-owned businesses through our back-to-business program in the U.S. and U.K. We have awarded more than 1,600 grants to eligible merchants since the inception of the program. \n Third, our commitment to continue to improve our collection and disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions and energy data. Not only have we aligned our 2022 CSR report with the Task Force on Climate-related Disclosures framework, but we have also provided 3 areas of data and a foundation for measuring the impact of our ongoing GHG and energy initiatives. These factors are reflected and being named to Forbes List of America's Best Large Employers, which is based on a poll of employee recommendations released in the first quarter. \n We are equally proud of another recognition received in the first quarter as one of America's Most Innovative Companies by Fortune. I started off this discussion by highlighting the importance of the investment in innovation, and this is another proof point on just how seriously we take technology innovation on behalf of customers and our future. \n This time of year is often marked by the release of ranking figures tabulated for the prior year. And my time in banking left me with an affinity for league tables that I know you also share. I'm pleased to report that Fiserv has retained its #1 position in 8 categories: core account processing; merchant acquiring; mobile banking; online banking; issuer processing; bill payment; person-to-person payments; and account transfers. \n And that brings me back to where we started our discussion today. The importance of scale in sustaining investment and driving innovation. I thank the 41,000 employees of Fiserv who helped get and keep us here. I know that I speak for all of them when I say, we intend to maintain the privileged position we hold. \n And now operator, please open the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. \nTien-Tsin Huang: Just wanted to maybe ask you to elaborate a little bit more on the month-to-month trends, including April. I heard some of the commentary on consumer spend and gas. But also curious around bank IT spending. I know you lifted the lower end of your outlook. Sounds like you feel confident in the timing of implementations on deals. So if you could just maybe elaborate on that and a little bit more on the consumer side, that would be great. \nFrank Bisignano: I'd say as much turmoil as we had in March, volumes were very high. You hear us talk about what I call a backlog, meaning our books told that being implemented right now, we expect that to be very strong, [ wouldn't ] in the second half. \n Demand, still very high from financial institutions. I've spent a lot of time with our client base. And the demand for digital, you heard us talk about the demand for Finxact, also our clients are building bigger businesses than trying to gain share also. So we feel good about the bank IT spend. And we feel good about our position with our client base right now. Hope that answers your question. \nTien-Tsin Huang: Just my follow-up then, if you don't mind just -- I know you've called out the Uber win on the STAR and Accel networks for CNP routing. We've been -- I think, I've asked you a few times, Frank, on Reg II. So you mentioned a strong pipeline. You see a burst in potential deals and revenue leading up to that? Or is this going to trickle into the second half of the year? Just trying to understand the... \nFrank Bisignano: I think it's second half and beyond. I think it's probably more a '24 than a '23. We should see some of it in '23, but I think you'll see more of it in '24. \nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. \nRamsey El-Assal: I wanted to ask you about the spread between merchant volume and revenues, which widened a little bit this quarter. If you could just update us on the primary drivers of that spread, product mix, geographic mix, pricing, other factors. And also just on the sustainability of those drivers in terms of driving revenue over the year. \nRobert Hau: Yes, Ramsey. As you've heard us talk about, there's lots of variation quarter-to-quarter in terms of that spread that you talk about. There's a combination of things like mix of small businesses versus enterprise of hardware versus processing. \n As you heard, we introduced some new hardware in the last few months. We've got some more coming in the balance of the year. That will drive it mix of international -- there are 3 regions, LatAm, EMEA and APAC  with particular strength in LatAm and in APAC right now. \n More penetration of value-added services. You heard us talk about that stepping up 150 basis points to 17% in the quarter. Mix of PayFacs and ISVs and ISOs. So lots of different elements, which is why we try to push on tracking our overall revenue growth. \n And as you've heard us say, we're focused on getting more merchants and selling more to those merchants. And we're seeing that benefit the last several quarters, and we expect that to continue as we march towards our goal of $10 billion of revenue in this segment by 2025. \nRamsey El-Assal: Okay. So quite a few different factors contributing there. A follow-up for me is just on the international growth and merchant. It seemed just incredibly impressive. What are the kind of common threads between the different markets where -- that are helping to drive that growth? Is there anything that's going on outside the U.S. that's sparking that kind of growth? \nFrank Bisignano: Well, I think you've watched us build out our international business for years. I mean, there was a point in time where we didn't have a business. In Brazil as an example, and then we've built it out. You heard us talk about Caixa. That's still ramping up. \n When you look across Asia Pac, you could see us winning business there. So I think it's a tried and true as having our feet completely embedded on the ground in terms of our capability. In some cases, Clover leads. But it's always been an investment for us in innovation, running a global franchise. And I think on top of it, it's beyond the merchant. It's issuer along with it, which allows the payment segment also to get the benefit of our geographic dispersity. So it's a continuation of our strategy we laid out going back to 2020. And we'll continue to invest in those markets. We like the growth in those markets. We run those regions separately, and we feel great about our leadership on the ground there, too. \nRobert Hau: Ramsey, I think that's one of the distinctions for us, and it's been one of the keys to our success. We have local leadership. We don't have an international business. We have 3 regions, and those 3 regions are run by local leaders who are physically present in those regions and know those regions. We operate as a global business, and so products and solutions. Clover is a global solution but it's brought to those regions through those local regional leaders. And of course, across all of the regions, we continue to be the full partner of choice, and bank partners are one of the key methods. \n Frank talked about Caixa. In Europe, we announced our Deutsche Bank joint venture. We've got partnerships in Asia Pac, in Singapore and in India, et cetera. So it's a global reach with a very local leadership. \nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. \nLisa Dejong Ellis: Good stuff here. Frank, you highlighted Fiserv's ongoing readiness efforts related to the rollout of FedNow coming in a few months. Can you just elaborate a bit on how you anticipate and I guess maybe how quickly you expect FedNow to begin impacting Fiserv's business and where we'll see that benefit? \nFrank Bisignano: Yes. I mean, we've always had a philosophy that we are a commerce enabler, right? So as new payment types and changes to payment types, just how we do with Zelle. If you go back to places like Apple Pay, it's just a philosophical belief that we are here to help our clients grow their business. We are here on purpose-driven method to help them run their business better. And when new initiatives like FedNow come along, and we have thousands of banks and credit unions across the country that are looking for different payment methodologies to allow them to deliver for their clients who are going to enable it. \n So we partner obviously with the Fed on this. I see it as another payment type. I think it's good for our large institutions and our smallest. And I suspect it will get volume. It's -- for us, it's a very good choice to enable payments, just like Zelle was a very good choice to enable payments. So we're pretty excited. Adoption will drive all. It will be a single integrated interface to allow our clients to be able to come in seamlessly through our network and I look forward to reporting on it when we talk next quarter. \nLisa Dejong Ellis: Terrific. And then maybe just for my follow-up, I'll ask about investment areas because you did call out how Finxact, Ondot and some of your other recent acquisitions are having a very noticeable positive impact on Fiserv. So just looking forward, what are some of your priority investment areas like sort of the hot areas right now, [ yielding ] either for organic or inorganic investment? \nFrank Bisignano: Well, I would say you have to start with a series of items. Carat, Clover, we're leaning heavily on both of those. I think we've grown them organically very well. But we've also added BentoBox, Merchant One, Nextable. So you'll see us do both. I think we have a very, very strong track record. \n Starting with Clover, moving to Ondot, moving to BentoBox, Finxact of bringing founders in and helping them grow their business at a different level, right? I think you can see a vertical focus. You see us with driving value-added services. So I would say that's a large part of the merchant story, and that will happen in the U.S. and within our regions also. \n I think when you think about Finxact, you think about what I feel is the best next-generation platform out there. And both Finxact and DNA are very, very strong assets. We do have great assets like Signature also, but when you think about the buildout, you should think about us taking Finxact and DNA to the next level, to the best cloud platform in the industry between the 2 by far. \n And when you see the investment we're making to bring Walmart up, and they're up and running in the early stages, that will industrialize us in that platform beyond anyone's expectations when we acquired it. \n If you look at our payments areas, we will continue to bring in the issuing area a lot of digital innovation. We're cloud enabling those platforms to take them to the next level. I think you've seen that we've been hugely successful in the issuing area even as late as Desjardins and Target coming on. \n So we'll continue to invest in those platforms, growing out and bring more value-added services there, more digital capability there also. I think along with that, what we're doing with things like SpendLabs and -- is we're opening up a whole new SMB opportunity within our portfolio that we think will transfer itself whole -- our whole organization. And we believe deeply in SMB and the combo of SpendLabs and Clover and other assets that we brought onboard, and it will really allow us to even have more wallet from our SMB population. \n And then Ondot, you saw us take something that was a card control, card access capability and bring it into the mobile banking platforms of over 1,000 institutions. So I think you also look at the speed in which we ramp these products, the way we integrate them into the company. We think we have a pretty strong expertise in that and you can count on that, continually driving future growth for the company. \nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Timothy Chiodo from Credit Suisse. \nTimothy Chiodo: Great. I want to dig in a little bit more on the recent STAR and Accel wins. So you mentioned numerous of those, the Uber, the large merchant acquirer last quarter and more in the pipeline. I want to just recap the value proposition. When you're speaking with these acquirers and merchants, I'm assuming part of it is lower interchange, network fees. There might be a bundled sales approach. There might be an authorization angle. If you could recap those and maybe add to the list. \n And then lastly, if at all possible, if you could just comment directionally in terms of market share goals. Is the goal for U.S. online debit for STAR and Accel to be in a similar position to your share for the in-store debit market in the U.S. \nFrank Bisignano: So first, I think you did a pretty good job. So thank you, in describing the opportunity. And I would say, yes, we're in the client's office every day, right? Large institutions, and we're talking to them about our full capability. \n I'd say we get a lot of imbalance from large institutions because if you're the third debit network, I think it's a very strong position. And the combo of STAR and Accel is very, very powerful. It's good for our merchants, it's good for our issuers. And I don't want to lose that, it's a 2-sided benefit. \n That benefit is us having invested in these products for a long time and consistently felt that it was a value-add to our clients, both large and small. It is about technical capability, not just about a lower price, right? Of course, every one of our businesses as the industry would call them merchants, I think of them as businesses. And always working on how to get a better client experience and how to lower the cost of acceptance. \n We're here to provide them the enablement they need. When you think about market share, you hear us rattle off those #1s and then we rattle off #3 in debit. I think that's a pretty privileged position. Those are formidable and fabulous institutions, 1 and 2. \n So our job is to give our client choice, right? And if we give them choice, we do come with an all-inclusive capable set of assets that we deliver to clients. It could be a cost debit routing. It's the capabilities of Reg II. It's also the pay by bank capability that you heard about. Over time, it will potentially be things like FedNow and Zelle capability. \n Our job is to have the bundle, have the capability, help both issuers and merchants be able to get a better outcome. And I think we're uniquely positioned out of everybody in the industry. It's really the power of having a merchant business and issuing business, a banking business. And we're a horizontal company that allows us to partner cross-sell businesses to give the best solution for the clients. \n And that's why sometimes when we look at it, we look at it, how did we deliver on the top in total? And how did we deliver in margin in total and making sure we're doing the best job for our clients and our shareholders. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Dave Togut from Evercore ISI. \nDavid Togut: Within the Fintech segment, the 12 core wins are certainly good to see. Can you talk about decision cycles, sales cycles and how they might be evolving post the regional bank crisis from early March? \nFrank Bisignano: Yes. I mean, first of all, I don't -- I didn't see a regional bank crisis. I saw tremendous turmoil. I think we have banks of all sizes from the largest in the world to 13-person credit unions, and there was not across -- and this is me talking to you about my interaction with my client base. \n In their office, during this period of time, while I was on the road, whether it was Topeka, Kansas, we saw that Missouri -- Springfield, Missouri, Raleigh, North Carolina, all across, we have very, very sound banks across this country that really performed very, very well and have always ran their asset and liability structure in a manner that I've seen through my career. \n So little bit -- I'm sorry for that take off, but I wouldn't want to name it as a banking crisis. There was turmoil, I see demand very high. Every one of those were creating opportunity that I rattled off during that week. I still -- I've been consistent on demand is high, opportunity to sell all products is very high. I mean, if you step back and look at of 2, FI-facing segments, you look at it over the past 3 quarters. Third quarter at 7.7% growth, fourth quarter '22 at 9.2% growth and first quarter of 23% at 9.4% growth. Those feel good to us. Our pipeline is strong both in traditional products and then in our new opportunities like Finxact and Ondot and others. \n So I feel very, very good about -- yes, there was maybe, as I called it, a little coastal problem. But I felt throughout the country, it's been very, very strong. And baseline to us, we were all over, how to help them through it and deliver what they needed during that turmoil. And I feel good about how the org performed. \nDavid Togut: Appreciate that. And just as a follow-up, perhaps, Bob, can you talk about the key drivers of operational effectiveness or operational excellence that will sustain margin expansion in your midterm range. \nRobert Hau: Sure. And Dave, this is quite frankly, it's just old-fashioned productivity. This is really what has been at the core of our company for a lot of years. \n The last couple of years have been focused on integration and cost synergies. And so this is returning back to basics with integration synergy behind us from the large merger back in middle of '19 and getting into productivity, reevaluating how we do everything and why we do what we do. It's things like implementing our new SAP system and streamlining the process and getting more information out of the hands of our business leaders more quickly so that we can make decisions faster. \n And it is, like I said, evaluating what we do on a day-to-day basis and streamlining that process so we can be quicker, more nimble, satisfy our clients and serve them in the way they need to be served with greater speed and efficiency. \nOperator: And for our final question, we'll go to Dave Koning from Baird. \nDavid Koning: Great job. And maybe just my 2 questions on merchant. First one, ex Clover, it seems like you still did mid- to upper teens revenue growth in Acceptance. So I guess my question really is, are you taking sure -- even without Clover, it seems like you're taking a lot of share in the industry. Is that fair to say? \nRobert Hau: Yes, David, I think we had yet another very strong merchant quarter across the board. Contributions, yes, Clover continues to do well. We continue to serve our enterprise clients and gain there. Our international business, as you heard, hitting on all cylinders. So this is -- Clover is a big part of this segment, no doubt about it, and a big part of growth. But we laid out our intent, our goal to get to $10 billion by 2025. \n Clearly, Clover is part of that. But our enterprise clients, our non-Clover SMB clients, our international region is all part of that. And all are contributing to the growth in first quarter, and last year for that matter. \nDavid Koning: Yes. Great. And just as a follow-up, I think there might be a little misconception on the Street, just that volume growth being mid-single digits seems to be losing momentum. But when I look at it, I think over 1/3 of your volume comes from bank JVs that generate almost no revenue. And I mean, I think those -- that all could almost go away, and you still probably would have beaten consensus this quarter. Is it fair to say is that maybe where some of the slowness is where it's the very high-yielding stuff actually is growing volume quite fast? \nRobert Hau: Yes. Overall, it's hard to be concerned in my mind with 18% top line when we did 17% for the full year last year, and to your earlier question, and taking share across the board. There's lots of different elements to that volume. It did ease a bit, and certainly the bank joint ventures are part of that. \n We have some processing revenue -- processing volume that doesn't drive big revenue and big profitability for us. And obviously, we continue to focus on that. And as we talked about, geez, a little more than a year ago now. And we think that, that holds going forward from a revenue standpoint but isn't a big growth driver for us. \nFrank Bisignano: Yes, I'd like to thank everybody for their attention today. Please feel free to reach out to our IR team with any questions. Have a great day, and I look forward to talking to you. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you all for participating in the Fiserv first quarter earnings conference call. That concludes today's conference. Please disconnect at this time, and have a great rest of your day.",

            "name": "Frank Bisignano",
            "content": "Thank you, Julie, and thank you all for joining us today. Fiserv is off to a strong start in 2023 with first quarter adjusted revenue growth of 10% and adjusted earnings per share of $1.58, up 13%. Adjusted operating margin of 33.6% was up 160 basis points. Organic revenue growth was 13%, above our 7% to 9% outlook for the full year, demonstrating our ability to sustain accelerated growth. \n Importantly, the growth was multidimensional. It included elevated contributions from card processing, noncard payments and digital banking solutions. Growth was also strong in all 3 of our international regions and in Merchant Acceptance. Investment on behalf of our clients and with our partners is paying off. \n We believe that accelerating our investment over the last 3 years, both organic and via M&A, has extended our leadership position among fintechs. This counters the narrative over the last few years that many start-ups in the payments and fintech space would disrupt and potentially replace the legacy companies. Our results show that our strategy to innovate and disrupt on behalf of, not in place of, our long-standing bank and merchant customers was on the mark. These competitors have indeed raised the bar for the tech and fintech, but we've met and, in some cases, exceeded that bar with our own investment and innovation. \n The power of our business model is in the virtuous cycle of generating revenue growth across a scaled business, leading to greater operating margins. That profit produces significant cash to reinvest in the business for faster organic growth and value-accretive acquisitions while the remainder is returned to shareholders through share repurchase. The market has shown that legacy companies across many industries with scale and willingness to innovate will offer sustainable value to clients and shareholders. \n Let's talk for a moment about how the benefits of our breadth, scale and investment have driven innovation. For small- and medium-sized businesses, we developed a cloud-based SaaS operating system for their payment needs with Clover. Now we're allowing these businesses to easily accept multiple payment types and we are seamlessly integrating software and services to address their broader business needs. \n For large enterprise businesses, we developed an integrated omnichannel system called Carat to manage payment needs across in-store and online sales channels, and we're adding SaaS-based solutions that improve our clients' efficiency and enhance their customers' experiences. \n For debit and credit issuers we've already built the most comprehensive suite of solutions, and we continue to innovate. CardHub was built off of the tools acquired with Ondot and now offers a comprehensive set of modern digital cardholder experiences. More than 1,000 financial institutions are now using CardHub, which can be fully integrated into their mobile banking app, allowing these issuers to offer their customers a unified digital card experience that only a few of the largest financial institutions can provide today. \n SpendTrack does for a bank's small- and medium-sized business clients what CardHub does for its retail customers. This differentiated mobile-first platform covers card management and AI-enabled expense management with workflows specific to their business needs. Built from our SpendLabs acquisition, SpendTrack has helped us win more credit, debit and network business with banks and issuers that cater to SMBs. \n For small- and medium-sized banks, we provide a full suite of the digital banking tools that help them compete with the largest banks from mobile apps, to spend management, to Zelle B2B payments. And in July, with the launch of FedNow will help them participate in the new wave of real-time payments, optimized on our NOW Network that connects banks to each other, to all payment rails and to essential applications. \n For banks of all sizes, we've built a path to the cloud through both our industry-leading DNA core platform, and now at Finxact, our native cloud solution acquired last year. \n And in support of our biggest investment of all, the combination of First Data and Fiserv, we are finding new opportunities across our client base that are aligned in ways that only Fiserv can enable. Here are just 3 examples of the power of our combined franchise. \n First, STAR and Accel, the third largest debit network in the country, helps card issuers and merchants realize attractive economics on debit transaction routing and satisfy new Reg II requirements for at least 2 unaffiliated networks on each card to route card-not-present transactions.  \n Second, our Finxact cloud-native banking core is laying the groundwork as an operating system at scale for financial institutions and merchants looking to offer embedded finance. \n Third, our Output Solutions business offers a full range of capabilities beyond what either a predecessor company had. For example, we are now able to offer communications and card manufacturing solutions to our entire client base from retail private label issuers to general purpose credit issuers, health care providers, banks and governments. \n As we look to the remainder of 2023, we start with a firm foundation of above-plan revenue and earnings. Still, we think it is wise to balance this strong start with the potential for macroeconomic headwinds in the second half of the year. So we are lifting the lower end of our prior 2023 guidance for both organic revenue growth and adjusted EPS and maintaining the upper end at this point. We now anticipate organic revenue growth of 8% to 9% and adjusted earnings per share of $7.30 to $7.40. \n Let's discuss the trends we are seeing in each of our segments now and for the rest of the year. Merchant Acceptance continues to be a very strong grower, posting 18% organic revenue growth in the first quarter, including significant strength in Latin America and Asia and continued gains in North America. This growth reflects overall consumer spending resilience but is also a testament to our strong distribution channels, ability to develop new products and services that resonate, success in selling more solutions to our existing merchants and the power of diversification across verticals, merchant size and geography. \n It's not yet clear whether broader macro headwinds are beginning to impact consumer spending, but we did see payment volume growth slow a bit late in the quarter. We continue to see good demand in the grocery vertical as well as in restaurants, especially QSRs. We've started to see consumers rotate towards nondiscretionary spending and reduced basket size. The decline in inflation is impacting volume growth, particularly in the petro vertical. This did not impact Fiserv revenue, which were large petro providers and other enterprise clients is based on transactions, not dollar volume. \n Our important advantages in this environment are our breadth of distribution, businesses both large and small, and a good mix of nondiscretionary spending, about half of our volume. Still, we are mindful that higher interest rates may weigh on consumers. And thus, we anticipate second quarter revenue growth in this segment to ease from the very strong first quarter levels. This, of course, is contemplated in our guidance. \n Clover revenue growth remains strong, up 22% in the quarter. We continue to add merchants at a healthy pace and extended value-added services penetration another point to 17%. Now 1 year since our Merchant Investor Day, we are on track to achieve the targets we set for 2025, $10 billion in Merchant Acceptance revenue; $3.5 billion in Clover revenue; and Clover value-added services penetration of 25%, where [ Clover ] a consistent average rate of growth over this time period was not in our calculus. Instead, the growth rate should accelerate over the next 3 years as we add more products, increase software penetration, and reach new markets. \n In the first quarter, for instance, we integrated bill pay and enhanced fraud management into Clover and improved access to Clover Capital via our client dashboard. In the past 12 months, we introduced upgraded Clover Mini and Clover Flex hardware. Later this year, we'll add a low-cost smart POS PIN pad to address the needs of smaller merchants who want simpler access to the Clover operating system and software. \n During the quarter, Fiserv launched support for Apple Tap to Pay on iPhone for SMBs on the Clover platform and for U.S. enterprise clients. This will enable businesses from large enterprises through medium and small businesses down to micro merchants, to securely accept contactless payments on iPhones without the need for additional hardware like an external card reader. As contactless payment usage rises, we are excited to enable new and existing clients to use this seamless and secure solution on iPhone to help run and grow their businesses. \n On our Carat platform, we continue to expand our capabilities in broad omnichannel solutions for enterprise merchants. We renewed and expanded our contract scope with several large merchants this quarter, including Fanatics and a major hotel chain. We also recently signed a Pay by Bank agreement with Walmart that includes traditional ACH processing and incorporates Fiserv's NOW Network and real-time payments capabilities. \n Our Payments and Network segment also had a very strong quarter, posting 13% organic revenue growth that included double-digit gains in all 3 business lines, issuer solutions primarily representing credit card issuing and output services. [ Card services ], including debit processing and our debit networks STAR and Accel, and our digital payment services, including Zelle and our bill pay business. This strong performance drove growth that was above our medium-term guidance of 5% to 8% and includes a couple of points of growth from a few discrete factors, which Bob will cover in more detail later. \n Positive trends continue and should carry full year growth towards the high end of the range. Several years of large card issuer wins in North America will drive revenue growth in the coming years with the pipeline that includes new win opportunities as well as follow-on sales to existing clients as we extend our value proposition. \n Our issuer clients have been active in deploying 3 highly innovative products: Advance Defense, our new AI-based fraud solution; new card controls and alerts developed by Ondot; and point-of-sale loan solutions that help issuers compete with BNPL providers. \n Recently, Citi signed on for our POS loan product and PNC went live. [ USAA ] is in the process of implementing Advance Defense, while [ One ] has signed on as well. \n International Issuer Solutions was another bright spot in the quarter with wins across all 3 of our regions. In Latin America, a leading Argentine fintech Uala chose Fiserv to provide credit card processing services for its new digital-first credit card product launch. It's already live in Mexico and will go live at Argentina and Colombia in the coming months. \n Uala shows our FirstVision platform for its local presence and global cloud API gateway that maximizes the digital user experience with APIs for instant card issuing, dynamic verification and installment payments among other services. We're excited about additional opportunities as we roll out the next-generation cloud-based FirstVision platform later this year. \n And in EMEA, we signed a contract with National Bank of Kuwait, the country's largest bank, to process their debit acquiring business on our FirstVision platform. This follows a fourth quarter win with this client for prepaid processing. \n Turning to [ bank ] services, our debit network and processing business. Growth remains strong as we continue to add new issuing business with our core and noncore bank clients and sign merchants for debit transaction routing via our networks. The adoption of Reg II has brought another large merchant, Uber, to our networks. We will provide Uber the benefit of the added choice that comes from the dual network mandate for card-not-present debit routing. We see many more merchants in our debit networks pipeline ahead of the new rules set to take effect July 1. \n Our digital payments activity continues to grow with Zelle implementations and transactions. We have over 1,200 financial institutions live on Zelle today, with the potential to add hundreds more to our installed base this year. Financial institutions that use us for Zelle services are connected to the Fiserv NOW Network, which also provides easy access to FedNow, the Federal Reserve's real-time payment system. We have 6 banks in the pilot phase and over 20 financial institutions committed to go live post FedNow launch in July. We're encouraged by the opportunity to add many more banks and credit unions, especially since we think our NOW Network as a single integration layer, offers the ideal way to access FedNow. \n NOW is a network of networks connecting financial institutions, billers, consumers and businesses with real-time money and data movement across all rails, including card, ACH, Zelle, FedNow and the clearinghouse. \n In Asia, we are working with leading banks across the region on digital transformation initiatives. This includes Bangkok Bank, the largest bank in Thailand, that will expand its mobility digital banking platform into new domains, and BDO, the largest bank in the Philippines, where we are bringing signature core banking micro services to enhance BDO's third-party systems integration. We're also working with National Payments Corporation of India to enable the unified payments interface on RuPay and credit cards for issuers on our India processing hub. \n Turning to our FinTech segment. Organic revenue growth of 3% was slightly below our medium-term guide of 4% to 6%, which we attribute to timing and a strong first quarter last year, creating a higher comparison point. Implementations from the healthy series of wins over the past few years will provide growth in the second half of this year. We continue to see organic growth in this segment within the guidance range. \n Importantly, we have not seen an extended disruption from the banking turmoil that arose in March. Thus far, there are no follow-on effects across our banking client base as we continue to monitor it with our enterprise risk framework. We see the opportunity to sell our regulatory suite to banks who may increasingly need them. And we are well positioned to be a net winner among acquirer banks, should M&A activity heat up. Many larger banks already use a variety of our services, and we've demonstrated the ability to scale our modern platforms. \n In April, we marked the 1-year anniversary of the Finxact acquisition and have been very happy with its progress. We've seen strong interest from new and existing clients, which has contributed to meaningful growth in our Fintech pipeline. \n Importantly, in the first quarter Fiserv renewed the Finxact partnership with One, a leading banking fintech backed by Walmart. Finxact will be the system of record for a growing number of One's expanding banking services. Ramping this opportunity will represent a high profile achievement and scale that could attract other banks and merchants to the proven Finxact solution. \n Now let me pass the discussion to Bob for more detail on our financial results. Thanks, Bob. Before wrapping up, I want to discuss our ESG efforts. Our approach to corporate, social, responsibility and ESG is one of the ways our business produces better outcomes for our clients, shareholders and associates. Let me share some highlights of our soon-to-be published annual CSR report. \n First, our ongoing dedication to the progress of our associates through professional development. In 2022, we filled 45% of exempt roles with internal Fiserv associates. \n Second, our continued investment in minority, women, veteran, ethnically diverse, LGBTQ+ and disability-owned businesses through our back-to-business program in the U.S. and U.K. We have awarded more than 1,600 grants to eligible merchants since the inception of the program. \n Third, our commitment to continue to improve our collection and disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions and energy data. Not only have we aligned our 2022 CSR report with the Task Force on Climate-related Disclosures framework, but we have also provided 3 areas of data and a foundation for measuring the impact of our ongoing GHG and energy initiatives. These factors are reflected and being named to Forbes List of America's Best Large Employers, which is based on a poll of employee recommendations released in the first quarter. \n We are equally proud of another recognition received in the first quarter as one of America's Most Innovative Companies by Fortune. I started off this discussion by highlighting the importance of the investment in innovation, and this is another proof point on just how seriously we take technology innovation on behalf of customers and our future. \n This time of year is often marked by the release of ranking figures tabulated for the prior year. And my time in banking left me with an affinity for league tables that I know you also share. I'm pleased to report that Fiserv has retained its #1 position in 8 categories: core account processing; merchant acquiring; mobile banking; online banking; issuer processing; bill payment; person-to-person payments; and account transfers. \n And that brings me back to where we started our discussion today. The importance of scale in sustaining investment and driving innovation. I thank the 41,000 employees of Fiserv who helped get and keep us here. I know that I speak for all of them when I say, we intend to maintain the privileged position we hold. \n And now operator, please open the line for questions. I'd say as much turmoil as we had in March, volumes were very high. You hear us talk about what I call a backlog, meaning our books told that being implemented right now, we expect that to be very strong, [ wouldn't ] in the second half. \n Demand, still very high from financial institutions. I've spent a lot of time with our client base. And the demand for digital, you heard us talk about the demand for Finxact, also our clients are building bigger businesses than trying to gain share also. So we feel good about the bank IT spend. And we feel good about our position with our client base right now. Hope that answers your question. I think it's second half and beyond. I think it's probably more a '24 than a '23. We should see some of it in '23, but I think you'll see more of it in '24. Well, I think you've watched us build out our international business for years. I mean, there was a point in time where we didn't have a business. In Brazil as an example, and then we've built it out. You heard us talk about Caixa. That's still ramping up. \n When you look across Asia Pac, you could see us winning business there. So I think it's a tried and true as having our feet completely embedded on the ground in terms of our capability. In some cases, Clover leads. But it's always been an investment for us in innovation, running a global franchise. And I think on top of it, it's beyond the merchant. It's issuer along with it, which allows the payment segment also to get the benefit of our geographic dispersity. So it's a continuation of our strategy we laid out going back to 2020. And we'll continue to invest in those markets. We like the growth in those markets. We run those regions separately, and we feel great about our leadership on the ground there, too. Yes. I mean, we've always had a philosophy that we are a commerce enabler, right? So as new payment types and changes to payment types, just how we do with Zelle. If you go back to places like Apple Pay, it's just a philosophical belief that we are here to help our clients grow their business. We are here on purpose-driven method to help them run their business better. And when new initiatives like FedNow come along, and we have thousands of banks and credit unions across the country that are looking for different payment methodologies to allow them to deliver for their clients who are going to enable it. \n So we partner obviously with the Fed on this. I see it as another payment type. I think it's good for our large institutions and our smallest. And I suspect it will get volume. It's -- for us, it's a very good choice to enable payments, just like Zelle was a very good choice to enable payments. So we're pretty excited. Adoption will drive all. It will be a single integrated interface to allow our clients to be able to come in seamlessly through our network and I look forward to reporting on it when we talk next quarter. Well, I would say you have to start with a series of items. Carat, Clover, we're leaning heavily on both of those. I think we've grown them organically very well. But we've also added BentoBox, Merchant One, Nextable. So you'll see us do both. I think we have a very, very strong track record. \n Starting with Clover, moving to Ondot, moving to BentoBox, Finxact of bringing founders in and helping them grow their business at a different level, right? I think you can see a vertical focus. You see us with driving value-added services. So I would say that's a large part of the merchant story, and that will happen in the U.S. and within our regions also. \n I think when you think about Finxact, you think about what I feel is the best next-generation platform out there. And both Finxact and DNA are very, very strong assets. We do have great assets like Signature also, but when you think about the buildout, you should think about us taking Finxact and DNA to the next level, to the best cloud platform in the industry between the 2 by far. \n And when you see the investment we're making to bring Walmart up, and they're up and running in the early stages, that will industrialize us in that platform beyond anyone's expectations when we acquired it. \n If you look at our payments areas, we will continue to bring in the issuing area a lot of digital innovation. We're cloud enabling those platforms to take them to the next level. I think you've seen that we've been hugely successful in the issuing area even as late as Desjardins and Target coming on. \n So we'll continue to invest in those platforms, growing out and bring more value-added services there, more digital capability there also. I think along with that, what we're doing with things like SpendLabs and -- is we're opening up a whole new SMB opportunity within our portfolio that we think will transfer itself whole -- our whole organization. And we believe deeply in SMB and the combo of SpendLabs and Clover and other assets that we brought onboard, and it will really allow us to even have more wallet from our SMB population. \n And then Ondot, you saw us take something that was a card control, card access capability and bring it into the mobile banking platforms of over 1,000 institutions. So I think you also look at the speed in which we ramp these products, the way we integrate them into the company. We think we have a pretty strong expertise in that and you can count on that, continually driving future growth for the company. So first, I think you did a pretty good job. So thank you, in describing the opportunity. And I would say, yes, we're in the client's office every day, right? Large institutions, and we're talking to them about our full capability. \n I'd say we get a lot of imbalance from large institutions because if you're the third debit network, I think it's a very strong position. And the combo of STAR and Accel is very, very powerful. It's good for our merchants, it's good for our issuers. And I don't want to lose that, it's a 2-sided benefit. \n That benefit is us having invested in these products for a long time and consistently felt that it was a value-add to our clients, both large and small. It is about technical capability, not just about a lower price, right? Of course, every one of our businesses as the industry would call them merchants, I think of them as businesses. And always working on how to get a better client experience and how to lower the cost of acceptance. \n We're here to provide them the enablement they need. When you think about market share, you hear us rattle off those #1s and then we rattle off #3 in debit. I think that's a pretty privileged position. Those are formidable and fabulous institutions, 1 and 2. \n So our job is to give our client choice, right? And if we give them choice, we do come with an all-inclusive capable set of assets that we deliver to clients. It could be a cost debit routing. It's the capabilities of Reg II. It's also the pay by bank capability that you heard about. Over time, it will potentially be things like FedNow and Zelle capability. \n Our job is to have the bundle, have the capability, help both issuers and merchants be able to get a better outcome. And I think we're uniquely positioned out of everybody in the industry. It's really the power of having a merchant business and issuing business, a banking business. And we're a horizontal company that allows us to partner cross-sell businesses to give the best solution for the clients. \n And that's why sometimes when we look at it, we look at it, how did we deliver on the top in total? And how did we deliver in margin in total and making sure we're doing the best job for our clients and our shareholders. Yes. I mean, first of all, I don't -- I didn't see a regional bank crisis. I saw tremendous turmoil. I think we have banks of all sizes from the largest in the world to 13-person credit unions, and there was not across -- and this is me talking to you about my interaction with my client base. \n In their office, during this period of time, while I was on the road, whether it was Topeka, Kansas, we saw that Missouri -- Springfield, Missouri, Raleigh, North Carolina, all across, we have very, very sound banks across this country that really performed very, very well and have always ran their asset and liability structure in a manner that I've seen through my career. \n So little bit -- I'm sorry for that take off, but I wouldn't want to name it as a banking crisis. There was turmoil, I see demand very high. Every one of those were creating opportunity that I rattled off during that week. I still -- I've been consistent on demand is high, opportunity to sell all products is very high. I mean, if you step back and look at of 2, FI-facing segments, you look at it over the past 3 quarters. Third quarter at 7.7% growth, fourth quarter '22 at 9.2% growth and first quarter of 23% at 9.4% growth. Those feel good to us. Our pipeline is strong both in traditional products and then in our new opportunities like Finxact and Ondot and others. \n So I feel very, very good about -- yes, there was maybe, as I called it, a little coastal problem. But I felt throughout the country, it's been very, very strong. And baseline to us, we were all over, how to help them through it and deliver what they needed during that turmoil. And I feel good about how the org performed. Yes, I'd like to thank everybody for their attention today. Please feel free to reach out to our IR team with any questions. Have a great day, and I look forward to talking to you. Thank you."

            "name": "Robert Hau",
            "content": "Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. If you're following along on our slides, I will cover additional detail on total company and segment performance starting with our financial metrics and trends on Slide 4. \n First quarter results largely outpaced both internal and external expectations. Total company organic revenue growth was 13% in the quarter with strong performance in the Payments and Network segment and continued momentum in our Merchant Acceptance segment. \n Growth is tracking well ahead of initial guidance for the full year, so we are raising the lower end and now anticipate growth of 8% to 9%, which considers economist forecasts for slower consumer spending and bank lending in the second half of this year. We note, however, that we are not seeing signs that these measures are slowing meaningfully at this time. \n First quarter total company adjusted revenue grew 10% to $4.3 billion and adjusted operating income grew 15% to $1.4 billion, resulting in adjusted operating margin of 33.6%, an increase of 160 basis points. \n First quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 13% to $1.58 compared to $1.40 in the prior year. Free cash flow came in at $861 million for the quarter, up 43%, driven by improved working capital. We remain confident in achieving our outlook of $3.8 billion in free cash flow this year. Based on higher organic revenue growth, coupled with our focus on operational excellence, which supports our margin expansion outlook of more than 125 basis points, we are raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance range from the previous $7.25 to $7.40 to a new range of $7.30 to $7.40, representing growth of 12% to 14% over 2022. \n Now looking to our segment results starting on Slide 5. Organic revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was a strong 18% in the quarter, well ahead of our medium-term segment guidance of 9% to 12%. Adjusted revenue growth in the quarter was 12%. Merchant volume and transactions each grew 5%. \n Turning to our merchant operating systems, Clover and Carat. We continue to see gains across key metrics, including net new merchant adds, value-added services penetration and partner relationships. \n Clover revenue grew 22%, coming off one of our toughest comparisons with last year when the post-COVID return to normal was in full swing. Payment volume growth was 17%. Software and services penetration reached 17% of total Clover revenue, an increase of 150 basis points from a year ago and up 80 basis points sequentially with continued strength in services such as Clover Capital. \n Clover Connect for ISVs built on its momentum with very strong revenue growth in the quarter as we continue to execute on our vertical strategies, adding 37 ISV partners. We also delivered new client wins following product introductions last quarter for the payment facilitator or PayFac market. \n Carat also had a strong quarter with revenue growing 16%. International merchant operations represented 22% of segment revenue in the first quarter and grew 39% organically, led by Latin America. Adjusted operating income in the Acceptance segment increased 20% to $562 million and adjusted operating margin was up 210 basis points to 30.5%. The improvement reflects strong operating leverage and cost management. \n Turning to Slide 6 on the Payments and Network segment. Organic revenue grew 13% in the quarter and adjusted revenue growth was 11%. Organic growth was well above the high end of the 5% to 8% guidance range. As Frank mentioned, a few discrete items contributed a couple of points of growth. \n These included additional revenue carryover from state government stimulus work, above-average digital bank transfers in March and a slightly easier comparison against first quarter of last year. Even as year-over-year comparisons get tougher in the second half, we still expect 2023 growth to be at the high end of the segment's guidance range for the full year. \n The remaining growth was driven by a variety of impacts across our business lines. \n Our North American credit active accounts on file grew 12%, driven by both new business onboarding and a favorable credit environment. Our international issuing business continues to grow above segment average driven by macroeconomic improvement as well as onboarding of new clients. \n And our debit business continues to post solid growth, supported by new solutions and new client wins across processing and network. Adjusted operating income for the segment was up 15% to $717 million and adjusted operating margin was up 130 basis points to 43.8%. Operating leverage and a favorable mix shift towards debit network revenue helped drive the margin improvement, along with cost management. \n Moving to Slide 7. In the Financial Technology segment, we posted 3% organic growth for the quarter, just below our 4% to 6% medium-term guidance range. We expect to achieve growth within that guidance range this year as implementation work on prior wins is completed in the second half. Meanwhile, new customer momentum continues and we had 12 core wins in the quarter. \n Adjusted operating income was up 2% to $280 million. Adjusted operating margin in the segment was flat at 35.4% as we continue to invest in Finxact. We expect margin expansion to resume as we anniversary the Finxact acquisition in the second quarter. \n The adjusted corporate operating loss was $122 million, in line with the prior year. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 18.9%. We continue to expect full year 2023 adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 20%. \n Total debt outstanding was $22.4 billion on March 31. The debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio increased [ 0.1 of a turn ] to 2.9x and remains in our target range of less than 3x leverage. \n During the quarter, we issued $1.8 billion of 5- and 10-year senior notes to replace notes coming due later this year and reduce our commercial paper program balances. Variable rate debt sits at 14% of total. \n During the quarter, we significantly stepped up our share repurchases, buying back nearly $1.5 billion worth of stock. After receiving Board approval to repurchase up to an additional 75 million shares, we had 78.7 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase at the end of the quarter. We are fully committed to our long-standing capital allocation strategy, which includes investing in our business organically, maintaining a strong balance sheet, returning cash to shareholders through share repurchase and pursuing high-value and innovative acquisitions. \n With that, let me turn the call back to Frank. Yes, Ramsey. As you've heard us talk about, there's lots of variation quarter-to-quarter in terms of that spread that you talk about. There's a combination of things like mix of small businesses versus enterprise of hardware versus processing. \n As you heard, we introduced some new hardware in the last few months. We've got some more coming in the balance of the year. That will drive it mix of international -- there are 3 regions, LatAm, EMEA and APAC  with particular strength in LatAm and in APAC right now. \n More penetration of value-added services. You heard us talk about that stepping up 150 basis points to 17% in the quarter. Mix of PayFacs and ISVs and ISOs. So lots of different elements, which is why we try to push on tracking our overall revenue growth. \n And as you've heard us say, we're focused on getting more merchants and selling more to those merchants. And we're seeing that benefit the last several quarters, and we expect that to continue as we march towards our goal of $10 billion of revenue in this segment by 2025. Ramsey, I think that's one of the distinctions for us, and it's been one of the keys to our success. We have local leadership. We don't have an international business. We have 3 regions, and those 3 regions are run by local leaders who are physically present in those regions and know those regions. We operate as a global business, and so products and solutions. Clover is a global solution but it's brought to those regions through those local regional leaders. And of course, across all of the regions, we continue to be the full partner of choice, and bank partners are one of the key methods. \n Frank talked about Caixa. In Europe, we announced our Deutsche Bank joint venture. We've got partnerships in Asia Pac, in Singapore and in India, et cetera. So it's a global reach with a very local leadership. Sure. And Dave, this is quite frankly, it's just old-fashioned productivity. This is really what has been at the core of our company for a lot of years. \n The last couple of years have been focused on integration and cost synergies. And so this is returning back to basics with integration synergy behind us from the large merger back in middle of '19 and getting into productivity, reevaluating how we do everything and why we do what we do. It's things like implementing our new SAP system and streamlining the process and getting more information out of the hands of our business leaders more quickly so that we can make decisions faster. \n And it is, like I said, evaluating what we do on a day-to-day basis and streamlining that process so we can be quicker, more nimble, satisfy our clients and serve them in the way they need to be served with greater speed and efficiency. Yes, David, I think we had yet another very strong merchant quarter across the board. Contributions, yes, Clover continues to do well. We continue to serve our enterprise clients and gain there. Our international business, as you heard, hitting on all cylinders. So this is -- Clover is a big part of this segment, no doubt about it, and a big part of growth. But we laid out our intent, our goal to get to $10 billion by 2025. \n Clearly, Clover is part of that. But our enterprise clients, our non-Clover SMB clients, our international region is all part of that. And all are contributing to the growth in first quarter, and last year for that matter. Yes. Overall, it's hard to be concerned in my mind with 18% top line when we did 17% for the full year last year, and to your earlier question, and taking share across the board. There's lots of different elements to that volume. It did ease a bit, and certainly the bank joint ventures are part of that. \n We have some processing revenue -- processing volume that doesn't drive big revenue and big profitability for us. And obviously, we continue to focus on that. And as we talked about, geez, a little more than a year ago now. And we think that, that holds going forward from a revenue standpoint but isn't a big growth driver for us."

        "content": "Operator: Welcome to the Fiserv Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session begins following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Julie Chariell, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv.\nJulie Chariell: Thank you, and good morning. With me on the call today are Frank Bisignano, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and supplemental materials for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Please refer to these materials for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call, along with a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. Unless otherwise stated, performance references are year-over-year comparisons. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results and strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. You should refer to the earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. And now, I'll turn the call over to Frank.\nFrank Bisignano: Thank you, Julie, and thank you all for joining us today. As we share our third quarter results this morning, it is increasingly clear that our position at the intersection of merchant and financial solutions is a strategic advantage. Fiserv delivered another strong quarter, with adjusted earnings per share of $2.30, up 17%, driven by strong revenue growth and further operating margin expansion across our businesses. Adjusted revenue growth was 7% and adjusted operating margin rose 170 basis points to 40.2%. Organic revenue growth was 15%. Our free cash flow was $1.9 billion in the quarter and $3.3 billion year-to-date, and we returned $1.3 billion to shareholders via share repurchase. Businesses and financial institutions are increasingly interconnected, and Fiserv has a key role to play here given our unmatched set of assets across software, data, technology and, of course, scale and experience in moving money. Here are two examples in just the past month. First, we announced this morning with DoorDash, we began implementing a comprehensive embedded finance application poised to be a best-in-class solution for gig economy company. This solution enables DoorDash to offer its delivery contractors a full range of financial services. Within a single app, they can get instant access to wages and rewards, as well as deposit accounts, debit cards and more. Our real-time ledger capability from Finxact manages the transactions and was a key reason why Fiserv was chosen. A Fiserv banking client rounded out the solution as a requisite sponsor. Second, we completed a proof of concept with Walmart where we enabled a real-time Pay by Bank transaction at the point of sale over our proprietary NOW Network. A growing number of merchants are adding Pay by Bank capability to maximize choice for consumers and the emerging capacity for handling such payments in real time offers advantages for Fiserv, merchants and consumers. This capability will be more widely available next year via our NOW Network. Additionally, we teamed up with Walmart Business as a referral partner for Clover as a business management platform, helping Walmart fulfill its goal of helping small businesses and non-profits to better run their businesses. In a separate but related testament to our product strength and position as a partner of choice, today Inc. magazine named Clover to its 2024 Power Partners list, which recognizes the best B2B providers for SMBs. Let me share some of the many highlights of the quarter. It was another strong quarter of growth in the Merchant Solutions segment, with organic revenue up 24%. At Clover, revenue grew 28% and value-added services penetration reached 21%, up 1 percentage point from Q2. In Latin America, we expanded the friends and family Clover pilots in Brazil and Mexico as planned with a full-scale launch coming in December. In Asia Pacific, we went live with our first Clover pilot in Australia in September. We also enabled the Enterprise Commerce Control Center, which allows merchants to monitor and analyze their business and transaction performance across locations, regions and operating segments in a single view. In Financial Solutions, we posted another quarter of strong organic revenue growth at 6%. The build out of CashFlow Central was completed in September and we have our first client gearing up to implement the solution in the next few months. And we continue to migrate clients to Experience Digital, or XD, our new digital banking solution, as we integrate additional solutions into this unique digital ecosystem, including CashFlow Central, real-time payments, Clover and more. We expect to see a multiplying effect on the average revenue per XD user over time. It was another quarter of marquee wins that demonstrate the power of Fiserv's integrated and value-added offerings. We were chosen to provide merchant acceptance services for a major e-com marketplace and expanded our long-standing partnership with Costco to launch a stored value digital wallet. The service enables new payment and reward redemption experiences whether the retailer's customers are shopping online or in the warehouse. We continue to sign other enterprise merchants onto our value-added solutions. Another long-time enterprise client, Exxon, signed on for a data-as-a-service offering. This solution is used to extract insights from integrated vendor, payments, consumer loyalty and wallet data. And because it runs in a cloud, we can reduce implementation time from months to days. Also in Q3, Ahold Delhaize, a global retailer whose portfolio includes Stop & Shop in the U.S. selected Fiserv as the provider of Pay by Bank services. Alex Lee, a large privately owned operator of multiple food companies, chose our Smart Routing technology for debit cost efficiency. We accelerated our signings of financial institutions as merchant acquirer referral partners. These included banks of all sizes as well as credit unions. Golden 1 Credit Union and America First Credit Union were two of the larger signings in Q3. In our three regions, we continue to see strong client momentum. We expanded our partnership with Netto, a major grocery chain in Europe. We'll provide several value-added services, including dynamic currency conversion, customer cashback and encryption solutions, in addition to supplying thousands of new PIN pads to accelerate transaction speed across their 700 stores in Poland. In Asia Pac, Fiserv was chosen by foodpanda, a subsidiary of Delivery Hero and one of the world's leading local delivery companies, to provide payment services across multiple markets in Asia. This strategic partnership spans online, mobile and digital wallets, positioning Fiserv as foodpanda's primary acquirer in Singapore and Hong Kong, processing over $1 billion in annual spend. We launched Clover Sport at Bombonera in Argentina. This is one of the country's largest soccer stadiums and home to one of the top teams in the league. Clover's presence there can add to awareness in the region. To optimize the fan experience for fast and easy concession services, the stadium, through our ISV partner, chose the Clover platform to accept payments in three ways: through QR codes, self-service kiosks and mobile handheld devices. Moving to the Financial Solutions segments, four banks signed on for CashFlow Central in the past three months, including our first credit union for a total of 10 since we announced the initiative a year ago. AvidXchange will be using the CheckFree biller directory to support faster bill payment on its mid-market B2B exchange. In September, we won a competitive bid with Farm Credit Mid-America, a cooperative that reaches across six states. We'll be converting their loan portfolio to DNA and integrating several other value-added solutions. PNC signed up for our AI-enabled Advance Defense product for enhanced fraud detection in their card issuing business. Equitas Small Finance Bank was the latest India issuer to go live on our India processing hub, successfully launching a new retail and corporate card product with a full-stack offering, including loyalty, offers and real-time fraud management, as well as credit on UPI, India's real-time account-to-account payment system. And we continue to build our capability here as a market leader with seven of the 10 largest credit card issuers in India on our platform. In September, we hosted 3,000 Fiserv clients and prospects at our annual Client Conference forum. This group of attendees represent nearly 50% of our North American institutional revenue across the Merchant and Financial Solutions segments and nearly 60% of our new business pipeline through 2025. After three days of demos across 75 booths in our Experience Center, over 100 well-attended product and technology information sessions and thousands of client meetings, we strengthened our relationships and partnerships, expanded our pipeline of opportunities and generated enthusiasm for our offerings, setting the stage for continued strong growth in the future. One of the many highlights at Forum this year was our SMB bundle. The premise behind this suite of products is that small- and medium-sized businesses have a complex landscape to navigate for managing their businesses and they prefer a single easy-to-use system. With our own products and partnerships, Fiserv is the only financial technology expert with solutions that cut across the entire SMB value chain. Since the products and the clients for our SMB bundle span our Merchant and Financial Solutions segments, we have the unique opportunity to win business through the integration of solutions across both of our ecosystems. From our merchant ecosystem, we provide acceptance and processing, the Clover POS platform, Clover VAS, including vertical and horizontal business process software, capital, loyalty and gift solutions and the Small Business Index for localized insights. From our financial ecosystem, we provide CashFlow Central because cash management is a fundamental requirement for business success at SMBs. We also provide Optis for business card issuance, SpendTrack for expense management, Zelle for small business and core banking account management and digital banking. While we sell each of these separately now, next year, they will be integrated on our leading platforms. For FIs, the SMB bundle will integrate into digital banking environment such as Fiserv's Experience Digital or XD platform. For small businesses, the SMB bundle will integrate into the Clover Dashboard and be sold through all Clover channels. Lastly, I want to come back to something I said last quarter. Merchant-related services from Fiserv are back as an opportunity for financial institutions to compete and win. What's old is new again based on our innovations across the SMB bundle. It gives FIs a deeper view into an SMB's full financial position. With this knowledge and breadth of product, they can better grow and retain SMB clients and generate deposit and non-interest fees. We couple this capability with tools to help FIs readily find merchant customer leads and onboard them digitally. Showcasing our integrated SMB capabilities generated a lot of interest and ongoing engagement and we expect the SMB bundle to start contributing to growth next year. Turning to our guidance for the rest of the year, we are raising organic revenue growth from 15% to 17% to 16% to 17%, and raising our guidance for adjusted earnings per share to $8.73 to $8.80. As I look across all the new initiatives we are rolling out, I am pleased with how the vision and investment we put into motion five years ago has brought Fiserv to a strong position today, one that's clearly hard to replicate. The results show that we are executing on mandates for each of our two ecosystems, merchants and financial institutions. This will continue in many ways as we add to our Clover portfolio, extend services to enterprise merchants, expand issuing to new verticals and geographies, enable more real-time payments, modernize core banking systems, add partners, grow internationally, and continue to use distribution data and more. With this foundation of leadership and steady growth firmly established, we are moving to the next generation of solutions that answers the needs across both ecosystems. As the only provider serving both merchants and financial institutions with product breadth and technological scale we serve at the intersection between merchants and fintech, issuers and fintechs, acquiring and cash management, digital wallets and card services, spending and banking data, and many other combinations. This is not a vision. It is here today in our initiatives with DoorDash, Apple, Walmart, U.S. Bank, Palantir and others. Of course, these integrated opportunities are in their early stages. As excited as we are about them today, our measure of success will be strong sustainable growth for Fiserv over the medium and longer term. And now, I will turn it over to Bob for more detail on our financial performance.\nBob Hau: Thank you, Frank, and good morning everyone. If you are following along on our slides, I will cover additional detail on total company and segment performance, starting with our financial metrics and trends on Slide 4. Third quarter, again, demonstrated our capability to maintain strong revenue growth and margin expansion. Third quarter total company adjusted revenue grew 7% to $4.9 billion and adjusted operating income grew 12% to $2 billion, resulting in adjusted operating margin of 40.2%, an increase of 170 basis points versus the prior year. Year-to-date, adjusted revenue grew 7% to $14.2 billion and adjusted operating income grew 12% to $5.4 billion, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 38.2%, an increase of 170 basis points versus the prior year. Organic revenue grew 15% in the quarter, driven by strength in both segments. The transitory contribution from excess inflation in Argentina was 3 points to our total organic growth in the quarter, down from 5 points in Q2. As mentioned during last quarter's earnings call, d\u00f3lar turista extended into Q3 and contributed less than 0.5 point of total company organic growth in the quarter. Third quarter adjusted earnings per share was $2.30 compared to $1.96 in the prior year, up 17% on the high end of our full year guidance provided last quarter of 15% to 17%. Year-to-date, our adjusted earnings per share increased 18% to $6.29 compared to $5.34 in the prior year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.9 billion, and year-to-date free cash flow was $3.3 billion. As mentioned in prior earnings calls, we expected free cash flow to be much higher in the second half of this year after a lighter first half due to the timing of cash flows for the green tax credit program. The related refund came through in the third quarter. Turning to performance by segment, starting on Slide 5, organic revenue growth in the Merchant Solutions segment was 24% in the quarter and 29% year-to-date. This includes a 6 point benefit from above-average inflation in Argentina in the quarter and a 10 point benefit year-to-date. While inflation remains high, interest rates in Argentina eased in late second quarter and are back to historical averages and, therefore, did not contribute to excess growth this quarter. The continuation of d\u00f3lar turista contributed nearly 1 percentage point to Merchant organic revenue growth in the quarter and 3 points year-to-date. On Slide 6, we have again included a summary of the impact of excess Argentine inflation and interest on total Fiserv and Merchant segment revenue along with the offsetting headwind from currency devaluation, which impacts adjusted revenue. Adjusted revenue growth for Merchant Solutions was 9% in the quarter and 10% year-to-date. The quarterly results include a 15 percentage point currency headwind largely from the Argentine peso after a sharp devaluation in late December last year. Similar to Q2, the currency headwind to adjusted revenue growth was much higher than the inflation and interest tailwind in the quarter. 2024 has been an outstanding year for new Clover hardware launches. Earlier this year, we brought to market the Kitchen Display System, or KDS XL, to manage orders and improve efficiency in a 24-inches formfactor that larger restaurants demand. We also launched the Kiosk, which allows for self-service ordering, reducing wait times and increasing average tickets. In Q3, we introduced a new version of the Flex handheld device called the Flex Pocket, which is 25% lighter, 50% thinner and oriented towards restaurant and waitstaff in retail. And most recently, we launched the Clover Compact, an entry-level solution that will help drive TAM expansion and create new VAS revenue opportunities. Now moving to the business lines. Small business organic and adjusted revenue growth in the quarter was 25% and 9%, respectively, on payment volume growth of 4%. This volume growth was similar to Q2 levels. According to a variety of external macro indicators, overall consumer spending growth is slower than last year, but appears stable at a comfortable pace. Fiserv's small business performance was ahead of our Small Business Index results, which showed year-over-year sales volume growth of 2.3% compared to 3.7% for Q2 and 2.8% for Q3 2023. The difference is likely attributable to our international presence and a slightly different mix of business. Fiserv is more heavily weighted to non-discretionary categories such as food and services, which have been growing faster. Clover revenue grew 28% in the third quarter on an annualized payment volume growth of 15%. VAS penetration increased sequentially by 1 point to 21% in Q3, driven by growth in Clover Capital and the Clover SaaS package. In Q4, we will be rolling out new vertical software plans for retail and services. With this progress, we remain on track to achieve our 2026 Clover targets of $4.5 billion in revenue and VAS penetration of 27%. Enterprise organic and adjusted revenue growth in the quarter was 37% and 17%, respectively, driven by transactions growth of 12% and higher VAS penetration. As with small business, organic growth in enterprise includes some transitory benefit in Argentina. Above-average growth in enterprise business reflects the ramping of a large PayFac from our processing customer to a direct client. Commerce Hub continues to see ongoing traction and is now processing almost 7 times the daily transactions versus Q1 and 2 times when compared to Q2. And clients are increasingly connected to enhanced solutions. Much of the Commerce Hub transaction growth comes from existing clients migrating to the Commerce Hub and the fact that they are now on the platform gives us the opportunity to sell more VAS going forward. Finally, processing organic revenue in the quarter declined by 1%, while adjusted revenue decreased 2%. This business represents the back-end processing we do for our bank and certain ISO partners where they own the merchant relationship. Year-to-date processing organic and adjusted revenue growth were both flat, consistent with our expectation. Adjusted operating income in the Merchant Solutions segment increased 19% to $931 million in the quarter, with adjusted operating margin up 290 basis points to 37.7%. Year-to-date, adjusted operating income increased 22% to $2.6 billion, with adjusted operating margin up 330 basis points to 36.2%. As noted in prior quarters, interest expense from anticipation revenue is recorded below the operating income line. If the interest costs from anticipation were included in the operating income, Merchant adjusted operating margins would have expanded 190 basis points for the quarter and 260 basis points year-to-date. Turning to Slide 7, on the Financial Solutions segment, organic revenue grew 6% in the quarter and year-to-date, in line with our full year outlook of 5% to 7%. Looking at the business lines, digital payments organic and adjusted revenue each grew by 5% in the quarter. Growth in Zelle transactions continue to be strong at 35%. We continue to see demand from clients for digital payments products such as FedNow and RTP integrations. CashFlow Central, our integrated AR/AP solution for SMBs, continues to see high interest from financial institutions. In the last three months, we signed two nearly-$10 billion institutions Amarillo National Bank and Tri Counties Bank. In total, we had four wins in the last three months, bringing the total to 10 since product announcement. In issuing, organic and adjusted revenue grew 7% and 4%, respectively, in the quarter, driven by demand across various verticals, including government and healthcare. During the quarter, we converted the remaining HealthEquity HSA and FSA card accounts to Optis, our issuing processing platform, solidifying our leadership in the healthcare card vertical. Banking organic and adjusted revenue grew 5% in the quarter. Last quarter, we spoke about signing a merchant agreement with Connecticut On-Line Computer Center, known as COCC, which is a client-owned provider of banking technology. In the third quarter, we expanded our relationship to include Experience Digital, or XD, which is our online and mobile banking solution. XD will now be available to the 150 community banks and credit unions on COCC solution. Third quarter adjusted operating income for the Financial Solutions segment was up 5% to $1.1 billion, and adjusted operating margin came in strong at 47.4%. Year-to-date, adjusted operating income for the segment was up 6% to $3.2 billion, with adjusted operating margin up 60 basis points to 45.8%. Now, let me wrap up with some remaining details on the financials. The corporate adjusted operating loss was $112 million in the quarter and $394 million year-to-date, in line with our expectations. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 18.8% and 19.0% year-to-date. We expect the full year rate to be slightly below 20%. Total debt outstanding was $25.3 billion on September 30. Our debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio went down from 2.8 times in the second quarter to 2.7 times in the third quarter, in line with our target leverage range. During the quarter, we repurchased 8 million shares for $1.3 billion, bringing our total cash return to shareholders for the last 12 months to $5.3 billion and over $16 billion since the 2019 merger. We had 24 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase at the end of the quarter. Turning to Slide 9, as Frank said earlier, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share outlook to a range of $8.73 to $8.80, up from $8.65 to $8.80. This is an acceleration in forecasted adjusted EPS growth to 16% to 17% from 15% to 17%. This is also a $0.04 raise at the midpoint from prior guidance and $0.14 from our original guidance. We are raising our 2024 organic revenue growth outlook from 15% to 17% to 16% to 17%. Additionally, we are raising our adjusted margin expansion outlook from more than 135 basis points to at least 150 basis points. Lastly, we are updating our free cash flow guidance from about $4.7 billion to above $4.7 billion, driven by the strong free cash flow in the third quarter and year-to-date. Given the current environment in Argentina, we continue to assume 4 points of benefit from excess inflation and interest this year for the total company and 9 points for Merchant Solutions. We now see the d\u00f3lar turista program continuing into the fourth quarter, but easing through the end of the year. Our full year outlook of 16% to 17% total company organic growth includes a 4 point transitory benefit from inflation and interest in Argentina and just over 1 point of growth from d\u00f3lar turista. Excluding these combined transitory factors, 2024 organic revenue growth would be 11% to 12% at the upper end of our medium-term guidance of 9% to 12%. The forecasted impact from foreign currency exchange remains 8.5% and we anticipate will continue to be a stronger though declining headwind to adjusted revenue growth relative to the tailwind from excess inflation and interest. Finally, in the past month, we made progress on three items that many of you have been asking about over the last month. While these do not have an outsized impact on our financials given the scale of our business, they demonstrate our ability to navigate ongoing change in our business in a way that is not disruptive and always open to opportunity. First, as previously reported, we expect Wells Fargo to take ownership of our 40% owned joint venture Wells Fargo Merchant Services on April 1, 2025, at which time, we will receive cash or assets for our portion of the business. Fiserv will continue to provide processing services to Wells' existing and new merchants along with other related services. As a result, we see no change to our medium-term outlook of 9% to 12% adjusted revenue growth and 15% to 17% adjusted EPS growth from this transaction. Secondly, we extended our merchant processing joint venture with PNC for the fifth time. The relationship dates back to 1996, supporting PNC small business and enterprise clients with hardware and processing services from Fiserv and we expect Clover to have a growing presence from here. And third, the State of Georgia approved our application for a merchant acquirer limited purpose bank charter. This approval from the state allows Fiserv to apply for direct acceptance into the card networks and is anticipated to be operational in 2025. This is a special purpose charter that enables optionality for sponsorship for merchant acquiring. It's important to clarify that Fiserv is not becoming a bank. Fiserv will not open branches, take deposits or write loans as traditional banks do. We have no intention in doing that and in fact the charter itself does not permit these traditional banking activities. With that, let me turn the call back to Frank for some closing remarks.\nFrank Bisignano: Thanks, Bob. I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss our corporate social responsibility initiatives, not because these are investment parameters, but because they represent who we are as a company. Hurricanes Helene and Milton were devastating for millions of people and businesses, including many Fiserv clients. Our response, as always, is to take action and we quickly sent support to the Red Cross and personally delivered supplies to the affected areas. As part of our partnership with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation and our investment to support its disaster preparedness and recovery effort for small businesses, we provided the Chamber with Fiserv Small Business Index data on the impact of the hurricanes. These granular insights on commerce levels leading up to, during and after these natural disasters are being used to educate policymakers and stakeholders, guide targeted response investments and inform philanthropic support efforts that create and boost small business recovery. Also in the quarter, Fiserv achieved a score of 100 on the Disability Equality Index and was recognized as a Top Veteran-Friendly Company by US Veterans Magazine, each for the third year in a row. The National Bankers Association, a trade organization that represents all minority depository institutions, presented Fiserv with its Corporate Excellence Award, making us the first large-scale tech provider to receive this honor. Finally, we continue to advance our sustainability and green building design strategy. Our Milwaukee headquarters recently achieved LEED Gold status following our Dublin, Ireland and New Jersey Innovation Centers, which achieved LEED Platinum status previously. These are just some examples of how our hard work and dedication show up in many quarters, but most importantly, it showed up in the strong financial performance you just heard. This put us at the top of the IDC FinTech Rankings for a second straight year, and our story today is about how we intend to stay there. I'd like to thank our more than 40,000 employees for their contributions to these significant achievements and for the day-to-day blocking and tackling that has produced consistently strong results. That's 40 years of building trust, scale and experience, and five years since the merger of achieving innovation through unmatched investment across our merchant and financial ecosystems. So, now, operator, please open the lines for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We would now like to open the phone lines for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for the update here. I want to ask on enterprise. It did accelerate nicely more than the transaction growth that you put up there. So, I heard, Bob, you mentioned it was transitory part of it and then there was a PayFac conversion to a retail relationship, it sounds like. So, can you just maybe go through that and what's a good sustainable level as we think about the fourth quarter?\nBob Hau: Yeah, Tien-Tsin, good morning. So, you're right, we did see an increase in transactions. Transaction growth in the quarter was up 12% over prior year. That actually matches what we saw in Q1. It's up from the 8% we saw in Q2. We definitely see some variation, particularly when we bring on new clients, some of them in this enterprise space can be quite large. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we did have a large PayFac begin to really ramp in the third quarter. We will see a little bit of that continue in fourth quarter as they get to full capability or full volume, and then it will return to \"more normal levels.\" Overall for that business line, we obviously saw very good organic growth, well ahead of the overall company average on an adjusted basis, which again that has also impact from Argentina in it. We feel great about the year-to-date at 11% on an adjusted basis.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we'll go to the line of Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nDarrin Peller: Guys, thanks. And nice results. Can we just start with -- overall the business is showing really strong signs of cross-sell. And I know, Frank, you alluded to that in your prepared remarks and how you're really packaging together more and more between segments. Maybe just some very specific examples of where you see that shaping up? And then, just if you could reiterate your conviction around the Financial Solutions segment accelerating into '25. I think you said going to 6% to 8% from 5% to 7%. Just reiterate why and what the driving force is and what you're seeing? Thanks, guys.\nFrank Bisignano: So, I'd like to go back to something I'd like to say the construction of the company, right? I always believe that this was a very strategic set of assets we put together that were highly complementary five years ago. And one quick place to think about it is in merchant and FI, just in total, our ability to be the strategic partner of choice to deliver merchant and FI and put Clover on the front end of that. And then, really there is the power of owning a debit network and the ability of what to bring to our largest institutions and to our client base across merchants. And then, you go a step further and the future of the growth initiatives in terms of us talking about the SMB bundle and the ability to take all the assets we have and integrate them technically now, right? You see us on the front line there with Apple Pay and then you can see us with issuers in another spot and then see us weaving the place together and the ability of the crossroads of merchants and FIs, I think Walmart is a great example of it. I think DoorDash is a great example of it, right? And so, then you think about, okay, you got Finxact, you're bringing Finxact in as a [handless core] (ph) to be actually a ledger here for the famous Dashers. And then you go, okay, you put XD and Clover together and deliver a capability to every financial institution that runs on us. And you take a look at our international expansion and you look at the work on Commerce Hub, now showing up in the enterprise segment. So, I think the construction of the company with financial institutions all the way through from the largest to a credit union or a local community bank, and then you take on top of that the assets we bring to it. So, I mean, you're seeing it and then we brought 3,000 people to forum and I think you were there, too, if I am right. And I mean you saw the power of the franchise first-hand. So, we think that's why we see such sustainable growth for the long term, and we always think we can do our job better, too.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we'll go to the line of Harshita Rawat from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nHarshita Rawat: Hi, good morning. Frank, can you talk about STAR and Accel, especially given some of the changes happening in the U.S.? Maybe talk about their PINless capabilities [indiscernible] Signature capabilities, how STAR is positioned to grow? Thank you.\nFrank Bisignano: Yeah. So, I think one of the things to think about is we always believe that we wanted the capability to compete for transactions for our client benefit, right, for our client benefit. And that window opens up. STAR/Accel is clearly a strategic asset to sit at the crossroads of merchants and financial institutions. We believe our capability is strong on PIN. We have the signature capability. We do have dual-messaging capability. And we give our merchants and issuers choices to compete for transactions at every level. So, that's the strategy, right? The strategy is to support our client base. We believe it too is one of these steady opportunity you're not going to see this meteoric rise of transactions, but you'll continue to see volume share gains and we'll continue to have an asset in our repertoire to help both our merchants and our financial institutions.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we'll go to the line of Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nJason Kupferberg: Good morning, guys. Just a couple of questions on Clover. I know revenue growth was steady here, volume growth ticked down a little bit. Just any thoughts on Q4 expectations for those metrics? I think the volume comps get a little bit harder, revenue also next quarter. So, just wanted to get a sense of how we should be thinking about near-term trajectory there. I know you've got some new country launches, product launches to support it.\nBob Hau: Yeah, Jason, good morning. So, yes, we continue to see good overall revenue and volume growth out of our Clover solution. As you know, we've got a target to be $4.5 billion by 2026. That gets us where we needed about the 28% compound growth rate to achieve that. It's exactly where we were for the quarter. It's where we are on a year-to-date basis. A key part of that is continuing to add value-added services that ticked up 1 point to 21% of revenue. Overall, volume remains good. It obviously isn't as strong as it was last year. Some of that is very strong last year. So, a little bit of a difficult comp, but also the consumer, while still strong, still spending, has certainly eased a bit. We saw that last quarter. We saw that continue again this quarter. But we feel good about where that spending is right now and what we see going into the future.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we'll go to the line of Dave Koning from Baird. Please go ahead.\nDave Koning: Yeah. Hey, guys. Thanks. Good job. I guess, my question, in the SMB segment, for many quarters, you had kind of teens growth, kind of 13% to 17%. This quarter was 9% despite Clover being in the high-20%s for many quarters in a row. So, maybe what -- kind of what's happening outside of Clover, and then how should we expect that to reaccelerate going forward, or maybe just kind of talk through that?\nBob Hau: Yeah. So, there's a number of things going on. Obviously, Argentina tailwind has eased quite meaningfully since last year beginning of this year even where we saw in first quarter, 15% benefit to the Merchant segment, easing down in second quarter to 10%, now down to 6%. And that impacts both, actually all three of our segments, but certainly a good portion of SMB volume -- excuse me, SMB revenue. The other thing that does play out is anticipation has been quite strong and there is a mix differential between -- or benefit differential between SMB and enterprise. We've seen particular strength out of the large enterprises down in Argentina. We see that kind of shifting a bit into the next couple of quarters. A bit difficult to predict exactly what's going to happen into Argentina in the future. I think we've gotten it pretty right over the last several quarters and we see that excess or that tailwind continuing to ease. You may have noticed in our presentation and our charts, inflation continues to be a tailwind, although easing meaningfully, but interest has actually returned back to more normal or historic levels. And so that tailwind is subsiding quite meaningfully. And then, of course, if you get to an adjusted revenue basis, FX continues to be a real headwind for us in the quarter for the segments. For the Merchant segment, we saw 15 point impact -- negative impact to our adjusted revenue from FX. So, all of those play out in SMB, both in Clover and non-Clover.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we'll go to the line of Tim Chiodo from UBS. Please go ahead.\nTim Chiodo: Great. Thank you for taking the question. I also want to revisit the Financial Solutions revenue guidance for next year, which is set to slightly accelerate, so from 5% to 7% this year to 6% to 8% next year. When we think about the reasons, there appears to be a good long list of very clear bullets. So, there's the Target business, there's Desjardins, there's Verizon. I believe all of those are expected to go live with their incremental revenue streams next year. And then, of course, there's the CashFlow Central. So, I was hoping you could touch on or maybe elaborate on any of those particular projects and/or maybe just talk a little bit about the confidence that you have in that reacceleration for next year?\nFrank Bisignano: Yeah. So, I think, we were greatly reinforced only a couple of weeks ago at our Client Conference where you heard me talk about the added pipe, the added interest and the amount of opportunity we see to grow our client base. That was not unexpected. That was exactly what we expected for the outcome. Today, on a year-to-date basis, we're a 6% grower as we were in the quarter. I think when you think about the repertoire, Finxact is growing clients right now, and that will continue to add. You saw us talk about what we're doing with DoorDash, that's creating another fundamental, as I use in my simple language, bundle, which is embedded finance, right? Then, you look at this SMB bundle, which I am being deep in every other week reviews for over a year. So, my conviction on the depth of that pipeline will be bringing that online and will be within the numbers. We talk about merchant and FI, but -- and that merchant part shows up in the merchant P&L, but the reality is that also is bringing along other opportunity within the banking segment. And then, we do and we'll continue to have opportunities even within the banking segment outside the U.S. that we see more of than we did before because of the nature and the construct of this company. And you tapped on the items that -- you touched on the items that we're bringing in. I'd add one other one. We believe our long-term opportunity around AI and data for our financial institutions, what I said to medium-sized to smaller banks, we need to be their data and AI engine. And that's our natural position with them. Now, that's not in forecast today. We don't have a number in a box, but we have demand and we have the best data in the industry and data drives AI. So, I would think about it that the fact we're posting a 6% and we have these engines behind us has such conviction of what we could do. And we can do all of it better as I say every day just in the base business. So that's why we've been able to produce at the level we have -- even if you look at our five-year margin, look what we've done there, and I'm not saying we're going to have never-ending margin expansion, but I sure work on it regularly.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we'll go to the line of Dan Dolev from Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.\nDan Dolev: Hey, guys. Great results again. Frank, Clover Go and Clover Compact, they look like great solutions from micro sellers. Can you maybe give us a little bit of an update on the strategy and in terms of initial traction that you see on these new products? Thank you.\nFrank Bisignano: Yeah. We also see those products as augmentation products for our client base, right? So, I just want you to think about that way we talk about our ability to expand TAM in our own client base by bringing more. We definitely see the Compact playing in the food space. Obviously, we're early, but you should also think about international, right, that we're going to be bringing those products outside the U.S. in many cases, where, yes, we will still have software and VAS on top of them, but they may be catering to a different market. And we're going to have different forms of channel distribution. So, it gets us more software coming down a little bit [scale] (ph) in terms of merchant, but also augmenting our current client base to have a product that can work a little more mobile for them at times, too.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we'll go to the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJames Faucette: Thank you so much. I wanted to follow-up on the SMB bundle and this ties a little bit into Dan's question, but it seems like there's a lot of capability expansion that's happening within the Clover ecosystem and then looking at new ways to go to market. How should we be thinking about -- I know you gave some targets for back book and some of those things to get to the $4.5 billion target, but how should we be thinking about like the roles that those will play and if there's been any change in your thinking in terms of mix or type of customers and such within that Clover target? Thank you.\nFrank Bisignano: Yeah. I know there's only one question allowed, but that's like five. Good job, James. Let me try it. Like first of all, in some ways, there's not really -- inside this company that there's a ton of new thought. We always have a lot of R&D going on that historically and the IR team don't always love me for it, but they're more apt to talk to you about when we're getting to market than what's in the R&D shop. So, this idea about us bringing more capability to the SMB space has always been there. I think if you go back to our acquisition of Ondot and us embedding it in Mobiliti and then it became let's think about XD and a new product, but then you start saying to yourself, we could deliver this way beyond Clover and XD, we can integrate it all, we can put out Spendlabs acquisition there. Oh boy, we could end up helping LFI's grow and other channel partners and future partners to be signed up. That's why we are ultimately a partner of choice for people who want to partner in the SMB space because of our capability. So, I think you got to think about it that, yes, there may be more back book swept up in there because there's a reason beyond switching out your FD150 for a Clover station, now you have a much broader capability. None of this back book, if it happened, was ever more than our natural kind of rate, which we talked about of merchant churn going from an older device to a newer. But I think you're seeing the size of the opportunity to actually impact Clover more than we might have because of the full capability set. Thank you. I think you're on the right track there.\nOperator: Thank you. And for our final question, we'll go to the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi, thanks for taking my question. On Clover international expansion, how long does it take to ramp a new country or region from the time you enter the market to when you reach peak run rate? And also, should we expect sort of a steady rhythm of new markets for a while here, or are you going to kind of -- should we expect some pauses where you build out and sort of spool up in the countries you've already launched in?\nFrank Bisignano: Yeah. So, I'm a funny guy. I think we're going to get to peak run rate never because we're just going to keep driving more. So, that's kind of the journey we're on. But if you want to pick a country like Brazil, right, I'll be down there on the kick-off of it in December for the launch in Brazil and Mexico. I remember us launching Argentina, call it, four years ago. So, first of all, it's the full build to get to market. As we launch it, we expect it in Brazil, perfect example, to capture more merchants and more revenue opportunities than we do today immediately. Now, our ability to scale at the peak, we have great partners. I think if you were sitting with our Head of Latin America, he would say Caixa is very motivated. Well, that's a huge distribution. Now, we're going to get them trained. They are doing that right now and ready to distribute. So, it affects growth rate in '25, but I see Brazil as a multiyear build and a multiyear ramp. Not because we weren't able to get to all the zip codes or towns, if you want to think about it, but adoption. And then, so it's a multiyear ramp. But much like CashFlow Central of Brazil is in next year's number at some level, nowhere near where it'll be three years from now. So, I'd like to thank everybody for your attention today. Please reach out to our IR team with any further questions. And have a great day, and thanks for your participation.\nOperator: Thank you all for participating in the Fiserv third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. That concludes today's call. Please disconnect at this time, and have a great rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Frank Bisignano",
            "content": "Thank you, Julie, and thank you all for joining us today. As we share our third quarter results this morning, it is increasingly clear that our position at the intersection of merchant and financial solutions is a strategic advantage. Fiserv delivered another strong quarter, with adjusted earnings per share of $2.30, up 17%, driven by strong revenue growth and further operating margin expansion across our businesses. Adjusted revenue growth was 7% and adjusted operating margin rose 170 basis points to 40.2%. Organic revenue growth was 15%. Our free cash flow was $1.9 billion in the quarter and $3.3 billion year-to-date, and we returned $1.3 billion to shareholders via share repurchase. Businesses and financial institutions are increasingly interconnected, and Fiserv has a key role to play here given our unmatched set of assets across software, data, technology and, of course, scale and experience in moving money. Here are two examples in just the past month. First, we announced this morning with DoorDash, we began implementing a comprehensive embedded finance application poised to be a best-in-class solution for gig economy company. This solution enables DoorDash to offer its delivery contractors a full range of financial services. Within a single app, they can get instant access to wages and rewards, as well as deposit accounts, debit cards and more. Our real-time ledger capability from Finxact manages the transactions and was a key reason why Fiserv was chosen. A Fiserv banking client rounded out the solution as a requisite sponsor. Second, we completed a proof of concept with Walmart where we enabled a real-time Pay by Bank transaction at the point of sale over our proprietary NOW Network. A growing number of merchants are adding Pay by Bank capability to maximize choice for consumers and the emerging capacity for handling such payments in real time offers advantages for Fiserv, merchants and consumers. This capability will be more widely available next year via our NOW Network. Additionally, we teamed up with Walmart Business as a referral partner for Clover as a business management platform, helping Walmart fulfill its goal of helping small businesses and non-profits to better run their businesses. In a separate but related testament to our product strength and position as a partner of choice, today Inc. magazine named Clover to its 2024 Power Partners list, which recognizes the best B2B providers for SMBs. Let me share some of the many highlights of the quarter. It was another strong quarter of growth in the Merchant Solutions segment, with organic revenue up 24%. At Clover, revenue grew 28% and value-added services penetration reached 21%, up 1 percentage point from Q2. In Latin America, we expanded the friends and family Clover pilots in Brazil and Mexico as planned with a full-scale launch coming in December. In Asia Pacific, we went live with our first Clover pilot in Australia in September. We also enabled the Enterprise Commerce Control Center, which allows merchants to monitor and analyze their business and transaction performance across locations, regions and operating segments in a single view. In Financial Solutions, we posted another quarter of strong organic revenue growth at 6%. The build out of CashFlow Central was completed in September and we have our first client gearing up to implement the solution in the next few months. And we continue to migrate clients to Experience Digital, or XD, our new digital banking solution, as we integrate additional solutions into this unique digital ecosystem, including CashFlow Central, real-time payments, Clover and more. We expect to see a multiplying effect on the average revenue per XD user over time. It was another quarter of marquee wins that demonstrate the power of Fiserv's integrated and value-added offerings. We were chosen to provide merchant acceptance services for a major e-com marketplace and expanded our long-standing partnership with Costco to launch a stored value digital wallet. The service enables new payment and reward redemption experiences whether the retailer's customers are shopping online or in the warehouse. We continue to sign other enterprise merchants onto our value-added solutions. Another long-time enterprise client, Exxon, signed on for a data-as-a-service offering. This solution is used to extract insights from integrated vendor, payments, consumer loyalty and wallet data. And because it runs in a cloud, we can reduce implementation time from months to days. Also in Q3, Ahold Delhaize, a global retailer whose portfolio includes Stop & Shop in the U.S. selected Fiserv as the provider of Pay by Bank services. Alex Lee, a large privately owned operator of multiple food companies, chose our Smart Routing technology for debit cost efficiency. We accelerated our signings of financial institutions as merchant acquirer referral partners. These included banks of all sizes as well as credit unions. Golden 1 Credit Union and America First Credit Union were two of the larger signings in Q3. In our three regions, we continue to see strong client momentum. We expanded our partnership with Netto, a major grocery chain in Europe. We'll provide several value-added services, including dynamic currency conversion, customer cashback and encryption solutions, in addition to supplying thousands of new PIN pads to accelerate transaction speed across their 700 stores in Poland. In Asia Pac, Fiserv was chosen by foodpanda, a subsidiary of Delivery Hero and one of the world's leading local delivery companies, to provide payment services across multiple markets in Asia. This strategic partnership spans online, mobile and digital wallets, positioning Fiserv as foodpanda's primary acquirer in Singapore and Hong Kong, processing over $1 billion in annual spend. We launched Clover Sport at Bombonera in Argentina. This is one of the country's largest soccer stadiums and home to one of the top teams in the league. Clover's presence there can add to awareness in the region. To optimize the fan experience for fast and easy concession services, the stadium, through our ISV partner, chose the Clover platform to accept payments in three ways: through QR codes, self-service kiosks and mobile handheld devices. Moving to the Financial Solutions segments, four banks signed on for CashFlow Central in the past three months, including our first credit union for a total of 10 since we announced the initiative a year ago. AvidXchange will be using the CheckFree biller directory to support faster bill payment on its mid-market B2B exchange. In September, we won a competitive bid with Farm Credit Mid-America, a cooperative that reaches across six states. We'll be converting their loan portfolio to DNA and integrating several other value-added solutions. PNC signed up for our AI-enabled Advance Defense product for enhanced fraud detection in their card issuing business. Equitas Small Finance Bank was the latest India issuer to go live on our India processing hub, successfully launching a new retail and corporate card product with a full-stack offering, including loyalty, offers and real-time fraud management, as well as credit on UPI, India's real-time account-to-account payment system. And we continue to build our capability here as a market leader with seven of the 10 largest credit card issuers in India on our platform. In September, we hosted 3,000 Fiserv clients and prospects at our annual Client Conference forum. This group of attendees represent nearly 50% of our North American institutional revenue across the Merchant and Financial Solutions segments and nearly 60% of our new business pipeline through 2025. After three days of demos across 75 booths in our Experience Center, over 100 well-attended product and technology information sessions and thousands of client meetings, we strengthened our relationships and partnerships, expanded our pipeline of opportunities and generated enthusiasm for our offerings, setting the stage for continued strong growth in the future. One of the many highlights at Forum this year was our SMB bundle. The premise behind this suite of products is that small- and medium-sized businesses have a complex landscape to navigate for managing their businesses and they prefer a single easy-to-use system. With our own products and partnerships, Fiserv is the only financial technology expert with solutions that cut across the entire SMB value chain. Since the products and the clients for our SMB bundle span our Merchant and Financial Solutions segments, we have the unique opportunity to win business through the integration of solutions across both of our ecosystems. From our merchant ecosystem, we provide acceptance and processing, the Clover POS platform, Clover VAS, including vertical and horizontal business process software, capital, loyalty and gift solutions and the Small Business Index for localized insights. From our financial ecosystem, we provide CashFlow Central because cash management is a fundamental requirement for business success at SMBs. We also provide Optis for business card issuance, SpendTrack for expense management, Zelle for small business and core banking account management and digital banking. While we sell each of these separately now, next year, they will be integrated on our leading platforms. For FIs, the SMB bundle will integrate into digital banking environment such as Fiserv's Experience Digital or XD platform. For small businesses, the SMB bundle will integrate into the Clover Dashboard and be sold through all Clover channels. Lastly, I want to come back to something I said last quarter. Merchant-related services from Fiserv are back as an opportunity for financial institutions to compete and win. What's old is new again based on our innovations across the SMB bundle. It gives FIs a deeper view into an SMB's full financial position. With this knowledge and breadth of product, they can better grow and retain SMB clients and generate deposit and non-interest fees. We couple this capability with tools to help FIs readily find merchant customer leads and onboard them digitally. Showcasing our integrated SMB capabilities generated a lot of interest and ongoing engagement and we expect the SMB bundle to start contributing to growth next year. Turning to our guidance for the rest of the year, we are raising organic revenue growth from 15% to 17% to 16% to 17%, and raising our guidance for adjusted earnings per share to $8.73 to $8.80. As I look across all the new initiatives we are rolling out, I am pleased with how the vision and investment we put into motion five years ago has brought Fiserv to a strong position today, one that's clearly hard to replicate. The results show that we are executing on mandates for each of our two ecosystems, merchants and financial institutions. This will continue in many ways as we add to our Clover portfolio, extend services to enterprise merchants, expand issuing to new verticals and geographies, enable more real-time payments, modernize core banking systems, add partners, grow internationally, and continue to use distribution data and more. With this foundation of leadership and steady growth firmly established, we are moving to the next generation of solutions that answers the needs across both ecosystems. As the only provider serving both merchants and financial institutions with product breadth and technological scale we serve at the intersection between merchants and fintech, issuers and fintechs, acquiring and cash management, digital wallets and card services, spending and banking data, and many other combinations. This is not a vision. It is here today in our initiatives with DoorDash, Apple, Walmart, U.S. Bank, Palantir and others. Of course, these integrated opportunities are in their early stages. As excited as we are about them today, our measure of success will be strong sustainable growth for Fiserv over the medium and longer term. And now, I will turn it over to Bob for more detail on our financial performance. Thanks, Bob. I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss our corporate social responsibility initiatives, not because these are investment parameters, but because they represent who we are as a company. Hurricanes Helene and Milton were devastating for millions of people and businesses, including many Fiserv clients. Our response, as always, is to take action and we quickly sent support to the Red Cross and personally delivered supplies to the affected areas. As part of our partnership with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation and our investment to support its disaster preparedness and recovery effort for small businesses, we provided the Chamber with Fiserv Small Business Index data on the impact of the hurricanes. These granular insights on commerce levels leading up to, during and after these natural disasters are being used to educate policymakers and stakeholders, guide targeted response investments and inform philanthropic support efforts that create and boost small business recovery. Also in the quarter, Fiserv achieved a score of 100 on the Disability Equality Index and was recognized as a Top Veteran-Friendly Company by US Veterans Magazine, each for the third year in a row. The National Bankers Association, a trade organization that represents all minority depository institutions, presented Fiserv with its Corporate Excellence Award, making us the first large-scale tech provider to receive this honor. Finally, we continue to advance our sustainability and green building design strategy. Our Milwaukee headquarters recently achieved LEED Gold status following our Dublin, Ireland and New Jersey Innovation Centers, which achieved LEED Platinum status previously. These are just some examples of how our hard work and dedication show up in many quarters, but most importantly, it showed up in the strong financial performance you just heard. This put us at the top of the IDC FinTech Rankings for a second straight year, and our story today is about how we intend to stay there. I'd like to thank our more than 40,000 employees for their contributions to these significant achievements and for the day-to-day blocking and tackling that has produced consistently strong results. That's 40 years of building trust, scale and experience, and five years since the merger of achieving innovation through unmatched investment across our merchant and financial ecosystems. So, now, operator, please open the lines for questions. So, I'd like to go back to something I'd like to say the construction of the company, right? I always believe that this was a very strategic set of assets we put together that were highly complementary five years ago. And one quick place to think about it is in merchant and FI, just in total, our ability to be the strategic partner of choice to deliver merchant and FI and put Clover on the front end of that. And then, really there is the power of owning a debit network and the ability of what to bring to our largest institutions and to our client base across merchants. And then, you go a step further and the future of the growth initiatives in terms of us talking about the SMB bundle and the ability to take all the assets we have and integrate them technically now, right? You see us on the front line there with Apple Pay and then you can see us with issuers in another spot and then see us weaving the place together and the ability of the crossroads of merchants and FIs, I think Walmart is a great example of it. I think DoorDash is a great example of it, right? And so, then you think about, okay, you got Finxact, you're bringing Finxact in as a [handless core] (ph) to be actually a ledger here for the famous Dashers. And then you go, okay, you put XD and Clover together and deliver a capability to every financial institution that runs on us. And you take a look at our international expansion and you look at the work on Commerce Hub, now showing up in the enterprise segment. So, I think the construction of the company with financial institutions all the way through from the largest to a credit union or a local community bank, and then you take on top of that the assets we bring to it. So, I mean, you're seeing it and then we brought 3,000 people to forum and I think you were there, too, if I am right. And I mean you saw the power of the franchise first-hand. So, we think that's why we see such sustainable growth for the long term, and we always think we can do our job better, too. Yeah. So, I think one of the things to think about is we always believe that we wanted the capability to compete for transactions for our client benefit, right, for our client benefit. And that window opens up. STAR/Accel is clearly a strategic asset to sit at the crossroads of merchants and financial institutions. We believe our capability is strong on PIN. We have the signature capability. We do have dual-messaging capability. And we give our merchants and issuers choices to compete for transactions at every level. So, that's the strategy, right? The strategy is to support our client base. We believe it too is one of these steady opportunity you're not going to see this meteoric rise of transactions, but you'll continue to see volume share gains and we'll continue to have an asset in our repertoire to help both our merchants and our financial institutions. Yeah. So, I think, we were greatly reinforced only a couple of weeks ago at our Client Conference where you heard me talk about the added pipe, the added interest and the amount of opportunity we see to grow our client base. That was not unexpected. That was exactly what we expected for the outcome. Today, on a year-to-date basis, we're a 6% grower as we were in the quarter. I think when you think about the repertoire, Finxact is growing clients right now, and that will continue to add. You saw us talk about what we're doing with DoorDash, that's creating another fundamental, as I use in my simple language, bundle, which is embedded finance, right? Then, you look at this SMB bundle, which I am being deep in every other week reviews for over a year. So, my conviction on the depth of that pipeline will be bringing that online and will be within the numbers. We talk about merchant and FI, but -- and that merchant part shows up in the merchant P&L, but the reality is that also is bringing along other opportunity within the banking segment. And then, we do and we'll continue to have opportunities even within the banking segment outside the U.S. that we see more of than we did before because of the nature and the construct of this company. And you tapped on the items that -- you touched on the items that we're bringing in. I'd add one other one. We believe our long-term opportunity around AI and data for our financial institutions, what I said to medium-sized to smaller banks, we need to be their data and AI engine. And that's our natural position with them. Now, that's not in forecast today. We don't have a number in a box, but we have demand and we have the best data in the industry and data drives AI. So, I would think about it that the fact we're posting a 6% and we have these engines behind us has such conviction of what we could do. And we can do all of it better as I say every day just in the base business. So that's why we've been able to produce at the level we have -- even if you look at our five-year margin, look what we've done there, and I'm not saying we're going to have never-ending margin expansion, but I sure work on it regularly. Yeah. We also see those products as augmentation products for our client base, right? So, I just want you to think about that way we talk about our ability to expand TAM in our own client base by bringing more. We definitely see the Compact playing in the food space. Obviously, we're early, but you should also think about international, right, that we're going to be bringing those products outside the U.S. in many cases, where, yes, we will still have software and VAS on top of them, but they may be catering to a different market. And we're going to have different forms of channel distribution. So, it gets us more software coming down a little bit [scale] (ph) in terms of merchant, but also augmenting our current client base to have a product that can work a little more mobile for them at times, too. Yeah. I know there's only one question allowed, but that's like five. Good job, James. Let me try it. Like first of all, in some ways, there's not really -- inside this company that there's a ton of new thought. We always have a lot of R&D going on that historically and the IR team don't always love me for it, but they're more apt to talk to you about when we're getting to market than what's in the R&D shop. So, this idea about us bringing more capability to the SMB space has always been there. I think if you go back to our acquisition of Ondot and us embedding it in Mobiliti and then it became let's think about XD and a new product, but then you start saying to yourself, we could deliver this way beyond Clover and XD, we can integrate it all, we can put out Spendlabs acquisition there. Oh boy, we could end up helping LFI's grow and other channel partners and future partners to be signed up. That's why we are ultimately a partner of choice for people who want to partner in the SMB space because of our capability. So, I think you got to think about it that, yes, there may be more back book swept up in there because there's a reason beyond switching out your FD150 for a Clover station, now you have a much broader capability. None of this back book, if it happened, was ever more than our natural kind of rate, which we talked about of merchant churn going from an older device to a newer. But I think you're seeing the size of the opportunity to actually impact Clover more than we might have because of the full capability set. Thank you. I think you're on the right track there. Yeah. So, I'm a funny guy. I think we're going to get to peak run rate never because we're just going to keep driving more. So, that's kind of the journey we're on. But if you want to pick a country like Brazil, right, I'll be down there on the kick-off of it in December for the launch in Brazil and Mexico. I remember us launching Argentina, call it, four years ago. So, first of all, it's the full build to get to market. As we launch it, we expect it in Brazil, perfect example, to capture more merchants and more revenue opportunities than we do today immediately. Now, our ability to scale at the peak, we have great partners. I think if you were sitting with our Head of Latin America, he would say Caixa is very motivated. Well, that's a huge distribution. Now, we're going to get them trained. They are doing that right now and ready to distribute. So, it affects growth rate in '25, but I see Brazil as a multiyear build and a multiyear ramp. Not because we weren't able to get to all the zip codes or towns, if you want to think about it, but adoption. And then, so it's a multiyear ramp. But much like CashFlow Central of Brazil is in next year's number at some level, nowhere near where it'll be three years from now. So, I'd like to thank everybody for your attention today. Please reach out to our IR team with any further questions. And have a great day, and thanks for your participation."

            "name": "Bob Hau",
            "content": "Thank you, Frank, and good morning everyone. If you are following along on our slides, I will cover additional detail on total company and segment performance, starting with our financial metrics and trends on Slide 4. Third quarter, again, demonstrated our capability to maintain strong revenue growth and margin expansion. Third quarter total company adjusted revenue grew 7% to $4.9 billion and adjusted operating income grew 12% to $2 billion, resulting in adjusted operating margin of 40.2%, an increase of 170 basis points versus the prior year. Year-to-date, adjusted revenue grew 7% to $14.2 billion and adjusted operating income grew 12% to $5.4 billion, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 38.2%, an increase of 170 basis points versus the prior year. Organic revenue grew 15% in the quarter, driven by strength in both segments. The transitory contribution from excess inflation in Argentina was 3 points to our total organic growth in the quarter, down from 5 points in Q2. As mentioned during last quarter's earnings call, do\u0301lar turista extended into Q3 and contributed less than 0.5 point of total company organic growth in the quarter. Third quarter adjusted earnings per share was $2.30 compared to $1.96 in the prior year, up 17% on the high end of our full year guidance provided last quarter of 15% to 17%. Year-to-date, our adjusted earnings per share increased 18% to $6.29 compared to $5.34 in the prior year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.9 billion, and year-to-date free cash flow was $3.3 billion. As mentioned in prior earnings calls, we expected free cash flow to be much higher in the second half of this year after a lighter first half due to the timing of cash flows for the green tax credit program. The related refund came through in the third quarter. Turning to performance by segment, starting on Slide 5, organic revenue growth in the Merchant Solutions segment was 24% in the quarter and 29% year-to-date. This includes a 6 point benefit from above-average inflation in Argentina in the quarter and a 10 point benefit year-to-date. While inflation remains high, interest rates in Argentina eased in late second quarter and are back to historical averages and, therefore, did not contribute to excess growth this quarter. The continuation of do\u0301lar turista contributed nearly 1 percentage point to Merchant organic revenue growth in the quarter and 3 points year-to-date. On Slide 6, we have again included a summary of the impact of excess Argentine inflation and interest on total Fiserv and Merchant segment revenue along with the offsetting headwind from currency devaluation, which impacts adjusted revenue. Adjusted revenue growth for Merchant Solutions was 9% in the quarter and 10% year-to-date. The quarterly results include a 15 percentage point currency headwind largely from the Argentine peso after a sharp devaluation in late December last year. Similar to Q2, the currency headwind to adjusted revenue growth was much higher than the inflation and interest tailwind in the quarter. 2024 has been an outstanding year for new Clover hardware launches. Earlier this year, we brought to market the Kitchen Display System, or KDS XL, to manage orders and improve efficiency in a 24-inches formfactor that larger restaurants demand. We also launched the Kiosk, which allows for self-service ordering, reducing wait times and increasing average tickets. In Q3, we introduced a new version of the Flex handheld device called the Flex Pocket, which is 25% lighter, 50% thinner and oriented towards restaurant and waitstaff in retail. And most recently, we launched the Clover Compact, an entry-level solution that will help drive TAM expansion and create new VAS revenue opportunities. Now moving to the business lines. Small business organic and adjusted revenue growth in the quarter was 25% and 9%, respectively, on payment volume growth of 4%. This volume growth was similar to Q2 levels. According to a variety of external macro indicators, overall consumer spending growth is slower than last year, but appears stable at a comfortable pace. Fiserv's small business performance was ahead of our Small Business Index results, which showed year-over-year sales volume growth of 2.3% compared to 3.7% for Q2 and 2.8% for Q3 2023. The difference is likely attributable to our international presence and a slightly different mix of business. Fiserv is more heavily weighted to non-discretionary categories such as food and services, which have been growing faster. Clover revenue grew 28% in the third quarter on an annualized payment volume growth of 15%. VAS penetration increased sequentially by 1 point to 21% in Q3, driven by growth in Clover Capital and the Clover SaaS package. In Q4, we will be rolling out new vertical software plans for retail and services. With this progress, we remain on track to achieve our 2026 Clover targets of $4.5 billion in revenue and VAS penetration of 27%. Enterprise organic and adjusted revenue growth in the quarter was 37% and 17%, respectively, driven by transactions growth of 12% and higher VAS penetration. As with small business, organic growth in enterprise includes some transitory benefit in Argentina. Above-average growth in enterprise business reflects the ramping of a large PayFac from our processing customer to a direct client. Commerce Hub continues to see ongoing traction and is now processing almost 7 times the daily transactions versus Q1 and 2 times when compared to Q2. And clients are increasingly connected to enhanced solutions. Much of the Commerce Hub transaction growth comes from existing clients migrating to the Commerce Hub and the fact that they are now on the platform gives us the opportunity to sell more VAS going forward. Finally, processing organic revenue in the quarter declined by 1%, while adjusted revenue decreased 2%. This business represents the back-end processing we do for our bank and certain ISO partners where they own the merchant relationship. Year-to-date processing organic and adjusted revenue growth were both flat, consistent with our expectation. Adjusted operating income in the Merchant Solutions segment increased 19% to $931 million in the quarter, with adjusted operating margin up 290 basis points to 37.7%. Year-to-date, adjusted operating income increased 22% to $2.6 billion, with adjusted operating margin up 330 basis points to 36.2%. As noted in prior quarters, interest expense from anticipation revenue is recorded below the operating income line. If the interest costs from anticipation were included in the operating income, Merchant adjusted operating margins would have expanded 190 basis points for the quarter and 260 basis points year-to-date. Turning to Slide 7, on the Financial Solutions segment, organic revenue grew 6% in the quarter and year-to-date, in line with our full year outlook of 5% to 7%. Looking at the business lines, digital payments organic and adjusted revenue each grew by 5% in the quarter. Growth in Zelle transactions continue to be strong at 35%. We continue to see demand from clients for digital payments products such as FedNow and RTP integrations. CashFlow Central, our integrated AR/AP solution for SMBs, continues to see high interest from financial institutions. In the last three months, we signed two nearly-$10 billion institutions Amarillo National Bank and Tri Counties Bank. In total, we had four wins in the last three months, bringing the total to 10 since product announcement. In issuing, organic and adjusted revenue grew 7% and 4%, respectively, in the quarter, driven by demand across various verticals, including government and healthcare. During the quarter, we converted the remaining HealthEquity HSA and FSA card accounts to Optis, our issuing processing platform, solidifying our leadership in the healthcare card vertical. Banking organic and adjusted revenue grew 5% in the quarter. Last quarter, we spoke about signing a merchant agreement with Connecticut On-Line Computer Center, known as COCC, which is a client-owned provider of banking technology. In the third quarter, we expanded our relationship to include Experience Digital, or XD, which is our online and mobile banking solution. XD will now be available to the 150 community banks and credit unions on COCC solution. Third quarter adjusted operating income for the Financial Solutions segment was up 5% to $1.1 billion, and adjusted operating margin came in strong at 47.4%. Year-to-date, adjusted operating income for the segment was up 6% to $3.2 billion, with adjusted operating margin up 60 basis points to 45.8%. Now, let me wrap up with some remaining details on the financials. The corporate adjusted operating loss was $112 million in the quarter and $394 million year-to-date, in line with our expectations. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 18.8% and 19.0% year-to-date. We expect the full year rate to be slightly below 20%. Total debt outstanding was $25.3 billion on September 30. Our debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio went down from 2.8 times in the second quarter to 2.7 times in the third quarter, in line with our target leverage range. During the quarter, we repurchased 8 million shares for $1.3 billion, bringing our total cash return to shareholders for the last 12 months to $5.3 billion and over $16 billion since the 2019 merger. We had 24 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase at the end of the quarter. Turning to Slide 9, as Frank said earlier, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share outlook to a range of $8.73 to $8.80, up from $8.65 to $8.80. This is an acceleration in forecasted adjusted EPS growth to 16% to 17% from 15% to 17%. This is also a $0.04 raise at the midpoint from prior guidance and $0.14 from our original guidance. We are raising our 2024 organic revenue growth outlook from 15% to 17% to 16% to 17%. Additionally, we are raising our adjusted margin expansion outlook from more than 135 basis points to at least 150 basis points. Lastly, we are updating our free cash flow guidance from about $4.7 billion to above $4.7 billion, driven by the strong free cash flow in the third quarter and year-to-date. Given the current environment in Argentina, we continue to assume 4 points of benefit from excess inflation and interest this year for the total company and 9 points for Merchant Solutions. We now see the do\u0301lar turista program continuing into the fourth quarter, but easing through the end of the year. Our full year outlook of 16% to 17% total company organic growth includes a 4 point transitory benefit from inflation and interest in Argentina and just over 1 point of growth from do\u0301lar turista. Excluding these combined transitory factors, 2024 organic revenue growth would be 11% to 12% at the upper end of our medium-term guidance of 9% to 12%. The forecasted impact from foreign currency exchange remains 8.5% and we anticipate will continue to be a stronger though declining headwind to adjusted revenue growth relative to the tailwind from excess inflation and interest. Finally, in the past month, we made progress on three items that many of you have been asking about over the last month. While these do not have an outsized impact on our financials given the scale of our business, they demonstrate our ability to navigate ongoing change in our business in a way that is not disruptive and always open to opportunity. First, as previously reported, we expect Wells Fargo to take ownership of our 40% owned joint venture Wells Fargo Merchant Services on April 1, 2025, at which time, we will receive cash or assets for our portion of the business. Fiserv will continue to provide processing services to Wells' existing and new merchants along with other related services. As a result, we see no change to our medium-term outlook of 9% to 12% adjusted revenue growth and 15% to 17% adjusted EPS growth from this transaction. Secondly, we extended our merchant processing joint venture with PNC for the fifth time. The relationship dates back to 1996, supporting PNC small business and enterprise clients with hardware and processing services from Fiserv and we expect Clover to have a growing presence from here. And third, the State of Georgia approved our application for a merchant acquirer limited purpose bank charter. This approval from the state allows Fiserv to apply for direct acceptance into the card networks and is anticipated to be operational in 2025. This is a special purpose charter that enables optionality for sponsorship for merchant acquiring. It's important to clarify that Fiserv is not becoming a bank. Fiserv will not open branches, take deposits or write loans as traditional banks do. We have no intention in doing that and in fact the charter itself does not permit these traditional banking activities. With that, let me turn the call back to Frank for some closing remarks. Yeah, Tien-Tsin, good morning. So, you're right, we did see an increase in transactions. Transaction growth in the quarter was up 12% over prior year. That actually matches what we saw in Q1. It's up from the 8% we saw in Q2. We definitely see some variation, particularly when we bring on new clients, some of them in this enterprise space can be quite large. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we did have a large PayFac begin to really ramp in the third quarter. We will see a little bit of that continue in fourth quarter as they get to full capability or full volume, and then it will return to \"more normal levels.\" Overall for that business line, we obviously saw very good organic growth, well ahead of the overall company average on an adjusted basis, which again that has also impact from Argentina in it. We feel great about the year-to-date at 11% on an adjusted basis. Yeah, Jason, good morning. So, yes, we continue to see good overall revenue and volume growth out of our Clover solution. As you know, we've got a target to be $4.5 billion by 2026. That gets us where we needed about the 28% compound growth rate to achieve that. It's exactly where we were for the quarter. It's where we are on a year-to-date basis. A key part of that is continuing to add value-added services that ticked up 1 point to 21% of revenue. Overall, volume remains good. It obviously isn't as strong as it was last year. Some of that is very strong last year. So, a little bit of a difficult comp, but also the consumer, while still strong, still spending, has certainly eased a bit. We saw that last quarter. We saw that continue again this quarter. But we feel good about where that spending is right now and what we see going into the future. Yeah. So, there's a number of things going on. Obviously, Argentina tailwind has eased quite meaningfully since last year beginning of this year even where we saw in first quarter, 15% benefit to the Merchant segment, easing down in second quarter to 10%, now down to 6%. And that impacts both, actually all three of our segments, but certainly a good portion of SMB volume -- excuse me, SMB revenue. The other thing that does play out is anticipation has been quite strong and there is a mix differential between -- or benefit differential between SMB and enterprise. We've seen particular strength out of the large enterprises down in Argentina. We see that kind of shifting a bit into the next couple of quarters. A bit difficult to predict exactly what's going to happen into Argentina in the future. I think we've gotten it pretty right over the last several quarters and we see that excess or that tailwind continuing to ease. You may have noticed in our presentation and our charts, inflation continues to be a tailwind, although easing meaningfully, but interest has actually returned back to more normal or historic levels. And so that tailwind is subsiding quite meaningfully. And then, of course, if you get to an adjusted revenue basis, FX continues to be a real headwind for us in the quarter for the segments. For the Merchant segment, we saw 15 point impact -- negative impact to our adjusted revenue from FX. So, all of those play out in SMB, both in Clover and non-Clover."

        "content": "Operator: Welcome to the Fiserv second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question and answer session begins following the presentation. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, I will turn the call over to Julie Chariell, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv.\nJulie Chariell: Thank you and good morning. With me on the call today are Frank Bisignano, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and supplemental materials for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of Fiserv.com. Please refer to these materials for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call, along with a reconciliation of those measure to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. Unless otherwise stated, performance references are year-over-year comparisons. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. You should refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Frank.\nFrank Bisignano: Thank you Julie, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss second quarter results that bring us closer to another year of double-digit organic revenue and adjusted earnings per share growth. Fiserv delivered strong results across our businesses with second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $2.13, up 18% driven by continued healthy revenue growth and further operating margin expansion. Adjusted revenue growth was 7% and adjusted operating margin rose 160 basis points to 38.4%. Organic revenue growth was 18%. We can point to many highlights in our business during the quarter, including Clover revenue of 28%, accelerated organic revenue growth in financial solutions to 8%, multiple wins with marquee clients including Verizon and Apple, plus new clients in important verticals such as petro, gaming, government and healthcare. Our free cash flow was $1 billion in the quarter and $4 billion over the last 12 months, and we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders via share repurchases. This month, we are celebrating the 40th anniversary of Fiserv, along with the fifth anniversary of the merger between Fiserv and First Data. Our vision back in 2019 was that if we brought together scaled platforms supporting a full breadth of solutions, merchant acquiring, debit and credit issuer services, digital payments of all kinds and core bank account systems modernized with cloud technologies, then clients would find value in the combination and the integration and Fiserv would become a partner of choice with unparalleled global reach. Today, we can see that\u2019s exactly what has happened. As we realized revenue and cost synergies over this time, we increased our investment in technology innovation. Our purpose has been to deliver solutions to clients of all kinds, established and new, large and small, local and global, spanning all verticals. With the proper amount of disrupting ourselves then and now, Fiserv is better able to run, optimize and grow our business, and now we find ourselves at this moment, singular in our ability to deliver a breadth of leading products across a diverse base of clients and demonstrating accelerated growth for the past three years. After five years of innovation, in some ways what\u2019s old is new again. Let me share three examples of how our clients are engaging in some of our traditional businesses as new ways to add and retain their own customers. First in merchant acquiring, banks are adding this service as a way to grow with small and medium sized business customers and choosing Fiserv for its leading solutions, including Clover. We already have nearly 900 financial institutions who offer merchant processing services to their small business clients, and thousands more who can still benefit from doing so. As an example, in Q2 we signed a merchant agreement with Connecticut Online Computer Center, known as COCC, which is a client-owned provider of banking technology. The 150 community banks and credit unions on the COCC platform now have access to our acquiring services in support of their own hundreds of thousands of merchants. Second in digital payments, CashFlow Central takes the best of consumer bill pay and turns it from a cost center within banks to a revenue generator that appeals to small business with bill payment and presentment capability. In the second quarter, we signed two more CashFlow Central deals with multi-billion dollar banks for a total of six in the few months since we introduced this solution. CashFlow Central will go live this quarter and the pipeline remains full. We are finding that as they go down this path, financial institutions are revitalizing the consumer bill pay offerings as well, answering the competition from the direct biller model. First Citizens, a top 20 U.S. bank with more than $200 billion in assets was one such consumer bill pay win in Q2. As a reminder, Fiserv is the largest provider of bank consumer bill pay services with over 20 million users on our check-free platform. Both merchant acquiring solutions and CashFlow Central are compelling because they provide revenue generating opportunities for our financial institution clients. They also demonstrate a distinct value proposition for small businesses which includes other products across our issuing and banking businesses. Next, we are integrating these solutions with Experience Digital, or XD, our new online and mobile banking solution; and third, traditional enterprise merchants are turning to software that surround their payments functionality to enhance revenue and improve data integration. As we\u2019ve seen from small businesses, the large and midmarket merchants who have been migrating to our omnichannel platform are increasingly integrating our value-added solutions. These include SnapPay, our ERP-integrated B2B bill presentment platform; gift solutions, where we support multiple leading retail and QSR enterprise clients; and data analytics, which I\u2019ll discuss a bit later. We continue to invest in new solutions such as our new dedicated platform for paybacks, which is gaining momentum. In the second quarter, for instance, we were selected by Cantaloupe, a major provider of unattended payment devices such as vending machines, for our Exchange payback platform, and we continue to integrate solutions across our two segments. One example is our new partnership with Apple that will enable new Apple Pay functionality with two of our next-generation solutions. One is pay with points, where the loyalty points residing on the card accounts of our issuer clients can be redeemed for a transaction in the Apple Pay wallet at checkout, serving as currency. We are a natural partner given the breadth of our card accounts on file and our technical capability to maintain account point balances, convert and accept those points as payments, and then reconcile the balances. A second solution is installment loans on credit cards. This is a new feature that presents the consumer with the choice to pay for a purchase in a set of installments when using Apple Pay at checkout. This is differentiating in that consumers have only been provided with the option to pay for a purchase in installments after making a purchase on a credit card. With Apple, we will move this installment loan feature into the checkout flow, giving the consumer choice at the point of purchase. Having this functionality at the point of sale from a digital wallet can drive greater card conversion, card usage, and spending power. It also enables our issuing partners to more directly compete with Buy Now, Pay Later using their existing credit card products. Fiserv is unique in its reach across all parties involved here: the consumer, the digital wallet provider, the issuer and the merchant, so we see multiple opportunities ahead as we enable this network effect to be a win-win across the ecosystem. Let\u2019s turn to our outlook for the business. Based on strong performance in the quarter and conviction in our unique opportunity set, we are raising our adjusted earnings per share outlook to $8.65 to $8.80, an increase of $0.05 across the range. Our revenue outlook is unchanged at 15% to 17% organic growth. This performance for 2024 would represent the 39th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Turning to our segment highlights, in merchant solutions starting with small business, we posted 4% volume growth, slightly ahead of the sales volume growth for the Fiserv Small Business Index, which rose 3.2% in Q2 as the pace of growth slowed from April to June. There are multiple reasons why our growth can differ from this U.S.-only index, including our global presence and different weightings across verticals. For Clover, we have a very active second half of the year for new product rollouts. We plan to launch additional restaurant software features that target our sweet spot in casual dining to enhance table management, kitchen operations, inventory and cost management. In the fourth quarter, we\u2019ll be rolling out new software offerings in our two other target verticals, services and retail. We are very pleased with initial sales of our restaurant order kiosks and now we look forward to two new hardware opportunities. First is the Clover Compact, which we rolled out this month, giving us a broader market opportunity with smaller merchants, and next an important solution for our restaurant clients, order and pay at the table via a new handheld Clover Flex Pocket, coming in August. We are on pace with our international expansion. Pilots are set to go live in Brazil and Mexico in August, and then in September in Australia ahead of the 2025 launch. In the enterprise merchant business, a key driver is the ongoing adoption of Commerce Hub, the orchestration layer that allows for easy integration with our growing portfolio of value-added solutions. We now have 230 clients live on Commerce Hub and signed several more in Q2, including two large petro retailers to extend our leading position in this vertical. Our financial solutions segment posted strong organic revenue growth at 8% in the quarter, above the high end of our 2024 guidance range. We delivered faster organic growth in our banking business while our core banking and credit union clients continued to drive strong growth in our digital payments business. We are adding new clients as well. In the second quarter, we had another example of winning the core account processing business in an M&A transaction. In this latest case, Sunflower Bank chose Fiserv after announcing their intent to acquire HomeStreet Bank to create a $17 billion bank by assets in January. In issuing, we manage the credit and loan accounts for some of the world\u2019s leading issuers and provide technology to issuers and lenders in healthcare, government and education. In June, we were very pleased to have won a strategic outsourcing agreement with Verizon to support their device financing activity and manage device payment agreements on Fiserv\u2019s Optis platform. Verizon chose Fiserv for the flexibility, optionality and resiliency of our platform on the foundation of a trusted longstanding relationship that spans multiple solutions. This is another example of extending our issuer and loan processing capability into adjacent verticals. In fact, we won another point of sale financing deal with an industrial equipment manufacturer to offer short term loans through its dealer network across the globe using our First Vision platform. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Bob to discuss more on outperformance and financials.\nBob Hau: Thank you Frank, and good morning everyone. If you\u2019re following along on our slides, I\u2019ll cover additional detail on total company and segment performance, starting with our financial metrics and trends on Slide 4. Our performance in the second quarter showcased our ability to sustain strong revenue growth and margin expansion. Second quarter total company adjusted revenue grew 7% to $4.8 billion, and adjusted operating income grew 12% to $1.8 billion, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 38.4%, an increase of 160 basis points versus the prior year. For the first half of the year, adjusted revenue grew 7% to $9.3 billion, and adjusted operating income grew 13% to $3.5 billion, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 37.2%, an increase of 180 basis points versus the prior year. Organic revenue grew 18% in the quarter with strength in both segments. The transitory contribution from Argentina was five points to our total organic growth in the quarter, down from seven points in Q1. In the first six months of the year, organic revenue grew 19%. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share was $2.13 compared to $1.81 in the prior year, up 18% and above previous full year guidance of 4% to 16%. Year to date, our adjusted earnings per share increased 18% to $4 compare to $3.38 in the prior year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1 billion and $1.5 billion for the first half of the year. We expect free cash flow to be much higher in the second half of this year due to the timing of cash flows for the green tax credit program. Turning to performance by segment, starting on Slide 5, organic revenue growth in the merchant solutions segment was 28% in the quarter and 32% year to date. For the quarter, this includes a 10-point benefit from above average interest and inflation in Argentina. Without this transitory benefit, organic growth would have been 18%. On Slide 6, we\u2019ve again included a summary of the impact of excess Argentine inflation and interest on total Fiserv and merchant segment revenue, along with the offsetting headwind from currency devaluation which impacts adjusted revenue. Adjusted revenue growth for merchant solutions was 9% in the quarter and 11% year to date. The quarterly results include a 19 percentage point currency headwind largely from the Argentine peso after a sharp devaluation in late December last year. Similar to Q1, the currency headwind to adjusted revenue growth was much higher than the inflation and interest tailwind in Q2. Moving to the business lines, small business organic and adjusted revenue growth in the quarter was 35% and 13% respectively. Clover revenue grew 28% in the second quarter on an annualized payment volume growth of 17%. The spread between revenue and volume growth continues to reflect a higher penetration of value-added solutions, continued channel mix shift, and value-based pricing. VAS penetration stayed constant sequentially at 20% in Q2, an improvement from prior years where we typically see a seasonal decline from Q1 to Q2. VAS penetration was driven by growth in Clover Capital and the Clover SaaS package and should expand with several new offerings coming in the second half. Overall, we remain on pace to meet our 2026 targets. Enterprise organic and adjusted revenue growth in the quarter was 27% and 9% respectively, driven by transactions growth of 8% and higher VAS penetration. As with small business, organic growth at enterprise includes some transitory benefit from excess inflation and interest in Argentina. We\u2019re pleased with the pace of client uptake and growth in Commerce Hub. Daily transactions in Commerce Hub are up 3.5 times from Q1 levels and clients are increasingly connecting to enhanced solutions. Three of the most popular are pay by bank, which allows consumers to pay via ACH payment from their bank account at the point of sale; online EVT, which lets merchants grow by offering payment via government benefit programs; and digital payouts, which merchants increasingly use to pay employees and vendors. Finally, processing organic and adjusted revenue in the quarter declined by 7% and 8% respectively. This business represents the bank end processing we do for our partners, where they own the merchant relationship. A few large processing clients experienced declines in their volumes and revenue in Q2. Year to date, processing organic and adjusted revenue are both up 1%, similar to our guidance for flat adjusted revenue over the medium term. Turning to some merchant highlights outside the U.S., first in EMEA, the general tone of business is improving as inflation is easing and consumer confidence begins to rise across the region. We had a good quarter for new wins and renewals with follow-on business, and we are finding that our professional services capability in the region is a competitive differentiator that reinforces our right to win. We expanded our strategic partnership with BNP Paribas, one of the leading banks in Europe, allowing it to extend its current merchant acquiring footprint into Germany. Also in Germany, H&M Group, the second-largest clothing retailer in the world, selected us as their strategic partner for point of sale, building on our existing relationship in Mexico and highlighting the value we bring to multi-national retail clients. We are also working with Lloyd\u2019s Banking Group, one of the leading banks in the U.K. and a key partner for Fiserv, on a major business transformation program for Cardnet, our merchant acquiring joint venture. Together, we will deliver tailored solutions including Clover, dynamic currency conversion and merchant cash advance to add new and grow existing merchant relationships. We\u2019ve also been selected by Deutsche Bahn, the national railway company of Germany and one of the largest railway companies in the world, to provide terminals, network services and value-added solutions. We extended our relationship with Absa, one of Africa\u2019s largest diversified financial services groups. We will be implementing our full AQaaS solution, or acquiring as a service, which will allow Absa to process ecommerce transactions in nine African countries. AQaaS integrates multiple value-added solutions including payment gateway, merchant onboarding, merchant portal, omnipay back office, open FX, and real time fraud monitoring. Finally, we\u2019ve extended our merchant acquiring relationship with \u017babka Polska, the largest convenience store chain in central and eastern Europe, based in Poland, with over 11,000 stores. We\u2019ve grown to provide more than 20 products to this innovative client, most recently adding merchant cash advance, a growing value-added solution for us in the region. Moving to Latin America, in Brazil the extension of our Caixa relationship to their bill pay locations has begun to ramp with sequential volume growth of over 20% in Q2. In addition, we went live with our pilot for our Pix platform to act as a payment service provider to over 30 merchants. This capability came through the acquisition of Sled in November of 2023 and will open up new growth opportunities from instant payment activity in Brazil. Overall, we continue to grow our instant payment transactions in Brazil and Argentina. In Brazil, we reached more than 400 million transactions in Q2, up 21% from Q1 levels, and we doubled our number of transactions in Argentina. In Asia Pacific, we went live with our pilot merchant acquiring services in New Zealand, a new market for Fiserv. We plan to target omnichannel merchants primarily in the hospitality and retail segments, as well as ecommerce-only merchants, aggregation partners and payfacs. Adjusted operating income in the merchant solutions segment increased 18% to $882 million in the quarter, with adjusted operating margin up 290 basis points to 36.6%. Year to date, adjusted operating income increased 23% to $1.7 billion with adjusted operating margin up 360 basis points to 35.4%. As noted last quarter, interest expense from anticipation revenue is recorded below the operating income line. If the interest costs from anticipation were included in operating income, merchant adjusted operating margins would have expanded 220 basis points for the quarter and 300 year to date. Turning to Slide 7 on the financial solutions segment, organic revenue grew 8% in the quarter and 6% year to date, in line with our full year outlook of 5% to 7%. Looking at the business lines, digital payments organic and adjusted revenue each grew by 8% in the quarter. Growth in Zelle transactions continued to be strong at 43%, and we signed one of our largest bank clients yet on Zelle, First Horizon Bank with $82 billion in assets, and the pipeline includes other large prospects. We continued to see strong demand from clients for FedNow and RTP integration. In Q2, we signed 32 FIs to FedNow, bringing our total signed to nearly 300. In issuing, organic and adjusted revenue grew 9% and 4% respectively in the quarter, driven by account growth internationally and new loan accounts in North America. Another growth vertical that we\u2019ve been highlighting is government, where we continue to win and convert large programs, including the California Employment Development Department, which has enrolled over 1 million of our money network prepaid cards, funding nearly $5 billion. In Q2, we won an electronic funds transfer mandate with a major U.S. agency which should help extend our double-digit growth in the federal market. We also won several state and local deals on the merchant side of the business, including Texas, Arizona, North Carolina, and the City of San Francisco. Meanwhile, we are continuing to make strides with prior large wins, implementing the first phase of a target program with output services, though we expect the vast majority of revenue will start in Q1 2025, when the Circle card accounts begin to go live. Issuing has a meaningful and growing presence outside the U.S., and we have been investing to roll out the next generation of First Vision, our international operating platform. In Q2, we won our first client on the new First Vision platform in Brazil. Banking organic and adjusted revenue grew 6% and 4% respectively in the quarter. Excluding periodic revenue, organic revenue grew 4% in the quarter. We had two Finxact wins this quarter, including Metropolitan Commercial Bank, a $7 billion bank and an existing Fiserv core client that has decided to build a migration path to Finxact. The pipeline remains robust, including embedded finance opportunities, and we completed the integration of Finxact with Commerce Hub. This allows our enterprise merchants to embed a robust suite of financial services for their customers across shopping and checkout experiences. Second quarter adjusted operating income for the financial solutions segment was up 6% to $1.1 billion, and adjusted operating margin was consistent with a very strong second quarter last year at 45.9%. Year to date, adjusted operating income for the segment was up 6% to $2.1 billion, with adjusted operating margin up 80 basis points to 45%. Now let me wrap up with some remaining details on the financials. The corporate adjusted operating loss was $134 million in the quarter and $282 million year to date, in line with our expectations. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.9% and 18.1% for the first half, and we continue to expect the full year rate to be approximately 20%. Total debt outstanding was $25.5 billion on June 30. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was steady at 2.8 times, within our target leverage range. During the quarter, we repurchased 10 million shares for $1.5 billion, bringing our total cash return to shareholders for the last 12 months to just over $5 billion, and nearly $15 billion since the 2015 merger. We had 32 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase at the end of the quarter. Turning to Slide 9, as Frank said earlier, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share outlook to a range of $8.65 to $8.80, up from $8.60 to $8.75, and an acceleration in forecasted adjusted EPS growth to 15% to 17%, from 14% to 16%. We are maintaining our 2024 organic revenue growth outlook of 15% to 17%, and raising our estimate for adjusted operating margin expansion to more than 135 basis points compared to at least 125 basis points. Previously, our organic growth guidance assumed seven points of contribution from excess inflation and interest in Argentina, but during Q2 we saw a faster than expected decline in both measures. This more rapid return to historic average is good news for our Argentine business and overall stability in the region; however, the extra revenue contribution will now be less this year. Based on the latest economist consensus, we now assume four points of benefit from excess inflation and interest this year, down from seven points. Nevertheless, we are reiterating our previous organic growth guidance for the year despite exogenous shifts affecting our business. This capability has become a hallmark of Fiserv today. It is a testament to the adaptability of our business model that comes from a broad product portfolio, diverse client base, resourceful management team, and global reach. This quarter, we offset the lower inflation and interest benefit in Argentina with additional anticipation revenue, another quarter of d\u00f3lar turista revenue, and other growth across the company. Our full year outlook of 15% to 17% total company organic growth less the four-point transitory benefit from inflation and interest in Argentina puts our normalized growth at 11% to 13% for 2024. This is in line with our medium term guidance of 9% to 12%, which assumes macro factors from Argentina continue to normalize. The forecasted impact from foreign currency exchange remains 8.5%, and we anticipate will continue to be a stronger though declining headwind to adjusted revenue growth relative to the tailwind from excess inflation and interest. Wrapping up with free cash flow, first I\u2019d like to note a change to our cash flow reporting. We moved the Clover Capital and LATAM anticipation activity to the investing section of the cash flow statement, beginning in the second quarter. We re-evaluated the presentation in our cash flow statement given a significant increase in the merchant cash advance activity. This change is consistent with how our peers account for these activities and the additional disclosure will provide greater transparency to our investors. This move affected our free cash flow since those amounts are no longer included in cash flows from operating activities, so we are adjusting our full year free cash flow outlook accordingly by increasing our guidance to $4.7 billion from $4.5 billion, since we expected $200 million of outflows for merchants\u2019 cash advances when we originally set our 2024 outlook. With that, let me turn the call back to Frank for some closing remarks.\nFrank Bisignano: Thanks Bob. There is another value creation opportunity within post-merger Fiserv, and that\u2019s data. The proposition for us in extracting intelligence from the massive amounts of data that we generate daily is significant and can be an important growth driver beyond the medium term. Three years ago, long before AI was the hot topic it is today, we assembled a team of internal and external experts in the fields of data science and AI. We gave them a mandate to harness all of the data naturally captured through Fiserv transactions and account processing activity to drive actionable intelligence for us, the marketplace, and our merchant and financial institution clients. There are three advantages that Fiserv has in its data. Ours is available in real time, it\u2019s granular to the transaction level, and it\u2019s multi-faceted in that it spans merchant, issuing and banking activity. This makes our data quite powerful to apply in anti-fraud solutions which we are doing internally, with plans for a client-facing solution this fall. Our first great application to the market is the Fiserv Small Business Index, a real time assessment of consumer spending at millions of small businesses published monthly. It maximizes the features of Fiserv data with its timely release two days after month end, a detailed look at trends by industry and geography, and the inclusion of non-card spending data such as cash and checks. We\u2019re also working to support clients in their AI journeys as they invest to process and understand their own data. Clients are recognizing that we can efficiently add Fiserv data and intelligence to help take decision making to the next level. It\u2019s a major value-added solution that we\u2019re already testing with several of our largest clients and on the Clover platform. We are still in the early stages of delivering our data and intelligence solutions, but the opportunity is significant given the power of our integrated platforms and our unmatched scale, breadth and investment. Finally, I\u2019d like to thank our more than 40,000 employees for their steadfast commitment to our vision and hard work on the day to day execution. It\u2019s clearly led to our leadership in product and innovation and the strong results you\u2019re seeing us report today. Together, we strive to achieve excellence every day on behalf of our clients, partners and shareholders. Thank you for your time today, and now Operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We would now like to open the phone lines for questions. [Operator instructions] For our first question, we\u2019ll go to the line of David Togut from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDavid Togut: Thank you, good morning Frank and Bob. Appreciate the update on new product launches for Clover, and also the vertical market expansion into services and retail. Could you update us on the international expansion in Brazil and Mexico? Frank, you called out some initiatives in Brazil, but in terms of the broader new market launch post friends and family, what are your expectations for the back half of this year and into 2025?\nFrank Bisignano: Yes, I think first of all, when you look at what we\u2019re doing on global penetration, we have--you know we talked about Mexico, Australia and Brazil. You should expect Brazil and Mexico in August as a pilot. I would see it as a full ramp in 2025, I\u2019d treat August like a friends and family. But remember, our business in Brazil, the things we\u2019ve done with Caixa, the things we\u2019ve done growing the business, you know, probably eight, nine years ago from a start-up into a tremendous competitor, so we have growth projections for that market that we would expect it to perform as our business has in Brazil. Mexico - you know, we\u2019ve built a business there, we continue to grow that business. We feel our Mexico and Brazil build is very similar, that\u2019s why you see them coming out together. Once again, a friends and family in August [indiscernible], and obviously we\u2019ll watch that build through the fourth quarter and then full effect in \u201925. We feel really great about our position on Australia and what we\u2019re going to do in Australia. You\u2019ll see us in September, and that as a friends and family. We have expectations of larger partner wins there also that are very, very highly motivated to have Clover in market in \u201925, so. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll get a ton of growth out of it this year. We\u2019ll update you later in the year on our expectations in \u201925, but those builds are in full force. We have partners who want it bad, and we see the market demand for all that. Thanks for that question. You know, David, we got on the call and talked about a celebration that we\u2019re really having right now, which is the 40th anniversary of Fiserv and the fifth anniversary of the merger. But I think what I realized when I got up this morning is we\u2019re actually celebrating your retirement from Evercore, and if my information\u2019s right, because you know we love to count everything here, you\u2019ve covered Fiserv for 29 years and that\u2019s spanned four CEOs, and I\u2019m fortunate to stand on the shoulders of those who became before me, so I cherish our time together. Then I think I\u2019m right in 32 years on First Data - I can\u2019t really account for all the CEOs that came before me specifically post KKR, but thank you for everything you\u2019ve done for the industry. Thank you for the work, and I think it\u2019s a celebration of your career and your retirement from Evercore. Thanks for being here with us today.\nDavid Togut: Thank you so much, Frank. That really means a lot to me. I really enjoyed working with you, Bob and Julie, and in the tradition of your predecessors, you continue to create tremendous shareholder value, so I\u2019ll continue to watch your progress with great interest.\nBob Hau: Congratulations, David.\nDavid Togut: Thank you Bob.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nTien-Tsin Huang: I was going to say, I can\u2019t remember any First Data or Fiserv call without David Togut on it, so I echo that. My question for you guys, just on the margin outlook that was raised, can you give us a little bit more specifics on the sources of the upside there? Then just a clarification on the merchant processing side, was that related to some bank losses? I heard a comment that there were some declines on the bank side, so I wanted to clarify if that was line specific or due to attrition. Thank you.\nBob Hau: Yes, thanks Tien-Tsin, good morning. First on the margin outlook, as you heard in our prepared remarks, we raised our margin outlook actually for the second quarter in a row, and now greater than 135 basis points. The original guide back in February was greater than 100 basis points. That\u2019s really driven by two factors. One is just the scale and volume of the company - as we add more revenue, it drops through to the company average--excuse me, better than company average rates, and continue to see good growth. The second one, of course, is ongoing productivity - we continue on an ongoing basis, as Frank said earlier, measure everything, and we continue to see progress towards achieving increased productivity across the organization, and so the combination of very strong organic growth, 15% to 17% this year plus productivity allows us to continue to expand margin on a multiple year basis. Then in the merchant processing side, as you know, the processing business line for us is where our clients own the merchant contracts, and so we are providing the back end processing for those clients. In many cases, it\u2019s banks, could be wholesale ISOs, and what we saw is some volume decline out of those processing contracts in the second quarter. Of course, on a year-to-date basis, we are plus-1% for the first half of the year, and that\u2019s in line with our ongoing expectation that it\u2019s roughly flat in this business line going forward.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nJason Kupferberg: Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. Great to see the ongoing revenue performance here. I was curious just to ask about some of the underlying metrics - small business volume growth, enterprise transaction growth. We did some slowdown there in Q2, probably more than can likely be explained just by leap year, so was hoping you could unpack those a little bit in terms of where you saw some of the softness. Was it certain verticals or higher income versus lower income consumers, and then just anything you can give us on what you\u2019ve seen in July so far? We heard from Visa last night about a little bit of softness related to hurricane and CrowdStrike. Thank you.\nBob Hau: Yes Jason, good morning. There\u2019s obviously lots of variables in both of those, both for small business and the enterprise business lines. Generally, we saw a bit of a slowing, and in fact through the second quarter, April and May were in line with our expectations, July came in a little bit slower. But I would emphasize that that was in line with our expectations, so it\u2019s partly why we\u2019re maintaining our full year organic growth rate at 15% to 17%, and in fact for the merchant segment holding at the 25% to 28% despite acceleration in easing of that transitory benefit down in Argentina. Generally, the business is performing at or better than we had previously expected outside of that slowing in the transitory benefit, which by the way, we think is a good thing for the Argentine economy. A more normalized growth rate in inflation and interest is good long term, and so we\u2019re encouraged by how that\u2019s going and how the overall business is responding.\nFrank Bisignano: Yes, maybe I\u2019d make a couple other general macro comments. One, when you looked at--you know, we\u2019re very, very proud of what we believe we\u2019ve created with the FSBI and our ability to track it. Obviously we talked about how our numbers don\u2019t exactly mirror the FSBI because of our international presence and the fact that we have verticals that we think outperform. We see a slowness in July, but we see growth in July as we look at it right now. It\u2019s in line with really Q2 if you look at it, and slightly ahead of June. I think also as you look across our book and our total portfolio, you\u2019ll also see the slowing in credit originations across our book which covers retail private label and general purpose, but all of this within our expectation range. I\u2019d also make a secondary point around volume and revenue. We are no longer a volume-only shop. We have lots of VAS, both at the enterprise level and at the SMB level, and it really was the design of how to proceed. We have great feeling about our ability to grow merchants globally, and that\u2019s inclusive of the U.S., so that all falls into our expectation set and I think in total when you look at the business performance and the portfolio size and scope, our hedge is very, very strong.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Timothy Chiodo from UBS. Please go ahead.\nTimothy Chiodo: Great, thank you for taking the question. I wanted to hit up on CashFlow Central, just given it\u2019s about to go live here. It\u2019s six large clients you mentioned. In terms of the monetization, I believe it\u2019s a combination of subscription fees and then also transaction fees, including some interchange revenue potentially. I was hoping you could break that down a little bit more, and then also talk a little bit about how the revenue will be recognized across the two segments. Thanks a lot.\nFrank Bisignano: Yes, maybe I\u2019ll elevate it a hair, just so we have pure clarity on our SMB strategy here, both with FIs and on our other direct channels. We referred to it in our prior comments, but I want to be very, very clear - first of all, those wins are large institutional wins before the product\u2019s in the market in that fashion, and our pipeline is tremendously strong. Remember, we\u2019re also going to bring this product to Clover, and we\u2019re bringing the product to our ISV channels also. Then what we talk about is, as I like to call it, an SMB bundle. That SMB bundle will include Clover, CashFlow Central, the ability to integrate that information, bring it to Active D, which is also winning heavily in the market right now as our new digital banking platform, and Spendlabs. So I think what you\u2019re going to find--and banks, FIs love the bundle, right? Yes, they\u2019re buying CashFlow Central, but this will be a long-term growth engine, and you also heard us talk about our ability to go yes, we have 900 financial institutions, we plan on continuing to grow that number. CashFlow Central by itself is a standout product, which Bob will walk you through the economics, but I want you to focus on the SMB strategy that is an integrated strategy. I think we\u2019re one of a kind in the ability to deliver digital banking, deliver card spend, deliver Clover, and deliver something like CashFlow Central AR/AP to this SMB set. Our banks are loving it. We\u2019ve got two shots at helping our banks generate revenue through it. I didn\u2019t want to minimize the question without articulating the strategy, which is a long term growth strategy for our total portfolio.\nBob Hau: And Tim, I\u2019d say we feel very good about signing up six large banks before we\u2019ve gone live. We\u2019re quite encouraged on the demand from those financial institutions and the excitement they have. As Frank points out, it\u2019s a revenue generator with them, it allows them to bring themselves closer to their small business client, which is an important client base for them, and for us, the opposite of our consumer bill pay solution which is a fee that the banks pay us but typically do not charge consumers, and so it\u2019s an expense item. For CashFlow Central, it\u2019s actually a revenue generator - they\u2019ll likely charge their small business clients a subscription, again generate revenue for themselves and obviously for us as transactions flow, so feel very good about the opportunity and very encouraged on the very, very early read.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go the line of Dave Koning from Baird. Please go ahead.\nDave Koning: Yes, hey guys. Thanks, and nice job. I guess my question, in the banking sub-unit, you grew 4% ex periodic revenue. That\u2019s the best we can see in the six quarters or so since you\u2019ve given the new segment data. Is there something about the market that\u2019s getting better or something that you\u2019re doing more specifically, and is this higher level sustainable?\nFrank Bisignano: Yes, maybe I\u2019d cover that. I realize in my comments about business generation and demand, I didn\u2019t include that we see large demand for our services out of the financial institutions, and that\u2019s beyond this merchant and CFC capability, which both have tremendous demand. It goes to [indiscernible], which is winning the marketplace. You heard us talk about our Finxact wins. Our clients are growing, and you can look at things that we\u2019ve done on Finxact with one, which has been a tremendous opportunity. I do think, you know, and you could point to recent surveys published that we\u2019ve differentiated ourselves in the service area from where we might have been a couple years ago with the delivery of a commitment tracker, which allows us and our clients to have 100% synchronization on our commitments and our delivery rate. I think those have really, really distinguished ourselves. Our relationship management model is making a difference and will continue. Demand is strong, so I think it\u2019s all those variables that gives us confidence about our ability to be the grower that we talked about to you back on i-day.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go the line of Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nDarrin Peller: Hey, thanks guys. If we could just hone in and just give a little bit more of a broad update on the financial solutions segment, just given the strength we\u2019re seeing, obviously CashFlow Central is strong and then you have Zelle and some other implementations. But help us understand the driving forces of that growth going from where it is today, and then I know you\u2019ve talked about it accelerating again into--like, through \u201925 and into \u201926 at your investor day. Is that still what you see happening, and what are the major drivers affecting that?\nBob Hau: Yes Darrin, so our expectation, our outlook for this year for the financial solutions segment is 4% to 6%--excuse me, 5% to 7%. Year to date, we\u2019re at 6%, so we\u2019re right at the midpoint of that full year outlook. We anticipate as we go into \u201925 and \u201926, our medium term outlook for the financial solutions segment increases a point to 6% to 8%, so 5% to 7% this year, we\u2019re right at midpoint halfway through the year, and we expect that to accelerate into \u201925 and 2026. That\u2019s really driven by the benefits of exactly what you called out - CashFlow Central coming online, growth in XD, our digital banking solution, Finxact, and a broad suite of capabilities that we have continuing to take hold and meet the demands of our financial solutions client base. We also have on the issuing side, as you heard us talk about back in November at the investor day, several large client wins that will go live in 2025 and beyond, things like Verizon and Target and Desjardins all giving us a lift, so we feel quite good about where we are first half of the year and what we see going into \u201925 and \u201926.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Dan Dolev from Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.\nDan Dolev: Hey Frank and Bob. Really nice results. I just wanted to go back to the more sort of guidance in merchant and macro - I mean, pretty impressive results despite, I\u2019d say, the more muted tone at Visa yesterday. Can you maybe provide just a little bridge in terms of what needs to happen for the guide, or the fact that you maintained the guide for the year? Is there anything--is it all idiosyncratic wins, etc., which is what we suspect, or is there anything else in there? And again, congrats.\nBob Hau: Yes, thanks Dan. Overall, maintaining our total company organic growth at 15% to 17%, in order to do that, we expect the merchant segment to grow 25% to 28% organically first half of the year. We\u2019re ahead of that slightly at the top end, good growth overall. We talked a little bit in our prepared remarks about the easing of the transitory benefit of inflation and interest. You\u2019ve seen in our slides that that number has come down. Our previous expectation for the full year was that that would provide a 14-point benefit to merchant solutions, now a 9-point benefit, yet we\u2019re maintaining our full year outlook, and that\u2019s the strength of things like Clover selling very well, value-added solutions both in our small business and in our enterprise business. CommerceHub continues to see good uptake from our large enterprise clients. We definitely saw an increase in anticipation activity down in Latin America we talked about in our prepared remarks, as well as an additional quarter benefit of D\u00f3lar turista, so maybe a little bit of that idiosyncratic view from your point on the D\u00f3lar turista, expect that to go away at the tail end of this quarter, third quarter, but generally, growth across the business. I think this is one of the hallmarks of Fiserv over the 40 years that we\u2019ve been in business, anticipating that 2024 will be our 39th consecutive year of double-digit EPS growth. We are incredibly resilient and we respond to changes in the marketplace. We respond to changes in the macroeconomic environment and it\u2019s the breadth and depth of our capability, of our product set, of our client base and our distribution channels.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJames Faucette: Great, thank you very much, and thanks for all of the color and detail here. I want to go back to Clover and Clover growth. One of the questions we get a lot is you talked at your analyst meeting back in November about using Clover and how the back book could contribute a little bit more going forward to that growth. But I\u2019m wondering if you can talk to a little bit the sale cycle there and where your existing customer is seeing value on Clover, and how you\u2019re feeling about that and maintaining those customers from a competitive standpoint, if they are re-evaluating solutions, etc. Thanks a lot.\nFrank Bisignano: Thanks Jim, good to hear from you. You know, we\u2019ve been really, really feeling good about the Clover strategy and continuing to refine it. Obviously we know there will be a day where we\u2019re going to come back to you and say, we hit it directly into the back book, but we see so much front book activity opportunity between our international, between our ISV, between how we\u2019re thinking about the verticals like services, like restaurants, that we\u2019re continuing to build that product set, that VAS. Obviously it\u2019s an outperformer in attrition across the total book, and we have the benefit of looking at attrition rates from everything. We look at them from what our ISO portfolios are attriting versus our ISV portfolios attriting, versus our agent versus our direct book, and we feel really, really good about how it\u2019s performed. We\u2019re continuing to ramp up our investment in value-added services and vertical expertise there. We\u2019ve made a set of commitments - you know, 3.5 and then 4.5 and pen rates, and you know, we think about the merchant business being $10 billion, then $12 billion, and all of those feels really, really tight and on track. Obviously--you know, I always have to say we started Clover with seven engineers and three [indiscernible], and now we\u2019ve got a global franchise, so it\u2019s straight in our sites. Obviously we have lots of other great things in our portfolio, but it also is a key to why we have 900 financial institutions, and I would expect over a period of time on this journey that if you ask me, we haven\u2019t ever made a commitment or guided to any financial institution, but you should expect us to continue to grow that at a double-digit number every year. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s helpful, Jim?\nOperator: For our final question, we\u2019ll go to the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi, thanks for squeezing me in here. I wanted to ask about M&A, and I guess specifically given the valuation, multiples on the public company side seem to be much lower than on the private side. Does that tilt the opportunity set for you guys more towards acquiring public peers? Would you have an appetite to move in that direction, Frank?\nFrank Bisignano: Well, I don\u2019t--you know, it\u2019s not like I think about public-private. I think about--first of all, we have a tried and true capital deployment philosophy, which I think we\u2019ve been performing well at. I frequently say, gee, I wish we had acquired more, and I frequently--and I always say, but there\u2019s nothing that traded that I wish we had acquired, so I think it\u2019s about value, it\u2019s about long term value creation. Remember, we have the best distribution with our financial institutions, our ISVs. Our ability now to take financial products and bring them to our merchants - you know, we didn\u2019t really talk about embedded finance at all today, but that is still an engine that\u2019s moving for us. It\u2019s where is value creation, how do we bring it to our clients and our shareholders, and I\u2019m really not thinking public versus private as much as being involved in looking at everything humanly possible. That would be--I think that\u2019s kind of where we are.\nFrank Bisignano: I\u2019d like to thank everybody for their attention today. Obviously we\u2019ve got a great IR team, so reach out to them with any further questions. Have a great day, and I look forward to talking to you in the future.\nOperator: Thank you all for participating in the Fiserv second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. That concludes today\u2019s conference. Please disconnect at this time and have a great rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Frank Bisignano",
            "content": "Thank you Julie, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss second quarter results that bring us closer to another year of double-digit organic revenue and adjusted earnings per share growth. Fiserv delivered strong results across our businesses with second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $2.13, up 18% driven by continued healthy revenue growth and further operating margin expansion. Adjusted revenue growth was 7% and adjusted operating margin rose 160 basis points to 38.4%. Organic revenue growth was 18%. We can point to many highlights in our business during the quarter, including Clover revenue of 28%, accelerated organic revenue growth in financial solutions to 8%, multiple wins with marquee clients including Verizon and Apple, plus new clients in important verticals such as petro, gaming, government and healthcare. Our free cash flow was $1 billion in the quarter and $4 billion over the last 12 months, and we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders via share repurchases. This month, we are celebrating the 40th anniversary of Fiserv, along with the fifth anniversary of the merger between Fiserv and First Data. Our vision back in 2019 was that if we brought together scaled platforms supporting a full breadth of solutions, merchant acquiring, debit and credit issuer services, digital payments of all kinds and core bank account systems modernized with cloud technologies, then clients would find value in the combination and the integration and Fiserv would become a partner of choice with unparalleled global reach. Today, we can see that's exactly what has happened. As we realized revenue and cost synergies over this time, we increased our investment in technology innovation. Our purpose has been to deliver solutions to clients of all kinds, established and new, large and small, local and global, spanning all verticals. With the proper amount of disrupting ourselves then and now, Fiserv is better able to run, optimize and grow our business, and now we find ourselves at this moment, singular in our ability to deliver a breadth of leading products across a diverse base of clients and demonstrating accelerated growth for the past three years. After five years of innovation, in some ways what's old is new again. Let me share three examples of how our clients are engaging in some of our traditional businesses as new ways to add and retain their own customers. First in merchant acquiring, banks are adding this service as a way to grow with small and medium sized business customers and choosing Fiserv for its leading solutions, including Clover. We already have nearly 900 financial institutions who offer merchant processing services to their small business clients, and thousands more who can still benefit from doing so. As an example, in Q2 we signed a merchant agreement with Connecticut Online Computer Center, known as COCC, which is a client-owned provider of banking technology. The 150 community banks and credit unions on the COCC platform now have access to our acquiring services in support of their own hundreds of thousands of merchants. Second in digital payments, CashFlow Central takes the best of consumer bill pay and turns it from a cost center within banks to a revenue generator that appeals to small business with bill payment and presentment capability. In the second quarter, we signed two more CashFlow Central deals with multi-billion dollar banks for a total of six in the few months since we introduced this solution. CashFlow Central will go live this quarter and the pipeline remains full. We are finding that as they go down this path, financial institutions are revitalizing the consumer bill pay offerings as well, answering the competition from the direct biller model. First Citizens, a top 20 U.S. bank with more than $200 billion in assets was one such consumer bill pay win in Q2. As a reminder, Fiserv is the largest provider of bank consumer bill pay services with over 20 million users on our check-free platform. Both merchant acquiring solutions and CashFlow Central are compelling because they provide revenue generating opportunities for our financial institution clients. They also demonstrate a distinct value proposition for small businesses which includes other products across our issuing and banking businesses. Next, we are integrating these solutions with Experience Digital, or XD, our new online and mobile banking solution; and third, traditional enterprise merchants are turning to software that surround their payments functionality to enhance revenue and improve data integration. As we've seen from small businesses, the large and midmarket merchants who have been migrating to our omnichannel platform are increasingly integrating our value-added solutions. These include SnapPay, our ERP-integrated B2B bill presentment platform; gift solutions, where we support multiple leading retail and QSR enterprise clients; and data analytics, which I'll discuss a bit later. We continue to invest in new solutions such as our new dedicated platform for paybacks, which is gaining momentum. In the second quarter, for instance, we were selected by Cantaloupe, a major provider of unattended payment devices such as vending machines, for our Exchange payback platform, and we continue to integrate solutions across our two segments. One example is our new partnership with Apple that will enable new Apple Pay functionality with two of our next-generation solutions. One is pay with points, where the loyalty points residing on the card accounts of our issuer clients can be redeemed for a transaction in the Apple Pay wallet at checkout, serving as currency. We are a natural partner given the breadth of our card accounts on file and our technical capability to maintain account point balances, convert and accept those points as payments, and then reconcile the balances. A second solution is installment loans on credit cards. This is a new feature that presents the consumer with the choice to pay for a purchase in a set of installments when using Apple Pay at checkout. This is differentiating in that consumers have only been provided with the option to pay for a purchase in installments after making a purchase on a credit card. With Apple, we will move this installment loan feature into the checkout flow, giving the consumer choice at the point of purchase. Having this functionality at the point of sale from a digital wallet can drive greater card conversion, card usage, and spending power. It also enables our issuing partners to more directly compete with Buy Now, Pay Later using their existing credit card products. Fiserv is unique in its reach across all parties involved here: the consumer, the digital wallet provider, the issuer and the merchant, so we see multiple opportunities ahead as we enable this network effect to be a win-win across the ecosystem. Let's turn to our outlook for the business. Based on strong performance in the quarter and conviction in our unique opportunity set, we are raising our adjusted earnings per share outlook to $8.65 to $8.80, an increase of $0.05 across the range. Our revenue outlook is unchanged at 15% to 17% organic growth. This performance for 2024 would represent the 39th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Turning to our segment highlights, in merchant solutions starting with small business, we posted 4% volume growth, slightly ahead of the sales volume growth for the Fiserv Small Business Index, which rose 3.2% in Q2 as the pace of growth slowed from April to June. There are multiple reasons why our growth can differ from this U.S.-only index, including our global presence and different weightings across verticals. For Clover, we have a very active second half of the year for new product rollouts. We plan to launch additional restaurant software features that target our sweet spot in casual dining to enhance table management, kitchen operations, inventory and cost management. In the fourth quarter, we'll be rolling out new software offerings in our two other target verticals, services and retail. We are very pleased with initial sales of our restaurant order kiosks and now we look forward to two new hardware opportunities. First is the Clover Compact, which we rolled out this month, giving us a broader market opportunity with smaller merchants, and next an important solution for our restaurant clients, order and pay at the table via a new handheld Clover Flex Pocket, coming in August. We are on pace with our international expansion. Pilots are set to go live in Brazil and Mexico in August, and then in September in Australia ahead of the 2025 launch. In the enterprise merchant business, a key driver is the ongoing adoption of Commerce Hub, the orchestration layer that allows for easy integration with our growing portfolio of value-added solutions. We now have 230 clients live on Commerce Hub and signed several more in Q2, including two large petro retailers to extend our leading position in this vertical. Our financial solutions segment posted strong organic revenue growth at 8% in the quarter, above the high end of our 2024 guidance range. We delivered faster organic growth in our banking business while our core banking and credit union clients continued to drive strong growth in our digital payments business. We are adding new clients as well. In the second quarter, we had another example of winning the core account processing business in an M&A transaction. In this latest case, Sunflower Bank chose Fiserv after announcing their intent to acquire HomeStreet Bank to create a $17 billion bank by assets in January. In issuing, we manage the credit and loan accounts for some of the world's leading issuers and provide technology to issuers and lenders in healthcare, government and education. In June, we were very pleased to have won a strategic outsourcing agreement with Verizon to support their device financing activity and manage device payment agreements on Fiserv's Optis platform. Verizon chose Fiserv for the flexibility, optionality and resiliency of our platform on the foundation of a trusted longstanding relationship that spans multiple solutions. This is another example of extending our issuer and loan processing capability into adjacent verticals. In fact, we won another point of sale financing deal with an industrial equipment manufacturer to offer short term loans through its dealer network across the globe using our First Vision platform. With that, I'll turn it over to Bob to discuss more on outperformance and financials. Thanks Bob. There is another value creation opportunity within post-merger Fiserv, and that's data. The proposition for us in extracting intelligence from the massive amounts of data that we generate daily is significant and can be an important growth driver beyond the medium term. Three years ago, long before AI was the hot topic it is today, we assembled a team of internal and external experts in the fields of data science and AI. We gave them a mandate to harness all of the data naturally captured through Fiserv transactions and account processing activity to drive actionable intelligence for us, the marketplace, and our merchant and financial institution clients. There are three advantages that Fiserv has in its data. Ours is available in real time, it's granular to the transaction level, and it's multi-faceted in that it spans merchant, issuing and banking activity. This makes our data quite powerful to apply in anti-fraud solutions which we are doing internally, with plans for a client-facing solution this fall. Our first great application to the market is the Fiserv Small Business Index, a real time assessment of consumer spending at millions of small businesses published monthly. It maximizes the features of Fiserv data with its timely release two days after month end, a detailed look at trends by industry and geography, and the inclusion of non-card spending data such as cash and checks. We're also working to support clients in their AI journeys as they invest to process and understand their own data. Clients are recognizing that we can efficiently add Fiserv data and intelligence to help take decision making to the next level. It's a major value-added solution that we're already testing with several of our largest clients and on the Clover platform. We are still in the early stages of delivering our data and intelligence solutions, but the opportunity is significant given the power of our integrated platforms and our unmatched scale, breadth and investment. Finally, I'd like to thank our more than 40,000 employees for their steadfast commitment to our vision and hard work on the day to day execution. It's clearly led to our leadership in product and innovation and the strong results you're seeing us report today. Together, we strive to achieve excellence every day on behalf of our clients, partners and shareholders. Thank you for your time today, and now Operator, please open the line for questions. Yes, I think first of all, when you look at what we're doing on global penetration, we have--you know we talked about Mexico, Australia and Brazil. You should expect Brazil and Mexico in August as a pilot. I would see it as a full ramp in 2025, I'd treat August like a friends and family. But remember, our business in Brazil, the things we've done with Caixa, the things we've done growing the business, you know, probably eight, nine years ago from a start-up into a tremendous competitor, so we have growth projections for that market that we would expect it to perform as our business has in Brazil. Mexico - you know, we've built a business there, we continue to grow that business. We feel our Mexico and Brazil build is very similar, that's why you see them coming out together. Once again, a friends and family in August [indiscernible], and obviously we'll watch that build through the fourth quarter and then full effect in '25. We feel really great about our position on Australia and what we're going to do in Australia. You'll see us in September, and that as a friends and family. We have expectations of larger partner wins there also that are very, very highly motivated to have Clover in market in '25, so. I don't think you'll get a ton of growth out of it this year. We'll update you later in the year on our expectations in '25, but those builds are in full force. We have partners who want it bad, and we see the market demand for all that. Thanks for that question. You know, David, we got on the call and talked about a celebration that we're really having right now, which is the 40th anniversary of Fiserv and the fifth anniversary of the merger. But I think what I realized when I got up this morning is we're actually celebrating your retirement from Evercore, and if my information's right, because you know we love to count everything here, you've covered Fiserv for 29 years and that's spanned four CEOs, and I'm fortunate to stand on the shoulders of those who became before me, so I cherish our time together. Then I think I'm right in 32 years on First Data - I can't really account for all the CEOs that came before me specifically post KKR, but thank you for everything you've done for the industry. Thank you for the work, and I think it's a celebration of your career and your retirement from Evercore. Thanks for being here with us today. Yes, maybe I'd make a couple other general macro comments. One, when you looked at--you know, we're very, very proud of what we believe we've created with the FSBI and our ability to track it. Obviously we talked about how our numbers don't exactly mirror the FSBI because of our international presence and the fact that we have verticals that we think outperform. We see a slowness in July, but we see growth in July as we look at it right now. It's in line with really Q2 if you look at it, and slightly ahead of June. I think also as you look across our book and our total portfolio, you'll also see the slowing in credit originations across our book which covers retail private label and general purpose, but all of this within our expectation range. I'd also make a secondary point around volume and revenue. We are no longer a volume-only shop. We have lots of VAS, both at the enterprise level and at the SMB level, and it really was the design of how to proceed. We have great feeling about our ability to grow merchants globally, and that's inclusive of the U.S., so that all falls into our expectation set and I think in total when you look at the business performance and the portfolio size and scope, our hedge is very, very strong. Yes, maybe I'll elevate it a hair, just so we have pure clarity on our SMB strategy here, both with FIs and on our other direct channels. We referred to it in our prior comments, but I want to be very, very clear - first of all, those wins are large institutional wins before the product's in the market in that fashion, and our pipeline is tremendously strong. Remember, we're also going to bring this product to Clover, and we're bringing the product to our ISV channels also. Then what we talk about is, as I like to call it, an SMB bundle. That SMB bundle will include Clover, CashFlow Central, the ability to integrate that information, bring it to Active D, which is also winning heavily in the market right now as our new digital banking platform, and Spendlabs. So I think what you're going to find--and banks, FIs love the bundle, right? Yes, they're buying CashFlow Central, but this will be a long-term growth engine, and you also heard us talk about our ability to go yes, we have 900 financial institutions, we plan on continuing to grow that number. CashFlow Central by itself is a standout product, which Bob will walk you through the economics, but I want you to focus on the SMB strategy that is an integrated strategy. I think we're one of a kind in the ability to deliver digital banking, deliver card spend, deliver Clover, and deliver something like CashFlow Central AR/AP to this SMB set. Our banks are loving it. We've got two shots at helping our banks generate revenue through it. I didn't want to minimize the question without articulating the strategy, which is a long term growth strategy for our total portfolio. Yes, maybe I'd cover that. I realize in my comments about business generation and demand, I didn't include that we see large demand for our services out of the financial institutions, and that's beyond this merchant and CFC capability, which both have tremendous demand. It goes to [indiscernible], which is winning the marketplace. You heard us talk about our Finxact wins. Our clients are growing, and you can look at things that we've done on Finxact with one, which has been a tremendous opportunity. I do think, you know, and you could point to recent surveys published that we've differentiated ourselves in the service area from where we might have been a couple years ago with the delivery of a commitment tracker, which allows us and our clients to have 100% synchronization on our commitments and our delivery rate. I think those have really, really distinguished ourselves. Our relationship management model is making a difference and will continue. Demand is strong, so I think it's all those variables that gives us confidence about our ability to be the grower that we talked about to you back on i-day. Thanks Jim, good to hear from you. You know, we've been really, really feeling good about the Clover strategy and continuing to refine it. Obviously we know there will be a day where we're going to come back to you and say, we hit it directly into the back book, but we see so much front book activity opportunity between our international, between our ISV, between how we're thinking about the verticals like services, like restaurants, that we're continuing to build that product set, that VAS. Obviously it's an outperformer in attrition across the total book, and we have the benefit of looking at attrition rates from everything. We look at them from what our ISO portfolios are attriting versus our ISV portfolios attriting, versus our agent versus our direct book, and we feel really, really good about how it's performed. We're continuing to ramp up our investment in value-added services and vertical expertise there. We've made a set of commitments - you know, 3.5 and then 4.5 and pen rates, and you know, we think about the merchant business being $10 billion, then $12 billion, and all of those feels really, really tight and on track. Obviously--you know, I always have to say we started Clover with seven engineers and three [indiscernible], and now we've got a global franchise, so it's straight in our sites. Obviously we have lots of other great things in our portfolio, but it also is a key to why we have 900 financial institutions, and I would expect over a period of time on this journey that if you ask me, we haven't ever made a commitment or guided to any financial institution, but you should expect us to continue to grow that at a double-digit number every year. I don't know if that's helpful, Jim? Well, I don't--you know, it's not like I think about public-private. I think about--first of all, we have a tried and true capital deployment philosophy, which I think we've been performing well at. I frequently say, gee, I wish we had acquired more, and I frequently--and I always say, but there's nothing that traded that I wish we had acquired, so I think it's about value, it's about long term value creation. Remember, we have the best distribution with our financial institutions, our ISVs. Our ability now to take financial products and bring them to our merchants - you know, we didn't really talk about embedded finance at all today, but that is still an engine that's moving for us. It's where is value creation, how do we bring it to our clients and our shareholders, and I'm really not thinking public versus private as much as being involved in looking at everything humanly possible. That would be--I think that's kind of where we are. I'd like to thank everybody for their attention today. Obviously we've got a great IR team, so reach out to them with any further questions. Have a great day, and I look forward to talking to you in the future."

            "name": "Bob Hau",
            "content": "Thank you Frank, and good morning everyone. If you're following along on our slides, I'll cover additional detail on total company and segment performance, starting with our financial metrics and trends on Slide 4. Our performance in the second quarter showcased our ability to sustain strong revenue growth and margin expansion. Second quarter total company adjusted revenue grew 7% to $4.8 billion, and adjusted operating income grew 12% to $1.8 billion, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 38.4%, an increase of 160 basis points versus the prior year. For the first half of the year, adjusted revenue grew 7% to $9.3 billion, and adjusted operating income grew 13% to $3.5 billion, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 37.2%, an increase of 180 basis points versus the prior year. Organic revenue grew 18% in the quarter with strength in both segments. The transitory contribution from Argentina was five points to our total organic growth in the quarter, down from seven points in Q1. In the first six months of the year, organic revenue grew 19%. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share was $2.13 compared to $1.81 in the prior year, up 18% and above previous full year guidance of 4% to 16%. Year to date, our adjusted earnings per share increased 18% to $4 compare to $3.38 in the prior year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1 billion and $1.5 billion for the first half of the year. We expect free cash flow to be much higher in the second half of this year due to the timing of cash flows for the green tax credit program. Turning to performance by segment, starting on Slide 5, organic revenue growth in the merchant solutions segment was 28% in the quarter and 32% year to date. For the quarter, this includes a 10-point benefit from above average interest and inflation in Argentina. Without this transitory benefit, organic growth would have been 18%. On Slide 6, we've again included a summary of the impact of excess Argentine inflation and interest on total Fiserv and merchant segment revenue, along with the offsetting headwind from currency devaluation which impacts adjusted revenue. Adjusted revenue growth for merchant solutions was 9% in the quarter and 11% year to date. The quarterly results include a 19 percentage point currency headwind largely from the Argentine peso after a sharp devaluation in late December last year. Similar to Q1, the currency headwind to adjusted revenue growth was much higher than the inflation and interest tailwind in Q2. Moving to the business lines, small business organic and adjusted revenue growth in the quarter was 35% and 13% respectively. Clover revenue grew 28% in the second quarter on an annualized payment volume growth of 17%. The spread between revenue and volume growth continues to reflect a higher penetration of value-added solutions, continued channel mix shift, and value-based pricing. VAS penetration stayed constant sequentially at 20% in Q2, an improvement from prior years where we typically see a seasonal decline from Q1 to Q2. VAS penetration was driven by growth in Clover Capital and the Clover SaaS package and should expand with several new offerings coming in the second half. Overall, we remain on pace to meet our 2026 targets. Enterprise organic and adjusted revenue growth in the quarter was 27% and 9% respectively, driven by transactions growth of 8% and higher VAS penetration. As with small business, organic growth at enterprise includes some transitory benefit from excess inflation and interest in Argentina. We're pleased with the pace of client uptake and growth in Commerce Hub. Daily transactions in Commerce Hub are up 3.5 times from Q1 levels and clients are increasingly connecting to enhanced solutions. Three of the most popular are pay by bank, which allows consumers to pay via ACH payment from their bank account at the point of sale; online EVT, which lets merchants grow by offering payment via government benefit programs; and digital payouts, which merchants increasingly use to pay employees and vendors. Finally, processing organic and adjusted revenue in the quarter declined by 7% and 8% respectively. This business represents the bank end processing we do for our partners, where they own the merchant relationship. A few large processing clients experienced declines in their volumes and revenue in Q2. Year to date, processing organic and adjusted revenue are both up 1%, similar to our guidance for flat adjusted revenue over the medium term. Turning to some merchant highlights outside the U.S., first in EMEA, the general tone of business is improving as inflation is easing and consumer confidence begins to rise across the region. We had a good quarter for new wins and renewals with follow-on business, and we are finding that our professional services capability in the region is a competitive differentiator that reinforces our right to win. We expanded our strategic partnership with BNP Paribas, one of the leading banks in Europe, allowing it to extend its current merchant acquiring footprint into Germany. Also in Germany, H&M Group, the second-largest clothing retailer in the world, selected us as their strategic partner for point of sale, building on our existing relationship in Mexico and highlighting the value we bring to multi-national retail clients. We are also working with Lloyd's Banking Group, one of the leading banks in the U.K. and a key partner for Fiserv, on a major business transformation program for Cardnet, our merchant acquiring joint venture. Together, we will deliver tailored solutions including Clover, dynamic currency conversion and merchant cash advance to add new and grow existing merchant relationships. We've also been selected by Deutsche Bahn, the national railway company of Germany and one of the largest railway companies in the world, to provide terminals, network services and value-added solutions. We extended our relationship with Absa, one of Africa's largest diversified financial services groups. We will be implementing our full AQaaS solution, or acquiring as a service, which will allow Absa to process ecommerce transactions in nine African countries. AQaaS integrates multiple value-added solutions including payment gateway, merchant onboarding, merchant portal, omnipay back office, open FX, and real time fraud monitoring. Finally, we've extended our merchant acquiring relationship with Z\u0307abka Polska, the largest convenience store chain in central and eastern Europe, based in Poland, with over 11,000 stores. We've grown to provide more than 20 products to this innovative client, most recently adding merchant cash advance, a growing value-added solution for us in the region. Moving to Latin America, in Brazil the extension of our Caixa relationship to their bill pay locations has begun to ramp with sequential volume growth of over 20% in Q2. In addition, we went live with our pilot for our Pix platform to act as a payment service provider to over 30 merchants. This capability came through the acquisition of Sled in November of 2023 and will open up new growth opportunities from instant payment activity in Brazil. Overall, we continue to grow our instant payment transactions in Brazil and Argentina. In Brazil, we reached more than 400 million transactions in Q2, up 21% from Q1 levels, and we doubled our number of transactions in Argentina. In Asia Pacific, we went live with our pilot merchant acquiring services in New Zealand, a new market for Fiserv. We plan to target omnichannel merchants primarily in the hospitality and retail segments, as well as ecommerce-only merchants, aggregation partners and payfacs. Adjusted operating income in the merchant solutions segment increased 18% to $882 million in the quarter, with adjusted operating margin up 290 basis points to 36.6%. Year to date, adjusted operating income increased 23% to $1.7 billion with adjusted operating margin up 360 basis points to 35.4%. As noted last quarter, interest expense from anticipation revenue is recorded below the operating income line. If the interest costs from anticipation were included in operating income, merchant adjusted operating margins would have expanded 220 basis points for the quarter and 300 year to date. Turning to Slide 7 on the financial solutions segment, organic revenue grew 8% in the quarter and 6% year to date, in line with our full year outlook of 5% to 7%. Looking at the business lines, digital payments organic and adjusted revenue each grew by 8% in the quarter. Growth in Zelle transactions continued to be strong at 43%, and we signed one of our largest bank clients yet on Zelle, First Horizon Bank with $82 billion in assets, and the pipeline includes other large prospects. We continued to see strong demand from clients for FedNow and RTP integration. In Q2, we signed 32 FIs to FedNow, bringing our total signed to nearly 300. In issuing, organic and adjusted revenue grew 9% and 4% respectively in the quarter, driven by account growth internationally and new loan accounts in North America. Another growth vertical that we've been highlighting is government, where we continue to win and convert large programs, including the California Employment Development Department, which has enrolled over 1 million of our money network prepaid cards, funding nearly $5 billion. In Q2, we won an electronic funds transfer mandate with a major U.S. agency which should help extend our double-digit growth in the federal market. We also won several state and local deals on the merchant side of the business, including Texas, Arizona, North Carolina, and the City of San Francisco. Meanwhile, we are continuing to make strides with prior large wins, implementing the first phase of a target program with output services, though we expect the vast majority of revenue will start in Q1 2025, when the Circle card accounts begin to go live. Issuing has a meaningful and growing presence outside the U.S., and we have been investing to roll out the next generation of First Vision, our international operating platform. In Q2, we won our first client on the new First Vision platform in Brazil. Banking organic and adjusted revenue grew 6% and 4% respectively in the quarter. Excluding periodic revenue, organic revenue grew 4% in the quarter. We had two Finxact wins this quarter, including Metropolitan Commercial Bank, a $7 billion bank and an existing Fiserv core client that has decided to build a migration path to Finxact. The pipeline remains robust, including embedded finance opportunities, and we completed the integration of Finxact with Commerce Hub. This allows our enterprise merchants to embed a robust suite of financial services for their customers across shopping and checkout experiences. Second quarter adjusted operating income for the financial solutions segment was up 6% to $1.1 billion, and adjusted operating margin was consistent with a very strong second quarter last year at 45.9%. Year to date, adjusted operating income for the segment was up 6% to $2.1 billion, with adjusted operating margin up 80 basis points to 45%. Now let me wrap up with some remaining details on the financials. The corporate adjusted operating loss was $134 million in the quarter and $282 million year to date, in line with our expectations. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.9% and 18.1% for the first half, and we continue to expect the full year rate to be approximately 20%. Total debt outstanding was $25.5 billion on June 30. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was steady at 2.8 times, within our target leverage range. During the quarter, we repurchased 10 million shares for $1.5 billion, bringing our total cash return to shareholders for the last 12 months to just over $5 billion, and nearly $15 billion since the 2015 merger. We had 32 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase at the end of the quarter. Turning to Slide 9, as Frank said earlier, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share outlook to a range of $8.65 to $8.80, up from $8.60 to $8.75, and an acceleration in forecasted adjusted EPS growth to 15% to 17%, from 14% to 16%. We are maintaining our 2024 organic revenue growth outlook of 15% to 17%, and raising our estimate for adjusted operating margin expansion to more than 135 basis points compared to at least 125 basis points. Previously, our organic growth guidance assumed seven points of contribution from excess inflation and interest in Argentina, but during Q2 we saw a faster than expected decline in both measures. This more rapid return to historic average is good news for our Argentine business and overall stability in the region; however, the extra revenue contribution will now be less this year. Based on the latest economist consensus, we now assume four points of benefit from excess inflation and interest this year, down from seven points. Nevertheless, we are reiterating our previous organic growth guidance for the year despite exogenous shifts affecting our business. This capability has become a hallmark of Fiserv today. It is a testament to the adaptability of our business model that comes from a broad product portfolio, diverse client base, resourceful management team, and global reach. This quarter, we offset the lower inflation and interest benefit in Argentina with additional anticipation revenue, another quarter of do\u0301lar turista revenue, and other growth across the company. Our full year outlook of 15% to 17% total company organic growth less the four-point transitory benefit from inflation and interest in Argentina puts our normalized growth at 11% to 13% for 2024. This is in line with our medium term guidance of 9% to 12%, which assumes macro factors from Argentina continue to normalize. The forecasted impact from foreign currency exchange remains 8.5%, and we anticipate will continue to be a stronger though declining headwind to adjusted revenue growth relative to the tailwind from excess inflation and interest. Wrapping up with free cash flow, first I'd like to note a change to our cash flow reporting. We moved the Clover Capital and LATAM anticipation activity to the investing section of the cash flow statement, beginning in the second quarter. We re-evaluated the presentation in our cash flow statement given a significant increase in the merchant cash advance activity. This change is consistent with how our peers account for these activities and the additional disclosure will provide greater transparency to our investors. This move affected our free cash flow since those amounts are no longer included in cash flows from operating activities, so we are adjusting our full year free cash flow outlook accordingly by increasing our guidance to $4.7 billion from $4.5 billion, since we expected $200 million of outflows for merchants' cash advances when we originally set our 2024 outlook. With that, let me turn the call back to Frank for some closing remarks. Congratulations, David. Yes, thanks Tien-Tsin, good morning. First on the margin outlook, as you heard in our prepared remarks, we raised our margin outlook actually for the second quarter in a row, and now greater than 135 basis points. The original guide back in February was greater than 100 basis points. That's really driven by two factors. One is just the scale and volume of the company - as we add more revenue, it drops through to the company average--excuse me, better than company average rates, and continue to see good growth. The second one, of course, is ongoing productivity - we continue on an ongoing basis, as Frank said earlier, measure everything, and we continue to see progress towards achieving increased productivity across the organization, and so the combination of very strong organic growth, 15% to 17% this year plus productivity allows us to continue to expand margin on a multiple year basis. Then in the merchant processing side, as you know, the processing business line for us is where our clients own the merchant contracts, and so we are providing the back end processing for those clients. In many cases, it's banks, could be wholesale ISOs, and what we saw is some volume decline out of those processing contracts in the second quarter. Of course, on a year-to-date basis, we are plus-1% for the first half of the year, and that's in line with our ongoing expectation that it's roughly flat in this business line going forward. Yes Jason, good morning. There's obviously lots of variables in both of those, both for small business and the enterprise business lines. Generally, we saw a bit of a slowing, and in fact through the second quarter, April and May were in line with our expectations, July came in a little bit slower. But I would emphasize that that was in line with our expectations, so it's partly why we're maintaining our full year organic growth rate at 15% to 17%, and in fact for the merchant segment holding at the 25% to 28% despite acceleration in easing of that transitory benefit down in Argentina. Generally, the business is performing at or better than we had previously expected outside of that slowing in the transitory benefit, which by the way, we think is a good thing for the Argentine economy. A more normalized growth rate in inflation and interest is good long term, and so we're encouraged by how that's going and how the overall business is responding. And Tim, I'd say we feel very good about signing up six large banks before we've gone live. We're quite encouraged on the demand from those financial institutions and the excitement they have. As Frank points out, it's a revenue generator with them, it allows them to bring themselves closer to their small business client, which is an important client base for them, and for us, the opposite of our consumer bill pay solution which is a fee that the banks pay us but typically do not charge consumers, and so it's an expense item. For CashFlow Central, it's actually a revenue generator - they'll likely charge their small business clients a subscription, again generate revenue for themselves and obviously for us as transactions flow, so feel very good about the opportunity and very encouraged on the very, very early read. Yes Darrin, so our expectation, our outlook for this year for the financial solutions segment is 4% to 6%--excuse me, 5% to 7%. Year to date, we're at 6%, so we're right at the midpoint of that full year outlook. We anticipate as we go into '25 and '26, our medium term outlook for the financial solutions segment increases a point to 6% to 8%, so 5% to 7% this year, we're right at midpoint halfway through the year, and we expect that to accelerate into '25 and 2026. That's really driven by the benefits of exactly what you called out - CashFlow Central coming online, growth in XD, our digital banking solution, Finxact, and a broad suite of capabilities that we have continuing to take hold and meet the demands of our financial solutions client base. We also have on the issuing side, as you heard us talk about back in November at the investor day, several large client wins that will go live in 2025 and beyond, things like Verizon and Target and Desjardins all giving us a lift, so we feel quite good about where we are first half of the year and what we see going into '25 and '26. Yes, thanks Dan. Overall, maintaining our total company organic growth at 15% to 17%, in order to do that, we expect the merchant segment to grow 25% to 28% organically first half of the year. We're ahead of that slightly at the top end, good growth overall. We talked a little bit in our prepared remarks about the easing of the transitory benefit of inflation and interest. You've seen in our slides that that number has come down. Our previous expectation for the full year was that that would provide a 14-point benefit to merchant solutions, now a 9-point benefit, yet we're maintaining our full year outlook, and that's the strength of things like Clover selling very well, value-added solutions both in our small business and in our enterprise business. CommerceHub continues to see good uptake from our large enterprise clients. We definitely saw an increase in anticipation activity down in Latin America we talked about in our prepared remarks, as well as an additional quarter benefit of Do\u0301lar turista, so maybe a little bit of that idiosyncratic view from your point on the Do\u0301lar turista, expect that to go away at the tail end of this quarter, third quarter, but generally, growth across the business. I think this is one of the hallmarks of Fiserv over the 40 years that we've been in business, anticipating that 2024 will be our 39th consecutive year of double-digit EPS growth. We are incredibly resilient and we respond to changes in the marketplace. We respond to changes in the macroeconomic environment and it's the breadth and depth of our capability, of our product set, of our client base and our distribution channels."

        "content": "Operator: Welcome to the Fiserv First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session begins following the presentation. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Julie Chariell, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv.\nJulie Chariell: Thank you, and good morning. With me on the call today are Frank Bisignano, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and supplemental materials for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Please refer to these materials for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call, along with the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. Unless otherwise stated, performance references are year-over-year comparisons. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results and strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. You should refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. As a reminder starting in the first quarter of this year Fiserv now reports two segments: merchant solution and financial solution to align with how we serve our clients. Please see our current reports on the Form 8-K filed on March 26 2024, for an explanation of the new segments and a recaps of 2022 and 2023 into the new segments. And with that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Frank.\nFrank Bisignano: Thank you, Julie. And thank you all for joining us today to discuss our first quarter results and a strong start to the year. Fiserv delivered a strong first quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $1.88, up 19%, which reflects our continued revenue growth and operating margin expansion. Adjusted revenue growth was 7% and adjusted operating margin of 35.8% increased 180 basis points. We had organic revenue growth of 20% in the first quarter. This is consistent with our expectation of higher growth in the first-half of 2024 toward our full-year outlook of 15% to 17% organic growth. This healthy top line growth coupled with Q1 stronger margin performance leads us to raise our adjusted earnings for share outlook to a range of $8.60 to $8.75. From the prior range of $8.55 to $8.70, which is 14% to 16% growth. We now expect adjusted operating margin to expand at least 125 basis points this year, compared to our prior outlook for at least 100 basis points of margin improvement. As you know, beginning this quarter, we realigned our business to best reflect our clients engage with our solutions today. This client-centric model is now reported in two segments, with roughly half of our business in the merchant solution segment and the other half in the financial solution segment. Through this change, we retain our fundamental approach of providing business operating systems to run our clients\u2019 key processes, while delivering a variety of value added solutions for enhanced capability. Our business model combines the recurring revenue and high incremental margin of a scaled processing business with higher growth and higher margins, but still consistent cloud-based software and services offerings. Both our segments performed well and within our expectations. Merchant Solutions organic revenue grew 36% in Q1 and 13% on an adjusted basis. Financial Solutions revenue grew 5% organically and 2% on an adjusted basis. This performance reflects a solid macro environment, along with our ability to drive outperformance by adding new clients, retaining and growing with existing clients, and providing them more value-added solutions. At a Macro level, consumer spending remains resilient. The Fiserv Small Business Index, based upon the spending activity at 2 million small merchants in the U.S., shows spending rose 3.4% in the first quarter, up from 2.5% in Q4. The early read on April is that growth is tracking slightly ahead of the Q1 average. The index also showed that roughly 60% of Q1 spend was on non-discretionary categories. And the remaining spend went mostly to dining out, amusement, hotels, and short-term rentals. These metrics point to a resilient consumer in the U.S. turning to the broader environment for banking, while there is some signs of pressure our net interest income given high interest rates and potentially tighter lending. We have not seen this having an impact on our client's IT spending for the essential services we provide. With that macro backdrop, there are a number of highlights for Fiserv\u2019s business in Q1 and the remainder of the year. In Merchant Solutions, first quarter activity reinforced our progress toward achieving the targets we set in our November Investor Day, including to reach $12 billion in revenue in 2026 as we continue to expand adjusted operating margin. Let's discuss five of the drivers that support this outlook. First, Clover continues to lead the small business merchant SaaS market in growth and scale and remains on track to reach the expected $4.5 billion in revenue in 2026. Clover first did a second consecutive quarter of 30% revenue growth, supported by new merchant ads, and a 20% penetration of value-added solutions. Second, we are launching multiple new Clover products this year. In the first quarter, we rolled out a larger kitchen display system and our ordering kiosks for the restaurant vertical. Around mid-year, we'll be rolling out a new Clover device called the Compact. In the second-half of the year, we expect to begin offering additional software solutions for the professional services vertical. Third, out progress in international markets continues to differentiate Pfizer. Demand for Clover is strong in Germany and leads our building from Albert Joint Venture with Deutsche Bank. In the Netherlands, where we acquired the remaining portion of the joint venture from our bank partner last year, we are seeing pent-up demand for Clover. In Argentina, we are having success adding merchants to Clover as we prepare to launch it in Brazil and Mexico in the second-half of the year. In Asia-Pac, we continue to build on our high-end hospitality market leadership, signing the Grand Hyatt in Q1 to reach over 25 five-star properties in Singapore and Malaysia. We continue to ramp up distribution as we prepare for the Clover launch in the APAC region. We already have over 50 ISO and PayFac partners, and we onboarded more partners in Q1, including KPay, which added 20,000 merchants onto our platform. We continued to expect a full-featured Clover launch in Australia, Singapore, and Hong Kong in 2025. Fourth, our value-added solutions penetration continues to rise. In Q1, Clover VAS penetration reached 20% on growth in Clover SaaS, Clover Capital, and Rapid Deposit. In the enterprise business, we are seeing a newer VAS opportunity emerge with our SnapPay product, a B2B payments offering for mid-market merchants that integrate seamlessly with popular ERP solutions. After over 20% revenue growth in 2023, SnapPay is poised for continued strength this year. Covanta Energy signed up for SnapPay in Q1, and we had an additional government win with the State of Texas to digitize revenue collection activity. We also entered into our first major reseller agreement for SnapPay, opening the opportunity to reach even more mid-market clients. Fifth and finally, we continue to add new merchant relationships across the SMB and enterprise markets. Building on the success we saw in 2023, Clover Sport added over 20 new venues, putting 1,000s of new Clover devices in the market. Venues include stadiums that are home to teams in the MLB, NFL, and NTAA, as well as amphitheaters, golf courses, and large-scale festivals. In our enterprise business, we address a wide breadth of industries and a growing presence in new markets, such as social gaming, which is a $10 billion opportunity by volume and growing around 20%. We signed three more clients in this space in Q1 and now serve 13 social gaming merchants, including three of the top five. We are seeing good uptake of Commerce Hub, our single orchestration layer that allows enterprise clients to operate a unified omnichannel platform. In Q1, our Commerce Hub client count surpassed 200. These five are just some of the ways we plan to achieve the targets we've set for 2026. Turning to the financial solutions segment, demand for modernization and innovation is on full display. We posted four Finxact wins for new and traditional use cases in Q1. Although we do not expect the revenue contribution to be significant in 2024, this progress reinforces Finxact\u2019s capability and flexibility as a cloud-based core banking and embedded finance platform. Let's take a deeper look at all four. First, Finxact will be the core platform for a new U.S.-based digital bank from Banco Inter Brazil, a current Fiserv client. Second, Finxact won a deal with the FinTech program manager that helps businesses access the payments ecosystem. This client decided to upgrade to Finxact and consolidate volumes on the platform. Third, Finxact signed a current Fiserv SMB solutions aggregator client as they build embedded finance for their merchant clients. This opportunity ties deeper into Fiserv as we will be working without financial institution clients to find sponsors of these lending services. Fourth and finally, Finxact won a deal to become the core account processor for a major U.S. government agency as part of the client's much larger modernization plan, which will pull in other parts of our business. It's clear that Finxact is demonstrating its capability across the broader financial services landscape. And we're encouraged by its growing pipeline today and the bigger opportunity it can bring to Fiserv over time. Turning to credit issuing, we partnered with Robinhood as it launches its gold card program following the acquisition of X1, which is built on Fiserv Credit Processing. We also extend our relationship with Kuwait Finance House on the back of its acquisition of Ali United Bank and will be migrating that card portfolio onto our platform. These are two more examples of how financial institution M&A is presenting more opportunities and risk as our technology leadership grows clearer. Lastly, in Digital Payment Solutions, demand among our core account clients and other financial institutions remains strong. One of the fastest growing examples of this is Zelle, the largest B2B payment platform where we remain the leading third-party systems integrator and recorded 45% transaction growth in Q1. A second example that's still emerging is FedNow and RTP, where we sign more than 500 financial institutions to provide access to these real-time realms. And perhaps our biggest medium to long-term opportunity is cash flow central, our small business accounts payable, accounts receivable solution that we are currently marketing to banks as resellers. The product will be available this summer and we've already sold it to four large banks including U.S. Bank announced in February and this month Bolton Bank and Citizens Bank. You should also expect to see cash flow central distributed through Clover later this year. The product is off to a great start and we are encouraged by what we are seeing. And now let me turn the call over to Bob to walk you through the financials in more detail.\nBob Hau: Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. If you're following along on our slides, I'll cover additional detail on total company and segment performance, starting with our financial metrics and trends on slide four. First quarter performance demonstrated our ability to deliver top line growth and continue to drive margin expansion. First quarter total company adjusted revenue grew 7% to $4.5 billion and adjusted operating income grew 13% to $1.6 billion, resulting in adjusted operating margin of 35.8%, an increase of 180 basis points versus the prior year. As a reminder, our adjusted revenue was recast as part of our realign segment reporting. And if you haven't already, I encourage you to review our 8-K filing from March 26 for historical comparisons. The recast numbers include a small change to our adjusted revenue in the prior years to account for all pass-through postage. In our prior reporting, we adjusted the postage pass-through revenue only from our output business, which represents the significant majority of our postage activity. We are now adjusting out the non-output pass-through postage revenue as well. The change slightly lowered our adjusted revenue for the recast prior periods and better aligns with our internal reporting. On an organic basis, revenue grew 20% in the quarter, with particular ongoing strength in Merchant Solutions organic revenue, which was up 36%, and steady growth of 5% in financial solutions organic revenue. First quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 19% to $1.88, compared to $1.58 in the prior year. Our adjusted earnings per share in Q1 grew well above the 14$% to 16% growth level anticipated for the full-year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $454 million. While this number is lower than normally seen in the quarter, it is in line with our expectations given the timing of payments for the green tax credit program. This timing is consistent with what we described during last quarter's earnings call, and we expect this cash flow headwind to become a tailwind in the second-half of this year when we apply the credit to lower our second-half cash tax payments. We continue to expect to generate $4.5 billion in free cash flow for the year. Turning to performance by segment. Starting on slide five, organic revenue growth in the Merchant Solution Segment was 36% in the quarter. This includes a 15-point benefit from excess revenue driven by above average interest and inflation in Argentina. Without this transitory benefit, organic growth would have been 21%. On slide six, we've added a summary of the impact of excess Argentine inflation and interest on total Fiserv and Merchant Segment revenue, and the offsetting headwind from currency devaluation, which impacts adjusted revenue. Adjusted revenue growth for Merchant Solutions was 13% in the quarter. It includes a 23 percentage point currency headwind largely from the Argentine peso and the impact of the devaluation in late December last year. Unlike in 2023, the currency headwind in Q1 \u201824 was much higher than the inflation and interest tailwind. If interest and inflation fall back to normal levels, which we expect to happen in the medium term. We anticipate the headwind from foreign currency exchange would ease as well. Moving to the business lines, small business organic revenue growth and adjusted revenue growth was 45% and 16% respectively. Small business volume growth was 8%. As I mentioned, over the last few quarters, revenue from the excess inflation interest in Argentina is boosting organic growth, while the currency devaluation is a headwind to adjusted revenue. Clover revenue grew 30% in the first quarter and annualized payment volume growth of 19%. The spread between revenue and volume growth reflects a higher penetration of value-added solutions, continued channel mix shift, and some pricing. Vast penetration reached 20% in Q1, up from 19% in Q4, and on pace to meet our 27% target by 2026. The increase was driven by revenue from Clover Capital, Rapid Deposit, and our basic Clover SaaS plans. Clover Capital is our short-term working capital advance program. Rapid deposit allows merchants to access money from daily car sales instantly for a fee. And while there are several standard Clover SaaS plans, the basic package includes virtual terminal, e-commerce products, developer tools, invoicing, and transaction reports. These are just some examples of the value-added solutions available with Clover. Enterprise organic and adjusted revenue growth was 29% and 6% respectively, driven by transactions growth of 12% and higher vast penetration. As in small business, organic growth includes some transitory benefit from excess inflation and interest in Argentina, but was also impacted by the inclusion of three lower growth products as part of the shift in our business segmentation to start this year. Finally, processing organic and adjusted revenue grew by 9% and 10%, respectively. As mentioned in the past, processing represents the back-end processing we do for our partners where they own the merchant relationship. The increase this quarter was driven by a termination fee from an existing client, who canceled a planned expansion into new geographies. This will not impact ongoing revenue in established geographies where our relationship with this client remains strong. Excluding periodic revenue, processing revenue declined 2% in the quarter. This business line has no revenue from Argentina. Overall, we continue to anticipate processing adjusted revenue to be roughly flat over the medium term. Adjusted operating income in the Merchant Solution Segment increased 30% to $769 million in the quarter with adjusted operating margin of 440 basis points to 34.1%. In accordance with GAAP, interest expense from anticipation revenue is recorded below the operating income line. If the interest costs from anticipation were included in operating income, Merchant adjusted operating margins would have still expanded a very strong 390 basis points for the quarter. Turning to slide seven, on the Financial Solutions Segment, organic revenue grew 5% in the quarter, which is in line with our full-year outlook of 5% to 7%. Looking at the business lines, digital payments, organic and adjusted revenue each grew by 5%. Dell transactions and number of clients continue to grow at a healthy clip at 45% and 20% respectively. And we continue to see strong demand from clients for FedNow and RTP integration. Issuing organic and adjusted revenue grew 8% and 3% respectively, driven by several factors, including the launch of money network cards to unemployment and disability benefit recipients under the California Employment Development Department Program. Banking organic and adjusted revenue declined 1% and 3%, respectively. Excluding periodic license and termination fee revenue, banking organic revenue grew 2%. First quarter adjusted operating income for the financial solution segment was up 6% to $1 billion, and adjusted operating margin was up 160 basis points to 44.1%, driven by operating leverage from scaled revenue growth and cost efficiency. As we highlighted at our Investor Conference in November, the cross Fiserv activity between our two segments is particularly powerful, because following the success of the Fiserv first data merger, we are the only single provider of merchant, Bank IT, and payments functionality. Let me share three examples where we've had important cross-Fiserv wins in Q1. In our debit networks, STAR and Accel, we have five merchant wins in the quarter, including ConocoPhillips, a traditional merchant, along with a social media company and a PayFac, both of which will be able to benefit from more choice under Reg II. Traditional and online merchants are using our debit networks to efficiently route card transactions at the point of sale. These wins drive revenue in our digital payments business line and often go hand in hand with merchant acquiring wins and other value-added solution sales that only Fiserv offers. A second example can be found in open banking, where we provide our data solutions to facilitators such as Plaid and MasterCard Open Banking as a single API into the open banking data of our financial institution clients. In Q1, we signed a data access agreement with Visa Open Banking Solutions acquired through Tink as they entered the U.S. The data is typically used by clients of these organizations to verify bank accounts for payments and transfers, underwrite loans, and facilitate financial wellness and planning, and by merchants to facilitate pay-by-bank transactions as just a few examples. Third, over the past year, we have announced a number of wins in the government sector, and we're excited about our continued momentum in this large vertical across our merchant and financial segments. Revenue from government clients recently surpassed $500 million. Now, let me wrap up with some remaining details on the financials. The corporate adjusted operating loss was $148 billion in the quarter, largely in line with our expectations. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 18.2%. The Q1 tax rate is traditionally below the full-year rate, and we continue to expect the 2024 adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 20% for the full-year. Total debt outstanding was $24.4 billion on March 31. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio slightly increased to 2.8 times within our targeted leverage range. And we have approximately 7% of our debt in variable rate instruments. During the quarter, we repurchased 10.2 million shares for $1.5 billion, bringing our total cash return to shareholders for the last 12 months to $4.7 billion. We had 42 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase at the end of the quarter. Our long-standing capital allocation strategy will continue in 2024, defined by a strong balance sheet, share repurchases, and complementary and innovative acquisitions. As Frank said earlier, we continue to expect organic revenue growth of 15% to 17% for the full year. One quarter into the year, we are maintaining our 2024 organic revenue growth rate outlook. While the interest in inflation tailwind from Argentina eased faster than we expected, further moves in the balance of the year remain unclear, while our overall business remains strong. For the full-year, we now expect adjusted operating margin expansion to be more than 125 basis points, up from our previous outlook of at least 100 basis points. This translates to adjusted earnings per share of $8.60 to $8.75, a $0.05 increase in our outlook at the midpoint, which is 14% to 16% growth over 2023. This performance for 2024 would represent our 39th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. With that, let me turn the call back to Frank for some closing remarks.\nFrank Bisignano: Thanks, Bob. Last week we published our fourth corporate social responsibility report. In it, we highlight the ways we execute on our four strategic pillars: empower people, advance communities and society; champion responsible business practices; and invest in sustainable systems. In summary, we believe that doing good is good for business. We are committed to diverse representation at all levels of the organization, including leadership positions. We continue to engage with communities where we live and work, including small businesses and minority depository institutions. We recognize the importance of strong governance as part of our overall strategy, and we continue to invest in sustainability. For the first time, our CSR report includes a greenhouse gas reduction goal. Later this year, we will be celebrating two important milestones for Fiserv. Our 40th year in business and our 5th year since merging with First Data. On these occasions, you naturally reflect on what it means to come of a certain age. For Fiserv 40-years old means proven, resilient, and experienced to deliver on our commitments, and we've done just that. It also means scaled, savvy and well capitalized to sustain strong top and bottom line growth. We are doing that as well. But when you consider the significant change created by the merger, we're also a lot like a young five-year-old company. Five means a fresh foundation to support investment. We have used our cash to invest in products, services, and people and that's driving higher growth. Five also means a longer term opportunity ahead, fueled by innovation, and therefore we see continued strong further top and bottom line growth at Pfizer. The proven strength of 40 combined with the opportunistic growth of five puts Pfizer in a distinguished position to both lead and drive innovation. And that's exactly what we're doing. All of this is possible because of our over 40,000 employees. I would like to thank them for what they do for our clients, shareholders, and each other. Thank you for your time today. And now, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We would now like to open the phone lines for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Togut from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. Good morning. Great to see Clover revenue growth sustained at 30% with accelerating payment volume growth and higher VAS attach rates. When you look at the picture for Clover for the year as a whole, can revenue growth sustain in this high-20s to low-30s range, you know, when you look at the Brazil market entry, Argentina expansion, and VAS growth opportunities?\nFrank Bisignano: Yes, hey, thanks David. You know, we've been focused on all of those for quite some time, and we treat unveiling new product, new initiatives, new market, while continuing to, you know, draw on the embedded business we have generating new merchants, right? So, you know, our basic philosophy is increase the number of merchants we have, be able to deliver more products to merchants, and then go into the areas that we haven't been before. So we feel very, very good about what we laid out a couple of years ago and what we talked about in November. You can see the traction here, which is kind of above what the CAGR needed to be, but you should expect us to be all cylinders on Clover, as we have a bunch of other parts about company also, I would have to say. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Thanks so much. Good morning. Just the increase here in the operating margin, how much of that 25 bps is from favorable mix versus other surprises, maybe the term fee and processing, and the Argentine, of course, is always a factor there. Just curious on the increase, and then any call-outs for the second quarter or the second-half with respect to the margin? Thanks.\nBob Hau: Yes, Tien-Tsin, it\u2019s Bob, good morning. I think overall the 25 basis points that you're describing our full-year outlook, moving from previously at least 100 basis points, margin expansion to now more than 125 is really driven by continued volume leverage, strong growth in the overall company, as well as continued progress on productivity. The termination fee in the processing is relatively small in the grand scheme. Obviously, it matters a bit in the processing line for this quarter, but in terms of the overall company's margin improvement, it really is continued volume leverage and a focus on productivity.\nFrank Bisignano: Yes, and I\u2019d just add, you know, when we think about running this company, our investment in technology is really around new product development, improved service, and the ability to deliver the next dollar of revenue at a better incremental cost by investing in productivity. So that will be for the rest of our lives. An AI and those type of items just allow us to do more of it. We're at the tip of that, but you know we can see our way very clearly this year. Q - Tien-Tsin Huang Nice color. Thank you.\nOperator: Next we'll go to the line of Dave Koning from Baird. Please go ahead.\nDave Koning: Yes, hey guys, great job again. And maybe just on the financial segment, digital slowed a bit this quarter. I think it was 5% or 7% to 8% the last few quarters. Wondering just about that and if Reg II, if you've kind of fully benefited from that or if that still has incremental room to benefit and accelerate growth in that part?\nBob Hau: Yes, David, good morning. On the Reg II, I'd say that there's still probably more opportunity ahead than what we've seen. It remains to truly be seeing what that means. We're seeing good uptick in our network business, whether that's really driven by Reg II or just continued progress in our debit business, I think it's just more continued progress. In terms of a slowdown, I wouldn't read anything into it other than quarterly fluctuations and a tough comp against Q1 prior year.\nDave Koning: Got it. Thanks. And if I can just do one more quick. SMB grew so fast 45%. Clover grew 30%. So non-Clover is actually growing faster, which I assume is just Argentina. But maybe how is non-Argentina, non-Clover doing, and is there room for that to keep growing well too?\nBob Hau: Non-Argentina, non-Clover. I'll have to pull up my Venn diagrams here. You know, obviously tongue in cheek there. Bottom line is we're seeing good growth, obviously, across the entire SMB business. That small business certainly has good growth from Clover, and you saw the 30% growth in Clover. We continue to see real opportunity there. On the non-Clover side, there's certainly impact from Argentina. There's a small piece of Clover Argentina there, but the 30% growth is really heavily driven by the United States growth there. On the overall segments, you heard us talk in the prepared remarks about the Argentine impact from organic growth. We continue to see that easing later into the year. It was a bit lower than what we expected in the first quarter, i.e., inflation and interest eased a little bit faster than we anticipated. In previous, in the last earnings call, we indicated we expect about a 14% impact from Argentina for the full-year in the merchant business. Q1 came in a little bit above that. We expect that to ease into later part of the year. That certainly impacts the non-Clover business. But overall, non-Clover is growing quite well. And we continue to see opportunity. It's not just about adding Clover in small businesses. It's supporting them wherever they want to take merchant acquiring solutions. The other thing I would add, and it's an impact to the first quarter that we expect to ease into the balance of the year, is in Q1, we saw the benefit of a better-than-expected lift on the use of foreign-based currency credit cards in Argentina. This is some people may have heard the term dollar turista. The Argentine government has a program sponsored by the Central Bank to encourage foreign currency denominated credit cards. And we saw that pick up in the first quarter. That is a program that the Argentine government has at their discretion to help the economy. Obviously, they're seeing the economy improve. So I would certainly not anticipate a 45% small business organic growth into the future. And we're seeing some of that kind of transitory impact this quarter.\nDave Koning: Got it. Great job. Thanks, guys.\nFrank Bisignano: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Timothy Chiodo from UBS. Please go ahead.\nTimothy Chiodo: Great. Thank you for taking the question. Looking at the gap between the 19% volume growth and the 30% revenue growth for Clover, you hit it pretty well I think on the VAS adding about 900 basis points. It just implies that there's a small component there from direct mix hardware and pricing as you mentioned? So I just wanted to see if you could provide some context on the path to the $4.5 billion, how we should think about those other contributors direct hardware and pricing contributing? And maybe a different way to ask it is, should we expect the volume growth to stay in this sort of high-teens range, or should we expect slightly higher turnover of volume growth?\nBob Hau: So, a number of elements to that question. First, in order to achieve the $4.5 billion goal that we set out ahead by 2026, we need kind of a very high 20% call it 28% total Clover revenue growth. As part of that goal, we've indicated we expect VAS to achieve 27% penetration from the current quarter Q1 at 20%. So certainly a big part of it is additional VAS. And we've talked about this in the past, the secret recipe to growing Clover to $4.5 billion is actually not so secret. It's get new merchants, sell more stuff to those merchants, and grow with those merchants, and that's exactly what we see. To your point, in the current quarter, there was a big part of the overall revenue left. Certainly, the delta between revenue and volume was driven by VAS. We kind of gave the sequence in order of importance, and I think that will continue as we progress over the next couple of years as we march towards that $4.5 billion, VAS will be a big part of it. This is always priced depending on what's going on with inflation, what's going on in the market, but that's probably the third of the three important factors.\nTimothy Chiodo: Great. Thank you.\nBob Hau: Thank you.\nOperator: Next we'll go to the line of Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nJason Kupferberg: Good morning guys. I just had a two-part question on merchant. The first is just do you have the total segment volume and transaction growth for the quarter? Not sure if you're going to continue to provide that going forward? And then the second part is just on the April comments. Frank, I think you indicated actually a little bit of an uptick in April relative to Q1, which could be viewed as a bit of an upside surprise considering Easter timing and how that fell this year? So just curious which parts of merchant might have performed better so far in April versus Q1. Thank you.\nFrank Bisignano: Hey Bob take the first part, I'll take the second.\nBob Hau: Yes, so the first part of your question is, in our prepared remarks, we gave a small business volume growth at 8% and enterprise transactions growth at 12%. Given the way we're reporting now for that Merchant Solution Segment and the three business lines. We felt that the volume for small business is the driver of revenue, and for transactions, it's enterprise. Transaction activity in small business is not a revenue driver and volume for enterprise is not a revenue driver. So we thought providing the key metrics that really are driving the business was important.\nFrank Bisignano: And just to be clear on clarity, a small tracking, a small growth, I want it. And I put it in the non-discretionary buckets. If you're thinking about where it occurred. Obviously, that's, you know, an early indicator. It's not necessarily, you know, how the whole quarter is going to play, but we always feel committed to be able to talk to you about what we see, you know, the vast amount of volume we have going throughout the -- both in the U.S. and around the world, and I consider it a small increase.\nOperator: Thank you. Next we'll go to Dan. Yes, we'll go to Dan Dolev from Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nDan Dolev: Hey, guys. Great results. I just have a quick question on Pay Easy. Can you maybe give us some context on the conversion to Clover, you know, about roughly timing and contribution and are there any other conversions that we should be expecting? Thanks again.\nFrank Bisignano: Yes, the way -- great question. The way we think about, Pay Easy, it was a processing system that were retired and then built out both commerce hub and brought some of that volume, which already existed through Clover to the future new merchants. That was completed, migrated, multi-year project that we built out in a way that allowed us to build out Commerce Hub, that allowed us to deliver VAS into Commerce Hub and also have Pay Easy operating within our SMB base. So I feel great about closing the books on that from a conversion standpoint. And we're seeing on the enterprise side, you heard us talk about 200 Commerce Hub users and a strategic platform for us going forward.\nDan Dolev: Great. Thank you and great results again.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi, thanks for taking my question this morning. I wanted to ask about M&A and what you're seeing out there. It feels like there's a little more opportunity, maybe urgency on the side of sellers in the sort of Fintech industry. What are you seeing and what's your appetite right now for doing a deal?\nFrank Bisignano: Well, you know, I don't know about urgency on sellers' parts as much as valuation and understanding what real valuations are. Now, we have a really great model, which we talked about our ability to generate cash flow, investing in our business, and the ability to deploy capital. I think we've done a very, very good job in the assets we've acquired, integrated, and grown. And so I'd say our appetite to acquire properties is always high. I mean, we're always trafficking. I think on the other hand, you know, we want to be very, very, very clear that it fits within our strategy, which I think is holding tight. It's within our structure and the ability to distribute the product to our vast client base both on the merchant side and on the FI side. You know, so, you know, I like to believe that we're always engaged and working and thinking through it. And we're highly selective to make sure we're using our shareholders' dollars as appropriately as possible. And I think we've got a pretty darn good track record in that so far.\nBob Hau: Ramsey, I think I'll carry your analogy one step further in terms of the question on appetite. If appetite's good, it's strong appetite, but we're not hungry. So, you know, you go to the shopping mall or to the grocery store, when you're hungry you buy a lot of stuff. You get home and you realize you didn't need all that stuff. We're certainly seeing a lot of activity, but we're not hungry. And while we have tremendous capacity on our balance sheet and could do deals, we're making sure that what we see is of good value and brings value to our shareholders before we go ahead and strike on it.\nRamsey El-Assal: Fantastic. Thanks.\nBob Hau: Thanks, Ramsey.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Christopher Kennedy from William Blair. Please go ahead.\nChristopher Kennedy: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So we have good targets for the value-added solutions for Clover. Is there a way to think about the opportunity for some of the other operating systems such as Carat, DNA, Finxact, or Optus?\nFrank Bisignano: Well, I think it\u2019s a -- we have not articulated goals around them, but they're clearly embedded in our guide and the things we think about our growth rates, right? I think what we think about, even at a more broader standpoint, is what those are, right? And you could go across the board from our fraud integration products like advanced defense to how even we bring in cash flow central. You heard us talk about that and that really hangs both in the SMB space through our own distribution and then, you know, obviously attached to a banking product. I think, you know, over time we probably should come back with a better clarity around some of it. Having said that, we've been selling value-added services to our clients, we've sold a gift product into our enterprise for a long time. We've sold different forms of data and information to them. So I think really the way we look at it at the large macro level in the enterprise is really that you can go back to the circle that we used to have about, we're going to sell a core, but really all the revenue comes when growth comes from debit, credit, right? Digital, and in their own right, those are value-added services hanging off the core. The same is true in our enterprise business and merchant. So I think in reality, when you look at how we report, we are reporting, you know, our economics and some of those actually value-added services and business lines also. So, you know, I'll go think about it a little more, but I think, you know, it's encompassed in the economics and how we show our business lines.\nChristopher Kennedy: Thank you.\nOperator: Next we'll go to -- yes next we\u2019ll go to the Jamie Friedman from Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\nJamie Friedman: Hi. Good morning. And I wanted to mention I appreciate the incremental disclosures. The segmentation is really helpful. I wanted to ask about government. Frank, you -- and if I mess this up because the transcript is not out yet, but I thought you said it's a $500 million category. Again, I apologize if I heard that wrong. But what I wanted to ask is, is it correct that, that rolls into the financial solutions segment? And if possible if you could unpack like where in there, like is it issuing specifically? And generally, how are you going to market with government? Thank you.\nFrank Bisignano: Good. So why don't I start with how are we going to government, how are we going to market in government? We've been focused on government as a very large vertical calling and that is everywhere from state and local to federal. And so we have a team and their sole job is government, right? And the traffic in the transactions, you've even been hurt. And you know, our thought was always, it transcends the org. That's why we have dedicated client sales force to it because, you know, at times we have opportunities to bid on merchant acquiring. At times you heard us talk about delivering FinXact. You know, the government is we called out the $0.5 because it demonstrated where we started, which was very, very small to the growth, but it transcends both segments. And on any given day, almost any one of our products can play in the government space, right? You know, so I don't know if that answers your question, but I think about it as dedicated coverage model, right? Transcending the businesses, and it can be anywhere from our core Finxact, which we just delivered to money network to merchant acquiring and we really love this segment, vertical, however you want to think about it. And we have a great, great team that knows how to cover government, and we've been very fortunate in that win.\nJamie Friedman: Great. Thanks for the call.\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question will come from James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJames Faucette: Great. Thank you very much. I'm wondering if we can help us understand not only where you're seeing success with Clover in the market competitively, but how you're thinking about continuing to improve its positioning in the market. I mean, it seems like value-added services is a key part of that, but are there other things or aspects we should be thinking about and love to get your sense of what your win rates, if you have any idea of that, versus other competitors in the market? Thank you very much.\nFrank Bisignano: Well, I try to be as clear as possible on this, Clover covers the whole SMB market and expands a little further, because you've heard about the 1,000s of Clovers we delivered in the quarter to venues, right? You know, it's a 30% grower today. We have talked very hard and have worked to do to finish the swing on restaurant, but feel very, very clear about our ability there. You know, you'll see us go deeper in professional services and in retail. Remember, it's a horizontal platform that we brought vertical expertise to. And then, you know, we have great demand outside the U.S., as you heard us talk about, along with the ability to continue to distribute through our channels like more in our ISV channel. So I think it spans the landscape of SMB. Obviously, our growth, which is through new business acquisition, has demonstrated at the 30% mark. And, you know, it's an open platform that we continue to add more software to. And so when you put that all together and where we started with, I like to remind us inside the house and outside the house that we were seven engineers and three patents and now you know we have more than a 1,000 software engineers across the world operating on it [Technical Difficulty] so we're going to complete rolling and so commensal across the world.\nJames Faucette: That\u2019s great. Thank you.\nFrank Bisignano: Good. And I'd like to thank everyone for their attention today. Please reach out to our IR team with any further questions, and have a great day. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you all for participating in the Fiserv first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. That concludes today's call. Please disconnect at this time and have a great rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Frank Bisignano",
            "content": "Thank you, Julie. And thank you all for joining us today to discuss our first quarter results and a strong start to the year. Fiserv delivered a strong first quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $1.88, up 19%, which reflects our continued revenue growth and operating margin expansion. Adjusted revenue growth was 7% and adjusted operating margin of 35.8% increased 180 basis points. We had organic revenue growth of 20% in the first quarter. This is consistent with our expectation of higher growth in the first-half of 2024 toward our full-year outlook of 15% to 17% organic growth. This healthy top line growth coupled with Q1 stronger margin performance leads us to raise our adjusted earnings for share outlook to a range of $8.60 to $8.75. From the prior range of $8.55 to $8.70, which is 14% to 16% growth. We now expect adjusted operating margin to expand at least 125 basis points this year, compared to our prior outlook for at least 100 basis points of margin improvement. As you know, beginning this quarter, we realigned our business to best reflect our clients engage with our solutions today. This client-centric model is now reported in two segments, with roughly half of our business in the merchant solution segment and the other half in the financial solution segment. Through this change, we retain our fundamental approach of providing business operating systems to run our clients' key processes, while delivering a variety of value added solutions for enhanced capability. Our business model combines the recurring revenue and high incremental margin of a scaled processing business with higher growth and higher margins, but still consistent cloud-based software and services offerings. Both our segments performed well and within our expectations. Merchant Solutions organic revenue grew 36% in Q1 and 13% on an adjusted basis. Financial Solutions revenue grew 5% organically and 2% on an adjusted basis. This performance reflects a solid macro environment, along with our ability to drive outperformance by adding new clients, retaining and growing with existing clients, and providing them more value-added solutions. At a Macro level, consumer spending remains resilient. The Fiserv Small Business Index, based upon the spending activity at 2 million small merchants in the U.S., shows spending rose 3.4% in the first quarter, up from 2.5% in Q4. The early read on April is that growth is tracking slightly ahead of the Q1 average. The index also showed that roughly 60% of Q1 spend was on non-discretionary categories. And the remaining spend went mostly to dining out, amusement, hotels, and short-term rentals. These metrics point to a resilient consumer in the U.S. turning to the broader environment for banking, while there is some signs of pressure our net interest income given high interest rates and potentially tighter lending. We have not seen this having an impact on our client's IT spending for the essential services we provide. With that macro backdrop, there are a number of highlights for Fiserv's business in Q1 and the remainder of the year. In Merchant Solutions, first quarter activity reinforced our progress toward achieving the targets we set in our November Investor Day, including to reach $12 billion in revenue in 2026 as we continue to expand adjusted operating margin. Let's discuss five of the drivers that support this outlook. First, Clover continues to lead the small business merchant SaaS market in growth and scale and remains on track to reach the expected $4.5 billion in revenue in 2026. Clover first did a second consecutive quarter of 30% revenue growth, supported by new merchant ads, and a 20% penetration of value-added solutions. Second, we are launching multiple new Clover products this year. In the first quarter, we rolled out a larger kitchen display system and our ordering kiosks for the restaurant vertical. Around mid-year, we'll be rolling out a new Clover device called the Compact. In the second-half of the year, we expect to begin offering additional software solutions for the professional services vertical. Third, out progress in international markets continues to differentiate Pfizer. Demand for Clover is strong in Germany and leads our building from Albert Joint Venture with Deutsche Bank. In the Netherlands, where we acquired the remaining portion of the joint venture from our bank partner last year, we are seeing pent-up demand for Clover. In Argentina, we are having success adding merchants to Clover as we prepare to launch it in Brazil and Mexico in the second-half of the year. In Asia-Pac, we continue to build on our high-end hospitality market leadership, signing the Grand Hyatt in Q1 to reach over 25 five-star properties in Singapore and Malaysia. We continue to ramp up distribution as we prepare for the Clover launch in the APAC region. We already have over 50 ISO and PayFac partners, and we onboarded more partners in Q1, including KPay, which added 20,000 merchants onto our platform. We continued to expect a full-featured Clover launch in Australia, Singapore, and Hong Kong in 2025. Fourth, our value-added solutions penetration continues to rise. In Q1, Clover VAS penetration reached 20% on growth in Clover SaaS, Clover Capital, and Rapid Deposit. In the enterprise business, we are seeing a newer VAS opportunity emerge with our SnapPay product, a B2B payments offering for mid-market merchants that integrate seamlessly with popular ERP solutions. After over 20% revenue growth in 2023, SnapPay is poised for continued strength this year. Covanta Energy signed up for SnapPay in Q1, and we had an additional government win with the State of Texas to digitize revenue collection activity. We also entered into our first major reseller agreement for SnapPay, opening the opportunity to reach even more mid-market clients. Fifth and finally, we continue to add new merchant relationships across the SMB and enterprise markets. Building on the success we saw in 2023, Clover Sport added over 20 new venues, putting 1,000s of new Clover devices in the market. Venues include stadiums that are home to teams in the MLB, NFL, and NTAA, as well as amphitheaters, golf courses, and large-scale festivals. In our enterprise business, we address a wide breadth of industries and a growing presence in new markets, such as social gaming, which is a $10 billion opportunity by volume and growing around 20%. We signed three more clients in this space in Q1 and now serve 13 social gaming merchants, including three of the top five. We are seeing good uptake of Commerce Hub, our single orchestration layer that allows enterprise clients to operate a unified omnichannel platform. In Q1, our Commerce Hub client count surpassed 200. These five are just some of the ways we plan to achieve the targets we've set for 2026. Turning to the financial solutions segment, demand for modernization and innovation is on full display. We posted four Finxact wins for new and traditional use cases in Q1. Although we do not expect the revenue contribution to be significant in 2024, this progress reinforces Finxact's capability and flexibility as a cloud-based core banking and embedded finance platform. Let's take a deeper look at all four. First, Finxact will be the core platform for a new U.S.-based digital bank from Banco Inter Brazil, a current Fiserv client. Second, Finxact won a deal with the FinTech program manager that helps businesses access the payments ecosystem. This client decided to upgrade to Finxact and consolidate volumes on the platform. Third, Finxact signed a current Fiserv SMB solutions aggregator client as they build embedded finance for their merchant clients. This opportunity ties deeper into Fiserv as we will be working without financial institution clients to find sponsors of these lending services. Fourth and finally, Finxact won a deal to become the core account processor for a major U.S. government agency as part of the client's much larger modernization plan, which will pull in other parts of our business. It's clear that Finxact is demonstrating its capability across the broader financial services landscape. And we're encouraged by its growing pipeline today and the bigger opportunity it can bring to Fiserv over time. Turning to credit issuing, we partnered with Robinhood as it launches its gold card program following the acquisition of X1, which is built on Fiserv Credit Processing. We also extend our relationship with Kuwait Finance House on the back of its acquisition of Ali United Bank and will be migrating that card portfolio onto our platform. These are two more examples of how financial institution M&A is presenting more opportunities and risk as our technology leadership grows clearer. Lastly, in Digital Payment Solutions, demand among our core account clients and other financial institutions remains strong. One of the fastest growing examples of this is Zelle, the largest B2B payment platform where we remain the leading third-party systems integrator and recorded 45% transaction growth in Q1. A second example that's still emerging is FedNow and RTP, where we sign more than 500 financial institutions to provide access to these real-time realms. And perhaps our biggest medium to long-term opportunity is cash flow central, our small business accounts payable, accounts receivable solution that we are currently marketing to banks as resellers. The product will be available this summer and we've already sold it to four large banks including U.S. Bank announced in February and this month Bolton Bank and Citizens Bank. You should also expect to see cash flow central distributed through Clover later this year. The product is off to a great start and we are encouraged by what we are seeing. And now let me turn the call over to Bob to walk you through the financials in more detail. Thanks, Bob. Last week we published our fourth corporate social responsibility report. In it, we highlight the ways we execute on our four strategic pillars: empower people, advance communities and society; champion responsible business practices; and invest in sustainable systems. In summary, we believe that doing good is good for business. We are committed to diverse representation at all levels of the organization, including leadership positions. We continue to engage with communities where we live and work, including small businesses and minority depository institutions. We recognize the importance of strong governance as part of our overall strategy, and we continue to invest in sustainability. For the first time, our CSR report includes a greenhouse gas reduction goal. Later this year, we will be celebrating two important milestones for Fiserv. Our 40th year in business and our 5th year since merging with First Data. On these occasions, you naturally reflect on what it means to come of a certain age. For Fiserv 40-years old means proven, resilient, and experienced to deliver on our commitments, and we've done just that. It also means scaled, savvy and well capitalized to sustain strong top and bottom line growth. We are doing that as well. But when you consider the significant change created by the merger, we're also a lot like a young five-year-old company. Five means a fresh foundation to support investment. We have used our cash to invest in products, services, and people and that's driving higher growth. Five also means a longer term opportunity ahead, fueled by innovation, and therefore we see continued strong further top and bottom line growth at Pfizer. The proven strength of 40 combined with the opportunistic growth of five puts Pfizer in a distinguished position to both lead and drive innovation. And that's exactly what we're doing. All of this is possible because of our over 40,000 employees. I would like to thank them for what they do for our clients, shareholders, and each other. Thank you for your time today. And now, operator, please open the line for questions. Yes, hey, thanks David. You know, we've been focused on all of those for quite some time, and we treat unveiling new product, new initiatives, new market, while continuing to, you know, draw on the embedded business we have generating new merchants, right? So, you know, our basic philosophy is increase the number of merchants we have, be able to deliver more products to merchants, and then go into the areas that we haven't been before. So we feel very, very good about what we laid out a couple of years ago and what we talked about in November. You can see the traction here, which is kind of above what the CAGR needed to be, but you should expect us to be all cylinders on Clover, as we have a bunch of other parts about company also, I would have to say. Thank you. Yes, and I'd just add, you know, when we think about running this company, our investment in technology is really around new product development, improved service, and the ability to deliver the next dollar of revenue at a better incremental cost by investing in productivity. So that will be for the rest of our lives. An AI and those type of items just allow us to do more of it. We're at the tip of that, but you know we can see our way very clearly this year. Q - Tien-Tsin Huang Nice color. Thank you. Thank you. Hey Bob take the first part, I'll take the second. And just to be clear on clarity, a small tracking, a small growth, I want it. And I put it in the non-discretionary buckets. If you're thinking about where it occurred. Obviously, that's, you know, an early indicator. It's not necessarily, you know, how the whole quarter is going to play, but we always feel committed to be able to talk to you about what we see, you know, the vast amount of volume we have going throughout the -- both in the U.S. and around the world, and I consider it a small increase. Yes, the way -- great question. The way we think about, Pay Easy, it was a processing system that were retired and then built out both commerce hub and brought some of that volume, which already existed through Clover to the future new merchants. That was completed, migrated, multi-year project that we built out in a way that allowed us to build out Commerce Hub, that allowed us to deliver VAS into Commerce Hub and also have Pay Easy operating within our SMB base. So I feel great about closing the books on that from a conversion standpoint. And we're seeing on the enterprise side, you heard us talk about 200 Commerce Hub users and a strategic platform for us going forward. Well, you know, I don't know about urgency on sellers' parts as much as valuation and understanding what real valuations are. Now, we have a really great model, which we talked about our ability to generate cash flow, investing in our business, and the ability to deploy capital. I think we've done a very, very good job in the assets we've acquired, integrated, and grown. And so I'd say our appetite to acquire properties is always high. I mean, we're always trafficking. I think on the other hand, you know, we want to be very, very, very clear that it fits within our strategy, which I think is holding tight. It's within our structure and the ability to distribute the product to our vast client base both on the merchant side and on the FI side. You know, so, you know, I like to believe that we're always engaged and working and thinking through it. And we're highly selective to make sure we're using our shareholders' dollars as appropriately as possible. And I think we've got a pretty darn good track record in that so far. Well, I think it's a -- we have not articulated goals around them, but they're clearly embedded in our guide and the things we think about our growth rates, right? I think what we think about, even at a more broader standpoint, is what those are, right? And you could go across the board from our fraud integration products like advanced defense to how even we bring in cash flow central. You heard us talk about that and that really hangs both in the SMB space through our own distribution and then, you know, obviously attached to a banking product. I think, you know, over time we probably should come back with a better clarity around some of it. Having said that, we've been selling value-added services to our clients, we've sold a gift product into our enterprise for a long time. We've sold different forms of data and information to them. So I think really the way we look at it at the large macro level in the enterprise is really that you can go back to the circle that we used to have about, we're going to sell a core, but really all the revenue comes when growth comes from debit, credit, right? Digital, and in their own right, those are value-added services hanging off the core. The same is true in our enterprise business and merchant. So I think in reality, when you look at how we report, we are reporting, you know, our economics and some of those actually value-added services and business lines also. So, you know, I'll go think about it a little more, but I think, you know, it's encompassed in the economics and how we show our business lines. Good. So why don't I start with how are we going to government, how are we going to market in government? We've been focused on government as a very large vertical calling and that is everywhere from state and local to federal. And so we have a team and their sole job is government, right? And the traffic in the transactions, you've even been hurt. And you know, our thought was always, it transcends the org. That's why we have dedicated client sales force to it because, you know, at times we have opportunities to bid on merchant acquiring. At times you heard us talk about delivering FinXact. You know, the government is we called out the $0.5 because it demonstrated where we started, which was very, very small to the growth, but it transcends both segments. And on any given day, almost any one of our products can play in the government space, right? You know, so I don't know if that answers your question, but I think about it as dedicated coverage model, right? Transcending the businesses, and it can be anywhere from our core Finxact, which we just delivered to money network to merchant acquiring and we really love this segment, vertical, however you want to think about it. And we have a great, great team that knows how to cover government, and we've been very fortunate in that win. Well, I try to be as clear as possible on this, Clover covers the whole SMB market and expands a little further, because you've heard about the 1,000s of Clovers we delivered in the quarter to venues, right? You know, it's a 30% grower today. We have talked very hard and have worked to do to finish the swing on restaurant, but feel very, very clear about our ability there. You know, you'll see us go deeper in professional services and in retail. Remember, it's a horizontal platform that we brought vertical expertise to. And then, you know, we have great demand outside the U.S., as you heard us talk about, along with the ability to continue to distribute through our channels like more in our ISV channel. So I think it spans the landscape of SMB. Obviously, our growth, which is through new business acquisition, has demonstrated at the 30% mark. And, you know, it's an open platform that we continue to add more software to. And so when you put that all together and where we started with, I like to remind us inside the house and outside the house that we were seven engineers and three patents and now you know we have more than a 1,000 software engineers across the world operating on it [Technical Difficulty] so we're going to complete rolling and so commensal across the world. Good. And I'd like to thank everyone for their attention today. Please reach out to our IR team with any further questions, and have a great day. Thank you."

            "name": "Bob Hau",
            "content": "Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. If you're following along on our slides, I'll cover additional detail on total company and segment performance, starting with our financial metrics and trends on slide four. First quarter performance demonstrated our ability to deliver top line growth and continue to drive margin expansion. First quarter total company adjusted revenue grew 7% to $4.5 billion and adjusted operating income grew 13% to $1.6 billion, resulting in adjusted operating margin of 35.8%, an increase of 180 basis points versus the prior year. As a reminder, our adjusted revenue was recast as part of our realign segment reporting. And if you haven't already, I encourage you to review our 8-K filing from March 26 for historical comparisons. The recast numbers include a small change to our adjusted revenue in the prior years to account for all pass-through postage. In our prior reporting, we adjusted the postage pass-through revenue only from our output business, which represents the significant majority of our postage activity. We are now adjusting out the non-output pass-through postage revenue as well. The change slightly lowered our adjusted revenue for the recast prior periods and better aligns with our internal reporting. On an organic basis, revenue grew 20% in the quarter, with particular ongoing strength in Merchant Solutions organic revenue, which was up 36%, and steady growth of 5% in financial solutions organic revenue. First quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 19% to $1.88, compared to $1.58 in the prior year. Our adjusted earnings per share in Q1 grew well above the 14$% to 16% growth level anticipated for the full-year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $454 million. While this number is lower than normally seen in the quarter, it is in line with our expectations given the timing of payments for the green tax credit program. This timing is consistent with what we described during last quarter's earnings call, and we expect this cash flow headwind to become a tailwind in the second-half of this year when we apply the credit to lower our second-half cash tax payments. We continue to expect to generate $4.5 billion in free cash flow for the year. Turning to performance by segment. Starting on slide five, organic revenue growth in the Merchant Solution Segment was 36% in the quarter. This includes a 15-point benefit from excess revenue driven by above average interest and inflation in Argentina. Without this transitory benefit, organic growth would have been 21%. On slide six, we've added a summary of the impact of excess Argentine inflation and interest on total Fiserv and Merchant Segment revenue, and the offsetting headwind from currency devaluation, which impacts adjusted revenue. Adjusted revenue growth for Merchant Solutions was 13% in the quarter. It includes a 23 percentage point currency headwind largely from the Argentine peso and the impact of the devaluation in late December last year. Unlike in 2023, the currency headwind in Q1 \u201824 was much higher than the inflation and interest tailwind. If interest and inflation fall back to normal levels, which we expect to happen in the medium term. We anticipate the headwind from foreign currency exchange would ease as well. Moving to the business lines, small business organic revenue growth and adjusted revenue growth was 45% and 16% respectively. Small business volume growth was 8%. As I mentioned, over the last few quarters, revenue from the excess inflation interest in Argentina is boosting organic growth, while the currency devaluation is a headwind to adjusted revenue. Clover revenue grew 30% in the first quarter and annualized payment volume growth of 19%. The spread between revenue and volume growth reflects a higher penetration of value-added solutions, continued channel mix shift, and some pricing. Vast penetration reached 20% in Q1, up from 19% in Q4, and on pace to meet our 27% target by 2026. The increase was driven by revenue from Clover Capital, Rapid Deposit, and our basic Clover SaaS plans. Clover Capital is our short-term working capital advance program. Rapid deposit allows merchants to access money from daily car sales instantly for a fee. And while there are several standard Clover SaaS plans, the basic package includes virtual terminal, e-commerce products, developer tools, invoicing, and transaction reports. These are just some examples of the value-added solutions available with Clover. Enterprise organic and adjusted revenue growth was 29% and 6% respectively, driven by transactions growth of 12% and higher vast penetration. As in small business, organic growth includes some transitory benefit from excess inflation and interest in Argentina, but was also impacted by the inclusion of three lower growth products as part of the shift in our business segmentation to start this year. Finally, processing organic and adjusted revenue grew by 9% and 10%, respectively. As mentioned in the past, processing represents the back-end processing we do for our partners where they own the merchant relationship. The increase this quarter was driven by a termination fee from an existing client, who canceled a planned expansion into new geographies. This will not impact ongoing revenue in established geographies where our relationship with this client remains strong. Excluding periodic revenue, processing revenue declined 2% in the quarter. This business line has no revenue from Argentina. Overall, we continue to anticipate processing adjusted revenue to be roughly flat over the medium term. Adjusted operating income in the Merchant Solution Segment increased 30% to $769 million in the quarter with adjusted operating margin of 440 basis points to 34.1%. In accordance with GAAP, interest expense from anticipation revenue is recorded below the operating income line. If the interest costs from anticipation were included in operating income, Merchant adjusted operating margins would have still expanded a very strong 390 basis points for the quarter. Turning to slide seven, on the Financial Solutions Segment, organic revenue grew 5% in the quarter, which is in line with our full-year outlook of 5% to 7%. Looking at the business lines, digital payments, organic and adjusted revenue each grew by 5%. Dell transactions and number of clients continue to grow at a healthy clip at 45% and 20% respectively. And we continue to see strong demand from clients for FedNow and RTP integration. Issuing organic and adjusted revenue grew 8% and 3% respectively, driven by several factors, including the launch of money network cards to unemployment and disability benefit recipients under the California Employment Development Department Program. Banking organic and adjusted revenue declined 1% and 3%, respectively. Excluding periodic license and termination fee revenue, banking organic revenue grew 2%. First quarter adjusted operating income for the financial solution segment was up 6% to $1 billion, and adjusted operating margin was up 160 basis points to 44.1%, driven by operating leverage from scaled revenue growth and cost efficiency. As we highlighted at our Investor Conference in November, the cross Fiserv activity between our two segments is particularly powerful, because following the success of the Fiserv first data merger, we are the only single provider of merchant, Bank IT, and payments functionality. Let me share three examples where we've had important cross-Fiserv wins in Q1. In our debit networks, STAR and Accel, we have five merchant wins in the quarter, including ConocoPhillips, a traditional merchant, along with a social media company and a PayFac, both of which will be able to benefit from more choice under Reg II. Traditional and online merchants are using our debit networks to efficiently route card transactions at the point of sale. These wins drive revenue in our digital payments business line and often go hand in hand with merchant acquiring wins and other value-added solution sales that only Fiserv offers. A second example can be found in open banking, where we provide our data solutions to facilitators such as Plaid and MasterCard Open Banking as a single API into the open banking data of our financial institution clients. In Q1, we signed a data access agreement with Visa Open Banking Solutions acquired through Tink as they entered the U.S. The data is typically used by clients of these organizations to verify bank accounts for payments and transfers, underwrite loans, and facilitate financial wellness and planning, and by merchants to facilitate pay-by-bank transactions as just a few examples. Third, over the past year, we have announced a number of wins in the government sector, and we're excited about our continued momentum in this large vertical across our merchant and financial segments. Revenue from government clients recently surpassed $500 million. Now, let me wrap up with some remaining details on the financials. The corporate adjusted operating loss was $148 billion in the quarter, largely in line with our expectations. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 18.2%. The Q1 tax rate is traditionally below the full-year rate, and we continue to expect the 2024 adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 20% for the full-year. Total debt outstanding was $24.4 billion on March 31. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio slightly increased to 2.8 times within our targeted leverage range. And we have approximately 7% of our debt in variable rate instruments. During the quarter, we repurchased 10.2 million shares for $1.5 billion, bringing our total cash return to shareholders for the last 12 months to $4.7 billion. We had 42 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase at the end of the quarter. Our long-standing capital allocation strategy will continue in 2024, defined by a strong balance sheet, share repurchases, and complementary and innovative acquisitions. As Frank said earlier, we continue to expect organic revenue growth of 15% to 17% for the full year. One quarter into the year, we are maintaining our 2024 organic revenue growth rate outlook. While the interest in inflation tailwind from Argentina eased faster than we expected, further moves in the balance of the year remain unclear, while our overall business remains strong. For the full-year, we now expect adjusted operating margin expansion to be more than 125 basis points, up from our previous outlook of at least 100 basis points. This translates to adjusted earnings per share of $8.60 to $8.75, a $0.05 increase in our outlook at the midpoint, which is 14% to 16% growth over 2023. This performance for 2024 would represent our 39th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. With that, let me turn the call back to Frank for some closing remarks. Yes, Tien-Tsin, it's Bob, good morning. I think overall the 25 basis points that you're describing our full-year outlook, moving from previously at least 100 basis points, margin expansion to now more than 125 is really driven by continued volume leverage, strong growth in the overall company, as well as continued progress on productivity. The termination fee in the processing is relatively small in the grand scheme. Obviously, it matters a bit in the processing line for this quarter, but in terms of the overall company's margin improvement, it really is continued volume leverage and a focus on productivity. Yes, David, good morning. On the Reg II, I'd say that there's still probably more opportunity ahead than what we've seen. It remains to truly be seeing what that means. We're seeing good uptick in our network business, whether that's really driven by Reg II or just continued progress in our debit business, I think it's just more continued progress. In terms of a slowdown, I wouldn't read anything into it other than quarterly fluctuations and a tough comp against Q1 prior year. Non-Argentina, non-Clover. I'll have to pull up my Venn diagrams here. You know, obviously tongue in cheek there. Bottom line is we're seeing good growth, obviously, across the entire SMB business. That small business certainly has good growth from Clover, and you saw the 30% growth in Clover. We continue to see real opportunity there. On the non-Clover side, there's certainly impact from Argentina. There's a small piece of Clover Argentina there, but the 30% growth is really heavily driven by the United States growth there. On the overall segments, you heard us talk in the prepared remarks about the Argentine impact from organic growth. We continue to see that easing later into the year. It was a bit lower than what we expected in the first quarter, i.e., inflation and interest eased a little bit faster than we anticipated. In previous, in the last earnings call, we indicated we expect about a 14% impact from Argentina for the full-year in the merchant business. Q1 came in a little bit above that. We expect that to ease into later part of the year. That certainly impacts the non-Clover business. But overall, non-Clover is growing quite well. And we continue to see opportunity. It's not just about adding Clover in small businesses. It's supporting them wherever they want to take merchant acquiring solutions. The other thing I would add, and it's an impact to the first quarter that we expect to ease into the balance of the year, is in Q1, we saw the benefit of a better-than-expected lift on the use of foreign-based currency credit cards in Argentina. This is some people may have heard the term dollar turista. The Argentine government has a program sponsored by the Central Bank to encourage foreign currency denominated credit cards. And we saw that pick up in the first quarter. That is a program that the Argentine government has at their discretion to help the economy. Obviously, they're seeing the economy improve. So I would certainly not anticipate a 45% small business organic growth into the future. And we're seeing some of that kind of transitory impact this quarter. So, a number of elements to that question. First, in order to achieve the $4.5 billion goal that we set out ahead by 2026, we need kind of a very high 20% call it 28% total Clover revenue growth. As part of that goal, we've indicated we expect VAS to achieve 27% penetration from the current quarter Q1 at 20%. So certainly a big part of it is additional VAS. And we've talked about this in the past, the secret recipe to growing Clover to $4.5 billion is actually not so secret. It's get new merchants, sell more stuff to those merchants, and grow with those merchants, and that's exactly what we see. To your point, in the current quarter, there was a big part of the overall revenue left. Certainly, the delta between revenue and volume was driven by VAS. We kind of gave the sequence in order of importance, and I think that will continue as we progress over the next couple of years as we march towards that $4.5 billion, VAS will be a big part of it. This is always priced depending on what's going on with inflation, what's going on in the market, but that's probably the third of the three important factors. Thank you. Yes, so the first part of your question is, in our prepared remarks, we gave a small business volume growth at 8% and enterprise transactions growth at 12%. Given the way we're reporting now for that Merchant Solution Segment and the three business lines. We felt that the volume for small business is the driver of revenue, and for transactions, it's enterprise. Transaction activity in small business is not a revenue driver and volume for enterprise is not a revenue driver. So we thought providing the key metrics that really are driving the business was important. Ramsey, I think I'll carry your analogy one step further in terms of the question on appetite. If appetite's good, it's strong appetite, but we're not hungry. So, you know, you go to the shopping mall or to the grocery store, when you're hungry you buy a lot of stuff. You get home and you realize you didn't need all that stuff. We're certainly seeing a lot of activity, but we're not hungry. And while we have tremendous capacity on our balance sheet and could do deals, we're making sure that what we see is of good value and brings value to our shareholders before we go ahead and strike on it. Thanks, Ramsey."
