At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nKathleen Quirk: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan fourth quarter conference call. Earlier this morning, we reported our fourth quarter and full-year 2020 operating and financial results, and a copy of today's press release and our slides are available on our website at fcx.com. Our call today is being broadcast live on the Internet and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website Homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on this call will include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described on our SEC filings. On the call today are, Richard Adkerson. We also have a number of our senior team with us today. Mark Johnson is here, Josh Olmsted, Mike Kendrick, Rick Coleman, and Steve Higgins. I'll start by briefly summarizing the results for the quarter, and then, we'll turn the call over to Richard, who will be reviewing our outlook. After our prepared remarks, we'll be taking questions. Today, FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of $708 million, or $0.48 per share in the fourth quarter and $599 million, or $0.41 per share for the year ended 2020. We had a number of special items in the fourth quarter, which are detailed on Roman numeral VII of our press release, those totaled net credits $142 million, or $0.10 a share, mainly associated with the gain on the sale of assets and partly offset by charges for litigation settlement and international tax matters. Our adjusted net income attributable to common stock after these items totaled $566 million, or $0.39 per share for the fourth quarter of 2020. Our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or EBITDA, for the fourth quarter approximated $1.9 billion and we generated $4.2 billion of adjusted EBITDA for the year 2020. A reconciliation of our EBITDA is available on Page 38 of the slide materials. We had a very strong fourth quarter. Our sales volumes of copper of 866 million pounds were 3% above our October 2020 estimate, and our gold sales of 293,000 ounces were 9% higher than our October 2020 guidance. These primarily reflected higher copper sales from Cerro Verde and in Indonesia and higher gold ore grades in Indonesia. We benefited during the quarter from improved pricing for both copper and gold. The realized price of copper was $3.40 per pound in the fourth quarter, and that was 24% above the year-ago quarterly average. Fourth quarter gold realized price was $1,870 per ounce, and that was about 25% above the year-ago average. Our unit net cash cost came in at an average of $1.28 per pound of copper and that was lower than what we had guided to in October. Notably, in the fourth quarter, we generated very strong cash flows, which totaled $1.3 billion in the quarter and that exceeded our capital spending of just under $400 million during the period. We were - together with our asset sale proceeds in the fourth quarter, we were successful in reducing our net debt by about $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter alone. And we ended the year with net debt approximating $6.1 billion. We had no borrowings under our revolving credit facility, consolidated cash of $3.7 billion and we are in a strong position as we look forward to generating increasing cash flows as we go forward. I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to our slide materials that you can reference on our website.\nRichard Adkerson: Good morning, and thank you all for participating in today's call. It's great to be able to talk to you today about our performance in 2020 and our positive outlook. It's been a head-spinning year when we think back to March and April, and all of the challenges we were facing at that point and the world was facing to have - be at this point is really head-spinning in many ways and remarkable, but it's been quite a year for Freeport. I really hope you and your families and colleagues are staying safe and well. We've all made personal sacrifices. It's been a tough year for us at Freeport, the progress our company has made has really been a godsend as we've all been working in ways that are so different than in past. We remain focused on working to protect our health and safety of our people. We're supporting the communities where we operate during this crisis and we are really encouraged by the scientific advances with therapeutics and now that vaccines are finally being distributed. But we know all this is going to take time to have the distribution widely placed and we're all looking forward to returning to normal lives. But for the time being, we are staying diligent with our protocols and these have really proven to be so effective for us at Freeport. I'm immensely proud of our Freeport team for their response to the COVID challenge, navigating through a pandemic like this that none of us of ever seen, and was this degree of duration has been difficult for everyone and all the communities around us. Our team has demonstrated real resilience, confidence and drive throughout all of this, come together to address the situation proactively, while we've maintained focus on continuing to protect and enhance our business and that's worked for the benefit of all stakeholders. On Slide 3, we show the highlights for 2020, a year of extraordinary accomplishment for Freeport. We laid a strong foundation for future growth in cash flows and profitability, which is exactly what we set out to do and had a strategy to do. And to have been able to achieve what we did in the face of COVID, is nothing short of remarkable. Earlier in 2020, we announced in April, we moved quickly to develop new operating protocols to maintain our business' continuity. We totally redesigned our operating plans from what we had announced this time a year ago to safeguard our business, protect our liquidity, and to be responsive to the really heightened uncertainty that we were facing and everyone was facing. At Freeport, all hands were on deck to build an optimal plan. Each of our operating teams around the globe played an important role in developing and then executing these aggressive plans. We just had a tremendous end by everyone and that enabled us to execute the plan so well. Big positive from this process that our team's collaboration, which has always been a strength of our organization is now more strong than it's ever been. Employment engagement, commitment, energy, and morale are at very high level. We effectively executed the revised plans, had a big focus on cost and capital management, and then, significantly, we advanced the largest block caving operation in the world at our Grasberg mine in Indonesia. You will see we met our key milestones for this massive multi-year, multi-billion dollar undertaking. At the same time, we also completed on time and on budget the Lone Star project in Arizona, and this is a potential future keystone asset for our Company. The progress we made this year set the foundation for strong cash flows literally for years to come. We turned the corner during 2020 to begin generating sustainable and substantial free cash flow. Beginning in the third quarter of 2020 and now continuing in the fourth quarter and as we look forward, we've generated and are generating significant free cash flow and that enabled us to reduce our net debt by $2.4 billion in the second half of the year. Slide 4 highlights key financial metrics by comparing our actual results for 2020 with the plan we presented to you last January prior to the onset of the pandemic. So this is not the revised April plan, but the one that we had before we knew what we were facing. In that comparison, our unit net cash costs for 2020 were 15% lower than the January 2020 guidance. EBITDA and operating cash flow improved by over 25%, capital spending was reduced by 29%. We also generated approximately $550 million in after-tax proceeds from the sale of non-cash flow producing assets that we disposed of this year. We ended the year with $2.7 billion lower debt than our original January plan. Think about that. Facing COVID, with all the uncertainties, having to make the changes, and then, coming back to do so much better than we set out to do before COVID was known about. This was accomplished in an average copper price realization of $2.95 for the year, to $0.10 per pound, well below the current price, the team did an outstanding job. We're strongly positioned for the future. In addition to the strong operating and financial performance in 2020, we achieved new milestones in the ESG area and that's shown on Slide 5. We committed to the Copper Mark. This is a new assurance framework developed by the International Copper Association and our Steve Higgins is now the President of ICA to promote and demonstrate responsible production practices focusing on meeting the United Nations' sustainability development goals. Big step forward. We established climate targets and added transparency with a new Climate Report, which is now available on our website. We took a leading role with ICMM, International Council of Metals and Mining, beginning over a year ago when it served as the industry representative in a multi-stakeholder initiative to develop a new tailing standard for the mining industry following the disasters in Brazil and then the subsequent development of implementation guidance for ICMM members. This was a major undertaking by the industry and by our Company, which took a lead in the process, and it reflects the importance of managing tailings storage facilities safely and responsibly. After serving two terms as Chairman of ICMM more than 10 years ago, I recently accepted a new term as Chairman. ICMM currently has 27 CEO Council Members from the largest global mining and metals companies, and I'm leading a strategic review of the organization to meet the increasing importance of ESG issues facing our industry. We advanced our inclusion and diversity initiatives which is core to our values at Freeport. We invest in our communities and continued to expand organizational resources in this effort. Workers' safety is our highest priority and we show that with what we did in response to COVID. Our safety statistics in 2020 measured by incidence rates met our targets. Fatality position continues to be a focus of our work safety management and regrettably, we had five fatalities in our operations last year. On Slide 6, you've heard me say for a long time that the copper price would benefit from its favorable fundamental outlook. Prices rose significantly in late 2020 in recognition of copper's favorable demand trends and the limited ability of the industry to increase supply. The recent price move is significant, but note that prices are still lower than they were just over 10 years ago or almost 10 years ago. Arguably, the fundamental outlook for copper today is better than it was 10 years ago. China is leading the recovery and global stimulus measures in countries around the world are also being positive for growth in copper demand. Freeport is a leading producer of copper and this commodity is critical to the economy of the future. It's essential to support global growth and broad scaled economic activity, but it is also essential and strategic for technologies required for the transition to a global, cleaner energy future that's on the front burner for everyone. More and more, we're seeing adoption of policies to reduce carbon emissions around the globe. 70% of the world's copper supply is used to deliver electricity. As clean energy initiatives are implemented, the intensity of copper use will increase. The chart on Slide 7 shows that copper utilization in electric vehicles and in the generation of renewable power is more than 4 times greater per unit than for our traditional vehicles and power generation. CRU estimates that copper demand for electrification and renewables will increase significantly over the coming years. In a relatively short timeframe, global demand just from these green initiatives could approximate the size of today's U.S. copper market. As demand accelerates, copper supply will continue to struggle to keep up and this supports the favorable near-term and long term fundamental outlook. As current situation echoes the early 2000s, when I became CEO of Freeport at a time when Chinese demand appeared and accelerate in such a dramatic fashion without a supply response, which created the commodity super cycle and sharp increases in copper prices very similar to what we're facing today. Turning to Indonesia on slide 8, our PTFI team is delivering really impressive results. During 2020, we built the momentum for the ramp up of our massive underground mines and by the fourth quarter, we had reached nearly 70% of the targeted annual run rates for sales volumes. This is something we were looking forward to beginning in the mid-1990s when we designed the original pit, which is now completed, and it's something that we've been investing in over the past 15 years. And to see it coming together like it is, is truly gratifying. And Mark Johnson and his team have just done an exceptional job. Continued growth during 2021 is expected to enable us to reach our full annualized targets by the end of this year. Considering the operating health challenges we faced in Papua, this is notable and striking. The team stayed on schedule, met our objectives, the project is massive and complex, and we did this by designing and maintaining effective COVID protocols for a very large workplace in a very challenging remote location. Our progress with the ramp-up has reduced risk for PTFI's underground mines significantly. The major risk as we started this was developing the infrastructure. Infrastructure is in place. There is always risk in mining. It's inherent in our business, but the major risks for this underground development are behind us and we are confident and have a track record of managing the types of risk we will be facing going forward. We can't make them go away, but we can manage them. And so we're really pleased with where we stand with that process. We are also continuing discussions currently regarding the new smelter in Indonesia. In early 2020, requested a delay in the agreed time schedule for completing of construction of the new smelter at a site in Eastern Java near Gresik, which is near the existing PT smelting facility. We haven't been able to progress work there because of COVID issues for the local workforce and international contracts. This is a greenfield smelter with a total cost of about $3 billion. That number continues to be refined and changed, and this project would be debt-financed but PTFI, the Indonesian entity. Over the last several months, PTFI and our partner and majority shareholder of PTFI, the Indonesian state-owned company MIND ID have been discussing with the government alternatives to this commitment to build a new smelter which was reflected in our IUPK mining license granted in December 2018. During the fourth quarter, we advanced discussions within the majority owner of the existing PT smelting facility at Gresik for a 30% expansion to add smelting capacity in Indonesia and partially satisfy our commitment to the government. Commercial and financing discussions with these expansions are being advanced, engineering is in progress. Initial estimates indicate that this project could be done for $250 million and be done efficiently in the current TCRC environment and it would partially meet our obligation to the government. Then separately, at the request of the government, PTFI is currently engaged in discussion with a third-party regarding the potential for the development of a new greenfield smelter at an alternate location away from Eastern Java. This project would be in lieu of PTFI's constructing the new greenfield smelter that I mentioned above. A third-party would lead the development for the smelter and arrange its financing. PTFI would commit to be a supplier of concentrate for the project, and the partners and the government are working expeditiously to reach a decision on the path forward. On Slide 10, we show our 2021 priorities for our ongoing efforts in creating values for our Company. We are building on the progress of 2020 by focusing on execution of plans to grow production volumes, manage costs, and capital spending efficiently. We're expanding our recent innovation efforts, supplying technology and innovative management processes in our operations around the world, and all of this, while we manage and are sensitive to our responsibilities to workers, communities, governments and other stakeholders. We look forward to resuming cash returns to shareholders during 2021. And we will be in a position to do that and we will be in discussions with our Board on taking actions. We will be in a period now for the long-term of harvesting cash flows now that we are completing the major long-term investment program in Indonesia. We are discussing with the Board a financial policy that would now enable a near-term resumption of the dividend and then, over time, a performance-based shareholder return policy. Significantly, we have recommenced work we suspended early in 2020 to evaluate and advance future organic growth opportunities from our large portfolio of undeveloped reserves and mineral resources. We look forward to doing that. The efforts of 2020 and work of our team over many years now, has enabled us to increase margins and cash flow substantially for 2021 and beyond. At $3.50 copper, we are on a path to nearly double EBITDA from 2020 levels. Copper sales for 2021 are projected to increase 20% over 2020. Gold volumes are projected to increase by over 50%, our unit net cash cost of production will decline. And this is occurring at a time of improved pricing for copper. I recall in an earlier conference call like this I said, an ideal situation for Freeport would be able to be completing the Grasberg expansion at the time of good copper prices. And here we are. The significantly higher cash flows will enable us to maintain a strong balance sheet, build value in our business. Returns substantial cash flows to shareholders. As shown on Slide 12, we have a long line portfolio of mineral reserves, reserve life for our proved and probable reserves of over 30 years. We have substantial options for the potential to expand our reserve base from our large inventory of mineral resources beyond reported reserves, all of this is associated with brownfield expansions of our existing ore bodies. What this means is that for our Company, to have long-term success, we are not required to have success in exploration. We hope we do. We're not required to do deals. Strategic opportunities may come to us, but we've got this base already in our portfolio that provides for a sustainable long-term future for Freeport. Slide 13 highlights the organic projects we are now assessing. During 2020, to conserve cash, we paused work on our expansion projects. We're now reengaged. Broad range of opportunities. During 2021, we will be developing a ranking of these projects to guide our thinking on sequencing and long-term planning. We have no plans to increase substantially capital spending on projects in the near term, but in the long-term, these growth opportunities will be approached in a measured and disciplined way. I'll close with Slide 14, which I have titled the Freeport Edge, which is a term we're using internally around our Company. Our management team at Freeport has extensive experience in managing this business. The leadership teams across the Company are seasoned, value-oriented, and intensely engaged. We have a management structure that is collaborative and experienced in working together and we're decisive, make a decision we execute. We recognize our responsibilities we undertake when we are granted harder and licensed to operate and we never cut corners on important issues. Looking at our team at Freeport, it's a combination of management with long tenure and experience. We also have a cadre of younger managers who bring new ideas, approaches and energies. We have strategic new hires, who bring outside perspectives. We've had three senior executives who've retired at the end of their careers over the last two years. Internal replacements were promoted and are performing effectively. And this just demonstrates the depth of talent in our organization. Freeport is foremost in copper. Our portfolio of assets is large, high-quality, well-established industry leader, operate mines that are among the largest in the world. Our assets have long lives and durable with embedded options, reserve, resource growth. We have strong operating franchises in the United States, South America, and Indonesia. We're a reliable supplier to the global copper industry. We have industry-leading technical capabilities, supported by our strong track record of project execution and business management over many years. We have earned the trust and respect of our partners, our customers, suppliers, financial markets, and most importantly, our workers, communities and host countries where we operate. Our block caving experience is among the most extensive and long-standing in the history of the global mining industry. We've been operating block caves in Indonesia since the early 1980s. We have an important molybdenum block caving operation in Colorado. And this is critically important as we transition Grasberg to be termed the largest block caving operation in the world. I'll close before turning to your questions by thanking our people and recognizing their strength, resiliency, and performance. I'm proud to be part of this team and I look forward to continue to be part of the team and to participate in our future successes. We will build on our accomplishments. As will be depicted on our 2020 Annual Report to shareholders, we are charging ahead responsibly, reliably, and relentlessly. Thank you for your attention. And operator, let's open the lines for questions.\nKathleen Quirk: Richard, I'm just going to make a few comments, and then, we can take the questions. I'll be brief. Just continuing with the slide presentation on Slide 16, we provide some additional details on the quarter and our operating plans. We are continuing in the U.S. to ramp up production from the new Lone Star mine, and in January of this year, we commenced the restart of the Chino mine, which we had previously announced. In South America, we're continuing to operate Cerro Verde at a reduced rate of roughly 360,000 tons per day. We did a little more than that in the fourth quarter and our team is prepared to increase rates to a level of 400,000 tons, which is about where we were - tons per day, which is about where we were pre-COVID after the COVID restrictions are lifted. At El Abra, we've incorporated in our latest plans an increase in operating rates, which will provide additional volumes beginning in 2022. And as we've talked about, at Grasberg, we made excellent progress in the fourth quarter and are continuing to execute the ramp up plan to achieve the targeted metal run rates by the end of this year. Slide 17, we present the outlook for 2021. The guidance is largely in line with our previous estimates. We made some minor revisions to 2021 volumes. These were largely timing in nature to reflect the latest Grasberg mine plans. And we've updated our cost models to incorporate the current pricing for energy, currencies, and ongoing maintenance programs. We expect to sell just over 3.8 billion pounds of copper in 2021 at an average unit net cash cost of $1.25 per pound. At $3.50 copper, this will generate about $8 billion of EBITDA and $5.5 billion in operating cash flows for the year 2021, which is nearly double the 2020 levels. And as you'll see, we expect further growth in 2022 and 2023, which is shown on Slide 18, where we provide a three-year outlook for volumes. After stacking growth of nearly 20% in copper and over 50% for gold in 2021 versus 2020, we're projecting further growth of 13% in copper volumes and over 20% in gold volumes for the year 2022. And these projects have been in development for some time. Most of the capital is behind us, which gives us a runway here of generating growth in cash flows and margins. The build-up in volumes for 2021 is reflected on Slide 19. And on Slide 20, we show the significance of the cash flow generation using these volumes and our cost estimates, and we show a range of prices from $3.50 to $4 copper, holding gold flat at $1,850 per ounce and molybdenum at $9 per pound. But you can see that the growth in volumes at very low incremental cost results in EBITDA ranging from over $10 billion per annum on average for the years 2022 and 2023. So over $12 billion per year at $4 copper and operating cash flows, which are net of our taxes and interest costs, would range from $7 billion at $3.50 per pound of copper to over $8.5 billion at $4 copper. And as Richard was mentioning, $4 copper is still well below historical periods of demand strength. The cash flows generation are expected to be significantly above our planned capital spending, which will provide substantial free cash flows as we go forward. Slide 21 includes our projected capital of $2.3 billion in 2021. That excludes potential spending on the Indonesian smelter, which would be debt-financed and is still under evaluation. We are maintaining our basic capital plans. We have been very disciplined about capital spend. The 2021 capital is roughly, as you'll see, about $100 million higher than the previous forecast and that incorporates an acceleration of some mining equipment investments to provide capacity assurance for our plans. We are in a strong financial position, as you see. We've entered a period of exceptional free cash flow generation. The long-lived asset base and ongoing cost and capital management will provide the ability to continue to strengthen our balance sheet, provide cash returns to shareholders and build additional values in our asset base. Regarding financial policy, we're working with our Board on a shareholder return policy that would balance our priorities, while providing increasing returns to shareholders based on this performance. It's a very exciting time for Freeport. And we're staying very focused on continuing our momentum. And now, operator, we'd like to take questions.\nRichard Adkerson: Kathleen, apologize for not - comments. I wasn't trying to cut you out. Okay. Let's have some questions.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Emily Chieng with Goldman Sachs.\nEmily Chieng: Hi, guys. Congratulations on a great quarter here. The first question I had is just really around digging into some of the capital allocation strategy plans we had again. Are you able to provide any narrowed timing or key financial metrics and operational targets that you're looking for ahead of thinking about raising the dividend or around when we might see some movement on growth projects longer-term looks like 2021 is still very much a harvest year, but any kind of guidelines on that would be great? Thank you.\nRichard Adkerson: Okay. So with respect to the dividend, we're already there. We just \u2013 we have a - we'll have Board meetings early this year and we are going to sit down with the Board about a broader long-term financial policy that I made referenced to, and we'll be in a position to recommend to the Board to reinstate the dividend. But there is no need for further financial metrics with that new look at our improved financial situation Over when we were paying the dividend before. The issue with the growth project is one that requires more work and requires some time in evaluating the market as we go forward. They range in size, but the projects are large ones. We have a significant expansion opportunity in El Abra, in Chile, with our partner Codelco. And it's - on the order of the project, we did Cerro Verde several years ago. And we have series of projects in the U.S. that initially aren't as large, although down the road, there are some very large ones available. The U.S. has some advantages. Tax rates are very favorable and we have a very large loss carry forward. So we don't pay taxes in the U.S. for years to come. We own most of the lands and fees. So there is no royalties. And so when you cut out taxes and royalties in the U.S. versus foreign economics and with the favorable energy situation in the U.S., and community support for workers, there's just a lot of advantages there. So we had to suspend this work because of the uncertainties of COVID. We\u2019re now - Rick Coleman and his team are digging back into it and we are going to be doing trade-offs of these individual projects as we go forward in 2021 and we are able to report to you about our intentions. We are constantly approached by others in the industry who would like to be our partners in these projects. So there'll be a lot of opportunities there. And just to say, today, we are just resuming the work that we were engaged in previously.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris LaFemina with Jefferies.\nChris LaFemina: Hi, Richard, Kathleen, and thank you for taking my call. Just two questions regarding Grasberg. The first is, it looks like for the Grasberg block caves, you've made a pretty material increase to your annual production guidance from 850 million pounds at average reserve grade to 950 million pounds, and I'm wondering what is driving that increase by 100 million pounds of annual production from the Grasberg block cave? That's my first question.\nRichard Adkerson: All right. Well, we\u2019re - the Grasberg block cave has gone extraordinarily well. I mean, it's an ore body that we knew well because it's the same ore body that we mined from the early 1990s to December 2019. So we know the ore body. It doesn't have some of the pressure situations that we've had to deal with at the Deep MLZ mine. And so when you just look at the advancement of the block caving operations, the development of draw bells and the way we've operated, we're just ahead of schedule. So it's nothing more than the team being very efficient, being ahead of schedule.\nChris LaFemina: Okay. It's nothing to do with surprise in terms of grades and looks like the average grade for the reserve is higher than it was the last time you reported results. So is there something different in terms of the mine plan or just some of the drilling you have done there where you've seen some different results than you expected?\nRichard Adkerson: No. It's just, as you mine an ore body and go forward, it's a dynamic situation and you update mine plans and reserves for the experience in the - it's just great to see the Grasberg block cave having this really positive development mode. I mean it's just special.\nChris LaFemina: Okay. Thanks for that. And then secondly on Indonesia in terms of the smelter. So the options here are number one, you build a new smelter, which I think you've said in the past, would cost up to $3 billion. You'd fund effectively half of that. Obviously, debt financed through the asset, but half of that that will be attributable to Freeport. The other option is to expand the Gresik smelter, build the precious metals refinery and have a third-party build the smelter. If a third-party - so my first question is, in that second scenario, that's $200 million for the smelter expansion, maybe $250 million for a precious metals refinery, so $500 million in total, of which you pay about half. Is that correct?\nRichard Adkerson: Well, let me pick on a few words that you just said.\nChris LaFemina: Okay.\nRichard Adkerson: First of all, Freeport - FCX, let's call the U.S. company FCX, the Indonesian entity PTFI, okay? We are a shareholder of PTFI. We own 49% of the shares. We have rights to operate under a shareholders' agreement, we be an FCX. MIND ID owns 51%. So it's a separate entity and it is the entity that would construct and finance the smelter. So it's no 50/50 sharing. I mean it is - it'd be financed in that entity, it's a substantial entity, with no external debt. From time-to-time, there is some borrowings from FCX, but \u2013 to meet working capital needs, but it's a substantial entity that clearly can debt finance this entity on its own. So that's the way this thing would be approached and financed. Now, we do consolidate that entity because of our operating rights. It's a very positive thing that we do have the ability to do that under the accounting rules because that way we can report it as part of our global operations. So to the extent that alternative is followed and PTFI takes the lead in constructing and financing the smelter, the debt that it incurs would be consolidated on our balance sheet, but it wouldn't be obligations of FCX to provide funding for it.\nChris LaFemina: Right. Understood. So in that scenario, PTFI would pay $500 million for a precious metal refinery and the expansion of the Gresik smelter. Whereas in the other scenario, where you build the smelter, PTFI would effectively spend $3 billion, right? So and then in a scenario, where you just expand the smelter, build the precious metal refinery and have a third-party build the second \u2013 the separate smelter, would there be a risk here? Will you be paying materially above market TCRC to that smelter or how should we think about the cost to you of not building the smelter?\nRichard Adkerson: So let me go back to one step. By expanding Gresik, we could downsize the greenfield smelter that PTFI would build, and the $3 billion number would be adjusted to be offset with the additional cost of the expansion. So at this point, I think it's fair to still consider - we may have ways of reducing the capital and we are working towards those, but to think about both those projects together and the precious metal facilities, all being a $3 billion project for PTFI. Now, this new alternative would result in not having to build the greenfield smelter. Another party would come in and do that, arrange it and finance it, so the debt would not be incurred by PTFI Okay. We're still in the process of negotiating TCRC rates for that. There will be some need for financial support because of the market, but there is an opportunity for us to end up in a much more favorable situation for PTFI if we are successful in these negotiations. And the government considers it positive because it would be a step in their own government initiatives to develop industry in Indonesia. This would tie into some nickel operations and potentially some downstream battery operations and the like for Indonesia. So strategically, the Government of Indonesia sees its positive. It could be positive for PTFI and so that's the basis for our deal. And now, we're in the process of negotiating the terms of that deal.\nKathleen Quirk: And Chris, this is Kathleen. We are really running the processes in parallel so that we can compare the economics of each. We were attracted to the third-party model because that was a model that was successful for us in the past when we built the original smelter. And so we'll be evaluating the economics of that option alongside of the original option as well. So really what we are seeking to do is to do this in the best economic fashion as we can. And the benefit of having a third party doing it is, it allows PTFI to really focus on mine development and upstream, which is what PTFI is really strong at. So we're still in the early stages of evaluating the two alternatives and progressing both of them in parallel to determine which is the best for PTFI and its shareholders.\nChris LaFemina: Great. Thank you very much.\nRichard Adkerson: Chris, I want to close with one thing, one reminder, I say this every time, but I just want to close with it. If we do go forward with our original commitment, build a smelter, just remember that the negative economics of that smelter are borne more than 70% by the Government of Indonesia because of taxes, royalties, their 51% equity ownership in PTFI. And so in essence, less than 30% of the negative economics of the smelter come back to FCX through its 49% share holding in PTFI. Many people seem to be assigning more negative value for FCX to this smelter than the economics really justify.\nChris LaFemina: All right. Sure. Thanks.\nRichard Adkerson: And that's why we are aligned with the government in trying to make this as economic as possible.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Hacking with Citi.\nAlex Hacking: Good morning, Richard and Kathleen, and congrats on all the achievements last year.\nRichard Adkerson: Thanks, Alex.\nAlex Hacking: So my question is around CapEx. If we look back to the beginning of last year, you were going to spend $2.8 billion last year and $2.4 billion this year, ended up spending $2 billion and $2.3 billion. So effectively $1 billion has been cut out of CapEx over that two-year period or roughly 20%. No one in the financial markets is complaining about that. But I guess, could you help us understand where that money has gone? Is it deferred in a sense or is that money that is effectively not going to be spent, or does it reflect FX and other effective changes to the price and cost of things, if that question makes sense? Thanks.\nKathleen Quirk: Yes. Part of the capital that we deferred in 2020 was related to the smelter. So that's something, as we've been talking about on this call, is still uncertain, but there was significant capital that we did cut in 2020. And we cut mining rates, we deferred some projects and we're still operating under those conditions. We did bring forward, - as I mentioned, we brought back in $100 million of mine equipment really allowing us to do some rebuilds more quickly than what was in the April plan and those would have been in the original plan. So some of it is timing related, and some of it really is just trying to be as efficient as possible with our equipment fleets. And that's one of the benefits that we have by operating all these mines is, planning the equipment for fleets where they bring the highest value, moving - we can move equipment from different sites to benefit from just being able to operate them together. And we're also just really trying to work the assets, use this technology that we have and the organizational improvement initiatives, to work the assets harder. And we started that program, what we called America's Concentrator, but it applies not just to milling operations but mining operations and really looking to improve the lives of our equipment, improve tire lives, all those things really add up. And so, yes. There is always tension and pressure of people wanting to invest more in our mining equipment, in our mining business, but we're really taking a very disciplined approach and using the learnings that we gained in 2020 and even prior to that, to try to drive better capital efficiency in the business.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners with Bank of America.\nTimna Tanners: I just wanted to ask about two things. One is on the cost side. It crept up a little bit and some people are asking about that. So I just wanted to understand, it seems like you made it clear that that was energy and currency, maybe some other issues. But does that also incorporate some of the cost-containment measures that you had, is that fixed or could it change as the year progresses with currency and other efficiencies? That's one question. And the other question is just to ask about Richard's plans because I know Richard you told me you're going to pursue another term like President Trump and that you're going to let us on the Indonesia progress. And so those are behind us now and you took on another term with ICMM. So just wondering if you could give us a few updated thoughts there as well. Thanks.\nRichard Adkerson: Well\u2026\nKathleen Quirk: Yes. On the first question on - you want to go first, Richard?\nRichard Adkerson: No, I was just going to - I will let you give the details, but Timna, you look back over time, some of our costs are correlated to the copper price. We have profit sharing for our workforce in Peru. So the more money we make there, the more our labor cost goes there. We've seen an uptick in energy cost recently from where they were earlier. So just inevitably, as the copper prices rise, we have some increases in unit costs and we are able to offset those, but not completely eliminate them through our cost efficiencies. But Kathleen, you go ahead or maybe you want to answer the second question too, Kathleen.\nKathleen Quirk: But no, I think you captured it, Richard. We updated our model for all the current rates in terms of energy. We've seen some energy, some oil price increase. Although the price of oil relative to copper is still very low, we have seen some increases in oil prices which affects some of our energy costs. We've had some increase in electricity costs. Richard mentioned profit sharing, but we updated our budgets to reflect all of the input costs that vary. But from a bottom-line standpoint, we are continuing to drive the benefits that we got in 2020 through these revised plans and really working to hold on to these cost savings. We learned a lot and we always say that necessity is the mother of invention and we learned a lot during 2020. And so basic cost structure, we're working to preserve, but we do have some variability with input costs. But it's something that we're just continuing to focus on as main driver of cost and capital efficiency in the business. It's really important in the Americas because that we have such leverage to the copper price and we really want to maintain as low cost as possible and we've got programs in place that are working on that every day.\nRichard Adkerson: So Timna, since I made that comment about Trump at your conference, we now have an older President than Trump. So maybe that extends my time frame. Personally, we've been through such a situation at Freeport really over my 30 years being here, but particularly over the last 10 years. And now that we are seeing the positive results of all of this work and particularly the recovery we made from five years ago, I'm healthy, I want to be part of it. I really enjoy and love the people I work with and we just have this incredible good spirit among our team. I do have a concern. That's why I made some of the comments on the last slide. Some people look at me and safe Freeport's an old company, maybe, but we really - if you look throughout our organization, we have a lot of young, experienced managers. With our longer-tenured people, we have great depth. We're showing we can sustain positions. When I do leave, we're going to have a sustainable company going forward, we're going to have a sustainable Board. We're working on that now. So anyway, it's been a crazy year for someone who traveled all the time to be working like I've worked - like how other people worked. But having the success with the Company which is not just a peak thing or an unusual thing, but this is - you look at the markets, inventories are low, there is elements of copper demand that are new, that are growing, supplies. I mean all of this is coming in place. And I think it's going to be - it was a great year for Freeport. I mean, we went from below $5 a share to be in the 8th best-performing stock in the S&P 500. I mean, how can you envision that. I mean that's a head spinner, but I think there is great things to come, and I want to be here and be part of it because we've worked so hard to get there. I should mention that Jim Bob died recently. He and I - I met him in my first year out of college as he was starting off McMoran and we were two different people, but we established a very good partnership. We brought different skills to bear in building Freeport. And in his later years, Jim Bob was focused on his oil and gas concepts, but he was always there. We did have a major disagreement. I mean, there is no way to hide it. Over the oil and gas deal in 2011, he thought it was a really good deal for the Company. I did not. The Board decided to do it and it caused us significant problems when commodity prices fell. He was very sick for a while, but I'm happy to say that in recent years, he and I established - in recent times he and I reestablished a really good personal relationship. And it was a sad day for all of us when he lost his life to COVID.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank.\nChris Terry: Hi, Richard and Kathleen, hope you guys are well. I just wanted to dig into Grasberg a little bit further, given it so pivotal. Just talk about the December - the fourth quarter development rates, and then, how you exited the year? And then as you've put your 2021 guidance in place, whether you see those estimates potentially still conservative versus how well you went on the development rights in 2020?\nRichard Adkerson: Well, Mark's here. And Mark, I'll say a couple of things and maybe you can chime in. We have four underground mines there. The two major ones are the Grasberg block cave and the Deep MLZ, and each of those have separate headings. So this is not like a single mine or even two major mines, but a collection of mines with a common infrastructure. And as we've developed the access to the ore bodies and expanded those, that gives us a lot of flexibility to deal with operating issues that may come up with particular sections of the mine where we are mining. And maybe things like that will come up, wet muck, and so forth. We haven't had much of that yet. But here's where we are. We mentioned just how well Grasberg block cave is going and we are ahead of schedule on that. Grasberg - the Deep MLZ mine has had the challenges over time with having these seismicity events that are mining-related not natural. And we've implemented a program of using fracking technology to pre-condition the ore bodies so that could leave the pressures that cause these. We still face them from time-to-time, but we've got great procedures for dealing with it. There are different ore bodies, different settings. The Grasberg block cave is ahead. Deep MLZ is maybe a month or two behind. But Mark talk us little bit about your perceptions on how we're dealing with the Deep MLZ?\nMark Johnson: Yes. Chris, Deep MLZ, as Richard mentioned, in the fourth quarter, we were ahead on all the development aspects. We are on target on draw belling, undercutting. And where we had some challenges was in just the material flow. And what I mean from there, is taking the material from the extraction level, getting it through the rock breaker, getting it to the grizzlies, through the internal ore passes, the 60-meter long ore passes and getting them into the trucks to take it to the crusher. The problems that we had there was, we deal everything from very, very cause rocky material to fine sticky material and we're coming up with methods that I'm confident will address that, that allow us to take both the big stuff and the fine stuff and run them through these ore passes. It's something that we saw at the initial stages of DOZ, and we're working our way through that. On the GBC, the Grasberg block cave, we had a very good year. We were on draw billing undercutting. We were ahead on our tonnage rates for the fourth quarter, marginally ahead and we're in a good position there. We build our second - we will complete the second pressure GBC in April of this year, which will be a major milestone. We continue to develop the rail haulage and that is a major milestone that we will achieve in the second quarter and let these trains run in a loop rather than out and back, and that's going to increase our production from our overall mine system. So both mines are tracking well. And as Richard mentioned, we do have DOZ. It's a mature mine, but it hit targets. Big Gossan our stope mine, was - we had very good results this last year, last quarter, in particular. So we've had some pluses and minuses, but overall, we're in a very good position entering this year. And particularly in the GBC, we've hit our peak in our draw belling in 2020. And just associated with mine plan and consistent with our long-range plans, that starts to tail off. We don't need as many draw bells to continue to sustain the ramp-up in production. Deep MLZ will pretty much stay steady for the next three years on draw belling and undercutting. So the next two years is really just doing more of the same, of growing these mines. There is no real rate increase in the amount of development. In fact, it's flatter or dropping off. And it's just a matter of continuing to be very consistent in how going forward as to what we've been able to demonstrate over the last couple of years and particularly in 2020.\nRichard Adkerson: And our volumes will be increasing. I mean we are 75%, 80% there now, but that will increase long-term. And what we try to do with our publicly disclosed guidance is be realistic. We don't try to do anything other than give you our current plans and what they are, and we will do better than that sometimes and sometimes, we may not. We also have an undeveloped ore body that we've been doing some work on that could add value for the future and that's an ore body called the Kucing Liar. It\u2019s ore body with high-grade material, has some pyrite in it. Mark and his team have come up with a revised plan to deal with that. It's about a $5 billion project spread over many years, a number of years in the future, but that's not near-term, but it's something that within the timeframe of our current IUPK will be something that will sustain and add value for PTFI\nChris Terry: Thanks, Richard. And I appreciate the color Mark. Just one other follow-up on smelter. In terms of the Gresik ownership being 25% Freeport and 75% Mitsubishi and Nippon, just in terms of the expansion that could take place there, I just wanted to be clear, the JV partners that you have there, they are comfortable doing the expansion on that asset, right?\nKathleen Quirk: We have been working with the majority partner there and they would lead the development of the project and we will work out the ownership as we go forward. But the structure that we're talking about is that, PTFI would advance the funds to the smelter company as a loan and potentially convert that into equity after the smelter is completed. But Mitsubishi Materials would lead the project to develop the expansion. They've done multiple expansions there since the smelter was constructed in the mid-'90s. They are excellent, excellent operators and very efficient in terms of capital management. So we're working with them to lead the expansion.\nRichard Adkerson: Yes. And I'll just echo, I was involved with the structure for the original smelter development in the '90s, and Mitsubishi has just been an excellent partner. They couldn't have been better. They operate the smelter in a first-class way. The world of smelters has changed so much. In those days at Grasberg, we couldn't find places to place our concentrate. So we bought a smelter in Spain. We worked to build the smelter in Indonesia. The world has changed. There is such a global excess capacity of smelters, but Mitsubishi has been there through thick and thin and have just done remarkably good job.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Orest Wowkodaw with Scotiabank.\nOrest Wowkodaw: Just following up on the Indonesian smelter alternative. Do you anticipate that the ultimate plan is going to be resolved call it in the next six to 12 months and then, along that do you - sorry. Go ahead Richard\u2026\nRichard Adkerson: The answer to that is, yes.\nOrest Wowkodaw: So, it's fairly closer?\nRichard Adkerson: Well, it needs to be. I mean, we've got this deadline that we're working with the government to extend a year, but we have to get on with the Gresik area smelter or go along with this other thing, the government is in it. So it's going to be resolved clearly within that timeframe.\nOrest Wowkodaw: Okay. And do you anticipate under any of these alternatives actually spending capital this year or is it more likely going to start, call it, like 2022?\nKathleen Quirk: We'll have some capital for the PT smelting expansion. It will be advanced as a loan. And they're doing the engineering now. We don't have definitive agreements with them, but we're very close to that. And again, any of the funding - we are planning to raise financing, debt financing, we've got discussions with banks about financing for that. And then on the larger smelter, it really will just depend on which alternative. One would be the third-party doing it, and we potentially could be a minority equity owner like we were in the PT Smelting project. Or the greenfield would involve some spending in 2021, but not significant. But as Richard said, we need to get the clarity over the next - here over the next several months to make a decision on which path to follow.\nOrest Wowkodaw: Okay. Wonderful.\nRichard Adkerson: Again, to be clear, when Kathleen says we, in that context, it's PTFI.\nOrest Wowkodaw: Right.\nRichard Adkerson: Okay.\nOrest Wowkodaw: And then just as a follow-up, is it fair to say that like Freeport is in no rush to begin constructing kind of new copper capacity on a greenfield level, but we're going to see more discipline, not just by Freeport but by the industry this time?\nRichard Adkerson: Well, we are certainly in no rush. I do think it's a great asset of our Company, but we are not - we are going to continue our focus on getting this project in Indonesia completed and that's going to be - and running our Americas business efficiently and increasing volumes when we can and controlling costs and so forth. So there's certainly no rush. In the industry itself, there are some projects that were begun and delayed because of COVID. Over time, those are going to be completed, but you don't see any evidence of a big rush to start investments. And I don't expect that to occur.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Carlos de Alba with Morgan Stanley.\nCarlos de Alba: So a couple of questions if I may. The first one is maybe Richard, has the management team come out with some potential proposal for the Board in terms of the shareholders' program that you would like to discuss, and hopefully, implement? And if so, if you could share some of what you and your team are thinking that would be great? And the second question is coming back to the DMLZ. The forecast, or at least the open draw bells blasted that our forecast for the end of 2021 and during 2022 came down. So maybe for Mark, is there this impact of the challenges that you are seeing with the material flow what explain this reduction in your open draw bells forecast for this year and next year? And also, what is behind the small reduction in copper and gold sales from PTFI in 2021? Thank you.\nRichard Adkerson: Mark, why don't you answer first, and I'll come back to the financial policy?\nMark Johnson: Yes. There is not any issue on the draw bell opening. If there was a reduction, it's very, very minor. We've been very consistent. We ended the fourth quarter with 15 draw bells within the Deep MLZ blasted and that's going to be relatively our flat rate. There might have been some ones or twos that are different, but it's not anything that was significant in our forecast. As Richard mentioned it's more about this, where we are in the ramping up of the tons and it's more in line. Any changes in the tonnage is more a reflection of this material flow, challenge that we're undertaking. But it's just marginally behind and at the same time, the GBC is marginally ahead. And so the, ramp-up rates are very consistent from one forecast to the other. Some slight changes in grades that are nothing significant, it's not drilling results, it's not any changes in reserves. It's simply where we're actually drawing. There is some - at the end of every quarter, we reflect what we've done and we built that into what we're doing forward. So there is really no significant change in our underground plans both at Deep MLZ and GBC. The other two mines DOZ and Big Gossan are both very consistent. In fact, in Big Gossan we've changed our stope sequencing a bit. That's going to add some metal. So we continue to look for opportunities and to reflect our actual production and operational over the previous quarters.\nRichard Adkerson: Yes. And just a side comment, these other two mines that we have look tiny compared with Grasberg block cave and the Deep MLZ, but when you look at underground mines in the industry, those are substantial mines in and of themselves. This copper difference is just a rounding. I mean it's less than 1%. I mean, so we're right on plan for copper. And in the gold things, remember we had higher gold. Now we upgraded our gold for 2022. So every year there is going to be those kinds of adjustments. We're going to try to produce more gold, which we were able to do in 2020, and then we adjust our plans for that. So there is nothing here other than that we are right on our targets and everything is going as planned. The financial policy, I'll go back and say, what I've said before, we have ongoing informal discussions with Board members. We have formal Board members coming up. My anticipation is that there will be a restoration of our dividend and then a financial policy that will give guidance to the market of how we will be dividing cash flows in the future for further debt reduction. Although, quite frankly, we are - If you look at our cash flows that we talked to you about today and a $3.50 copper price, we are down to about $3 billion from net debt at the end of 2022. So we certainly can support higher level of debts. And that means there's plenty of cash to enhance cash returns to shareholders and then, have availability of funds, and depending on how we structure it, for future organic growth projects when we decide to initiate those. So restoration of dividend, financial policy that we will provide for increasing cash returns to shareholder over long-term with funds available for organic growth investments.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Murphy with Barclays.\nMatthew Murphy: I had a question about some of your innovation initiatives. I guess this time last year you were talking about some specific programs with data science, machine learning that you were going to roll out for something like $150 million, $200 million bucks. Should we consider that embedded in this guidance, or is that a program that's still on pause that might be reinitiated at some point?\nKathleen Quirk: We are - and Josh Olmsted is on, he can talk more about it. But we are continuing those projects. We've brought a number of things in-house. We were doing a lot of work externally as well, but we brought a number of those initiatives in-house. We're still progressing with some of the automated models that help predict better mill throughput rates and help develop the right recipe to maximize throughput through the mills and we are adopting a lot of the data analytics in other areas as well. We're working on adopting the data analytics process in our leach operations as well. So we are continuing and the team is very actively involved in using technology and digitalization to enhance performance. We're not - the Cerro Verde increase, we're not doing that now because of the COVID restrictions and expect to continue to look at driving mill rates higher there beginning next year. But Josh, why don't you just talk a little bit about it, because it's really an exciting area that Josh and his team are working on actively every day. And it may not look exactly the same as what we were talking about at the beginning of last year, because we've learned a lot and we're improving it from there, but the bottom line to answer your question is, yes. We have built in a lot of it into these plans, but there is upside from there. Josh, you want to add anything to that?\nRichard Adkerson: Hi Kathleen, let me introduce Josh to the Group, okay, just briefly. Beginning September 1, Josh became our Senior Operating Manager for the Americas, a Senior Vice President. He's been with the Company 28 years and he is only 50 years old or so, but he has progressively risen in the organization, had senior leadership roles at several of our operating sites in the U.S. and South America. And over the past four years, his leadership role has grown as he worked with Red Conger who retired. And he has just been doing a great job and he's brought an energy to. He is very teamwork focused. Our other operating managers are coalescing around him. He works very well with our technical group and with our financial administrative group. So Josh Olmsted, why don't you follow-up Kathleen's comments.\nJosh Olmsted: Thanks, Richard. Appreciate that. Matthew, just as Kathleen indicated, if we look at year ago when we were talking about Americas concentrate and that $150 million to $200 million investment compared to where we sit today, one of the, I'm going to call it, benefits or one of the things that we took advantage of during 2020 was how do we internalize a lot of that stuff. And as Kathleen alluded to, we took a lot of those learnings and really embedded them in the operation. And that's what allowed us to be as successful as we were in 2020. And as we look at 2021 and beyond, we continue to leverage, whether that be data analytics, the AI and how that applies, the tools that are out there and we look for opportunities, a lot of those things are embedded in the plans today, but I think it's also going to drive additional things as we go forward that won't require the investment or the dollars that we had thought about previously just from the fact that we've got it internalized and we're leveraging a lot of the energy, passion, and excitement of our workforce and tapping into ideas that are allowing us to add incremental benefits across the organization from an efficiency perspective as well as from a cost perspective. And so it's really exciting to see the folks at all levels of the organization have the opportunity and take the opportunity to provide ideas that then turn into significant value for us as an organization. And so, I just continue to be encouraged with our ability to execute on those things and identify opportunities going forward to leverage data, leverage analytics, and put the right information in the right people's hands, at the right time to make good decisions.\nRichard Adkerson: And back to the point about Freeport operating all the assets, we benefit from all being on the same system. And so this data analytics work that we're doing, really can be compared and shared across the company and collaborate, and really take the best of each of the operations and apply that to the portfolio. And we're starting to do some work with Mark and his team on different things as well. So as Josh was saying, it's really some synergies here and the work that we did in 2020 allowed us really to kind of take some of this on our own and down and drive it. So more to come on that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lucas Pipes with B. Riley Securities.\nLucas Pipes: I want to pick up on one of your comments from the prepared remarks regarding how this period is reminding you of the early 2000s. And I think you even mentioned a super cycle. What is your confidence level today that we are on the cusp or maybe already entered a period like this? And then, there were a few questions on M&A, organic growth, and obviously, your conclusion on where we are in the cycle and whether this is another super cycle is of course really important for how you think about these things? So if you could maybe incorporate all these thoughts in a reply would really appreciate your comments on this. Thank you.\nRichard Adkerson: So we are working remotely, Lucas. If we were sitting as we normally do around our conference desk in Phoenix, Kathleen will be kicking me out on the table because that question is just like giving a monkey a machine gun. 2003, we had gone through a real tough time in copper with the economic issues of the late 1990s, the global recession, the global slowdown. Copper prices had dropped at one point to below $0.70. And I recall and it was at - Timna at a Merrill Lynch conference in Ireland, that was my first conference as CEO. It was right before my CEO and the price of copper had just dipped over $0.70. Nobody in the industry thought it could go beyond $1 within the foreseeable future and everybody was running the business. So what happened? China emerged in a way nobody expected. Created a whole new element of demand. Historically, whenever copper prices jumped up, the industry had projects primarily in Latin America to invest in. And the industry was widely divided and there'll be new investment. Supplies would come on, business cycle with turn down and copper prices withdraw. At this time China added in 2003 a permanent element of new demand that was beyond the traditional demand from copper that was tied into global industrial production. And there was widespread expectation that the industry would invest and add new supplies. I remember my partner Chip Goodyear got up at that conference and said, in the conference, he hope that the price wouldn't rise too much because it would create uneconomic investment. Well, what happened was the industry started looking for new projects then, and geologically, they weren't there and there were all these other barriers to investment. So we had higher prices without a supply response. That led us to do the Phelps Dodge deal in 2007. Our market cap in 2003 was $6 billion. It was $12 billion at the Phelps Dodge. We did a $38 billion business combination, the biggest in the industry. Lived through the financial crisis and then emerged in 2011 as a company with a $60 billion market cap and no debt. So what do we like here? The reason that I feel this is an echo is that we still have a world that's being burdened by the economic slowdown with COVID. While there has been recoveries in pockets of the economy, there has been stimulus by governments and China has recovered much faster than we heard about earlier I think about a world where we had a slow down to the extent we did in 2020, and copper inventories are at levels that we hadn't seen since the mid-2000s. And so here we are and we just talked about how there is not a huge rush to invest in new projects. All the major companies want to grow. Copper is part of their portfolios. That's been the case since the mid-2000s and they've been challenged in doing that. Projects today around the world geologically are more difficult, less quality than they were, underground lower grades. You look at Cerro Verde, [Covid pandemic] these are big low-grade projects that require huge investments in infrastructure and equipment, and mill processing. And then you have these barriers to production that keep some attractive projects in and around the world from going forward. You have political issues in countries that - and Africa is challenged, Latin Americas having political issues, Indonesia has been what it's been. So I do feel that if the world's global economy recovers in a reasonable way, not in an extreme way and we have this big move toward - look at all the stats that are coming about for electric vehicles in the United States. I mean think about what General Motors is doing and what China is doing? You think about the change in the global perception about climate change. In the United States, forest fires, hurricanes, I mean this is something that's going to have to be addressed. And when it is addressed, it's going to require tremendous amounts of infrastructure spending, extraordinary amounts and in all of those elements of spending there is an element of copper of significance into it. So that's why I feel like we are echoing 2003 today.\nLucas Pipes: Richard, I really appreciate your expansive answer. Best of luck, and thanks, again.\nKathleen Quirk: Thanks, Lucas. I think we have time for one more question operator. And for those of you who didn't get questions in, we'll follow up with you.\nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of Curt Woodworth with Credit Suisse.\nCurt Woodworth: Thanks for fitting me in. Yes, in terms of the super cycle or things like that, in the past, there have been also opportunities for monetization or potentially useful in terms of bringing in JV partners at very accretive terms potentially to develop assets. So to your point, Richard, on Grasberg being derisked, having little net debt by the end of '22. You'd be - you would have the wherewithal to develop maybe multiple projects. I'm just curious how you think about potentially growing the business from a capital-efficient basis going forward, because obviously in the past when you did get into these super cycles, I think, one of the issues in mining industry has been the lack of seeing that cash come back to shareholders. I'm just curious kind of how you balance that going forward? Thank you.\nKathleen Quirk: One point, I'll just jump in before Richard comments, we already have growth. I mean if you look at our outlook and Richard touched on this before, not only do we have growth in 2021, but also in 2022. So we've got that and we've got to execute on that plan and that's going to give us a lot of cash flow to be in a position to get some returns back to shareholders after this big investment program.\nRichard Adkerson: So, again, I look over the shoulder. If you look back at Freeport, when copper prices begin rising in 2003, 2004, we returned tremendous amounts of cash to investors out of Grasberg. We were like a royalty trust or an MLP or something. Then after Phelps Dodge, we delevered very quickly and we start returning and paying dividends again. And we were well positioned in 2011 to continue to do that. The Board decided to invest in oil and gas and took it away. So here we are coming back from the situation that we are now. We don't need a commodities boom to generate lots of cash to return to shareholders. At $3.50 copper you see what the numbers are. I think copper could go much higher than $3.50. I can't guarantee it, but in my gut and Timna that's one of the reasons I want to keep working, I think it's going to be really a special time. And when that happens, we will be able to really return cash to shareholders in a substantial way. This question of investing, I mean, right now, money is so cheap you wouldn't want to bring in a joint venture partner. That may not stay that way forever, but financing is incredibly cheap and available. And I wish Phelps Dodge hadn't given up the interest in the Red Sea or the interest in Cerro Verde. So if we got good projects, we will look at the most efficient way to finance it. That could well be - could be partners because lots of people want to be our partners. And then others may have projects that we have the opportunity to join in on. There could be opportunities in M&A market, but all of that is part of this really bright future that I see for Freeport. The vision right now is focused on getting 2021 to be a successful as 2020 was. And when that happens and we got long-term run rates at Grasberg. Josh and his team has fine-tuned our business in the Americas. We got this Lone Star project, don't overlook that. That could be a new Morenci down the road. This is just a Company that's really well situated to generate cash, not have to do anything to have a sustainable future, but having the world open to us to do lots of different things. It's really, really exciting.\nRichard Adkerson: All right. Thank you all for participating. We look forward to reporting our progress in 2021. And take care. Take care of yourselves, your families and the people around you. We're not over the hump yet on COVID, but just hang in there. Life is going to get better. Thanks for participating.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kathleen Quirk",
            "content": "Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan fourth quarter conference call. Earlier this morning, we reported our fourth quarter and full-year 2020 operating and financial results, and a copy of today's press release and our slides are available on our website at fcx.com. Our call today is being broadcast live on the Internet and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website Homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on this call will include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described on our SEC filings. On the call today are, Richard Adkerson. We also have a number of our senior team with us today. Mark Johnson is here, Josh Olmsted, Mike Kendrick, Rick Coleman, and Steve Higgins. I'll start by briefly summarizing the results for the quarter, and then, we'll turn the call over to Richard, who will be reviewing our outlook. After our prepared remarks, we'll be taking questions. Today, FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of $708 million, or $0.48 per share in the fourth quarter and $599 million, or $0.41 per share for the year ended 2020. We had a number of special items in the fourth quarter, which are detailed on Roman numeral VII of our press release, those totaled net credits $142 million, or $0.10 a share, mainly associated with the gain on the sale of assets and partly offset by charges for litigation settlement and international tax matters. Our adjusted net income attributable to common stock after these items totaled $566 million, or $0.39 per share for the fourth quarter of 2020. Our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or EBITDA, for the fourth quarter approximated $1.9 billion and we generated $4.2 billion of adjusted EBITDA for the year 2020. A reconciliation of our EBITDA is available on Page 38 of the slide materials. We had a very strong fourth quarter. Our sales volumes of copper of 866 million pounds were 3% above our October 2020 estimate, and our gold sales of 293,000 ounces were 9% higher than our October 2020 guidance. These primarily reflected higher copper sales from Cerro Verde and in Indonesia and higher gold ore grades in Indonesia. We benefited during the quarter from improved pricing for both copper and gold. The realized price of copper was $3.40 per pound in the fourth quarter, and that was 24% above the year-ago quarterly average. Fourth quarter gold realized price was $1,870 per ounce, and that was about 25% above the year-ago average. Our unit net cash cost came in at an average of $1.28 per pound of copper and that was lower than what we had guided to in October. Notably, in the fourth quarter, we generated very strong cash flows, which totaled $1.3 billion in the quarter and that exceeded our capital spending of just under $400 million during the period. We were - together with our asset sale proceeds in the fourth quarter, we were successful in reducing our net debt by about $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter alone. And we ended the year with net debt approximating $6.1 billion. We had no borrowings under our revolving credit facility, consolidated cash of $3.7 billion and we are in a strong position as we look forward to generating increasing cash flows as we go forward. I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to our slide materials that you can reference on our website. Richard, I'm just going to make a few comments, and then, we can take the questions. I'll be brief. Just continuing with the slide presentation on Slide 16, we provide some additional details on the quarter and our operating plans. We are continuing in the U.S. to ramp up production from the new Lone Star mine, and in January of this year, we commenced the restart of the Chino mine, which we had previously announced. In South America, we're continuing to operate Cerro Verde at a reduced rate of roughly 360,000 tons per day. We did a little more than that in the fourth quarter and our team is prepared to increase rates to a level of 400,000 tons, which is about where we were - tons per day, which is about where we were pre-COVID after the COVID restrictions are lifted. At El Abra, we've incorporated in our latest plans an increase in operating rates, which will provide additional volumes beginning in 2022. And as we've talked about, at Grasberg, we made excellent progress in the fourth quarter and are continuing to execute the ramp up plan to achieve the targeted metal run rates by the end of this year. Slide 17, we present the outlook for 2021. The guidance is largely in line with our previous estimates. We made some minor revisions to 2021 volumes. These were largely timing in nature to reflect the latest Grasberg mine plans. And we've updated our cost models to incorporate the current pricing for energy, currencies, and ongoing maintenance programs. We expect to sell just over 3.8 billion pounds of copper in 2021 at an average unit net cash cost of $1.25 per pound. At $3.50 copper, this will generate about $8 billion of EBITDA and $5.5 billion in operating cash flows for the year 2021, which is nearly double the 2020 levels. And as you'll see, we expect further growth in 2022 and 2023, which is shown on Slide 18, where we provide a three-year outlook for volumes. After stacking growth of nearly 20% in copper and over 50% for gold in 2021 versus 2020, we're projecting further growth of 13% in copper volumes and over 20% in gold volumes for the year 2022. And these projects have been in development for some time. Most of the capital is behind us, which gives us a runway here of generating growth in cash flows and margins. The build-up in volumes for 2021 is reflected on Slide 19. And on Slide 20, we show the significance of the cash flow generation using these volumes and our cost estimates, and we show a range of prices from $3.50 to $4 copper, holding gold flat at $1,850 per ounce and molybdenum at $9 per pound. But you can see that the growth in volumes at very low incremental cost results in EBITDA ranging from over $10 billion per annum on average for the years 2022 and 2023. So over $12 billion per year at $4 copper and operating cash flows, which are net of our taxes and interest costs, would range from $7 billion at $3.50 per pound of copper to over $8.5 billion at $4 copper. And as Richard was mentioning, $4 copper is still well below historical periods of demand strength. The cash flows generation are expected to be significantly above our planned capital spending, which will provide substantial free cash flows as we go forward. Slide 21 includes our projected capital of $2.3 billion in 2021. That excludes potential spending on the Indonesian smelter, which would be debt-financed and is still under evaluation. We are maintaining our basic capital plans. We have been very disciplined about capital spend. The 2021 capital is roughly, as you'll see, about $100 million higher than the previous forecast and that incorporates an acceleration of some mining equipment investments to provide capacity assurance for our plans. We are in a strong financial position, as you see. We've entered a period of exceptional free cash flow generation. The long-lived asset base and ongoing cost and capital management will provide the ability to continue to strengthen our balance sheet, provide cash returns to shareholders and build additional values in our asset base. Regarding financial policy, we're working with our Board on a shareholder return policy that would balance our priorities, while providing increasing returns to shareholders based on this performance. It's a very exciting time for Freeport. And we're staying very focused on continuing our momentum. And now, operator, we'd like to take questions. And Chris, this is Kathleen. We are really running the processes in parallel so that we can compare the economics of each. We were attracted to the third-party model because that was a model that was successful for us in the past when we built the original smelter. And so we'll be evaluating the economics of that option alongside of the original option as well. So really what we are seeking to do is to do this in the best economic fashion as we can. And the benefit of having a third party doing it is, it allows PTFI to really focus on mine development and upstream, which is what PTFI is really strong at. So we're still in the early stages of evaluating the two alternatives and progressing both of them in parallel to determine which is the best for PTFI and its shareholders. Yes. Part of the capital that we deferred in 2020 was related to the smelter. So that's something, as we've been talking about on this call, is still uncertain, but there was significant capital that we did cut in 2020. And we cut mining rates, we deferred some projects and we're still operating under those conditions. We did bring forward, - as I mentioned, we brought back in $100 million of mine equipment really allowing us to do some rebuilds more quickly than what was in the April plan and those would have been in the original plan. So some of it is timing related, and some of it really is just trying to be as efficient as possible with our equipment fleets. And that's one of the benefits that we have by operating all these mines is, planning the equipment for fleets where they bring the highest value, moving - we can move equipment from different sites to benefit from just being able to operate them together. And we're also just really trying to work the assets, use this technology that we have and the organizational improvement initiatives, to work the assets harder. And we started that program, what we called America's Concentrator, but it applies not just to milling operations but mining operations and really looking to improve the lives of our equipment, improve tire lives, all those things really add up. And so, yes. There is always tension and pressure of people wanting to invest more in our mining equipment, in our mining business, but we're really taking a very disciplined approach and using the learnings that we gained in 2020 and even prior to that, to try to drive better capital efficiency in the business. Yes. On the first question on - you want to go first, Richard? But no, I think you captured it, Richard. We updated our model for all the current rates in terms of energy. We've seen some energy, some oil price increase. Although the price of oil relative to copper is still very low, we have seen some increases in oil prices which affects some of our energy costs. We've had some increase in electricity costs. Richard mentioned profit sharing, but we updated our budgets to reflect all of the input costs that vary. But from a bottom-line standpoint, we are continuing to drive the benefits that we got in 2020 through these revised plans and really working to hold on to these cost savings. We learned a lot and we always say that necessity is the mother of invention and we learned a lot during 2020. And so basic cost structure, we're working to preserve, but we do have some variability with input costs. But it's something that we're just continuing to focus on as main driver of cost and capital efficiency in the business. It's really important in the Americas because that we have such leverage to the copper price and we really want to maintain as low cost as possible and we've got programs in place that are working on that every day. We have been working with the majority partner there and they would lead the development of the project and we will work out the ownership as we go forward. But the structure that we're talking about is that, PTFI would advance the funds to the smelter company as a loan and potentially convert that into equity after the smelter is completed. But Mitsubishi Materials would lead the project to develop the expansion. They've done multiple expansions there since the smelter was constructed in the mid-'90s. They are excellent, excellent operators and very efficient in terms of capital management. So we're working with them to lead the expansion. We'll have some capital for the PT smelting expansion. It will be advanced as a loan. And they're doing the engineering now. We don't have definitive agreements with them, but we're very close to that. And again, any of the funding - we are planning to raise financing, debt financing, we've got discussions with banks about financing for that. And then on the larger smelter, it really will just depend on which alternative. One would be the third-party doing it, and we potentially could be a minority equity owner like we were in the PT Smelting project. Or the greenfield would involve some spending in 2021, but not significant. But as Richard said, we need to get the clarity over the next - here over the next several months to make a decision on which path to follow. We are - and Josh Olmsted is on, he can talk more about it. But we are continuing those projects. We've brought a number of things in-house. We were doing a lot of work externally as well, but we brought a number of those initiatives in-house. We're still progressing with some of the automated models that help predict better mill throughput rates and help develop the right recipe to maximize throughput through the mills and we are adopting a lot of the data analytics in other areas as well. We're working on adopting the data analytics process in our leach operations as well. So we are continuing and the team is very actively involved in using technology and digitalization to enhance performance. We're not - the Cerro Verde increase, we're not doing that now because of the COVID restrictions and expect to continue to look at driving mill rates higher there beginning next year. But Josh, why don't you just talk a little bit about it, because it's really an exciting area that Josh and his team are working on actively every day. And it may not look exactly the same as what we were talking about at the beginning of last year, because we've learned a lot and we're improving it from there, but the bottom line to answer your question is, yes. We have built in a lot of it into these plans, but there is upside from there. Josh, you want to add anything to that? Thanks, Lucas. I think we have time for one more question operator. And for those of you who didn't get questions in, we'll follow up with you. One point, I'll just jump in before Richard comments, we already have growth. I mean if you look at our outlook and Richard touched on this before, not only do we have growth in 2021, but also in 2022. So we've got that and we've got to execute on that plan and that's going to give us a lot of cash flow to be in a position to get some returns back to shareholders after this big investment program."

            "name": "Richard Adkerson",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you all for participating in today's call. It's great to be able to talk to you today about our performance in 2020 and our positive outlook. It's been a head-spinning year when we think back to March and April, and all of the challenges we were facing at that point and the world was facing to have - be at this point is really head-spinning in many ways and remarkable, but it's been quite a year for Freeport. I really hope you and your families and colleagues are staying safe and well. We've all made personal sacrifices. It's been a tough year for us at Freeport, the progress our company has made has really been a godsend as we've all been working in ways that are so different than in past. We remain focused on working to protect our health and safety of our people. We're supporting the communities where we operate during this crisis and we are really encouraged by the scientific advances with therapeutics and now that vaccines are finally being distributed. But we know all this is going to take time to have the distribution widely placed and we're all looking forward to returning to normal lives. But for the time being, we are staying diligent with our protocols and these have really proven to be so effective for us at Freeport. I'm immensely proud of our Freeport team for their response to the COVID challenge, navigating through a pandemic like this that none of us of ever seen, and was this degree of duration has been difficult for everyone and all the communities around us. Our team has demonstrated real resilience, confidence and drive throughout all of this, come together to address the situation proactively, while we've maintained focus on continuing to protect and enhance our business and that's worked for the benefit of all stakeholders. On Slide 3, we show the highlights for 2020, a year of extraordinary accomplishment for Freeport. We laid a strong foundation for future growth in cash flows and profitability, which is exactly what we set out to do and had a strategy to do. And to have been able to achieve what we did in the face of COVID, is nothing short of remarkable. Earlier in 2020, we announced in April, we moved quickly to develop new operating protocols to maintain our business' continuity. We totally redesigned our operating plans from what we had announced this time a year ago to safeguard our business, protect our liquidity, and to be responsive to the really heightened uncertainty that we were facing and everyone was facing. At Freeport, all hands were on deck to build an optimal plan. Each of our operating teams around the globe played an important role in developing and then executing these aggressive plans. We just had a tremendous end by everyone and that enabled us to execute the plan so well. Big positive from this process that our team's collaboration, which has always been a strength of our organization is now more strong than it's ever been. Employment engagement, commitment, energy, and morale are at very high level. We effectively executed the revised plans, had a big focus on cost and capital management, and then, significantly, we advanced the largest block caving operation in the world at our Grasberg mine in Indonesia. You will see we met our key milestones for this massive multi-year, multi-billion dollar undertaking. At the same time, we also completed on time and on budget the Lone Star project in Arizona, and this is a potential future keystone asset for our Company. The progress we made this year set the foundation for strong cash flows literally for years to come. We turned the corner during 2020 to begin generating sustainable and substantial free cash flow. Beginning in the third quarter of 2020 and now continuing in the fourth quarter and as we look forward, we've generated and are generating significant free cash flow and that enabled us to reduce our net debt by $2.4 billion in the second half of the year. Slide 4 highlights key financial metrics by comparing our actual results for 2020 with the plan we presented to you last January prior to the onset of the pandemic. So this is not the revised April plan, but the one that we had before we knew what we were facing. In that comparison, our unit net cash costs for 2020 were 15% lower than the January 2020 guidance. EBITDA and operating cash flow improved by over 25%, capital spending was reduced by 29%. We also generated approximately $550 million in after-tax proceeds from the sale of non-cash flow producing assets that we disposed of this year. We ended the year with $2.7 billion lower debt than our original January plan. Think about that. Facing COVID, with all the uncertainties, having to make the changes, and then, coming back to do so much better than we set out to do before COVID was known about. This was accomplished in an average copper price realization of $2.95 for the year, to $0.10 per pound, well below the current price, the team did an outstanding job. We're strongly positioned for the future. In addition to the strong operating and financial performance in 2020, we achieved new milestones in the ESG area and that's shown on Slide 5. We committed to the Copper Mark. This is a new assurance framework developed by the International Copper Association and our Steve Higgins is now the President of ICA to promote and demonstrate responsible production practices focusing on meeting the United Nations' sustainability development goals. Big step forward. We established climate targets and added transparency with a new Climate Report, which is now available on our website. We took a leading role with ICMM, International Council of Metals and Mining, beginning over a year ago when it served as the industry representative in a multi-stakeholder initiative to develop a new tailing standard for the mining industry following the disasters in Brazil and then the subsequent development of implementation guidance for ICMM members. This was a major undertaking by the industry and by our Company, which took a lead in the process, and it reflects the importance of managing tailings storage facilities safely and responsibly. After serving two terms as Chairman of ICMM more than 10 years ago, I recently accepted a new term as Chairman. ICMM currently has 27 CEO Council Members from the largest global mining and metals companies, and I'm leading a strategic review of the organization to meet the increasing importance of ESG issues facing our industry. We advanced our inclusion and diversity initiatives which is core to our values at Freeport. We invest in our communities and continued to expand organizational resources in this effort. Workers' safety is our highest priority and we show that with what we did in response to COVID. Our safety statistics in 2020 measured by incidence rates met our targets. Fatality position continues to be a focus of our work safety management and regrettably, we had five fatalities in our operations last year. On Slide 6, you've heard me say for a long time that the copper price would benefit from its favorable fundamental outlook. Prices rose significantly in late 2020 in recognition of copper's favorable demand trends and the limited ability of the industry to increase supply. The recent price move is significant, but note that prices are still lower than they were just over 10 years ago or almost 10 years ago. Arguably, the fundamental outlook for copper today is better than it was 10 years ago. China is leading the recovery and global stimulus measures in countries around the world are also being positive for growth in copper demand. Freeport is a leading producer of copper and this commodity is critical to the economy of the future. It's essential to support global growth and broad scaled economic activity, but it is also essential and strategic for technologies required for the transition to a global, cleaner energy future that's on the front burner for everyone. More and more, we're seeing adoption of policies to reduce carbon emissions around the globe. 70% of the world's copper supply is used to deliver electricity. As clean energy initiatives are implemented, the intensity of copper use will increase. The chart on Slide 7 shows that copper utilization in electric vehicles and in the generation of renewable power is more than 4 times greater per unit than for our traditional vehicles and power generation. CRU estimates that copper demand for electrification and renewables will increase significantly over the coming years. In a relatively short timeframe, global demand just from these green initiatives could approximate the size of today's U.S. copper market. As demand accelerates, copper supply will continue to struggle to keep up and this supports the favorable near-term and long term fundamental outlook. As current situation echoes the early 2000s, when I became CEO of Freeport at a time when Chinese demand appeared and accelerate in such a dramatic fashion without a supply response, which created the commodity super cycle and sharp increases in copper prices very similar to what we're facing today. Turning to Indonesia on slide 8, our PTFI team is delivering really impressive results. During 2020, we built the momentum for the ramp up of our massive underground mines and by the fourth quarter, we had reached nearly 70% of the targeted annual run rates for sales volumes. This is something we were looking forward to beginning in the mid-1990s when we designed the original pit, which is now completed, and it's something that we've been investing in over the past 15 years. And to see it coming together like it is, is truly gratifying. And Mark Johnson and his team have just done an exceptional job. Continued growth during 2021 is expected to enable us to reach our full annualized targets by the end of this year. Considering the operating health challenges we faced in Papua, this is notable and striking. The team stayed on schedule, met our objectives, the project is massive and complex, and we did this by designing and maintaining effective COVID protocols for a very large workplace in a very challenging remote location. Our progress with the ramp-up has reduced risk for PTFI's underground mines significantly. The major risk as we started this was developing the infrastructure. Infrastructure is in place. There is always risk in mining. It's inherent in our business, but the major risks for this underground development are behind us and we are confident and have a track record of managing the types of risk we will be facing going forward. We can't make them go away, but we can manage them. And so we're really pleased with where we stand with that process. We are also continuing discussions currently regarding the new smelter in Indonesia. In early 2020, requested a delay in the agreed time schedule for completing of construction of the new smelter at a site in Eastern Java near Gresik, which is near the existing PT smelting facility. We haven't been able to progress work there because of COVID issues for the local workforce and international contracts. This is a greenfield smelter with a total cost of about $3 billion. That number continues to be refined and changed, and this project would be debt-financed but PTFI, the Indonesian entity. Over the last several months, PTFI and our partner and majority shareholder of PTFI, the Indonesian state-owned company MIND ID have been discussing with the government alternatives to this commitment to build a new smelter which was reflected in our IUPK mining license granted in December 2018. During the fourth quarter, we advanced discussions within the majority owner of the existing PT smelting facility at Gresik for a 30% expansion to add smelting capacity in Indonesia and partially satisfy our commitment to the government. Commercial and financing discussions with these expansions are being advanced, engineering is in progress. Initial estimates indicate that this project could be done for $250 million and be done efficiently in the current TCRC environment and it would partially meet our obligation to the government. Then separately, at the request of the government, PTFI is currently engaged in discussion with a third-party regarding the potential for the development of a new greenfield smelter at an alternate location away from Eastern Java. This project would be in lieu of PTFI's constructing the new greenfield smelter that I mentioned above. A third-party would lead the development for the smelter and arrange its financing. PTFI would commit to be a supplier of concentrate for the project, and the partners and the government are working expeditiously to reach a decision on the path forward. On Slide 10, we show our 2021 priorities for our ongoing efforts in creating values for our Company. We are building on the progress of 2020 by focusing on execution of plans to grow production volumes, manage costs, and capital spending efficiently. We're expanding our recent innovation efforts, supplying technology and innovative management processes in our operations around the world, and all of this, while we manage and are sensitive to our responsibilities to workers, communities, governments and other stakeholders. We look forward to resuming cash returns to shareholders during 2021. And we will be in a position to do that and we will be in discussions with our Board on taking actions. We will be in a period now for the long-term of harvesting cash flows now that we are completing the major long-term investment program in Indonesia. We are discussing with the Board a financial policy that would now enable a near-term resumption of the dividend and then, over time, a performance-based shareholder return policy. Significantly, we have recommenced work we suspended early in 2020 to evaluate and advance future organic growth opportunities from our large portfolio of undeveloped reserves and mineral resources. We look forward to doing that. The efforts of 2020 and work of our team over many years now, has enabled us to increase margins and cash flow substantially for 2021 and beyond. At $3.50 copper, we are on a path to nearly double EBITDA from 2020 levels. Copper sales for 2021 are projected to increase 20% over 2020. Gold volumes are projected to increase by over 50%, our unit net cash cost of production will decline. And this is occurring at a time of improved pricing for copper. I recall in an earlier conference call like this I said, an ideal situation for Freeport would be able to be completing the Grasberg expansion at the time of good copper prices. And here we are. The significantly higher cash flows will enable us to maintain a strong balance sheet, build value in our business. Returns substantial cash flows to shareholders. As shown on Slide 12, we have a long line portfolio of mineral reserves, reserve life for our proved and probable reserves of over 30 years. We have substantial options for the potential to expand our reserve base from our large inventory of mineral resources beyond reported reserves, all of this is associated with brownfield expansions of our existing ore bodies. What this means is that for our Company, to have long-term success, we are not required to have success in exploration. We hope we do. We're not required to do deals. Strategic opportunities may come to us, but we've got this base already in our portfolio that provides for a sustainable long-term future for Freeport. Slide 13 highlights the organic projects we are now assessing. During 2020, to conserve cash, we paused work on our expansion projects. We're now reengaged. Broad range of opportunities. During 2021, we will be developing a ranking of these projects to guide our thinking on sequencing and long-term planning. We have no plans to increase substantially capital spending on projects in the near term, but in the long-term, these growth opportunities will be approached in a measured and disciplined way. I'll close with Slide 14, which I have titled the Freeport Edge, which is a term we're using internally around our Company. Our management team at Freeport has extensive experience in managing this business. The leadership teams across the Company are seasoned, value-oriented, and intensely engaged. We have a management structure that is collaborative and experienced in working together and we're decisive, make a decision we execute. We recognize our responsibilities we undertake when we are granted harder and licensed to operate and we never cut corners on important issues. Looking at our team at Freeport, it's a combination of management with long tenure and experience. We also have a cadre of younger managers who bring new ideas, approaches and energies. We have strategic new hires, who bring outside perspectives. We've had three senior executives who've retired at the end of their careers over the last two years. Internal replacements were promoted and are performing effectively. And this just demonstrates the depth of talent in our organization. Freeport is foremost in copper. Our portfolio of assets is large, high-quality, well-established industry leader, operate mines that are among the largest in the world. Our assets have long lives and durable with embedded options, reserve, resource growth. We have strong operating franchises in the United States, South America, and Indonesia. We're a reliable supplier to the global copper industry. We have industry-leading technical capabilities, supported by our strong track record of project execution and business management over many years. We have earned the trust and respect of our partners, our customers, suppliers, financial markets, and most importantly, our workers, communities and host countries where we operate. Our block caving experience is among the most extensive and long-standing in the history of the global mining industry. We've been operating block caves in Indonesia since the early 1980s. We have an important molybdenum block caving operation in Colorado. And this is critically important as we transition Grasberg to be termed the largest block caving operation in the world. I'll close before turning to your questions by thanking our people and recognizing their strength, resiliency, and performance. I'm proud to be part of this team and I look forward to continue to be part of the team and to participate in our future successes. We will build on our accomplishments. As will be depicted on our 2020 Annual Report to shareholders, we are charging ahead responsibly, reliably, and relentlessly. Thank you for your attention. And operator, let's open the lines for questions. Kathleen, apologize for not - comments. I wasn't trying to cut you out. Okay. Let's have some questions. Okay. So with respect to the dividend, we're already there. We just \u2013 we have a - we'll have Board meetings early this year and we are going to sit down with the Board about a broader long-term financial policy that I made referenced to, and we'll be in a position to recommend to the Board to reinstate the dividend. But there is no need for further financial metrics with that new look at our improved financial situation Over when we were paying the dividend before. The issue with the growth project is one that requires more work and requires some time in evaluating the market as we go forward. They range in size, but the projects are large ones. We have a significant expansion opportunity in El Abra, in Chile, with our partner Codelco. And it's - on the order of the project, we did Cerro Verde several years ago. And we have series of projects in the U.S. that initially aren't as large, although down the road, there are some very large ones available. The U.S. has some advantages. Tax rates are very favorable and we have a very large loss carry forward. So we don't pay taxes in the U.S. for years to come. We own most of the lands and fees. So there is no royalties. And so when you cut out taxes and royalties in the U.S. versus foreign economics and with the favorable energy situation in the U.S., and community support for workers, there's just a lot of advantages there. So we had to suspend this work because of the uncertainties of COVID. We're now - Rick Coleman and his team are digging back into it and we are going to be doing trade-offs of these individual projects as we go forward in 2021 and we are able to report to you about our intentions. We are constantly approached by others in the industry who would like to be our partners in these projects. So there'll be a lot of opportunities there. And just to say, today, we are just resuming the work that we were engaged in previously. All right. Well, we're - the Grasberg block cave has gone extraordinarily well. I mean, it's an ore body that we knew well because it's the same ore body that we mined from the early 1990s to December 2019. So we know the ore body. It doesn't have some of the pressure situations that we've had to deal with at the Deep MLZ mine. And so when you just look at the advancement of the block caving operations, the development of draw bells and the way we've operated, we're just ahead of schedule. So it's nothing more than the team being very efficient, being ahead of schedule. No. It's just, as you mine an ore body and go forward, it's a dynamic situation and you update mine plans and reserves for the experience in the - it's just great to see the Grasberg block cave having this really positive development mode. I mean it's just special. Well, let me pick on a few words that you just said. First of all, Freeport - FCX, let's call the U.S. company FCX, the Indonesian entity PTFI, okay? We are a shareholder of PTFI. We own 49% of the shares. We have rights to operate under a shareholders' agreement, we be an FCX. MIND ID owns 51%. So it's a separate entity and it is the entity that would construct and finance the smelter. So it's no 50/50 sharing. I mean it is - it'd be financed in that entity, it's a substantial entity, with no external debt. From time-to-time, there is some borrowings from FCX, but \u2013 to meet working capital needs, but it's a substantial entity that clearly can debt finance this entity on its own. So that's the way this thing would be approached and financed. Now, we do consolidate that entity because of our operating rights. It's a very positive thing that we do have the ability to do that under the accounting rules because that way we can report it as part of our global operations. So to the extent that alternative is followed and PTFI takes the lead in constructing and financing the smelter, the debt that it incurs would be consolidated on our balance sheet, but it wouldn't be obligations of FCX to provide funding for it. So let me go back to one step. By expanding Gresik, we could downsize the greenfield smelter that PTFI would build, and the $3 billion number would be adjusted to be offset with the additional cost of the expansion. So at this point, I think it's fair to still consider - we may have ways of reducing the capital and we are working towards those, but to think about both those projects together and the precious metal facilities, all being a $3 billion project for PTFI. Now, this new alternative would result in not having to build the greenfield smelter. Another party would come in and do that, arrange it and finance it, so the debt would not be incurred by PTFI Okay. We're still in the process of negotiating TCRC rates for that. There will be some need for financial support because of the market, but there is an opportunity for us to end up in a much more favorable situation for PTFI if we are successful in these negotiations. And the government considers it positive because it would be a step in their own government initiatives to develop industry in Indonesia. This would tie into some nickel operations and potentially some downstream battery operations and the like for Indonesia. So strategically, the Government of Indonesia sees its positive. It could be positive for PTFI and so that's the basis for our deal. And now, we're in the process of negotiating the terms of that deal. Chris, I want to close with one thing, one reminder, I say this every time, but I just want to close with it. If we do go forward with our original commitment, build a smelter, just remember that the negative economics of that smelter are borne more than 70% by the Government of Indonesia because of taxes, royalties, their 51% equity ownership in PTFI. And so in essence, less than 30% of the negative economics of the smelter come back to FCX through its 49% share holding in PTFI. Many people seem to be assigning more negative value for FCX to this smelter than the economics really justify. And that's why we are aligned with the government in trying to make this as economic as possible. Thanks, Alex. Well... No, I was just going to - I will let you give the details, but Timna, you look back over time, some of our costs are correlated to the copper price. We have profit sharing for our workforce in Peru. So the more money we make there, the more our labor cost goes there. We've seen an uptick in energy cost recently from where they were earlier. So just inevitably, as the copper prices rise, we have some increases in unit costs and we are able to offset those, but not completely eliminate them through our cost efficiencies. But Kathleen, you go ahead or maybe you want to answer the second question too, Kathleen. So Timna, since I made that comment about Trump at your conference, we now have an older President than Trump. So maybe that extends my time frame. Personally, we've been through such a situation at Freeport really over my 30 years being here, but particularly over the last 10 years. And now that we are seeing the positive results of all of this work and particularly the recovery we made from five years ago, I'm healthy, I want to be part of it. I really enjoy and love the people I work with and we just have this incredible good spirit among our team. I do have a concern. That's why I made some of the comments on the last slide. Some people look at me and safe Freeport's an old company, maybe, but we really - if you look throughout our organization, we have a lot of young, experienced managers. With our longer-tenured people, we have great depth. We're showing we can sustain positions. When I do leave, we're going to have a sustainable company going forward, we're going to have a sustainable Board. We're working on that now. So anyway, it's been a crazy year for someone who traveled all the time to be working like I've worked - like how other people worked. But having the success with the Company which is not just a peak thing or an unusual thing, but this is - you look at the markets, inventories are low, there is elements of copper demand that are new, that are growing, supplies. I mean all of this is coming in place. And I think it's going to be - it was a great year for Freeport. I mean, we went from below $5 a share to be in the 8th best-performing stock in the S&P 500. I mean, how can you envision that. I mean that's a head spinner, but I think there is great things to come, and I want to be here and be part of it because we've worked so hard to get there. I should mention that Jim Bob died recently. He and I - I met him in my first year out of college as he was starting off McMoran and we were two different people, but we established a very good partnership. We brought different skills to bear in building Freeport. And in his later years, Jim Bob was focused on his oil and gas concepts, but he was always there. We did have a major disagreement. I mean, there is no way to hide it. Over the oil and gas deal in 2011, he thought it was a really good deal for the Company. I did not. The Board decided to do it and it caused us significant problems when commodity prices fell. He was very sick for a while, but I'm happy to say that in recent years, he and I established - in recent times he and I reestablished a really good personal relationship. And it was a sad day for all of us when he lost his life to COVID. Well, Mark's here. And Mark, I'll say a couple of things and maybe you can chime in. We have four underground mines there. The two major ones are the Grasberg block cave and the Deep MLZ, and each of those have separate headings. So this is not like a single mine or even two major mines, but a collection of mines with a common infrastructure. And as we've developed the access to the ore bodies and expanded those, that gives us a lot of flexibility to deal with operating issues that may come up with particular sections of the mine where we are mining. And maybe things like that will come up, wet muck, and so forth. We haven't had much of that yet. But here's where we are. We mentioned just how well Grasberg block cave is going and we are ahead of schedule on that. Grasberg - the Deep MLZ mine has had the challenges over time with having these seismicity events that are mining-related not natural. And we've implemented a program of using fracking technology to pre-condition the ore bodies so that could leave the pressures that cause these. We still face them from time-to-time, but we've got great procedures for dealing with it. There are different ore bodies, different settings. The Grasberg block cave is ahead. Deep MLZ is maybe a month or two behind. But Mark talk us little bit about your perceptions on how we're dealing with the Deep MLZ? And our volumes will be increasing. I mean we are 75%, 80% there now, but that will increase long-term. And what we try to do with our publicly disclosed guidance is be realistic. We don't try to do anything other than give you our current plans and what they are, and we will do better than that sometimes and sometimes, we may not. We also have an undeveloped ore body that we've been doing some work on that could add value for the future and that's an ore body called the Kucing Liar. It's ore body with high-grade material, has some pyrite in it. Mark and his team have come up with a revised plan to deal with that. It's about a $5 billion project spread over many years, a number of years in the future, but that's not near-term, but it's something that within the timeframe of our current IUPK will be something that will sustain and add value for PTFI Yes. And I'll just echo, I was involved with the structure for the original smelter development in the '90s, and Mitsubishi has just been an excellent partner. They couldn't have been better. They operate the smelter in a first-class way. The world of smelters has changed so much. In those days at Grasberg, we couldn't find places to place our concentrate. So we bought a smelter in Spain. We worked to build the smelter in Indonesia. The world has changed. There is such a global excess capacity of smelters, but Mitsubishi has been there through thick and thin and have just done remarkably good job. The answer to that is, yes. Well, it needs to be. I mean, we've got this deadline that we're working with the government to extend a year, but we have to get on with the Gresik area smelter or go along with this other thing, the government is in it. So it's going to be resolved clearly within that timeframe. Again, to be clear, when Kathleen says we, in that context, it's PTFI. Okay. Well, we are certainly in no rush. I do think it's a great asset of our Company, but we are not - we are going to continue our focus on getting this project in Indonesia completed and that's going to be - and running our Americas business efficiently and increasing volumes when we can and controlling costs and so forth. So there's certainly no rush. In the industry itself, there are some projects that were begun and delayed because of COVID. Over time, those are going to be completed, but you don't see any evidence of a big rush to start investments. And I don't expect that to occur. Mark, why don't you answer first, and I'll come back to the financial policy? Yes. And just a side comment, these other two mines that we have look tiny compared with Grasberg block cave and the Deep MLZ, but when you look at underground mines in the industry, those are substantial mines in and of themselves. This copper difference is just a rounding. I mean it's less than 1%. I mean, so we're right on plan for copper. And in the gold things, remember we had higher gold. Now we upgraded our gold for 2022. So every year there is going to be those kinds of adjustments. We're going to try to produce more gold, which we were able to do in 2020, and then we adjust our plans for that. So there is nothing here other than that we are right on our targets and everything is going as planned. The financial policy, I'll go back and say, what I've said before, we have ongoing informal discussions with Board members. We have formal Board members coming up. My anticipation is that there will be a restoration of our dividend and then a financial policy that will give guidance to the market of how we will be dividing cash flows in the future for further debt reduction. Although, quite frankly, we are - If you look at our cash flows that we talked to you about today and a $3.50 copper price, we are down to about $3 billion from net debt at the end of 2022. So we certainly can support higher level of debts. And that means there's plenty of cash to enhance cash returns to shareholders and then, have availability of funds, and depending on how we structure it, for future organic growth projects when we decide to initiate those. So restoration of dividend, financial policy that we will provide for increasing cash returns to shareholder over long-term with funds available for organic growth investments. Hi Kathleen, let me introduce Josh to the Group, okay, just briefly. Beginning September 1, Josh became our Senior Operating Manager for the Americas, a Senior Vice President. He's been with the Company 28 years and he is only 50 years old or so, but he has progressively risen in the organization, had senior leadership roles at several of our operating sites in the U.S. and South America. And over the past four years, his leadership role has grown as he worked with Red Conger who retired. And he has just been doing a great job and he's brought an energy to. He is very teamwork focused. Our other operating managers are coalescing around him. He works very well with our technical group and with our financial administrative group. So Josh Olmsted, why don't you follow-up Kathleen's comments. And back to the point about Freeport operating all the assets, we benefit from all being on the same system. And so this data analytics work that we're doing, really can be compared and shared across the company and collaborate, and really take the best of each of the operations and apply that to the portfolio. And we're starting to do some work with Mark and his team on different things as well. So as Josh was saying, it's really some synergies here and the work that we did in 2020 allowed us really to kind of take some of this on our own and down and drive it. So more to come on that. So we are working remotely, Lucas. If we were sitting as we normally do around our conference desk in Phoenix, Kathleen will be kicking me out on the table because that question is just like giving a monkey a machine gun. 2003, we had gone through a real tough time in copper with the economic issues of the late 1990s, the global recession, the global slowdown. Copper prices had dropped at one point to below $0.70. And I recall and it was at - Timna at a Merrill Lynch conference in Ireland, that was my first conference as CEO. It was right before my CEO and the price of copper had just dipped over $0.70. Nobody in the industry thought it could go beyond $1 within the foreseeable future and everybody was running the business. So what happened? China emerged in a way nobody expected. Created a whole new element of demand. Historically, whenever copper prices jumped up, the industry had projects primarily in Latin America to invest in. And the industry was widely divided and there'll be new investment. Supplies would come on, business cycle with turn down and copper prices withdraw. At this time China added in 2003 a permanent element of new demand that was beyond the traditional demand from copper that was tied into global industrial production. And there was widespread expectation that the industry would invest and add new supplies. I remember my partner Chip Goodyear got up at that conference and said, in the conference, he hope that the price wouldn't rise too much because it would create uneconomic investment. Well, what happened was the industry started looking for new projects then, and geologically, they weren't there and there were all these other barriers to investment. So we had higher prices without a supply response. That led us to do the Phelps Dodge deal in 2007. Our market cap in 2003 was $6 billion. It was $12 billion at the Phelps Dodge. We did a $38 billion business combination, the biggest in the industry. Lived through the financial crisis and then emerged in 2011 as a company with a $60 billion market cap and no debt. So what do we like here? The reason that I feel this is an echo is that we still have a world that's being burdened by the economic slowdown with COVID. While there has been recoveries in pockets of the economy, there has been stimulus by governments and China has recovered much faster than we heard about earlier I think about a world where we had a slow down to the extent we did in 2020, and copper inventories are at levels that we hadn't seen since the mid-2000s. And so here we are and we just talked about how there is not a huge rush to invest in new projects. All the major companies want to grow. Copper is part of their portfolios. That's been the case since the mid-2000s and they've been challenged in doing that. Projects today around the world geologically are more difficult, less quality than they were, underground lower grades. You look at Cerro Verde, [Covid pandemic] these are big low-grade projects that require huge investments in infrastructure and equipment, and mill processing. And then you have these barriers to production that keep some attractive projects in and around the world from going forward. You have political issues in countries that - and Africa is challenged, Latin Americas having political issues, Indonesia has been what it's been. So I do feel that if the world's global economy recovers in a reasonable way, not in an extreme way and we have this big move toward - look at all the stats that are coming about for electric vehicles in the United States. I mean think about what General Motors is doing and what China is doing? You think about the change in the global perception about climate change. In the United States, forest fires, hurricanes, I mean this is something that's going to have to be addressed. And when it is addressed, it's going to require tremendous amounts of infrastructure spending, extraordinary amounts and in all of those elements of spending there is an element of copper of significance into it. So that's why I feel like we are echoing 2003 today. So, again, I look over the shoulder. If you look back at Freeport, when copper prices begin rising in 2003, 2004, we returned tremendous amounts of cash to investors out of Grasberg. We were like a royalty trust or an MLP or something. Then after Phelps Dodge, we delevered very quickly and we start returning and paying dividends again. And we were well positioned in 2011 to continue to do that. The Board decided to invest in oil and gas and took it away. So here we are coming back from the situation that we are now. We don't need a commodities boom to generate lots of cash to return to shareholders. At $3.50 copper you see what the numbers are. I think copper could go much higher than $3.50. I can't guarantee it, but in my gut and Timna that's one of the reasons I want to keep working, I think it's going to be really a special time. And when that happens, we will be able to really return cash to shareholders in a substantial way. This question of investing, I mean, right now, money is so cheap you wouldn't want to bring in a joint venture partner. That may not stay that way forever, but financing is incredibly cheap and available. And I wish Phelps Dodge hadn't given up the interest in the Red Sea or the interest in Cerro Verde. So if we got good projects, we will look at the most efficient way to finance it. That could well be - could be partners because lots of people want to be our partners. And then others may have projects that we have the opportunity to join in on. There could be opportunities in M&A market, but all of that is part of this really bright future that I see for Freeport. The vision right now is focused on getting 2021 to be a successful as 2020 was. And when that happens and we got long-term run rates at Grasberg. Josh and his team has fine-tuned our business in the Americas. We got this Lone Star project, don't overlook that. That could be a new Morenci down the road. This is just a Company that's really well situated to generate cash, not have to do anything to have a sustainable future, but having the world open to us to do lots of different things. It's really, really exciting. All right. Thank you all for participating. We look forward to reporting our progress in 2021. And take care. Take care of yourselves, your families and the people around you. We're not over the hump yet on COVID, but just hang in there. Life is going to get better. Thanks for participating."

            "content": "Yes. Chris, Deep MLZ, as Richard mentioned, in the fourth quarter, we were ahead on all the development aspects. We are on target on draw belling, undercutting. And where we had some challenges was in just the material flow. And what I mean from there, is taking the material from the extraction level, getting it through the rock breaker, getting it to the grizzlies, through the internal ore passes, the 60-meter long ore passes and getting them into the trucks to take it to the crusher. The problems that we had there was, we deal everything from very, very cause rocky material to fine sticky material and we're coming up with methods that I'm confident will address that, that allow us to take both the big stuff and the fine stuff and run them through these ore passes. It's something that we saw at the initial stages of DOZ, and we're working our way through that. On the GBC, the Grasberg block cave, we had a very good year. We were on draw billing undercutting. We were ahead on our tonnage rates for the fourth quarter, marginally ahead and we're in a good position there. We build our second - we will complete the second pressure GBC in April of this year, which will be a major milestone. We continue to develop the rail haulage and that is a major milestone that we will achieve in the second quarter and let these trains run in a loop rather than out and back, and that's going to increase our production from our overall mine system. So both mines are tracking well. And as Richard mentioned, we do have DOZ. It's a mature mine, but it hit targets. Big Gossan our stope mine, was - we had very good results this last year, last quarter, in particular. So we've had some pluses and minuses, but overall, we're in a very good position entering this year. And particularly in the GBC, we've hit our peak in our draw belling in 2020. And just associated with mine plan and consistent with our long-range plans, that starts to tail off. We don't need as many draw bells to continue to sustain the ramp-up in production. Deep MLZ will pretty much stay steady for the next three years on draw belling and undercutting. So the next two years is really just doing more of the same, of growing these mines. There is no real rate increase in the amount of development. In fact, it's flatter or dropping off. And it's just a matter of continuing to be very consistent in how going forward as to what we've been able to demonstrate over the last couple of years and particularly in 2020. Yes. There is not any issue on the draw bell opening. If there was a reduction, it's very, very minor. We've been very consistent. We ended the fourth quarter with 15 draw bells within the Deep MLZ blasted and that's going to be relatively our flat rate. There might have been some ones or twos that are different, but it's not anything that was significant in our forecast. As Richard mentioned it's more about this, where we are in the ramping up of the tons and it's more in line. Any changes in the tonnage is more a reflection of this material flow, challenge that we're undertaking. But it's just marginally behind and at the same time, the GBC is marginally ahead. And so the, ramp-up rates are very consistent from one forecast to the other. Some slight changes in grades that are nothing significant, it's not drilling results, it's not any changes in reserves. It's simply where we're actually drawing. There is some - at the end of every quarter, we reflect what we've done and we built that into what we're doing forward. So there is really no significant change in our underground plans both at Deep MLZ and GBC. The other two mines DOZ and Big Gossan are both very consistent. In fact, in Big Gossan we've changed our stope sequencing a bit. That's going to add some metal. So we continue to look for opportunities and to reflect our actual production and operational over the previous quarters."

Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nKathleen Quirk: Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan third quarter conference call. Earlier this morning, we reported our third quarter 2020 operating and financial results, and a copy of today's press release and slides are available on our website at fcx.com. Our call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call, and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. I'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, each filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. On the call today is Richard Adkerson; Mark Johnson is also on the call; Josh Olmsted; Mike Kendrick; Steve Higgins; and Rick Coleman. I'll start by briefly summarizing the quarter's financial results and then we'll turn the call over to Richard, who will review the slide materials. And we'll then open up the call for questions. Today, FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of $329 million, or $0.22 per share for the third quarter of 2020. After taking into account, debt extinguishment costs associated with our refinancings during the quarter and other non-recurring net charges totaling $101 million, or $0.07 per share, adjusted net income attributable to common stock totaled $430 million, or $0.29 per share. These special items can be reviewed on Page VII of our press release. Our adjusted earnings before interest taxes and depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, totaled $1.4 billion for the third quarter of 2020, and a reconciliation of the EBITDA calculation is available on Page 32 of our slide deck. Our third quarter results benefited from improved pricing for both copper and gold, strong copper and gold sales volumes that were above the prior estimates and solid cost performance. The average realized price during the quarter for copper was $3.01 per pound that was 15% above the year ago average and the third quarter realized gold price of just over $1,900 per ounce was 28% above the year ago quarterly average. We generated strong cash flows in the quarter. Our operating cash flows totaled $1.2 billion and exceeded roughly $400 million of capital expenditures during the quarter. We ended the quarter with $10 billion of total debt and our consolidated cash position grew during the quarter from $1.5 billion at the start of the period to total $2.4 billion at the end of the quarter. I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to our slide materials.\nRichard Adkerson: Thanks, Kathleen, and good morning everyone. Thank you all for participating in today's call. I hope you and your families and your colleagues are all staying well and safe. This corona virus situation is not ended. We at Freeport are not letting up our guard in any fashion. We remain focused on protecting the health and safety of our people and the communities where we work, and we're all looking forward to a medical solution, which will come in time. In the meantime, though, we are staying diligent with our health protocols and we're also being conservative in the way we continue to run our business. And this has proved, served us well over the last six months. I'm really proud of our Freeport team for the aggressive response we developed as an organization, how we've executed the plans that we announced just six months ago, it seems like a decade ago, but it was at the end of April when we announced plans that was well received by our company and the market to take steps to reduce cost, capital cost, operating cost and G&A cost, suspend some low margin production. And we put those plans in place and we really went after them in an aggressive way and it served us well. Turning \u2013 starting with Slide 3, we present the highlights for the quarter and it's notable just how much cash flow we're generating. We've been talking about this for a long time [indiscernible] finally arrived for Freeport. This is the quarter where all this work that we've been doing for years and years is beginning to show, is beginning to show its presence. This free cash flow generation will actually accelerate as we go forward into the fourth quarter, into 2021. And by the end of 2021, we'll reach really a \u2013 relatively steady state of volumes and that extends for the 20 years beyond than our current contract rights extend to. But as you see clearly our sales volumes, our cost and capital performances were favorable to the estimates we provided to market three months ago. Our Grasberg team achieved its quarterly sales targets and continue to make excellent progress with the ramp up of our large underground mines, the Grasberg Block Cave, and the Deep MLZ mine. In Arizona, we completed The Lone Star project during the quarter. It was completed on time and below budget. In the bottom line, we generated substantial cash flows in the quarter, reduced our net debt in this quarter by $800 million. And this was all achieved operating safely in a challenging environment because of the pandemic. Our team maintained its focus on the health of our workers in our protocols and showed real drive and commitment in executing our plans while managing this health issue. As an organization, we're all stepping up to meet this challenge. We met challenges effectively in the past. Turning to Slide 4, this is LME Week and it's a strange deal and I being in London, last night would have been the night of our Freeport reception such a fun event and it's disappointing not to be there. We distributed a video to people. And if you didn't get it, contact David and we'll get it to you, but just a lot of fun looking at the video and thinking about all the good times I've had in London and looking forward to coming back next year. But you know thinking about LME Week and the times we're facing right now really makes us all very pleased to be a company that's the leading producer of copper and copper is critical to the economy of the world, has been, but even more so as we look to the future. Copper is absolutely essential and strategic to the technologies that the world is moving to transition to global clean energy future. And more and more we're seeing the adoption of policies both in community and governments, but by companies to reduce carbon emissions. This initiative is no longer being debated as to whether it's needed or not, but there is a real commitment now to accelerate. And as a result of the steps that will be required to reduce carbon, the intensity of the use of copper in those application is really significant. Copper utilization in electric vehicles and the generation of renewable power requires four times more copper per unit than traditional internal combustion vehicles require and traditional power generation requires. The coming transition to 5G technology will be positive from copper with required data centers to supporting infrastructure with lots of new copper wiring required to support 5G. These major trends, which are in place and irreversible, will bring significant new sources of demand for copper. And that will supplement the already significant requirements for copper to fund global growth in the developing world. We are committed at Freeport to being a responsible producer of copper, which is a very favorable metal in terms of these positive ESG factors going forward. In addition to Freeport's commitment to the International Council on Mining and Metals, where I just returned as Chairman after serving 10 years ago, during the third quarter, we committed to the Copper Mark, which is a new assurance framework developed by The International Copper Association that's specific to the copper industry that demonstrates responsible production practices and how operations for copper can contribute to the UN sustainable development goals, and we're fully committed to these things. Currently in the market conditions, thinking back to six months ago, none of us would have anticipated that we would be today just six months later after facing the industrial downturn that was accelerating at that time. And all of the uncertainties from a health and economic standpoints to think that here we would be at the end of our third quarter in such a favorable market condition. And this has been led by the really dramatic recovery of the Chinese economy and demand that's generated for copper. Economic conditions in other parts of the world continue to face uncertainties. And we are certainly sensitive to those uncertainties. And as I said, we're not letting our guard down. But we're encouraged by these demand trends in China. And then we look at global stimulus measures and decarbonization initiatives, which are also supportive of copper demand. At a time when supplies of copper remain limited, and this supply effect has been really emphasized by what we'd gone on with the COVID situation. Prices have recovered from the lows earlier this year. You may recall that we were preparing for a scenario of $2 copper and year-to-date we have copper that $3.15 that's pretty remarkable. But the fundamentals of copper market are increasingly attractive. We put together a slide on five to give a historical perspective on these copper markets. And thinking back, they're really strong similarities and parallels to what we've seen earlier. In the early 2000s, when the world was coming out of the global recession, there was policy driven demand particularly in copper combined with limited new supplies, which was a new factor in the market at that time. And that drove a major repricing of copper to kick off the commodity super cycle. Then again in 2009 following the global financial crisis that emerged in 2008, China again led a significant and unexpected recovery in copper prices, which crisis \u2013 when crisis increased over three times from the lows with that 24-month period. In each of these times, FCX share price performed strongly. On the right side of the chart, which shows what's happened since March, copper \u2013 it's notable and this is something that I think is striking and it's different. The copper inventories have declined even with the major downturn in the global economy. You could have ever thought that the U.S. GNP would drop by a third in the second quarter and copper inventories would not have risen. The global pandemic resulted in disruption of supply as well as demand of course. And with low inventories and limited new supply, the market is positioned for additional gains. As we look forward to a medical solution to COVID-19 and for our economies to recover with major copper intensive infrastructure spending on the horizon. Again, in the past, when the downturn occurred, inventory spills, the inventories had to be run off. We don't have that this time. We have low inventories. And so with recovery, we were better positioned to see copper perform strongly. Now turning to our company, the challenge for us in 2020, unlike these earlier times, when we faced downturns was a long list, the lower prices driven by COVID-19. We were at a time of trough production at Grasberg. We completed mining the Grasberg open pit at the end of 2019. We couldn't even begin to ramp up in any significant way of the Grasberg Block Cave ore body, which is our largest underground ore body until we were complete mining in the pit. So all of this started and production dropped from the pit, it was at low levels from the underground, and then we get hit with a low copper prices from COVID and operational challenges in the Americas, because of their situation and so that makes what's happened for our company over the last six months, really, really special. Our team in the Americas continues to do great work, executing our plans, and the plans were aggressive and challenging. You can see the results of the execution in our financial results. We made the decision to complete the initial Lone Star development project, which is located right in the heart of our operations in Eastern Arizona. This is a relatively small, but very positive returns initial project. And it opens the opportunity for a very large future significant project. The team at Cerro Verde in Peru has done exceptional work in restoring our large scale operations there. They were really challenged by COVID. Our people at Cerro Verde lived in the town of Arequipa, which was facing a challenging community situation with COVID where they work with the local community and with the government to restore operations. We've done that largely. We've had to keep a sharp focus on cost and capital management. We had one mine, an older mine in New Mexico that we shut down operations because of COVID situation where now taking actions to restart that mine next year at a much reduced rate, a smaller footprint will allow us to achieve cost in capital benefits from as compared with prior operations. On the call today, Josh Olmsted and I want to recognize him and congratulate him on his expanded new role in managing our operations in the Americas. Josh was named Chief Operating Officer for the Americas in August, following Red Conger\u2019s departure. Red was great friend and long time employee who decided to move for family reasons. And we congratulate him and wish him well. Josh was Red\u2019s right hand guy for \u2013 along with the rest of our team for recent years. He's an experienced operator; a really good, strong inspirational leader has been with our company 28 years. He has worked in leadership roles at a number of our operations across our Americas assets. Josh is really highly qualified and well prepared for success in this new role. He's off to a great start. He's been a key driver of our innovation initiatives, which all of our team is committed to and is committed to having a high performance culture. The really good thing is Josh has a terrific team around him. We have really significant technical depth world-class in every respect. And we all look forward to working together with him and his team to accomplish both we have for us opportunities going forward. At Grasberg, our third core annual sale volumes on an annualized basis reached 58% of the targeted annual run rate post ramp up. And I want you to focus on this. We generate all these cash flows by being at less than 60% of our targets of where we're going to, and we're making progress on reaching those targets. For so long, I've been talking at these calls about looking at this ramp up. It's not like starting a new operation with a one point in time startup, but it was a process \u2013 a process of increasing volumes with 58% of the target, and you saw we generated this level of cash flows. So as we increase that ramp up volumes grow, cash flows will grow as well. It wasn't without its challenges this past quarter. We had a COVID related labor disruption that we had to deal with. We were actually shut down for four or five days this week, worked with a group of indigenous workers in our workforce who wanted to be able to return to the Lowlands where many of their families lived. We had restricted travel. We had to negotiate a resolution with that. We also had some maintenance issues with the material handling. So it's notable, and we're going to have situations that are inherent part of mining as we go forward. But here's the quarter where we had to deal with temporary shutdown, some unscheduled maintenance issues. And yet we were able to meet our metals target. By the end of the quarter, the mining rates at the Grasberg Block Cave in the deep MLZ had reached targeted levels. We continue to target metal production that will approach 90% of the ramp up targets by the middle of next year, middle of 2021. Unit cost \u2013 note that the unit cost for Grasberg in the third quarter averaged $0.13 a pound. Grasberg of course has this really significant gold component in its ore which at full production rates makes it the largest gold mine in the world, even though it's a byproduct production, but using current gold prices, I'm looking forward. If prices stay at this level, global revenues will fund all of the costs of operations for Grasberg. And we'll be producing over 1.5 billion pounds of copper a year. With full ramp-up that we'll reach at the end of 2021 at a zero or negative unit cost. In Indonesia, I mentioned that the discussions about the new smelter are ongoing; they're being led by our partner, MIND ID interlude. PT-FI requested a 12-month delay in construction of the smelter that we had committed to because of COVID issues, which affects international contractors and local workers. The government is in the process of assessing alternatives to building a new smelter. No decision has been reached. The discussions are going being led by MIND ID and the Ministry of State Owned Enterprises. The alternatives that are under consideration will be mutually beneficial to the government, first of all, and to PT-FI. We will keep you informed as developments occur going forward. I will note that our partnership that we established with the Government of Indonesia and the structure for governance in operating management that we established in December 2018 is really going well. The partnership is strong and mutually supportive. We and the government through the State Owned Enterprise and the Ministry of State Owned Enterprises, the Ministry of Mines, the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Finance, we're all fully aligned now in our objectives of creating value for all stakeholders. We're working together and that's a huge positive development for Freeport and for the asset itself. Slide 7. We're focused on execution, that's what we've been saying for so long. And that's what the results show that we have been successful in doing, but we're focused on executing and continued success will drive strong and improving results. We're now on a path to double EBITDA from 2020 levels as we go forward. Execution of these plans all well underway, biggest risks are behind this. There are always be risk with the biggest risk behind us will allow us to grow our copper volumes by 20% in 2021; gold volumes by 70%, that would result in a reduction in net unit cost by 20% for the company and completely expand \u2013 significantly expand margins and cash flows. You see this in our third quarter results, our financial performance will improve throughout 2021. Our current operating rates as I mentioned earlier extend to 2041 with six fiscal terms. This will allow PT-FI to generate massive future cash flows from this set of remarkable copper and gold resources. Our company is going to stay focused on execution. As we complete this transition at Grasberg, we are deferring any decisions about major investments and as we go forward with the higher cash flows that we generated, we'll be able to reduce our debt and further improve our balance sheet to see what we've done this quarter? I'm confident that in 2021, we'll be in a position to recommend to our Board a resumption of our dividend for the Board to consider. And that as we go forward, we will be able to generate increasing returns to shareholders from higher cash flows. In addition, we'll have opportunities to consider significant growth from large scale low cost \u2013 low risk, high return, disciplined Brownfield investments in our large portfolio of undeveloped reserves and resources. Freeport can maintain its production, grow its production without having success and refilled expiration, which we all do or without having \u2013 without having to do any M&A deals. Slide 8 shows this, we have a long live portfolio of mineral reserves with recoverable reserves extends beyond 30 years with substantial options to expand these reserves in the future considering our large inventory of mineralized material with our resources beyond current proved and probable reserves. For now however, I want to reemphasize again, we're focused on executing our plans efficiently, delivering on our targets, as we go forward we'll be accessing growth options in a measured and disciplined way. I'll close with Slide 9, with what we adopted internally as the Freeport Edge. Our management team has had extensive experience in managing this business responsibility. We've been together a long time now. Leadership teams across the company are seasoned, battle hardened, value oriented. We're all intentionally engaged in it. That's one thing I keep talking about our work during 2020. It has been really intense, but our people are energetic, highly motivated. We have an action oriented management structure. We work together collaboratively. We're experienced decisive, never cut corners on important issues like worker safety, community responsibilities, environmental obligations. We keep a long-term focus on our licensed operators around the world. We work hard to earn this and to keep it. We know, and we've had a long history of operating on the premise that our shareholders cannot succeed, unless all stakeholders in our businesses succeed. Freeport is clearly on a global basis foremost in copper. A portfolio of assets are large high quality when established industry leader, great track record, operate mines, developed mines among the largest in the world. Our assets are long lived durable with embedded options for reserve and resource growth. Strong franchises in the U.S., South America and Indonesia. Industry-leading technical capabilities with a strong track record of project execution around the world that we're many years. We've earned the trust and respect of our partners, our customers, our suppliers to financial markets; most importantly, our workers communities in those countries. Notably our block caving experience is if not the most, one of the most extensive and long stating in the history of the global mining industry. And that's so critically important for success, both in the ramp of at Grasberg and being able to continue to execute our plans over the next 20 years. This is not for the faint of heart. We've been operating block cave mines in Indonesia since the early 1980s, and we have an important molybdenum block caving operation in our Henderson mine in Colorado. This is critically important as we tradition Grasberg from the largest \u2013 from this enormous surface mine that we completed at the end of 2018 to the largest block caving operation in the history of the mining industry. Our team has demonstrated capabilities in good times and bad, and I want to close by thanking our people, recognizing their strength and resilience to your dedication. And now this is performance that's evidence in today's report. I'm personally proud to be part of this team. I look forward to the success we're going to have before us in the future. We're all motivated and committed to persevere and to achieve the success for the benefit of all of our stakeholders. So thank you for that. And now I will return \u2013 I will turn the presentation over to Kathleen to talk about some financial matters.\nKathleen Quirk: Okay, great. Thanks, Richard. I'll just make some brief comments on financial matters so we can take your questions. As you'll see in the materials, our guidance is very similar to our prior guidance. We have incorporated the plan restart of Chino that Richard mentioned, and that's reflected in the guidance. But I just really wanted to make three points. The first one is, as Richard has said, we're continuing to focus on execution of his plan, which will generate growing cash flows and margins. Clearly the Grasberg underground ramp-up is making great progress, and we're building that on that momentum each quarter. I wanted to mention the cost benefits that we're seeing and the ongoing capital management programs. We now feel that were successfully implemented the plan that we laid out in April. I think when you look at the cash cost in the quarter of $1.32 per pound, and compare that to where we were in the first quarter of this year, you see a 30% reduction in that unit cash costs; also a 30% reduction in capital spending levels. With the increased volumes that we have coming in 2021 at very low incremental costs, we expect our unit net cash costs will decline below $1.20 per pound next year. So we're remaining focused on sustaining all of these costs and capital management programs. We've also implemented savings in a number of other areas, including in general administrative costs, which as you see in the third quarter were over 30% below the first quarter 2020 levels. The second point is, you know, and Richard made this point as well. So the third quarter really demonstrates the growing cash flow generating capacity of the business. We had $1.4 billion in EBITDA during the quarter, and $1.2 billion in operating cash flow, and our volumes are continuing to grow. We expect to continue building volumes during 2021 and using $3 to $3.50 copper, we would average between $7.4 billion to $9.4 billion per annum in EBITDA for 2021 and 2022. And generate nearly $5 billion to over $6 billion in operating cash flow with $2 billion of capital expenditures; so very focused on free cash flow generation as we look forward. And the third point is that our balance sheet and financial position are very strong. As you'll see in the slide materials, the net data is expected to decline rapidly and consent continued execution and performance will allow our board to consider a resumption of dividends in 2021 and increasing shareholder returns over time. As Richard mentioned, we're also continuing to assess the sequence of our future organic projects. We expect to be in a great position, really to maintain a strong balance sheet, provide returns to shareholders and invest in value enhancing projects that are embedded in our portfolio as market conditions warrant. So that concludes our prepared remarks. And operator, we will not take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question, our first question comes from the line of Alex Hacking with Citi. Please go ahead.\nAlex Hacking: Yes. Good morning, Richard and Kathleen, and thanks for the presentations. I'll ask two questions if it's okay. The first question on the dividend, Richard, you mentioned restarting the dividend next year. Any thoughts on how that would be structured, percentage payout in that debt target something like that? And the second quick one if I may, just the copper grade at Grasberg is very, very strong during the quarter. Should we read anything into this? Are grades coming in ahead of your geological models or this was just some variance that we shouldn't read much into? Thank you.\nRichard Adkerson: So, you know, on the dividend, it's really going to be something that we haven't teed-up for the board yet. We're really focused on getting through this year and going forward. But we are giving thought to this idea as we make further progress on getting to our targets is to how to establish a policy for the dividend. We won't, as I mentioned, we want to take steps to reduce debt. We're on track to doing that. We will likely take a first step of restoring the dividend, but then we will have the opportunity of doing as you said of establishing a financial policy and looking for further shareholder returns, growing shareholder returns in the future, that could be in the form of dividends and depending on how the equity market reacts, we would have the option of looking at stock buy backs. But at this point we're not \u2013 we have not really engaged with the Board to establish a specific policy. Mark, do you want to comment on the grade situation?\nMark Johnson: Sure. Yes. Alex, where we're at right now in the Deep MLZ, we're mining some of the highest grade sections of the [indiscernible] sections of the ore body. Estimation of these very high grade zones is always a challenge for our modelers. The concern is always that we take high grade intercepts and smear them over too broad of an area and caused overestimation. So we've taken a conservative but appropriate modeling approach. So the grades that you've seen are a bit of a positive variance that we've had really for the last six months. We believe our overall global estimate is appropriate. We didn't do anything with our sequencing of the cave. We followed our cave management plan and really the grades just came to us more or less as a bit of a positive surprise. But if you look at the grades individually, Deep MLZ is very high grade, it's close to 1.9% and gold grades are about 1.8%. And what we saw was a bit higher than expected grades in that very high grade portion of the mine.\nKathleen Quirk: And one of the things that Mark is doing, and the team out there is doing is really focused on the long-term plan. And so, as Mark said, we're following the sequencing to maximize the long-term values and not try to look for short-term wins and they're really doing a good job of staying disciplined on that program.\nAlex Hacking: Great. Thank you so much. And I should say congratulations on the very strong cash flow in the quarter. Thanks.\nRichard Adkerson: Thanks, Alex.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners with Bank of America.\nTimna Tanners: Yes. Hey, good morning everyone. And thanks for the update.\nRichard Adkerson: Okay. Hey, Timna.\nKathleen Quirk: Good morning.\nTimna Tanners: I wanted to ask two questions, also I suppose, I'm really curious about the Gresik smelter alternatives and the update there. I know you alluded to some ongoing negotiations. I'm just wondering if you could, if it's more than just a delay, if you could give us any color on what that might look like. And then I'll follow up with the second question.\nRichard Adkerson: So an alternative would be rather than building a new smelter as to expanding the existing Gresik smelter and adding a precious metals refinery to it. That could not be expanded to a size to take all of our future concentrate production, so there it would have to be an agreement allowing us to export the excess. And we were proposing if that's a allowed, I'm going to say if we as PT-FI and this is being led by the state owned ministries in the internal discussions within the government that would involve paying an export fee on that. The benefits would be, we would avoid having to undertake this major new construction project and the financial benefits are really positive for the government. And so with the government, like all other countries around the world, seeing its financial situation being challenged by COVID this is \u2013 this has some fundamental attractions to the government. As you know, when we reached our agreement in 2018, a feature of that agreement was a commitment by PT-FI to build a new smelter that we had years of discussions about that because it is uneconomic to everyone. But to get the deal accomplished in 2018, we had to commit to do that and that commitment's in place. So it's really in the government's hands about what they decide to do, but this issue of the financial benefits to the government is a significant one.\nTimna Tanners: Okay. That's super helpful. Thank you. And I don't want to take away from all the Grasberg progress and success, but starting to think actually about the next generation of projects and initiatives for the company. I know you've alluded to other projects. Can you kind of run through with us where you prioritize the different options and alternatives out there? So we can start thinking about what's around the corner?\nRichard Adkerson: I can point to them. We haven't prioritized them yet. We've done some initial pre-feasibility, feasibility type work. We actually suspended some of that as part of our cost reduction efforts in April. But we have a significant opportunity in Chile with our El Abra project where we're essentially 50/50 partners with CODELCO. It has a significant sulfide deposit. It would be a major development project involving a water desalinization plant, but a project from the order of our Cerro Verde expansion, but it has an attractive ore body to consider. And then in the U.S. we have a series of Brownfield expansions at mines ranging from our Bagdad mine in Northwest Arizona. There's in the future a very large sulfide opportunity at Morenci, this Lone Star property as we've mine the oxide cap, we're exposing what looks to be a very significant sulfide resource, which I believe will be developed. The U.S. opportunities have some economic advantage. We own all of our lands in the U.S. essentially all of our lands and sea; so there's no royalties. The tax situation is very favorable and we have a big NOL carry forward. So when have the ability to develop resources with no taxes, no royalties, that's a big, big fundamental economic advantage. So as we go forward, we'll be doing a trade-off studies and making decisions about where and when to invest, that's in the future. We have a long line of potential partners who are interested in working with us. That'd be something we could consider. But right now, we're going to continue to focus and achieve the kind of success for the next few quarters like you saw in this third quarter.\nTimna Tanners: Okay. Super. Thanks for all the detail.\nKathleen Quirk: Thank you, Timna.\nRichard Adkerson: Okay.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank.\nChris Terry: Hi, Richard and Kathleen. A couple of questions from me. First on Grasberg, just on the development rights for the quarter; I think you said you try to be at 90% by the middle of next year. Just wondering if the third quarter exit rate, that was just looking at the chart from last quarter and slide pack, I think that 94,000 tons is back on track. I just wondered if he could give some details, a bit more specifically on during the quarter, some of those hiccups if so, you said COVID 4 to 5 days. Was there anything else in there? And basically what the messages sending, I think is at the end of the quarter you're back onto the chart? The progress chart, that's my first question, I'll start with that.\nKathleen Quirk: That's right, Chris. We did have the five day outage for the work stoppage, and then we had some overflow maintenance that was unplanned during the period. And by the end of the quarter we had gotten back to the rates and Mark and his team do an update every quarter and went through the five year forecast. And essentially there was a very little change in our ramp-up. So we're still \u2013 we're still on track with the getting to a 90% of the run rate by mid next year.\nRichard Adkerson: Okay. I think on every one of these calls, we noted that there will be things we'll have to deal with from time to time just to inherit the nature of mining. And what I say is the fact that we had these and we're still able to have this kind of quarter. So as we go forward and as we open up more access to these ore bodies, that gives us more flexibility. If we do have some issues to deal with offsetting those by adjusting our operations because of this greater access that continues to emerge.\nChris Terry: Okay. Thanks. Thanks, Richard. The follow-up question I had is just around the dividend. I know you commented before that it's early days, but just wanted to get an update on the target net debt level. I think you previously talked about 5 billion it's been around that level that you would think about the dividend. Is that still the thinking on 5 billion more correctly is about the level of net debt that you're targeting. So then you can explore other options. You're obviously at 7.6 billion now. So that's still how we should think about the timing of the dividend when you break it up that level?\nRichard Adkerson: We said that back five years ago, we set a target of reducing what was then $20 billion of debt to five \u2013 by reducing $20 billion by $5 billion to $10 billion. So that's the $5 billion, nothing magic about it. In fact, in those earlier years that I referred to when we started generating so much cash in both of those cases, we totally paid off our debt. We were debt free, 2005 I believe we were debt free in 2010, 2011. That's just because these cash flows when the market is really good, really come at you really strong. And so in both of those cases, we were able to pay big dividends. And so we were certain, we're comfortable with the debt level we have now. Kathleen and her team has done a great job of structuring our maturity schedules. So we got really strong liquidity and certainly $5 billion would be a level of debt that we'd be comfortable living within the long run. So we'll manage our business on the basis of the cash that comes to us in our expectations by cash flows. But I think you could be comfortable in saying that, that $5 billion target is something that would be acceptable to us. Cash may come to us that we've paid down more than that, but as we did that would clearly be returning cash to shareholders and looking at these opportunities for future investments.\nChris Terry: Thanks, Richard. Thanks, Kathleen and well-done on a great quarter. Thanks.\nRichard Adkerson: Thanks, Chris. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets.\nDavid Gagliano: Great. Thanks for taking my questions, and as always thank you for the detailed update. You covered a lot of the things that I was hoping to ask about already. But, I do have a bit of a follow-up on the capital allocation question. On the Brownfield opportunities, I was wondering if you can just talk about the timing of investing in those opportunities relative to the 2021 dividend recommendations for the Board.\nRichard Adkerson: Well, and this is a feature of the industry, David. Even with all of these projects and the Brownfield expansions, execution of those will take a long period of time. Even if we were to start today and we're not starting today. So each of these projects that would be significant projects. Now we're going to do things to make incremental improvements through the efficiency programs and so forth and so we have an initiative to actually increase volumes without making a capital investment, and we call it the America's concentrator project. But far a major Brownfield investment project from the time we make the decision to start, and that's not likely to occur until 2022, 2023, you're still looking at six or seven years at a minimum, the execution on it. So with positive cash flows, will those won't stand in the way of really having significant increases in returns to shareholders.\nKathleen Quirk: And Dave, we'll have some incremental projects that we can look at that would be quicker than that, but Richard's talking about a major investment, but we'll have some incremental opportunities that we can evaluate as well during that period.\nDavid Gagliano: Okay, great. That's helpful. Thank you.\nRichard Adkerson: Dave, I think the way to think about it is, we have a fully developed set of assets essentially now. And we're in \u2013 we will be, was with kind of positive markets that we have now that we appear to be moving more towards the future. We're really going to be in a harvesting set of years for the near term. And I think that's a great to be a natural resource company and being able to look at the benefit of the decisions you made over many years and see that you made the right ones and you generate cash and return it to shareholders.\nDavid Gagliano: Perfect. Thank you.\nRichard Adkerson: By the way Dave, we thought about you on Monday at lunch. So we miss being in London.\nDavid Gagliano: No problem, thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris LaFemina with Jefferies.\nChris LaFemina: Hi, good morning, Richard, Kathleen. Thanks for taking my question. It's really a strategic question about Grasberg. And Richard as something I know you've addressed at times in the past, but obviously the world is changing and things like Grasberg are changing pretty quickly. So the question relates to the potential rationale of selling a portion of the gold production from Grasberg as a gold stream, presumably you would get a premium multiple. The ability to do so, I would think, has increased. Now that Grasberg is ramping up and being de-risked. This would accelerate your ability to return capital potentially even via buyback, which would be pretty compelling. I think, right now, probably be very significant and positive for your shares would really \u2013 would not really reduce the competitors in the mine and would probably reduce the perceived risk around Freeport as it would reduce your exposure to Indonesia a little bit in the market. So obviously in the past, Grasberg was such a critically important asset to Freeport. You obviously owned more than 90% of the mine for a long time, but now that you've done this transition, ownership is transitioning as well, but the operational transition to the underground. And again the fact that arguably the value of the gold from the asset has been not reflected in your shares. What is your argument to not sell a portion of that gold as a stream? Thank you.\nRichard Adkerson: All right, well, Chris, one bit of correction there about the ownership. Since the mid 1990s, Rio Tinto had a joint venture ownership in this interest. And so, while the government's interest was roughly 10%, FCX's interest was net of the Rio Tinto joint venture interest. So what we own in Grasberg today is essentially the same that we've owned since the mid 1990s. It's just that the Rio Tinto interest was transferred from a joint venture interest of Rio Tinto to shares owned by the government. So our fundamental interest has not changed. Did you follow that, Chris?\nChris LaFemina: Yes, that's right. So, basically, my point is that Indonesia will be the majority owner of the mine, whereas historically they own less than 10%. So the\u2026\nRichard Adkerson: They own 51% of the shares. And in the past that ownership interest there 10%. They acquired about five from us, but they acquired the Rio Tinto interest. But when you look at FCX's ownership interest, it really hasn't changed from what we've had for over the years. And that was one of the really good things about the deal that we got in 2018 is we were able to hold on to the interest that we had, even though the government had these ownership objectives, which they reached by acquiring the Rio Tinto interest. So that's just\u2026\nKathleen Quirk: The cost will change but our economic interest did not.\nRichard Adkerson: That's right. Our economic interest has not changed. That's just a clarification. But, yes, we're fully aware of the opportunity that we have to look at a gold streaming opportunity. As you know, we've assessed those over the years in various forms. And with the spike in gold prices currently, it makes that a new opportunity for us. We need to get ramped up. You don't want to sell a stream before you have the stream in place, but we're studying various alternatives for doing that. And we recognized the opportunity to generate cash and restructure our balance sheet and our ability to deal with returns to shareholders and so forth. So that's on our plate. You can rest assure that bankers are visiting us regularly and talking about that opportunity and it's something we'll be considering. Our first order of business though is to get it ramped up.\nChris LaFemina: And sorry. Second question along those lines, in terms of the operational performance at Grasberg, can you just give us an update and I'm sorry if you mentioned this earlier, I might have missed it on the call before, but can you give us an update in terms of number of COVID cases at Grasberg between your employees and between contractors, if things are getting better or worse, we'd run in COVID at the mine, just an update there. Thank you.\nRichard Adkerson: Yes. I mean, I'm just \u2013 when COVID broke out, Grasberg was the huge concern. I think most of you know, we have an enormous workforce there. It was on the order of approaching 30,000 people, roughly 20,000 at any point in time were living in close proximity to each other in the highlands area of New Guinea where it's damp and cool and people live and work together. So we really recognize that as a problem and made major investments in medical facilities, in protocols for managing it, testing equipment, PCR labs both in the highlands and the lowlands. We did all the things at the health standards say that you should do in terms of finding infected people, tracing, isolating and treating. And so, over time, we've had \u2013 and Indonesia as a country is \u2013 is a country that's challenged with COVID. So we've had a number of cases, fortunately the huge majority of those who have recovered or non-symptomatic, our process of isolation and restricting travel and testing has worked. The serious cases we have had have been few, and the most serious ones were ones where people had previous health conditions. So it's consistent with what people are faced with around the world. We've really done well in the highlands. We had an outbreak of cases in the lowlands where our ship terminal is and where people there have more of an interaction with the community to make a \u2013 which is less of a control situation. But we've instituted new protocols there and it made a great progress. So we've had to deal with it. We've had a number of cases, almost all have now recovered. And we continue to have very strict protocols on travel interactions and people there. So the government, and in large part, the local community support us. We're supporting local community with helping them health issues and testing procedures. So it's been an issue, but has been managed.\nChris LaFemina: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Orest Wowkodaw with Scotiabank.\nOrest Wowkodaw: Hi, good morning.\nRichard Adkerson: Good morning.\nOrest Wowkodaw: Just turning our \u2013 good morning, turning our attention back to Grasberg. Obviously, there was, I guess, a bit of a setback there in the third quarter, but you recovered really well with that exit rate of 90,000 tons a day. Can you give us a sense of how that's continued through October? And if I'm not mistaken looking at your slides, it wasn't your planned exit rate for the year at 95,000? So, I mean, doesn't that mean you're essentially already there at the end of September?\nRichard Adkerson: Yes, you're right. I mean, it's going well and I would not \u2013 you got to look at where I am. I'm really sensitive. I wouldn't call them what we face was a setback. It was just a situation we had to face and we managed it. I mean, man, you look back over the years, that's always the case. It's always the case with complicated mines. So it certainly wouldn't be \u2013 I wouldn't characterize it as setback, but yes we're on track. We're on track in October. If we have had any significant issues to report today, we would have reported them. So, we just feel great about what's going on. This was a critically important time for us at Grasberg in 2020 completing mining the pit and really taking the ramp up over the hump to the point where it was ramping up in generating cash flows. This was a quarter that we always knew was going to be the quarter where cash flows were going to start coming in. They did. We had to do that in managing the COVID situation and we just talked about. So it's a remarkable accomplishment that we've been able to do that and we feel very good. We feel like we've avoided the major risk of COVID. We've now avoided the major risk of the ramp up. Mark and his team will face issues every day. We're communicating about how things are going with the various aspects of our operations, how we're doing with our maintenance programs, how we're doing in. We've had a lots of excess capacity in the mill, but that's we're going to start filling the mill up. So, we've got to be prepared for that, but we're on track to 200,000 tons a day plus of ore from these underground ore bodies to the mill and everything is on track and it's really gratifying to see.\nKathleen Quirk: And we haven't had geologic or geotechnical type things, the kind of things that we're aiming to in the third quarter other than the labor issue was just more mechanical type things, maintenance type items and ore getting hung up in passes and that sort of thing. And that's going to happen from time to time, but those things are more easily dealt within geologic or geotechnical issues and we're pleased to report we just feel it's been going very well on the geologic and geotechnical front.\nRichard Adkerson: Yes. This fracking approach then Mark and his team came up with, the Deep MLZ mine was delayed on the order of two years as we dealt with the seismicity issues, but \u2013 which is not a factor in the Grasberg Block Cave because of the geological setting that it's in, physical setting, I should stay, but that was an issue in the Deep MLZ, they came up with the solution and it's working. We still have seismic events from time to time, but the fracking is helping us to manage those. And we're being able to achieve the results that you see. And it's straightforward fracking. It's not as complicated as what's going on in the oil and gas industry in the Permian basin. This is a really straightforward type of operation.\nOrest Wowkodaw: Is it possible that you may actually exit this year ahead of plan, I think you've been \u2013you're already at 94,000 tons a day?\nRichard Adkerson: Certainly possible, and our guys are going to do the best they can do. We set our plans as being aspirational plans, but achievable. And the guys work every day to try to do better than planned. And they take \u2013 it's a great \u2013 I mean the smiles on our faces when we have these days, when we go over plans, its felt all the way from [indiscernible] where we are here in the United States. So everybody is oriented to try to beat the plans. And in the Americas too, I mean, Josh \u2013 Josh's guys have done a great job. Our safety statistics are great. We did have an unfortunate \u2013 fortunate fatality at Grasberg, where a worker took a really unfashionable action, but we work hard, but our safety statistics are good. Our people are focused. I think one thing about \u2013 one thing I think of this COVID thing has done for all of us is really made us focus on our work even more intently than we ever had. And I keep talking about work is intense. And so now with having restricted travel, making sacrifices in your personal life, everybody is really focused on work, and we can see the results of that globally.\nOrest Wowkodaw: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley.\nCarlos De Alba: Yes, good morning everyone. Thank you for taking the question. So, first, just maybe Richard if you could elaborate and you maybe early on to provide this number, but what sort of estimate CapEx do you \u2013 would you envision for the alternative to and brand new copper semester in Indonesia? Expanding of the current \u2013 expansion of the current semester and adding the precious metal refinery how much would that cause relative to the $3 billion, I think that Kathleen had mentioned for potentially CapEx of a new semester?\nRichard Adkerson: Rick Coleman is on the line, and he manages our capital projects globally and he's involved in the smelter rig hit. Is there any way we can give an order of magnitude number on the aggressive smelter.\nKathleen Quirk: Yes, and I'll jump in here, Richard. The prior estimate for the new Greenfield smelter was $3 billion. And the estimate for the expansion of Gresik for 30% expansions is roughly $250 million and similar amount for the PMR; still we're going to do a PMR anyway in the original configuration.\nRichard Adkerson: Yes.\nCarlos De Alba: All right, thanks guys\u2026\nRichard Adkerson: And it's an economic project that current PCRC raise, which the new smelter would not be\u2026\nCarlos De Alba: Perfect. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Good luck.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lucas Pipes with B. Riley. Please go ahead.\nRichard Adkerson: Hi, Lucas. Hang on just one second. I just want to say, just to emphasize, we've got financing available to us, ready to go if we do have to build a new smelter, it would be debt financed, no capital required by shareholders and PT-FI FCX, would not have to put capital into this. It would be the losses that the smelter generate would be tax deductible. And when you look at the current situation out there with the government owning 50% of the equity with having taxes and royalties, the government's share of the economics of the project, including the smelter, is in excess of 70%. So, we do consolidate this and I'm glad we do, even though we own 49%, we at FCX control operations of PT-FI. So it would be consolidate debt, but it would not require a capital to be put into PT-FI for the smelter from FCX.\nLucas Pipes: Good morning Richard and team. This is Lucas.\nRichard Adkerson: Sure.\nLucas Pipes: Great job on the quarter. And my first question \u2013 on my first question I just wanted to explore another angle of this, what's next theme that's been a part of this call here? And would there be any interest to supplement your development pipeline with an acquisition of pre-production copper gold projects? There would a couple of candidates in North America. I am curious how you think about that opportunity set. Thank you.\nRichard Adkerson: Yes, we look at all of those. We're approached with opportunities and we have our \u2013 we have a long-term history in the marketplace, so we are as a company familiar with all of these projects and mineral opportunities in North America and so forth. The challenge that we have found today \u2013 and we'll continue to do that, but the challenge we found today is we have these internal resources that have currently no value in our share price. And if we're successful in creating value, 100% of that value comes to our shareholders. But if we were to acquire properties from someone else, we'd have to pay to their shareholders, the current value of that. So it's hard to make the numbers work quite frankly.\nLucas Pipes: Very helpful. I appreciate that. And then as a follow-up question, I wanted to follow up on your CapEx guidance. You maintained prior guidance. And any risk to that number? Any sort of CapEx risk that we should be thinking about given the plans you put in place earlier this year, and obviously that's been very successful, but I would appreciate your thoughts on that and how you think about CapEx and long-term CapEx over the coming years? Thank you.\nKathleen Quirk: Lucas, we're in a \u2013 next couple of years really we had the peak in 2021 at Grasberg and it will be declining after that. So as we look out absent other projects, our capital expenditures will decline significantly from the 2022 levels. So, we're talking about something on the order of $1 billion to $1.2 billion in sustaining capital. And we've got some ongoing development at Grasberg, but it won't be anything like what we've got in these next few years. So we do have rising cash flows, declining CapEx and we'll be evaluating there are opportunities to have some incremental expansions, but as Richard said, we're really looking forward to harvesting cash flows for a period of time.\nLucas Pipes: Very helpful. I appreciate that and continue. Best of luck. Thank you.\nKathleen Quirk: Thank you.\nRichard Adkerson: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andreas Bokkenheuser with UBS.\nAndreas Bokkenheuser: Thank you very much. Just a quick production question from your two part one. Can you just give us a quick update in terms of what the current situation especially in South America where you operate? Are you able to fully return to kind of pre-COVID levels kind of production wise at this point in time? Or you still see any kind of lingering pressure from local communities, local governance in terms of workers returning to the site, this sort of thing. And I'm not just telling them how to do online, told them about what you're kind of hearing and seeing in the industry. And then related to that question, when we kind of think about 2021, presumably I think that a lot of the growth that you're going to see in copper production sales of 2021, some of that would kind of weighted onto the back half the year. Is that a fair way to look at it like back half \u2013 is a little bit stronger than the first half of the year production wise? Those are my two questions. Thank you much.\nKathleen Quirk: At Cerro Verde, in Peru where we've done really well, Richard said, the team has done really great job. Getting back to we're roughly 350,000 tons a day. Prior to the COVID, we were close to 400 and looking to grow. We still think that we can do that over time, but for the foreseeable future until there's a complete return to normal in terms of people going back and forth to work and it's normal, we're going to operate at this lower rate. So we've \u2013 that's all reflected in our plans, but we do expect Cerro Verde at some point next year and into 2021 to begin wrapping up again. I think the situation in Peru is and then Josh Olmsted is here can comment, but this \u2013 we're continuing to be very vigilant with our protocols have been effective. Same in Chile, Chile did have some escalating cases earlier, but that seems to have abated some with the actions that the industry has taken, but still very much like it is around the world, no one has really let up their guard and we're continuing to be very careful about how we're operating in the COVID environment.\nJosh Olmsted: Yes. And one thing I would say, and this is true for us in managing the COVID situation, and it would apply to different operations, site specific challenges. So you can't really generalize about what happens with us versus what would happen with other companies. We have had a totally different situation in Cerro Verde than in Morenci and Grasberg. And so I just caution you about trying to generalize when you hear something about one company situation, applying it to other sites of other companies.\nRichard Adkerson: Yes, I wouldn't do that. I mean, I think there was a couple of Bloomberg headlines out suggesting that Peruvian mine workers were a little bit still returning to the mine site. So I kind of figured that that was industry-wide just Peru alone, it wasn't something we\u2019re trying to extrapolate Grasberg or Morenci for that matter. But right, even within Peru, I mean in the second quarter, the government in Peru on a very sudden basis shut down mine. And we had a different situation because most of our workers lived in Arequipa. And so we had to then go to work with the local community and government. And we had to construct some temporary living facilities on-site for people to live and demonstrate to people that we could manage the house situation. And that would be a different situation than other operations, where they have their workforce living \u2013 already living on their site. So anyway, we've had to manage it and our guys down there just done a tremendous job, we're not in full production, but we're originally 90 day production and we're making a lot of money out of Cerro Verde now, and we have the opportunity to increase it.\nKathleen Quirk: And to your second question, the volumes we expect will increase quarter-by-quarter through 2021. And that's mainly because of the Grasberg ramp up. And as we said, we expect to get to about 90% of the run rate by middle of next year. So but the back half will be bigger than the front half, but the front half will still be significant and growing from where we were in the third quarter.\nAndreas Bokkenheuser: That's very clear. Thank you very much for answering my questions.\nRichard Adkerson: Thank you for your question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research.\nJohn Tumazos: Thank you very much and congratulations on so much progress.\nRichard Adkerson: Thanks, John.\nJohn Tumazos: Just sulfides concentrators that you've talked about for a couple years. Are any of them even 10% engineered and what's the six to seven year time horizon you're talking about. You're saying that none of them would arrive earlier than 2027.\nRichard Adkerson: Rick, I think that's a fair statement, right?\nRick Coleman: Yes, that's right, Richard. With permitting and \u2013 with downstream engineering is definitely not more than 10% on the larger concentrator designs.\nJohn Tumazos: Okay.\nKathleen Quirk: And again, John, that's where he's referring to is major new projects like, there are a lot of project would be like another Cerro Verde. As we said, we also have incremental type expansions within the portfolio that don't require permitting or don't require major multi-year planning. So we've got a combination of both, but the major projects, like the one that operates is multi years because of the permitting that has to be done and all the infrastructure. But we do have other options within the portfolio that wouldn't be as lonely.\nJohn Tumazos: Lone Star or the oxide is so vast that the sulfides wouldn't be exposed or you wouldn't need the sulfides until 2027?\nRichard Adkerson: Right. And so Lone Star, which made it so attractive initially, is it dovetails in with the depletion of the Safford reserves, which was part of the mine plan there. So we had existing processing facilities and Lone Star is so close to Safford that we're able to truck the ore to Safford facilities and also build new facilities, the oxide resource is growing. And we may have an opportunity to invest in incremental processing facilities, take advantage of that. So but this Lone Star sulfide is longer term, even then the opportunities that we have at the other projects, because we can make so much money off of oxides before we develop it.\nKathleen Quirk: And we've done a lot of work on drilling over the past several years on Lone Star. And we'll be incorporating that drilling. This joint was also into our longer range plans. And a lot of our exploration budget over the last few years has been on Lone Star. So we were really prioritizing that opportunity.\nJohn Tumazos: If I could ask one more, if we just take, for example, an El Abra sulfide now, if you're largely copying the 240,000 metric ton a day, most recent module at Cerro Verde and the diesel plant pumping pipeline is sort of an off-the-shelf, third-party design. Why would the \u2013 pits pre-stripped, why would the engineering and planning take a long time in El Abra?\nKathleen Quirk: It's not just the engineering and planning. It's the permitting, as Rick was saying, we've got to, we'd have to do an EIS, and you've got a baseline that you have to provide in terms of data going back on it. And so it's a new mill, new diesel, we don't have a mill there now. But it's an attractive project, it's a very attractive project, but we may have more attracted projects that are less capital intensive.\nJohn Tumazos: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Dudas with Vertical Research Partners.\nMike Dudas: Hi, good morning, everybody. Richard, I'm not going to ask you what you think is going to happen in the U.S. elections next month. So that's okay. But I want to \u2013 wait if you want to opine go right ahead, but I want to see what your thoughts are on say this month in Chile with the constitutional vote and looking into next year, presidential elections in Peru and Chile. Any sense of how that could impact possibly negatively tenor or support for mining and overall, maybe some of the labor situations that could pop up?\nRichard Adkerson: Well, thanks we're not putting me so much on the spot. It's not just next month, it's almost next week now that we got the election here in the U.S. and this goes beyond the presidential election. We've got complicated political situations everywhere. And Latin America is always a complicated area. The thing though that underlies this is that with the COVID challenges that the economies around the world are facing, but particularly in Chile and Peru, I think, that, however, the political situation unravels, there's going to be a need for those countries and objective of those countries is provide a favorable environment for mining investments. In Chile, which has had such long-term success from that there's a growing recognition of the need for Chile to not lose its competitive edge that it's had. And some of that's been eroded with some recent legislative regulatory actions. So I'm confident that those countries will see the benefits of mining investment. In Peru the bigger challenges which we fortunately found a way to manage effectively is how do mining investments interact with local communities because that's what's really been the barrier there as opposed to central government barriers.\nMike Dudas: I appreciate that. Thanks for Richard.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jatinder Goel with Exane BNP Paribas.\nJatinder Goel: Hi, good morning. Just a quick one on your 2021 unit cost guidance. You've left it unchanged below $1.20 there can be lot of vacant room based on the prices. Are you able to indicate decision to spot gold/molly and currencies with their production outlook what would net unit cost look like for next year?\nKathleen Quirk: We will update our guidance for 2021 next quarter. Our plan right now is below a $1.20 and we haven't gotten more specific than that. But we'll certainly update that when we come out with our updated guidance. But we're trending well below $1.20 at this point on our current plan at $1,900 gold and $8 molybdenum.\nJatinder Goel: And just to confirm, you are using $1,800 in that $1.20, or is it lower than that?\nKathleen Quirk: Our current plans that we're using and we just \u2013 we run scenarios, but our current plan with the guidance in the deck is $3 copper, $1,900 gold and $8 molybdenum.\nJatinder Goel: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Mancini with Gabelli Funds.\nChris Mancini: Hi everybody. Thanks a lot. And congratulations on Grasberg, it really is, as you've been saying Richard, all along, having followed the company for a long time just the amount of tons that you're moving there every day, along with building the mine, along with dealing with COVID and everything, it's really fantastic. What you've done there you have ways to go, but congratulations. It really is a great job.\nRichard Adkerson: Yes, Chris we've been talking about it for a long, long time haven\u2019t we?\nChris Mancini: Yes, you have. And like you say, you are starting to inflect here and it's impressive what you've been able to do. So I just wanted to say that quickly. And just another quick question, don't want to put you too much on the spot, but relative to Lucas's question about acquisitions, and you're saying that you not really getting, seeing a lot of value in potentially buying something how would you feel about conceptually a merger of equals with another mining company? And just given what we've seen in this space about like you say, kind of value destruction in the natural resources space, in terms of deals that have been done at premiums, what do you think conceptually about merger of equal \u2013 potential merger equals, or just conceptually in the space or\u2026\nRichard Adkerson: Conceptually you can identify circumstances where mergers of equals make sense, because of the ability to reduce cost and operate more efficiently through asset management, and so forth. But in our case where we're on the verge of this \u2013 when we made great progress, now we're less than 60% there in terms of the volumes that we will achieve at Grasberg. I also believe we have the potential, even though copper markets are strong now, one of the reasons we showed that chart with the earlier years is I believe there are factors working today that could well make copper much more valuable as we go forward. They are having all these polls in connection with the virtual meetings with LME Week going on. And when you look at all the polls that people are taking copper is far outstripping other metals. So I just don't believe, and I'm a shareholder, as you know, I don't believe as a shareholder, that there is any way that we would want to consider a merger of equals right now, where we would dilute the opportunity that we have as a standalone company that\u2019s so attractive. We worked for it for a long time. And I think \u2013 I wouldn't want \u2013 and the reason I'm working in everything else is I believe we're on the verge of really good things happening at Freeport. I just made a brief reference to what happened to us in earlier years. We've had ups and downs with the company for various reasons since then, but this time we're committed to sticking to our guns. Our board has made a firm commitment five years ago to focus on what the real value opportunity to Freeport is. And that's in the copper business with this set of assets. We've shown in the past, what we could do with essentially this set of assets and how we could build real value. I\u2019m getting to the age of where I tell too many war stories, according to some of my friends, including our CFO, but there was \u2013 2011, we had a company with a $60 billion market cap and no debt. And I think we're on the verge of rebuilding that we've taken the steps. But this is not what this company can be and what we're on the track today. And I firmly believe, and as I talked to our shareholders, nothing [indiscernible] about it that the best opportunity for our shareholders with this set of assets is to stick with a strategy that we're on right now. And it's not a short term strategy, as we've talked about, we got short term positives going for us, but there's a longer term set of opportunities that's really attractive.\nChris Mancini: Right, okay. Yes, that makes sense. I mean, given where you are now and I mean, so do you think that once Grasberg is fully ramped, you would have a different view potentially?\nRichard Adkerson: We'll always view the opportunities as they come about. Chris raised earlier the opportunity if this goes streaming deal, and that's certainly something we'll consider. But yes, we'll \u2013 opportunities emerge on an opportunistic basis, that's using the same word twice, but you know helps that emerge for us without having a long-term strategy of doing it. But it was an opportunity that came up because of circumstances. And we took advantage of it. If opportunities come to us in the future, that makes sense for our shareholders and we will act on it. But for right now, it's not the time to do that.\nChris Mancini: Okay. Well, great thanks a lot. And again, congrats to the team for doing a great job at Grasberg so far and the rest of the operations. Thanks. And congrats to you Richard. Thanks.\nRichard Adkerson: We appreciate your comments and your support for all these years.\nOperator: Now, we'll turn the call over to management for any closing remarks.\nRichard Adkerson: Well, thanks everyone. Appreciate your interest. Obviously a great quarter for us, and we look forward to reporting continued progress. So it's been a tough world. We live in lots and lots of personal sacrifices. It's gratifying though to see within our company to see the success that we're all sharing together. And I think we've made clear today, our commitment to continue to move forward with progress and success in the future. But thanks for being on our call today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan third quarter conference call. Earlier this morning, we reported our third quarter 2020 operating and financial results, and a copy of today's press release and slides are available on our website at fcx.com. Our call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call, and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. I'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, each filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. On the call today is Richard Adkerson; Mark Johnson is also on the call; Josh Olmsted; Mike Kendrick; Steve Higgins; and Rick Coleman. I'll start by briefly summarizing the quarter's financial results and then we'll turn the call over to Richard, who will review the slide materials. And we'll then open up the call for questions. Today, FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of $329 million, or $0.22 per share for the third quarter of 2020. After taking into account, debt extinguishment costs associated with our refinancings during the quarter and other non-recurring net charges totaling $101 million, or $0.07 per share, adjusted net income attributable to common stock totaled $430 million, or $0.29 per share. These special items can be reviewed on Page VII of our press release. Our adjusted earnings before interest taxes and depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, totaled $1.4 billion for the third quarter of 2020, and a reconciliation of the EBITDA calculation is available on Page 32 of our slide deck. Our third quarter results benefited from improved pricing for both copper and gold, strong copper and gold sales volumes that were above the prior estimates and solid cost performance. The average realized price during the quarter for copper was $3.01 per pound that was 15% above the year ago average and the third quarter realized gold price of just over $1,900 per ounce was 28% above the year ago quarterly average. We generated strong cash flows in the quarter. Our operating cash flows totaled $1.2 billion and exceeded roughly $400 million of capital expenditures during the quarter. We ended the quarter with $10 billion of total debt and our consolidated cash position grew during the quarter from $1.5 billion at the start of the period to total $2.4 billion at the end of the quarter. I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to our slide materials. Okay, great. Thanks, Richard. I'll just make some brief comments on financial matters so we can take your questions. As you'll see in the materials, our guidance is very similar to our prior guidance. We have incorporated the plan restart of Chino that Richard mentioned, and that's reflected in the guidance. But I just really wanted to make three points. The first one is, as Richard has said, we're continuing to focus on execution of his plan, which will generate growing cash flows and margins. Clearly the Grasberg underground ramp-up is making great progress, and we're building that on that momentum each quarter. I wanted to mention the cost benefits that we're seeing and the ongoing capital management programs. We now feel that were successfully implemented the plan that we laid out in April. I think when you look at the cash cost in the quarter of $1.32 per pound, and compare that to where we were in the first quarter of this year, you see a 30% reduction in that unit cash costs; also a 30% reduction in capital spending levels. With the increased volumes that we have coming in 2021 at very low incremental costs, we expect our unit net cash costs will decline below $1.20 per pound next year. So we're remaining focused on sustaining all of these costs and capital management programs. We've also implemented savings in a number of other areas, including in general administrative costs, which as you see in the third quarter were over 30% below the first quarter 2020 levels. The second point is, you know, and Richard made this point as well. So the third quarter really demonstrates the growing cash flow generating capacity of the business. We had $1.4 billion in EBITDA during the quarter, and $1.2 billion in operating cash flow, and our volumes are continuing to grow. We expect to continue building volumes during 2021 and using $3 to $3.50 copper, we would average between $7.4 billion to $9.4 billion per annum in EBITDA for 2021 and 2022. And generate nearly $5 billion to over $6 billion in operating cash flow with $2 billion of capital expenditures; so very focused on free cash flow generation as we look forward. And the third point is that our balance sheet and financial position are very strong. As you'll see in the slide materials, the net data is expected to decline rapidly and consent continued execution and performance will allow our board to consider a resumption of dividends in 2021 and increasing shareholder returns over time. As Richard mentioned, we're also continuing to assess the sequence of our future organic projects. We expect to be in a great position, really to maintain a strong balance sheet, provide returns to shareholders and invest in value enhancing projects that are embedded in our portfolio as market conditions warrant. So that concludes our prepared remarks. And operator, we will not take questions. And one of the things that Mark is doing, and the team out there is doing is really focused on the long-term plan. And so, as Mark said, we're following the sequencing to maximize the long-term values and not try to look for short-term wins and they're really doing a good job of staying disciplined on that program. Good morning. Thank you, Timna. That's right, Chris. We did have the five day outage for the work stoppage, and then we had some overflow maintenance that was unplanned during the period. And by the end of the quarter we had gotten back to the rates and Mark and his team do an update every quarter and went through the five year forecast. And essentially there was a very little change in our ramp-up. So we're still \u2013 we're still on track with the getting to a 90% of the run rate by mid next year. And Dave, we'll have some incremental projects that we can look at that would be quicker than that, but Richard's talking about a major investment, but we'll have some incremental opportunities that we can evaluate as well during that period. The cost will change but our economic interest did not. And we haven't had geologic or geotechnical type things, the kind of things that we're aiming to in the third quarter other than the labor issue was just more mechanical type things, maintenance type items and ore getting hung up in passes and that sort of thing. And that's going to happen from time to time, but those things are more easily dealt within geologic or geotechnical issues and we're pleased to report we just feel it's been going very well on the geologic and geotechnical front. Yes, and I'll jump in here, Richard. The prior estimate for the new Greenfield smelter was $3 billion. And the estimate for the expansion of Gresik for 30% expansions is roughly $250 million and similar amount for the PMR; still we're going to do a PMR anyway in the original configuration. Lucas, we're in a \u2013 next couple of years really we had the peak in 2021 at Grasberg and it will be declining after that. So as we look out absent other projects, our capital expenditures will decline significantly from the 2022 levels. So, we're talking about something on the order of $1 billion to $1.2 billion in sustaining capital. And we've got some ongoing development at Grasberg, but it won't be anything like what we've got in these next few years. So we do have rising cash flows, declining CapEx and we'll be evaluating there are opportunities to have some incremental expansions, but as Richard said, we're really looking forward to harvesting cash flows for a period of time. Thank you. At Cerro Verde, in Peru where we've done really well, Richard said, the team has done really great job. Getting back to we're roughly 350,000 tons a day. Prior to the COVID, we were close to 400 and looking to grow. We still think that we can do that over time, but for the foreseeable future until there's a complete return to normal in terms of people going back and forth to work and it's normal, we're going to operate at this lower rate. So we've \u2013 that's all reflected in our plans, but we do expect Cerro Verde at some point next year and into 2021 to begin wrapping up again. I think the situation in Peru is and then Josh Olmsted is here can comment, but this \u2013 we're continuing to be very vigilant with our protocols have been effective. Same in Chile, Chile did have some escalating cases earlier, but that seems to have abated some with the actions that the industry has taken, but still very much like it is around the world, no one has really let up their guard and we're continuing to be very careful about how we're operating in the COVID environment. And to your second question, the volumes we expect will increase quarter-by-quarter through 2021. And that's mainly because of the Grasberg ramp up. And as we said, we expect to get to about 90% of the run rate by middle of next year. So but the back half will be bigger than the front half, but the front half will still be significant and growing from where we were in the third quarter. And again, John, that's where he's referring to is major new projects like, there are a lot of project would be like another Cerro Verde. As we said, we also have incremental type expansions within the portfolio that don't require permitting or don't require major multi-year planning. So we've got a combination of both, but the major projects, like the one that operates is multi years because of the permitting that has to be done and all the infrastructure. But we do have other options within the portfolio that wouldn't be as lonely. And we've done a lot of work on drilling over the past several years on Lone Star. And we'll be incorporating that drilling. This joint was also into our longer range plans. And a lot of our exploration budget over the last few years has been on Lone Star. So we were really prioritizing that opportunity. It's not just the engineering and planning. It's the permitting, as Rick was saying, we've got to, we'd have to do an EIS, and you've got a baseline that you have to provide in terms of data going back on it. And so it's a new mill, new diesel, we don't have a mill there now. But it's an attractive project, it's a very attractive project, but we may have more attracted projects that are less capital intensive. We will update our guidance for 2021 next quarter. Our plan right now is below a $1.20 and we haven't gotten more specific than that. But we'll certainly update that when we come out with our updated guidance. But we're trending well below $1.20 at this point on our current plan at $1,900 gold and $8 molybdenum. Our current plans that we're using and we just \u2013 we run scenarios, but our current plan with the guidance in the deck is $3 copper, $1,900 gold and $8 molybdenum."

            "content": "Thanks, Kathleen, and good morning everyone. Thank you all for participating in today's call. I hope you and your families and your colleagues are all staying well and safe. This corona virus situation is not ended. We at Freeport are not letting up our guard in any fashion. We remain focused on protecting the health and safety of our people and the communities where we work, and we're all looking forward to a medical solution, which will come in time. In the meantime, though, we are staying diligent with our health protocols and we're also being conservative in the way we continue to run our business. And this has proved, served us well over the last six months. I'm really proud of our Freeport team for the aggressive response we developed as an organization, how we've executed the plans that we announced just six months ago, it seems like a decade ago, but it was at the end of April when we announced plans that was well received by our company and the market to take steps to reduce cost, capital cost, operating cost and G&A cost, suspend some low margin production. And we put those plans in place and we really went after them in an aggressive way and it served us well. Turning \u2013 starting with Slide 3, we present the highlights for the quarter and it's notable just how much cash flow we're generating. We've been talking about this for a long time [indiscernible] finally arrived for Freeport. This is the quarter where all this work that we've been doing for years and years is beginning to show, is beginning to show its presence. This free cash flow generation will actually accelerate as we go forward into the fourth quarter, into 2021. And by the end of 2021, we'll reach really a \u2013 relatively steady state of volumes and that extends for the 20 years beyond than our current contract rights extend to. But as you see clearly our sales volumes, our cost and capital performances were favorable to the estimates we provided to market three months ago. Our Grasberg team achieved its quarterly sales targets and continue to make excellent progress with the ramp up of our large underground mines, the Grasberg Block Cave, and the Deep MLZ mine. In Arizona, we completed The Lone Star project during the quarter. It was completed on time and below budget. In the bottom line, we generated substantial cash flows in the quarter, reduced our net debt in this quarter by $800 million. And this was all achieved operating safely in a challenging environment because of the pandemic. Our team maintained its focus on the health of our workers in our protocols and showed real drive and commitment in executing our plans while managing this health issue. As an organization, we're all stepping up to meet this challenge. We met challenges effectively in the past. Turning to Slide 4, this is LME Week and it's a strange deal and I being in London, last night would have been the night of our Freeport reception such a fun event and it's disappointing not to be there. We distributed a video to people. And if you didn't get it, contact David and we'll get it to you, but just a lot of fun looking at the video and thinking about all the good times I've had in London and looking forward to coming back next year. But you know thinking about LME Week and the times we're facing right now really makes us all very pleased to be a company that's the leading producer of copper and copper is critical to the economy of the world, has been, but even more so as we look to the future. Copper is absolutely essential and strategic to the technologies that the world is moving to transition to global clean energy future. And more and more we're seeing the adoption of policies both in community and governments, but by companies to reduce carbon emissions. This initiative is no longer being debated as to whether it's needed or not, but there is a real commitment now to accelerate. And as a result of the steps that will be required to reduce carbon, the intensity of the use of copper in those application is really significant. Copper utilization in electric vehicles and the generation of renewable power requires four times more copper per unit than traditional internal combustion vehicles require and traditional power generation requires. The coming transition to 5G technology will be positive from copper with required data centers to supporting infrastructure with lots of new copper wiring required to support 5G. These major trends, which are in place and irreversible, will bring significant new sources of demand for copper. And that will supplement the already significant requirements for copper to fund global growth in the developing world. We are committed at Freeport to being a responsible producer of copper, which is a very favorable metal in terms of these positive ESG factors going forward. In addition to Freeport's commitment to the International Council on Mining and Metals, where I just returned as Chairman after serving 10 years ago, during the third quarter, we committed to the Copper Mark, which is a new assurance framework developed by The International Copper Association that's specific to the copper industry that demonstrates responsible production practices and how operations for copper can contribute to the UN sustainable development goals, and we're fully committed to these things. Currently in the market conditions, thinking back to six months ago, none of us would have anticipated that we would be today just six months later after facing the industrial downturn that was accelerating at that time. And all of the uncertainties from a health and economic standpoints to think that here we would be at the end of our third quarter in such a favorable market condition. And this has been led by the really dramatic recovery of the Chinese economy and demand that's generated for copper. Economic conditions in other parts of the world continue to face uncertainties. And we are certainly sensitive to those uncertainties. And as I said, we're not letting our guard down. But we're encouraged by these demand trends in China. And then we look at global stimulus measures and decarbonization initiatives, which are also supportive of copper demand. At a time when supplies of copper remain limited, and this supply effect has been really emphasized by what we'd gone on with the COVID situation. Prices have recovered from the lows earlier this year. You may recall that we were preparing for a scenario of $2 copper and year-to-date we have copper that $3.15 that's pretty remarkable. But the fundamentals of copper market are increasingly attractive. We put together a slide on five to give a historical perspective on these copper markets. And thinking back, they're really strong similarities and parallels to what we've seen earlier. In the early 2000s, when the world was coming out of the global recession, there was policy driven demand particularly in copper combined with limited new supplies, which was a new factor in the market at that time. And that drove a major repricing of copper to kick off the commodity super cycle. Then again in 2009 following the global financial crisis that emerged in 2008, China again led a significant and unexpected recovery in copper prices, which crisis \u2013 when crisis increased over three times from the lows with that 24-month period. In each of these times, FCX share price performed strongly. On the right side of the chart, which shows what's happened since March, copper \u2013 it's notable and this is something that I think is striking and it's different. The copper inventories have declined even with the major downturn in the global economy. You could have ever thought that the U.S. GNP would drop by a third in the second quarter and copper inventories would not have risen. The global pandemic resulted in disruption of supply as well as demand of course. And with low inventories and limited new supply, the market is positioned for additional gains. As we look forward to a medical solution to COVID-19 and for our economies to recover with major copper intensive infrastructure spending on the horizon. Again, in the past, when the downturn occurred, inventory spills, the inventories had to be run off. We don't have that this time. We have low inventories. And so with recovery, we were better positioned to see copper perform strongly. Now turning to our company, the challenge for us in 2020, unlike these earlier times, when we faced downturns was a long list, the lower prices driven by COVID-19. We were at a time of trough production at Grasberg. We completed mining the Grasberg open pit at the end of 2019. We couldn't even begin to ramp up in any significant way of the Grasberg Block Cave ore body, which is our largest underground ore body until we were complete mining in the pit. So all of this started and production dropped from the pit, it was at low levels from the underground, and then we get hit with a low copper prices from COVID and operational challenges in the Americas, because of their situation and so that makes what's happened for our company over the last six months, really, really special. Our team in the Americas continues to do great work, executing our plans, and the plans were aggressive and challenging. You can see the results of the execution in our financial results. We made the decision to complete the initial Lone Star development project, which is located right in the heart of our operations in Eastern Arizona. This is a relatively small, but very positive returns initial project. And it opens the opportunity for a very large future significant project. The team at Cerro Verde in Peru has done exceptional work in restoring our large scale operations there. They were really challenged by COVID. Our people at Cerro Verde lived in the town of Arequipa, which was facing a challenging community situation with COVID where they work with the local community and with the government to restore operations. We've done that largely. We've had to keep a sharp focus on cost and capital management. We had one mine, an older mine in New Mexico that we shut down operations because of COVID situation where now taking actions to restart that mine next year at a much reduced rate, a smaller footprint will allow us to achieve cost in capital benefits from as compared with prior operations. On the call today, Josh Olmsted and I want to recognize him and congratulate him on his expanded new role in managing our operations in the Americas. Josh was named Chief Operating Officer for the Americas in August, following Red Conger's departure. Red was great friend and long time employee who decided to move for family reasons. And we congratulate him and wish him well. Josh was Red's right hand guy for \u2013 along with the rest of our team for recent years. He's an experienced operator; a really good, strong inspirational leader has been with our company 28 years. He has worked in leadership roles at a number of our operations across our Americas assets. Josh is really highly qualified and well prepared for success in this new role. He's off to a great start. He's been a key driver of our innovation initiatives, which all of our team is committed to and is committed to having a high performance culture. The really good thing is Josh has a terrific team around him. We have really significant technical depth world-class in every respect. And we all look forward to working together with him and his team to accomplish both we have for us opportunities going forward. At Grasberg, our third core annual sale volumes on an annualized basis reached 58% of the targeted annual run rate post ramp up. And I want you to focus on this. We generate all these cash flows by being at less than 60% of our targets of where we're going to, and we're making progress on reaching those targets. For so long, I've been talking at these calls about looking at this ramp up. It's not like starting a new operation with a one point in time startup, but it was a process \u2013 a process of increasing volumes with 58% of the target, and you saw we generated this level of cash flows. So as we increase that ramp up volumes grow, cash flows will grow as well. It wasn't without its challenges this past quarter. We had a COVID related labor disruption that we had to deal with. We were actually shut down for four or five days this week, worked with a group of indigenous workers in our workforce who wanted to be able to return to the Lowlands where many of their families lived. We had restricted travel. We had to negotiate a resolution with that. We also had some maintenance issues with the material handling. So it's notable, and we're going to have situations that are inherent part of mining as we go forward. But here's the quarter where we had to deal with temporary shutdown, some unscheduled maintenance issues. And yet we were able to meet our metals target. By the end of the quarter, the mining rates at the Grasberg Block Cave in the deep MLZ had reached targeted levels. We continue to target metal production that will approach 90% of the ramp up targets by the middle of next year, middle of 2021. Unit cost \u2013 note that the unit cost for Grasberg in the third quarter averaged $0.13 a pound. Grasberg of course has this really significant gold component in its ore which at full production rates makes it the largest gold mine in the world, even though it's a byproduct production, but using current gold prices, I'm looking forward. If prices stay at this level, global revenues will fund all of the costs of operations for Grasberg. And we'll be producing over 1.5 billion pounds of copper a year. With full ramp-up that we'll reach at the end of 2021 at a zero or negative unit cost. In Indonesia, I mentioned that the discussions about the new smelter are ongoing; they're being led by our partner, MIND ID interlude. PT-FI requested a 12-month delay in construction of the smelter that we had committed to because of COVID issues, which affects international contractors and local workers. The government is in the process of assessing alternatives to building a new smelter. No decision has been reached. The discussions are going being led by MIND ID and the Ministry of State Owned Enterprises. The alternatives that are under consideration will be mutually beneficial to the government, first of all, and to PT-FI. We will keep you informed as developments occur going forward. I will note that our partnership that we established with the Government of Indonesia and the structure for governance in operating management that we established in December 2018 is really going well. The partnership is strong and mutually supportive. We and the government through the State Owned Enterprise and the Ministry of State Owned Enterprises, the Ministry of Mines, the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Finance, we're all fully aligned now in our objectives of creating value for all stakeholders. We're working together and that's a huge positive development for Freeport and for the asset itself. Slide 7. We're focused on execution, that's what we've been saying for so long. And that's what the results show that we have been successful in doing, but we're focused on executing and continued success will drive strong and improving results. We're now on a path to double EBITDA from 2020 levels as we go forward. Execution of these plans all well underway, biggest risks are behind this. There are always be risk with the biggest risk behind us will allow us to grow our copper volumes by 20% in 2021; gold volumes by 70%, that would result in a reduction in net unit cost by 20% for the company and completely expand \u2013 significantly expand margins and cash flows. You see this in our third quarter results, our financial performance will improve throughout 2021. Our current operating rates as I mentioned earlier extend to 2041 with six fiscal terms. This will allow PT-FI to generate massive future cash flows from this set of remarkable copper and gold resources. Our company is going to stay focused on execution. As we complete this transition at Grasberg, we are deferring any decisions about major investments and as we go forward with the higher cash flows that we generated, we'll be able to reduce our debt and further improve our balance sheet to see what we've done this quarter? I'm confident that in 2021, we'll be in a position to recommend to our Board a resumption of our dividend for the Board to consider. And that as we go forward, we will be able to generate increasing returns to shareholders from higher cash flows. In addition, we'll have opportunities to consider significant growth from large scale low cost \u2013 low risk, high return, disciplined Brownfield investments in our large portfolio of undeveloped reserves and resources. Freeport can maintain its production, grow its production without having success and refilled expiration, which we all do or without having \u2013 without having to do any M&A deals. Slide 8 shows this, we have a long live portfolio of mineral reserves with recoverable reserves extends beyond 30 years with substantial options to expand these reserves in the future considering our large inventory of mineralized material with our resources beyond current proved and probable reserves. For now however, I want to reemphasize again, we're focused on executing our plans efficiently, delivering on our targets, as we go forward we'll be accessing growth options in a measured and disciplined way. I'll close with Slide 9, with what we adopted internally as the Freeport Edge. Our management team has had extensive experience in managing this business responsibility. We've been together a long time now. Leadership teams across the company are seasoned, battle hardened, value oriented. We're all intentionally engaged in it. That's one thing I keep talking about our work during 2020. It has been really intense, but our people are energetic, highly motivated. We have an action oriented management structure. We work together collaboratively. We're experienced decisive, never cut corners on important issues like worker safety, community responsibilities, environmental obligations. We keep a long-term focus on our licensed operators around the world. We work hard to earn this and to keep it. We know, and we've had a long history of operating on the premise that our shareholders cannot succeed, unless all stakeholders in our businesses succeed. Freeport is clearly on a global basis foremost in copper. A portfolio of assets are large high quality when established industry leader, great track record, operate mines, developed mines among the largest in the world. Our assets are long lived durable with embedded options for reserve and resource growth. Strong franchises in the U.S., South America and Indonesia. Industry-leading technical capabilities with a strong track record of project execution around the world that we're many years. We've earned the trust and respect of our partners, our customers, our suppliers to financial markets; most importantly, our workers communities in those countries. Notably our block caving experience is if not the most, one of the most extensive and long stating in the history of the global mining industry. And that's so critically important for success, both in the ramp of at Grasberg and being able to continue to execute our plans over the next 20 years. This is not for the faint of heart. We've been operating block cave mines in Indonesia since the early 1980s, and we have an important molybdenum block caving operation in our Henderson mine in Colorado. This is critically important as we tradition Grasberg from the largest \u2013 from this enormous surface mine that we completed at the end of 2018 to the largest block caving operation in the history of the mining industry. Our team has demonstrated capabilities in good times and bad, and I want to close by thanking our people, recognizing their strength and resilience to your dedication. And now this is performance that's evidence in today's report. I'm personally proud to be part of this team. I look forward to the success we're going to have before us in the future. We're all motivated and committed to persevere and to achieve the success for the benefit of all of our stakeholders. So thank you for that. And now I will return \u2013 I will turn the presentation over to Kathleen to talk about some financial matters. So, you know, on the dividend, it's really going to be something that we haven't teed-up for the board yet. We're really focused on getting through this year and going forward. But we are giving thought to this idea as we make further progress on getting to our targets is to how to establish a policy for the dividend. We won't, as I mentioned, we want to take steps to reduce debt. We're on track to doing that. We will likely take a first step of restoring the dividend, but then we will have the opportunity of doing as you said of establishing a financial policy and looking for further shareholder returns, growing shareholder returns in the future, that could be in the form of dividends and depending on how the equity market reacts, we would have the option of looking at stock buy backs. But at this point we're not \u2013 we have not really engaged with the Board to establish a specific policy. Mark, do you want to comment on the grade situation? Thanks, Alex. Okay. Hey, Timna. So an alternative would be rather than building a new smelter as to expanding the existing Gresik smelter and adding a precious metals refinery to it. That could not be expanded to a size to take all of our future concentrate production, so there it would have to be an agreement allowing us to export the excess. And we were proposing if that's a allowed, I'm going to say if we as PT-FI and this is being led by the state owned ministries in the internal discussions within the government that would involve paying an export fee on that. The benefits would be, we would avoid having to undertake this major new construction project and the financial benefits are really positive for the government. And so with the government, like all other countries around the world, seeing its financial situation being challenged by COVID this is \u2013 this has some fundamental attractions to the government. As you know, when we reached our agreement in 2018, a feature of that agreement was a commitment by PT-FI to build a new smelter that we had years of discussions about that because it is uneconomic to everyone. But to get the deal accomplished in 2018, we had to commit to do that and that commitment's in place. So it's really in the government's hands about what they decide to do, but this issue of the financial benefits to the government is a significant one. I can point to them. We haven't prioritized them yet. We've done some initial pre-feasibility, feasibility type work. We actually suspended some of that as part of our cost reduction efforts in April. But we have a significant opportunity in Chile with our El Abra project where we're essentially 50/50 partners with CODELCO. It has a significant sulfide deposit. It would be a major development project involving a water desalinization plant, but a project from the order of our Cerro Verde expansion, but it has an attractive ore body to consider. And then in the U.S. we have a series of Brownfield expansions at mines ranging from our Bagdad mine in Northwest Arizona. There's in the future a very large sulfide opportunity at Morenci, this Lone Star property as we've mine the oxide cap, we're exposing what looks to be a very significant sulfide resource, which I believe will be developed. The U.S. opportunities have some economic advantage. We own all of our lands in the U.S. essentially all of our lands and sea; so there's no royalties. The tax situation is very favorable and we have a big NOL carry forward. So when have the ability to develop resources with no taxes, no royalties, that's a big, big fundamental economic advantage. So as we go forward, we'll be doing a trade-off studies and making decisions about where and when to invest, that's in the future. We have a long line of potential partners who are interested in working with us. That'd be something we could consider. But right now, we're going to continue to focus and achieve the kind of success for the next few quarters like you saw in this third quarter. Okay. Okay. I think on every one of these calls, we noted that there will be things we'll have to deal with from time to time just to inherit the nature of mining. And what I say is the fact that we had these and we're still able to have this kind of quarter. So as we go forward and as we open up more access to these ore bodies, that gives us more flexibility. If we do have some issues to deal with offsetting those by adjusting our operations because of this greater access that continues to emerge. We said that back five years ago, we set a target of reducing what was then $20 billion of debt to five \u2013 by reducing $20 billion by $5 billion to $10 billion. So that's the $5 billion, nothing magic about it. In fact, in those earlier years that I referred to when we started generating so much cash in both of those cases, we totally paid off our debt. We were debt free, 2005 I believe we were debt free in 2010, 2011. That's just because these cash flows when the market is really good, really come at you really strong. And so in both of those cases, we were able to pay big dividends. And so we were certain, we're comfortable with the debt level we have now. Kathleen and her team has done a great job of structuring our maturity schedules. So we got really strong liquidity and certainly $5 billion would be a level of debt that we'd be comfortable living within the long run. So we'll manage our business on the basis of the cash that comes to us in our expectations by cash flows. But I think you could be comfortable in saying that, that $5 billion target is something that would be acceptable to us. Cash may come to us that we've paid down more than that, but as we did that would clearly be returning cash to shareholders and looking at these opportunities for future investments. Thanks, Chris. Appreciate it. Well, and this is a feature of the industry, David. Even with all of these projects and the Brownfield expansions, execution of those will take a long period of time. Even if we were to start today and we're not starting today. So each of these projects that would be significant projects. Now we're going to do things to make incremental improvements through the efficiency programs and so forth and so we have an initiative to actually increase volumes without making a capital investment, and we call it the America's concentrator project. But far a major Brownfield investment project from the time we make the decision to start, and that's not likely to occur until 2022, 2023, you're still looking at six or seven years at a minimum, the execution on it. So with positive cash flows, will those won't stand in the way of really having significant increases in returns to shareholders. Dave, I think the way to think about it is, we have a fully developed set of assets essentially now. And we're in \u2013 we will be, was with kind of positive markets that we have now that we appear to be moving more towards the future. We're really going to be in a harvesting set of years for the near term. And I think that's a great to be a natural resource company and being able to look at the benefit of the decisions you made over many years and see that you made the right ones and you generate cash and return it to shareholders. By the way Dave, we thought about you on Monday at lunch. So we miss being in London. All right, well, Chris, one bit of correction there about the ownership. Since the mid 1990s, Rio Tinto had a joint venture ownership in this interest. And so, while the government's interest was roughly 10%, FCX's interest was net of the Rio Tinto joint venture interest. So what we own in Grasberg today is essentially the same that we've owned since the mid 1990s. It's just that the Rio Tinto interest was transferred from a joint venture interest of Rio Tinto to shares owned by the government. So our fundamental interest has not changed. Did you follow that, Chris? They own 51% of the shares. And in the past that ownership interest there 10%. They acquired about five from us, but they acquired the Rio Tinto interest. But when you look at FCX's ownership interest, it really hasn't changed from what we've had for over the years. And that was one of the really good things about the deal that we got in 2018 is we were able to hold on to the interest that we had, even though the government had these ownership objectives, which they reached by acquiring the Rio Tinto interest. So that's just... That's right. Our economic interest has not changed. That's just a clarification. But, yes, we're fully aware of the opportunity that we have to look at a gold streaming opportunity. As you know, we've assessed those over the years in various forms. And with the spike in gold prices currently, it makes that a new opportunity for us. We need to get ramped up. You don't want to sell a stream before you have the stream in place, but we're studying various alternatives for doing that. And we recognized the opportunity to generate cash and restructure our balance sheet and our ability to deal with returns to shareholders and so forth. So that's on our plate. You can rest assure that bankers are visiting us regularly and talking about that opportunity and it's something we'll be considering. Our first order of business though is to get it ramped up. Yes. I mean, I'm just \u2013 when COVID broke out, Grasberg was the huge concern. I think most of you know, we have an enormous workforce there. It was on the order of approaching 30,000 people, roughly 20,000 at any point in time were living in close proximity to each other in the highlands area of New Guinea where it's damp and cool and people live and work together. So we really recognize that as a problem and made major investments in medical facilities, in protocols for managing it, testing equipment, PCR labs both in the highlands and the lowlands. We did all the things at the health standards say that you should do in terms of finding infected people, tracing, isolating and treating. And so, over time, we've had \u2013 and Indonesia as a country is \u2013 is a country that's challenged with COVID. So we've had a number of cases, fortunately the huge majority of those who have recovered or non-symptomatic, our process of isolation and restricting travel and testing has worked. The serious cases we have had have been few, and the most serious ones were ones where people had previous health conditions. So it's consistent with what people are faced with around the world. We've really done well in the highlands. We had an outbreak of cases in the lowlands where our ship terminal is and where people there have more of an interaction with the community to make a \u2013 which is less of a control situation. But we've instituted new protocols there and it made a great progress. So we've had to deal with it. We've had a number of cases, almost all have now recovered. And we continue to have very strict protocols on travel interactions and people there. So the government, and in large part, the local community support us. We're supporting local community with helping them health issues and testing procedures. So it's been an issue, but has been managed. Good morning. Yes, you're right. I mean, it's going well and I would not \u2013 you got to look at where I am. I'm really sensitive. I wouldn't call them what we face was a setback. It was just a situation we had to face and we managed it. I mean, man, you look back over the years, that's always the case. It's always the case with complicated mines. So it certainly wouldn't be \u2013 I wouldn't characterize it as setback, but yes we're on track. We're on track in October. If we have had any significant issues to report today, we would have reported them. So, we just feel great about what's going on. This was a critically important time for us at Grasberg in 2020 completing mining the pit and really taking the ramp up over the hump to the point where it was ramping up in generating cash flows. This was a quarter that we always knew was going to be the quarter where cash flows were going to start coming in. They did. We had to do that in managing the COVID situation and we just talked about. So it's a remarkable accomplishment that we've been able to do that and we feel very good. We feel like we've avoided the major risk of COVID. We've now avoided the major risk of the ramp up. Mark and his team will face issues every day. We're communicating about how things are going with the various aspects of our operations, how we're doing with our maintenance programs, how we're doing in. We've had a lots of excess capacity in the mill, but that's we're going to start filling the mill up. So, we've got to be prepared for that, but we're on track to 200,000 tons a day plus of ore from these underground ore bodies to the mill and everything is on track and it's really gratifying to see. Yes. This fracking approach then Mark and his team came up with, the Deep MLZ mine was delayed on the order of two years as we dealt with the seismicity issues, but \u2013 which is not a factor in the Grasberg Block Cave because of the geological setting that it's in, physical setting, I should stay, but that was an issue in the Deep MLZ, they came up with the solution and it's working. We still have seismic events from time to time, but the fracking is helping us to manage those. And we're being able to achieve the results that you see. And it's straightforward fracking. It's not as complicated as what's going on in the oil and gas industry in the Permian basin. This is a really straightforward type of operation. Certainly possible, and our guys are going to do the best they can do. We set our plans as being aspirational plans, but achievable. And the guys work every day to try to do better than planned. And they take \u2013 it's a great \u2013 I mean the smiles on our faces when we have these days, when we go over plans, its felt all the way from [indiscernible] where we are here in the United States. So everybody is oriented to try to beat the plans. And in the Americas too, I mean, Josh \u2013 Josh's guys have done a great job. Our safety statistics are great. We did have an unfortunate \u2013 fortunate fatality at Grasberg, where a worker took a really unfashionable action, but we work hard, but our safety statistics are good. Our people are focused. I think one thing about \u2013 one thing I think of this COVID thing has done for all of us is really made us focus on our work even more intently than we ever had. And I keep talking about work is intense. And so now with having restricted travel, making sacrifices in your personal life, everybody is really focused on work, and we can see the results of that globally. Rick Coleman is on the line, and he manages our capital projects globally and he's involved in the smelter rig hit. Is there any way we can give an order of magnitude number on the aggressive smelter. Yes. And it's an economic project that current PCRC raise, which the new smelter would not be... Hi, Lucas. Hang on just one second. I just want to say, just to emphasize, we've got financing available to us, ready to go if we do have to build a new smelter, it would be debt financed, no capital required by shareholders and PT-FI FCX, would not have to put capital into this. It would be the losses that the smelter generate would be tax deductible. And when you look at the current situation out there with the government owning 50% of the equity with having taxes and royalties, the government's share of the economics of the project, including the smelter, is in excess of 70%. So, we do consolidate this and I'm glad we do, even though we own 49%, we at FCX control operations of PT-FI. So it would be consolidate debt, but it would not require a capital to be put into PT-FI for the smelter from FCX. Sure. Yes, we look at all of those. We're approached with opportunities and we have our \u2013 we have a long-term history in the marketplace, so we are as a company familiar with all of these projects and mineral opportunities in North America and so forth. The challenge that we have found today \u2013 and we'll continue to do that, but the challenge we found today is we have these internal resources that have currently no value in our share price. And if we're successful in creating value, 100% of that value comes to our shareholders. But if we were to acquire properties from someone else, we'd have to pay to their shareholders, the current value of that. So it's hard to make the numbers work quite frankly. Thank you. Yes, I wouldn't do that. I mean, I think there was a couple of Bloomberg headlines out suggesting that Peruvian mine workers were a little bit still returning to the mine site. So I kind of figured that that was industry-wide just Peru alone, it wasn't something we're trying to extrapolate Grasberg or Morenci for that matter. But right, even within Peru, I mean in the second quarter, the government in Peru on a very sudden basis shut down mine. And we had a different situation because most of our workers lived in Arequipa. And so we had to then go to work with the local community and government. And we had to construct some temporary living facilities on-site for people to live and demonstrate to people that we could manage the house situation. And that would be a different situation than other operations, where they have their workforce living \u2013 already living on their site. So anyway, we've had to manage it and our guys down there just done a tremendous job, we're not in full production, but we're originally 90 day production and we're making a lot of money out of Cerro Verde now, and we have the opportunity to increase it. Thank you for your question. Thanks, John. Rick, I think that's a fair statement, right? Right. And so Lone Star, which made it so attractive initially, is it dovetails in with the depletion of the Safford reserves, which was part of the mine plan there. So we had existing processing facilities and Lone Star is so close to Safford that we're able to truck the ore to Safford facilities and also build new facilities, the oxide resource is growing. And we may have an opportunity to invest in incremental processing facilities, take advantage of that. So but this Lone Star sulfide is longer term, even then the opportunities that we have at the other projects, because we can make so much money off of oxides before we develop it. Well, thanks we're not putting me so much on the spot. It's not just next month, it's almost next week now that we got the election here in the U.S. and this goes beyond the presidential election. We've got complicated political situations everywhere. And Latin America is always a complicated area. The thing though that underlies this is that with the COVID challenges that the economies around the world are facing, but particularly in Chile and Peru, I think, that, however, the political situation unravels, there's going to be a need for those countries and objective of those countries is provide a favorable environment for mining investments. In Chile, which has had such long-term success from that there's a growing recognition of the need for Chile to not lose its competitive edge that it's had. And some of that's been eroded with some recent legislative regulatory actions. So I'm confident that those countries will see the benefits of mining investment. In Peru the bigger challenges which we fortunately found a way to manage effectively is how do mining investments interact with local communities because that's what's really been the barrier there as opposed to central government barriers. Yes, Chris we've been talking about it for a long, long time haven't we? Conceptually you can identify circumstances where mergers of equals make sense, because of the ability to reduce cost and operate more efficiently through asset management, and so forth. But in our case where we're on the verge of this \u2013 when we made great progress, now we're less than 60% there in terms of the volumes that we will achieve at Grasberg. I also believe we have the potential, even though copper markets are strong now, one of the reasons we showed that chart with the earlier years is I believe there are factors working today that could well make copper much more valuable as we go forward. They are having all these polls in connection with the virtual meetings with LME Week going on. And when you look at all the polls that people are taking copper is far outstripping other metals. So I just don't believe, and I'm a shareholder, as you know, I don't believe as a shareholder, that there is any way that we would want to consider a merger of equals right now, where we would dilute the opportunity that we have as a standalone company that's so attractive. We worked for it for a long time. And I think \u2013 I wouldn't want \u2013 and the reason I'm working in everything else is I believe we're on the verge of really good things happening at Freeport. I just made a brief reference to what happened to us in earlier years. We've had ups and downs with the company for various reasons since then, but this time we're committed to sticking to our guns. Our board has made a firm commitment five years ago to focus on what the real value opportunity to Freeport is. And that's in the copper business with this set of assets. We've shown in the past, what we could do with essentially this set of assets and how we could build real value. I'm getting to the age of where I tell too many war stories, according to some of my friends, including our CFO, but there was \u2013 2011, we had a company with a $60 billion market cap and no debt. And I think we're on the verge of rebuilding that we've taken the steps. But this is not what this company can be and what we're on the track today. And I firmly believe, and as I talked to our shareholders, nothing [indiscernible] about it that the best opportunity for our shareholders with this set of assets is to stick with a strategy that we're on right now. And it's not a short term strategy, as we've talked about, we got short term positives going for us, but there's a longer term set of opportunities that's really attractive. We'll always view the opportunities as they come about. Chris raised earlier the opportunity if this goes streaming deal, and that's certainly something we'll consider. But yes, we'll \u2013 opportunities emerge on an opportunistic basis, that's using the same word twice, but you know helps that emerge for us without having a long-term strategy of doing it. But it was an opportunity that came up because of circumstances. And we took advantage of it. If opportunities come to us in the future, that makes sense for our shareholders and we will act on it. But for right now, it's not the time to do that. We appreciate your comments and your support for all these years. Well, thanks everyone. Appreciate your interest. Obviously a great quarter for us, and we look forward to reporting continued progress. So it's been a tough world. We live in lots and lots of personal sacrifices. It's gratifying though to see within our company to see the success that we're all sharing together. And I think we've made clear today, our commitment to continue to move forward with progress and success in the future. But thanks for being on our call today."

            "content": "Sure. Yes. Alex, where we're at right now in the Deep MLZ, we're mining some of the highest grade sections of the [indiscernible] sections of the ore body. Estimation of these very high grade zones is always a challenge for our modelers. The concern is always that we take high grade intercepts and smear them over too broad of an area and caused overestimation. So we've taken a conservative but appropriate modeling approach. So the grades that you've seen are a bit of a positive variance that we've had really for the last six months. We believe our overall global estimate is appropriate. We didn't do anything with our sequencing of the cave. We followed our cave management plan and really the grades just came to us more or less as a bit of a positive surprise. But if you look at the grades individually, Deep MLZ is very high grade, it's close to 1.9% and gold grades are about 1.8%. And what we saw was a bit higher than expected grades in that very high grade portion of the mine."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nKathleen Quirk: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our conference call. Earlier this morning, we reported our second quarter 2020 operating and financial results. And a copy of the press release and slides are available on our website at fcx.com. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet. And anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today\u2019s call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today\u2019s press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. We\u2019d like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the Risk Factors described in our 2019 Form 10-K and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q, each filed with the SEC as updated by FCX's subsequent filings with the SEC. On the call today is Richard Adkerson, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Red Conger is on the call, as well as Mark Johnson; Steve Higgins, Rick Coleman and Mike Kendrick . I'll start by briefly summarizing the financial results and then turn the call over to Richard who will be going through the presentation materials. As usual, after our prepared remarks, we'll open the call up for questions. Today FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of $53 million, or $0.03 per share in the second quarter of 2020. The results included net credits of $9 million or roughly $0.01 per share, primarily associated with favorable metals inventory adjustments and an income tax credit, and those were mostly offset by COVID-19-related costs and employee separation programs. Adjusted net income after these special items totaled $44 million or $0.03 per share in the second quarter. Our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation for the second quarter totaled $754 million. That was above our July 6 estimate of approximately $650 million, primarily reflecting slightly higher sales volumes in the quarter and lower costs than our prior estimates. A reconciliation of our EBITDA is available on slide 38 of our side deck. Copper sales during the second quarter were 759 million pounds. That was about 10% higher than our April, 2020 estimate. And that reflected better than anticipated production rates in Indonesia and North America, and the timing of shipments from Cerro Verde. Our second quarter gold sales of 184,000 ounces were 12% higher than our April 2020 estimate, reflecting a strong performance in Indonesia. The average realized copper price during the quarter for copper was $2.55 per pound. That was below the year ago quarterly average of $2.75 per pound. And gold realized prices averaged $1,749 per ounce during the second quarter, above last year's second quarter of $1,351 per ounce. Consolidated average unit net cash costs averaged $1.47 per pound in the second quarter of 2020. That was lower than a year-ago quarter and also lower than our April 2020 estimate of a $1.63 per pound, reflecting the higher copper and gold sales volumes and strong execution of our cost reduction initiatives. We generated strong cash flows during the quarter, totaling $491 million in cash flows from operations and funded capital expenditures, totaling $527 million during the period. We ended the quarter with consolidated debt, totaling $9.9 billion and consolidated cash totaled $1.5 billion, with strong liquidity and no borrowings under our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard who will be referring to our slide presentation materials. Richard, please go ahead.\nRichard Adkerson: Okay. Thank you, Kathleen. And good morning to each of you, and we appreciate you participating in our call today. Hope you and your families are staying well and safe. This has been a very trying time over the past four months. Work has been intense. Life is challenging. I'm pleased that our team has shown the discipline preserver. [Ph] We faced lots of problems, but I want to say that this quarterly report as we previewed earlier is really a good news for our Freeport team and the great work we\u2019ve been doing. I'll refer to the slides and going to slide 3. At Freeport, we are of course continuing to prioritize the health and safety of our workers, and we're also working hard to support communities where we operate as we serve our customers with their ongoing requirements for copper. In late April, we laid out a comprehensive plan to share with our stakeholders at that time to describe how we were going to manage the COVID-19 health and economic issues, keep our people safe and how we were going to safeguard our business to protect the value of our assets for what we are convinced will be a very-positive long-term future. Since that time, over the past three months, I've been extremely proud of our Freeport team for the way they responded to this plan and this crisis in a very short period, making tough decisions during the height of this unprecedented crisis, and more importantly, how our team is executing these plans safely with a spirit of commitment and cooperation. We have had a real sense of urgency in implementing these plans. We moved very quickly to reduce costs and capital spending. And you can see this in our second quarter results and our annual guidance that we're providing today. Our management and healthcare -- worker healthcare today has been affected. Pleased that in addition to manage these health issues, our team has also achieved strong safety performance during the quarter. And that's particularly gratifying because of our concerns as people might be distracted, but that's not been the case. We have been able to produce safely our products, using strict operating protocols, distancing, enhancing protective equipment for our workers, sanitation, and particularly significant investments in testing and tracing isolated, infected people and treating those that are sick. We've actually had only a handful of people to be seriously sick and the vast majority of the people that have encountered the disease today have recovered. Many have not had any symptoms. But that's not deterred us from going forward with this program to protect their safety. Our workforce is adhering to global health standards. We're making sure everyone focuses on their own personal safety and the wellbeing of people around them. We are continuing and enhancing and responding to these protocols as we go forward. Our global team of workers is of course critical to our Company's success. And we recognize and I personally appreciate the dedication, commitment and their cooperation during this challenging time. Other than government imposed restrictions at Cerro Verde, there have only been very limited impacts from the pandemic at our operating sites. But knowing just how fast this virus can spread, we remain diligent and steadfast in protecting people. As I said in April, we laid out our plans to address our business and boost liquidity in what was then a very weak and volatile market environment. As a reminder, we laid out our plan to reduce costs and capital spending in 2020 by over $2 billion, the reduction of about 15% of our planned copper production, totaling about 400 million pounds, an aggressive management of all costs, including G&A and exploration. Our execution of this plan has been very effective. You see that in our second quarter results, which are better than the revised forecast. Our sales volume exceeded our April guidance about 10% for copper, 12% for gold, all achieved very safely in the face of this global crisis. Our team maintained focus, drive and came together to meet the challenges as we've done [Technical Difficulty] in the past at Freeport. Copper prices have improved dramatically during the quarter. Our plan was based in April on a $2.30 per pound copper price and we had contingencies for much lower prices. Even though prices are higher, we are staying the course, remaining disciplined and executing our cost containment plans. We\u2019re convinced this is prudent in light of the uncertainties and dynamic nature of the ongoing pandemic. We're not letting down our guard at all or taking any victory laps. We're more focused than ever as an organization to drive long-term values that we see in our assets. In a few seconds, I'll be reporting more in detail on the progress our team has made at Grasberg. The team there continues to shine in its operations, and it's really key to our long-term strategy. We are on schedule and ramping up to deliver large, low-cost, sustainable production, volume of copper and gold for years to come. The team has consistently been meeting or beating forecasts. That's been our situation for several quarters. Now, I'm pleased to report that we're on track with our ramp up plan. And I also want to especially acknowledge the Cerro Verde team for their exceptional work during this quarter to restore operations at our site near Arequipa in Peru. We've worked very closely with the Peruvian government and the local authorities. We developed a safe plan for return to operations at Cerro Verde. By June, we were operating at 80% of our 2019 rates. We're continuing to increase productivity with protocols that protect workers in the community surrounding Arequipa. The Lone Star project in Eastern Arizona advanced during the quarter on schedule and that is now being commissioned. We also continued to build flexibility in our balance sheet, through extending maturities at attractive rates. We're working with our bank group to provide enhanced downside protection to maintain liquidity through our bank credit facility. All of this has effectively safeguarded our business, allowed us to navigate this period of uncertainty and retain the massive upside we see in our asset that is now increasingly close to being in front of us. Our Company benefits from a major way from having an extraordinary long life and durable reserve base and resource space, premier position in copper, which has a compelling long-term outlook and significant exposure to gold markets. And I'm confident that continued strong execution will make these assets even more valuable to our shareholders in the future. Now, turning to slide 4. We talk about our commitment to our communities. This has been longstanding on wavering. Communities are home for our workers and their families. They're essential to our long-term success. Across the gold, we supported communities here in this time with much of the medical supplies, food, monetary support. In many respects, dealing with COVID is bringing us closer to communities -- bringing us closer communities, where we operate to fight a common cold. Our people are stepping up to help communities to meet this growing need. And as a company, we're continuing to find ways to make a difference. On slide 5, we talk about our commitment to all stakeholders. Our focus is on our shareholders of course, but equally on our workers, communities and environment. And this has been embedded in Freeport\u2019s culture for many years. We cannot be successful in generating long-term value for shareholders, unless we address sustainability issues appropriately. In fact, we learned that many years ago. While this commitment is being highlighted through our actions in response to the COVID pandemic, in our recent report -- published annual report and sustainability, which you can find on our website, summarizes all of our programs in this important area. I'm pleased to note, we've recently published our first climate report, which details our efforts to-date and our plans to address climate-related risks and opportunities to go forward. And of course, copper is going to play a key role broadly in dealing with carbon reduction and as the world focuses more on climate issues. As I mentioned and shown on slide 6, copper prices have recovered sharply from the lows in March. We're now back to the point where they were earlier in the year at the height of the crisis. Speaking candidly, this recovery came sooner and stronger than we and others anticipated, similarly to what we saw in 2009-2010. China's economy is recovering strongly and steadily from the first quarter low, being led by its industrial sector, infrastructure spending and the government's actions to stimulate the Chinese economy. Around the world, ongoing monetary and physical stimulus is helping to offset the negative economic downturn from COVID. We're beginning to see a restart in the global economies. We're also seeing some positive signs as businesses reopen in the western world, particularly with automobile production beginning to improve. Supplies of copper during this COVID pandemic have been affected, both mine supply and scrap availability are lower. Notably, inventories have remained low and have actually moved even lower in recent months. Now, this is very notable because it's not typical of past commodity downturns. Typically, in downturns, inventories rise and then have to be worked off when recovery occurs. Currently low inventories are a good omen for copper as it positions the metal for material gains as economic activity rebounds. Now, having said this, we at Freeport are cognizant of the risk of current uncertainties. We will continue to operate our business prudently until there's clarity. As economies around the world recover and improve, copper will be a major benefit. And prices are still well-below what is needed to incentivize investments and new projects, which results in a tight market as we go forward. Slide 7, we show how to become clearly and more widely acknowledged that copper's importance in a global economy will be key to achieving decarbonization initiatives, that will require greater intensity for the use of copper. Copper is strongly supported by fundamentals as an essential metal in the overall global economy. And as the economy recovers and the world grows, more copper will be needed. But, momentum is growing in efforts to reduce carbon around the world. I'm personally convinced this is going to be a mandate for all companies and governments, mandate by people as we go forward. From electric vehicles and charging stations to 5G and other technical applications, all of this is driven by electronics, and electronics require copper. Copper is essentially not only in times when the economy is growing, but also times like these when healthcare, water and food supply, communication and technology, critically important. Telecommunications, digital technologies, cloud applications have never been more important than in today's world. The current pandemic is bringing to light what copper can achieve in improving global health. Studies have demonstrated that copper can destroy viruses like COVID-19. Use in healthcare equipment, facilities, public places will undoubtedly grow significantly. Our Company, Freeport is foremost in copper. Copper is widely considered the best position major commodity from a supply-demand standpoint. And Freeport will be a major beneficiary of these trends. Now, beginning on slide eight, I'll give you a brief update on our operations and projects. At Cerro Verde, its production was impacted during the quarter by the government order, which restricted operating rights for Cerro Verde and other mines in Peru. Our Cerro Verde team is doing terrific work in working with the government and our workforce, and implementing protocols to demonstrate to the government and our workers that we can operate safely. During the quarter, we managed to increase rates from about a third of capacity to about 80% of 2019 levels. Our current plans assume we operate at about 350,000 tons per day through the mill for the balance of the year. We will continuously monitor conditions in the region and work to increase rates over time. We have demonstrated in the past that the modern concentrator complex at Cerro Verde, the largest in the world, copper industry, can produce at rates over 400,000 metric tons per day. Cerro Verde has been a large contributor to the local economy, one of the largest employers in the region, has a bright long term future. Cerro Verde is simply a great long term asset for Freeport. Now, for the good stuff. At Grasberg, I'm very pleased to report of the positive progress on our underground ramp-up. For several quarters now, our team has consistently been meeting or beating expectations. And this quarter\u2019s progress is particularly noteworthy in light of doing this with having to manage the impact of the pandemic. Combined production from our two major mines, the Grasberg Block Cave and the Deep MLZ mine averaged nearly 55,000 tons of ore per day. This is ahead of our forecast, and almost 50% above the first quarter of this year. By the end of the quarter, we were producing 70,000 tons of ore per day, containing high grades of copper and gold, and we expect to exit 2020 at 95,000 tons per day. We added 46 new drawbells during the quarter. These are the rock funnels that are used to collect ore simultaneously which add scale. We now have 260 drawbell locations and growing these. Infrastructure is in place. What we're doing now is basic Block Cave mining, advancing the cave front, building drawbells and commencing production. On slide 9, we show a new chart this quarter to illustrate the pace of our underground production ramp-up. The annualized run rate in the second quarter, this is really notable is now at about close to 50% of the ultimate goal of producing an average of 1.55 billion pounds of copper and 1.6 million ounces of gold from the underground ore bodies. This is triple what we achieved a year ago. As indicated in the graph, we expect to average about 70% of the annual targeted run rate by the fourth quarter of this year, and by the end of 2021 be at 90% of the targeted run rates. We expect to continue to add new drawbells to allow us to increase production. Basically, we'll now continue to do what we now have been doing over the last several quarters. But, when this all down, it's straight forward that all of this is achievable because of the more than 15 years we've been investing in this program. Making the decision to continue this investment during our negotiations with Indonesian government of our contract, the investments we've made in developing the infrastructure, the technical expertise of our team and managing Block Cave and a social license we have earned in Grasberg position us over the many years, we've been there. We are now positioned for achieving this success that we've been pointing to for such a long period of time. But, we know better than anybody in the world the risk inherent in Block Cave mining and there are issues that we will face. But, the progress today demonstrates validity in our confidence. We've gone a long way in derisking the long-term plan. We recently achieved a major milestone, which was expected. The Grasberg Block Cave has now intersected the massive Grasberg open pit. This is a milestone. It was also a situation that we had to be prepared to manage because it evolved certain unknowns. Gratified to say that Mark Johnson and has team are dealing with this, and we don't perceive this as being a problem. And now, the massive Grasberg open pit will literally crumble into the Block Cave mine we're developing. The value creation from this transformation is truly magic. Notably, the gold benefit at Grasberg production has been and will be a major benefit with combined rates -- combined with rates of high grades of copper. At full production, Grasberg mine is the largest gold mine, even though the gold is a byproduct of the copper operations. The high grades of copper combined with this gold component make Grasberg one of the mining industry\u2019s truly most valuable fabulous asset in its history. As gold prices, approximate $1,800 an ounce, revenues from gold are projected to completely offset the total cost of production at Grasberg. EBITDA from this operation would average $4.5 billion to $5 billion a year at copper and gold prices. Really want to say and emphasize that our partnership with the government of Indonesia remains strong and I would say grow stronger every day. We're now fully aligned in our mutual objectives of creating values for all stakeholders. And what a much improved situation it is for all of us to be focused on developing and operating this asset and not to be sidetracked by dealing with contract issues, as we were for so long. I can't say enough about how pleased I am with the agreement we reached in December 2018 and how it's being operated. I want to say, as indicated in our April report, we continue to experience delays with the development of the proposed new smelter in the Gresik area of Eastern Java. We're continuing to do running planning and site work to a certain degree, but COVID is a real serious problem in the Gresik area, and it is delaying progress with this project, with workers and with contractors. We are continuing our discussions with the government regarding our request for a year's delay in completing the project. We are also engaged in discussing with partners and representatives of government alternative scenarios that would be true beneficial to the government and the PT-FI. These matters are currently under consideration, and we'll keep you informed of what happens with this. There's nothing easy about this project we're doing. It takes a world class team in terms of competency with years of experience, strong track record of success. This is a unique asset in a unique physical setting. We're meeting this challenge. We met the challenge of dealing with the unexpected seismic events with the Deep MLZ mine, with hydraulic fracking solution that is now working and is proving to be very effective. We are confident about our team's ability to meet these challenges and confident that going forward that the biggest risks we face are behind us. Slide 9 shows -- illustrates what I've been talking about in terms of the progress that we're making towards getting to our long-term goal, which we will subsequently reach by the end of just next year, 18 months from now. Many of you\u2019ll recall how we were talking about dealing with this 15 years ago, and now we're 18 months away. As I said, in terms of targeted production, we're at about 50% way there in terms of throughput from our two major mines. We are a third of the way there and moving forward. Slide 10 covered the smelter, which I've talked about. Slide 11, we talk about our Lone Star mine in Eastern Arizona. This is the mine as most of you know, that's directly adjacent to the Safford mine where we're using available production facilities as the Safford mine ages and has availability for capacity. It's just across the mountain range from Morenci in an area of the world that we're very well familiar with and very well accepted. Our progress at Lone Star was excellent in the quarter, commissioning work has begun. We are ramping up placement of ore on a newly constructed leach pad. At Safford, the pre-stripping we undertook to explore the ore is substantially behind us now. And we're setting up for the production phase at the beginning of this quarter, third quarter. Project capital of $825 million is largely behind us, technically a bit lower than the original budget. Initial project is forecasted at 200 million pounds of copper annually. We're evaluating exciting opportunities to increase production over time with low capital. This is a tremendous resource with great expansion opportunities. But for now, we're focused on optimizing the initial project. We'll turn to major expansions of Lone Star when market conditions warrant. Over the long term, this asset will be a significant future cornerstone asset for Freeport in the United States in our outlook. I want to point out the United States has major advantages for mining investments compared with other countries around the world in general. For our Company, there are no taxes in the far U.S. investments for many, many years to come. We pay no royalties because we own lands and fleet. Energy costs are lower. We have a flexible workforce with no unions. We now have an improved regulatory framework. Freeport has achieved through hard work, community and government support for our businesses, and in the United States benefits from a strong rule of law. Slide 12, we summarize the work we've been talking about over the past year that our Company has been doing with automation. We continue to leverage the technology tools we've developed to unlock bottlenecks, use machine learning, drive to have our best operating performance every hour of every day. We have reduced the budget for this initiative -- the spending budget for this initiative, but our teams continue to progress the work we started in 2018 and 2019, using internal resources with minimal capital investment. We continue to be encouraged by the power of these two, and the results we\u2019ve generated to-date. And I can say, the enthusiasm of our team for this initiative is very-high. Now, putting this altogether on slide 13, you will see that we're on a path to double our EBITDA from 2020 levels as we go forward. Execution of these plans now well underway, will allow us to grow copper volumes by over 20% in 2021, gold volumes by 75%, reduce our net unit cost by over 20% and significantly expand our margin and cash flows. Assuming an average of $2.70 copper for 2020, this takes into account the first year actual average in $285 million copper for the balance of the year. EBITDA would approximate $3.4 billion. This expands to $7 billion per year at $2.75 to $3 copper. Our gold revenues are expected to approximate $2.7 billion per year at $1,800 gold. So, you can see the very positive exposure we have to gold prices. Through our decisive actions announced in April for 2020, we have protected the downside, while we've retained the growth in cash flows for 2021 and beyond. That was the objective of the whole exercise. This combination of growing volumes with the potential -- has the potential to coincide with [Technical Difficulty] copper prices to enable us to strengthen our balance sheet and then returned to the day when we can provide significant cash returns to our shareholders. We at Freeport have all worked so hard to position our Company for this opportunity. And it's particularly gratifying now to see this firmly within our line of sight. Slide 14. I'm so proud of our organization and what we refer to internally as The Freeport Edge. Our management team has extensive experience in managing tough market environments. Leadership teams across our Company are seasoned battle-hardened. They have been effective and successful in past downturns. Each crisis is different, but in each of our past experiences, Freeport as a company has come out stronger. We have a management structure and a team that is collaborative, experienced and decisive. We never cut corners on important issues involving worker safety, environmental obligations, responsibilities to our communities, and commitments to governments. We keep a long-term focus on our license to operate around the world that we have worked so hard to earn. We've shown that we can adjust to market conditions quickly. We've done this on multiple occasions and we're doing it now. We\u2019ve developed contingency plans for further actions required to take this on a site by site basis. Value orientation is real hallmark of this Freeport organization. Freeport is foremost in copper in the industry. And copper is a great place to be. Freeport\u2019s portfolio of assets are large and high quality. We are an established an industry leader by developing and operating mines that are among the largest in the world. Our assets are long-lived and durable with embedded options for reserve and resource growth. We have strong franchises in the USA, South America and Indonesia. We have industry-leading technical capabilities through a strong track record of project execution demonstrated over many years. We've earned the trust and respect of our partners, our customers, our suppliers, financial markets, most importantly, our workers, communities, and host companies, where we operate. Really important that our Block Caving experience in our company is one of the most extensive and longstanding is the history of the global mining industry. We've been successfully operating Block Cave mines in Indonesia since the early 1980s. And we have an important molybdenum Block Caving operation in Colorado at our Henderson mine. This experience and capabilities and competency is critically important as we\u2019re introducing Grasberg with the largest Block Caving operation in the world. And I can tell you it's highly valued by our Indonesian partners. Our experience and battle-tested management has demonstrated the capabilities to perform in good times and in bads. We are confident in our ability to live with these plans safely and efficiently. Before turning the presentation back to Kathleen, I want to close by sincerely thanking all of our Freeport people. They inspire me every day. I want to recognize them for their strength and resiliency, their dedication and performance. I'm personally proud to be part of this team over all these years. I can tell you, we're all motivated and committed to persevering and achieving success for all of our stakeholders. Kathleen? \nKathleen Quirk: Great. Thanks, Richard. And I'll just briefly review our financial outlook, beginning on slide 17, and then we'll take your questions. On slide 17, we're summarizing our sales outlook for 2020 through 2022. As Richard indicated, our global team is performing at a high level. We've increased our 2020 sales outlook by about 60 million pounds of copper and 50,000 ounces of gold, reflecting the strong second quarter performance. As reflected in the charts, our sales volumes estimates are expected to grow by over 20% in 2021 and 30% in 2022, compared to 2020 levels. Notably, volumes in 2022 are expected to increase by nearly 1 billion pounds of copper from 2020 levels. This reflects the projected addition of volumes from Grasberg as we move toward design capacity and the increased Cerro Verde volumes as we continue to restore full production levels. Our gold volumes, as I said, in 2020, are slightly above our prior estimates and are similar to the guidance that we provided for 2021 and 2022. For moly, we've adjusted the sales outlook slightly to better match our supply with current market conditions. We show on the next slide, slide 18, our volumes by quarter. And as you'll see, we're expecting a strong second half with sales increasing throughout the year. And you'll know, by the fourth quarter, we're very close to our 2021 run rate for annual volumes. Our teams remain very-focused on executing the plan safely and finishing the year strong. Turning to costs on the next slide, slide 19. You can see, we moved very quickly in March and April to adjust our cost structure. We modified our mine plans to reduce mining rates and to reduce higher cost production, and we successfully implemented a series of cost savings initiatives to drive long-term benefits. As Richard mentioned, in addition to the operating cost reductions, we also took steps to reduce overhead and exploration costs, and those initiatives were also successfully implemented during the second quarter. We reduced our North American mining rates in the second quarter by about 25%, compared to the year-ago quarter. We also reduced our contract labor significantly, and our team stepped up -- internal-team stepped up to fill in the gaps. We continue to effectively implement the cost containment programs that have been underway in Indonesia. And as a result of these combined initiatives, our unit cash cost declined from $1.90 per pound on a net unit cost basis in the first quarter to $1.47 per pound in the second quarter. This was over 10% better than our April forecast. We're continuing to manage all costs very carefully and expect our net unit cash costs to trend lower in the second half of the year and into 2021, as we increase volumes at a very-low incremental cost. Our current forecast incorporates current market conditions for energy prices, currency rates and other input costs. These input costs have increased somewhat from our April forecast, but this has been offset by improved gold prices. So, we're continuing to expect our net unit cash costs for the year to be roughly $1.53, that's similar to the average cost we estimated of $1.55 in April. And in 2021, the average is expected to decline to below $1.20 per pound. With the rising volumes and declining cash costs, we expect our margins and cash flows expand in the second half of the year. As you look at slide 20, this provides the EBITDA and cash flow sensitivities, and shows the significant cash flow generation that we expect from the business, bringing in the additional volumes into 2021 and 2022 and beyond. As you'll see, if we assume gold prices flat at $1,800 per ounce, and molybdenum flat at $7 per pound, we would generate between $6 billion and $8 billion of annual EBITDA at copper prices ranging between $2.75 per pound and $3.25 per pound. Operating cash flows which are reflected at the bottom of the chart would range between $4 billion and $5 billion at these price levels. This provides significant amount of cash flow to fund our capital expenditures and provides excess cash flows for further balance sheet improvement and returns to shareholders. We're all very-focused on this. We're very close to getting there, as you'll see from the results we expect in the fourth quarter of this year. And much of the capital that was required to generate this result has already been spent to achieve this. And we\u2019ll continue to maintain our focus on delivering these results. On slide 21, we present the capital spending plans. We continue to manage the capital plans in line with the revised estimates we laid out in April. As a reminder, we reduced our 2020 capital spending by about $800 million. And we're tracking very well against those plans. The bulk of the $2 billion capital budget for 2020 is related to the Grasberg underground development, which will pay back quickly as we reach capacity rates. As Richard indicated, the spending for Lone Star in 2020 is largely behind us and we'll begin to generate cash flow from that operation. We have adjusted slightly to 2021 capital budget down from $2.3 billion to $2.2 billion that was originally estimated at the beginning of the year to total $2.4 billion. And we're presenting our 2022 estimates. And as you'll see the spending at Grasberg will begin to decline and decline after 2022 as well. We're going to continue to manage our capital spending levels very carefully. We remain very-disciplined in carrying out our revised operating plans. Turning to our financial and liquidity position. You'll see we had strong liquidity at the end of June, totaling $5 billion and our financial position is strong. We've taken steps to protect the balance sheet and liquidity and we undertook a series of capital markets transactions over the last 12 months to extend out our debt maturity profile and provide flexibility. We also worked with our banks and achieved amendment of our credit facility during the second quarter, which provides substantial flexibility and gives us access to the liquidity under the bank credit facility. We show our net debt at the end of June of $8.4 billion, that's a debt of just under $10 billion net of our cash position of $1.5 billion. And that equates to about 2.5 times the estimated 2020 EBITDA. Notably, that relates if you look at 2021 EBITDA, the leverage is 1.4 times. If we were to apply the 2021 projected excess cash flow to net debt reduction, we\u2019d have $5.3 billion of net-debt at the end of 2021 or less than one time the 2021 EBITDA. Our uses of excess cash will be considered by the Board. There's a strong commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet to drive shareholder returns over the long-term, and our Board will consider financial policy as we go forward. But, we show at the bottom of the chart, the average duration of our debt, which is currently just under 11 years. And as you can see, we've built significant flexibility with the maturity schedule that is very attractive profile over the next few years. Regarding financial policy, as we've covered throughout this call, we remain focused on safeguarding our people and our business, and maintain strong liquidity and balance sheet strength as we manage through uncertainty during the pandemic. As previously reported, our Board has indicated it does not expect to declare dividends in 2020, but this will be evaluated on a regular basis. And as we successfully execute these plans in 2021, we expect to be in a much stronger position with increased cash flows, enhanced flexibility to consider shareholder returns. So that's just a summary of our quarter and outlook. And now, operator, we\u2019d like to take questions.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instruction] Our first question will come from the line of David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets.\nDavid Gagliano: You\u2019ve covered a lot of it in the prepared remarks. But, I did just want to try and talk a little bit more on the capital return policy. Obviously, strong free cash flow generation expected over the next six quarters, net debt metrics flow one times. Is there a target of average, leverage metrics over the cycle? And from a timing perspective, when should investors start thinking about getting some of that cash back?\nRichard Adkerson: So, Dave, we've always approached those questions not from the standpoint of developing any particular financial metrics, but assessing commodity markets cash flows and where we stand. We will want to reduce our debt from the current levels. We were doing that -- on a track to do that before COVID. And so, as these cash flows recover, and Kathleen talks about capital spending going down, we will have much higher volumes and the prospects for higher copper prices will have opportunities in the relative near-term, beginning in 2020, by the end of 2021, to achieve that goal of reducing debt going forward. Now, I want to compliment Kathleen and her team for the actions they have been taken over the past 10 months or so. We've had three bond offerings now that have been very successful at rates that are really attractive considering the fact that we are just beyond being an investment grade, still we expect someday to get back to the investment grade. But, now, we spread out our maturities. We work with flexibility of the bank group, so we can achieve all that. So, I can't give you anything other than, if this world unfolds like we hope it will and expect it to the very near-future, we're going to be able to return paying dividends, and looking at the possibility of buying stock back, depending on how the equity market reacts to our improved situation. I quite frankly expect the equity market to react positively in a significant way.\nDavid Gagliano: Okay. Thanks for that. And somewhat related on the Indonesian smelter, first of all, I'm assuming that the cash flow numbers that are -- those projected net debt numbers are not included anything for the smelter and the CapEx for smelters...\nKathleen Quirk: That's right.\nDavid Gagliano: Okay. And then, in the press release\u2026\nRichard Adkerson: But, let me just say, I know you understand this, Dave, because you followed us so closely over the years. But, to be clear to everyone else, the smelter, if we go forward with the current plan, and as I said, that's under discussion, will be financed by PT-FI where we have a 49% equity interest. But, because of our shareholders agreement with the government of Indonesia and the state-owned company, MIND ID, we consolidate. So, we have a 49% interest. We finance by that entity. But, it will show up as consolidated debt because we consolidate PT-FI, which is really good for the way we present our financial statements.\nDavid Gagliano: Okay. That's helpful. Then just really quickly, the related question there on the Indonesian smelter. The press release talks about other alternatives in terms of deferring schedule for the projects as well as other alternatives. Can you touch a little bit more on what those other alternatives might be?\nRichard Adkerson: One of the positive things about this is these considerations within Indonesian government are being led by the Minister and the Ministry of State Owned Enterprises, whereas in the past, we had to deal with that on our own. We have aligned interest with the state owned enterprises. And a number of alternatives are being considered, which would be alternatives to building the smelter is presently contemplating. It's a complicated political situation, it goes without saying. But the economic benefits to the government are really strong if we were to pursue other alternatives that would require significantly less capital from PT-FI.\nDavid Gagliano: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks very much.\nRichard Adkerson: Thanks, Dave.\nOperator: Your next question comes from a line of Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley.\nCarlos De Alba: Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. So, my question is on the ramp-up in -- of Indonesia on the ground operations. I appreciate and congratulations on achieving the targets and being on the right track to deliver results there. I just got a question on slide 25. The open drawbells on a cumulative blasted basis were -- declined a little bit from the last quarter presentation, just a little bit less in 2020, 2021 and 2022 in the DMLZ; and for the GBC, it is lower in 2020 and 2021, slightly higher in 2022. So, I appreciate that these may be too specific of a question. But, given that this is probably the most important aspect of people going forward, I just wanted to get some clarification as to what drove that rise in the forecast? Thank you.\nKathleen Quirk: Yes. This is Kathleen. There were just minor revisions to the Deep MLZ and GBC drawbells. And you can see at the end of 2021, we had 213 for Deep MLZ and 322, and those have been reduced by 3 each. It\u2019s not been anything significant and just slight timing differences. By the end of 2022 in Deep MLZ we\u2019re just slightly below, but it doesn't change the ore extraction levels and it's pretty much the same plan that we've been on.\nCarlos De Alba: Understood. Thank you very much and good luck.\nRichard Adkerson: I'll just say, this is a -- as I mentioned earlier, this is a complicated operation, Mark Johnson is on the call and nobody knows that better than him. So, there are going to be ups and downs and adjustments and so forth. That's part of our everyday life out there. But, of what we set out to do and what we're doing, and we have confidence that over time, we'll do it. But, having said that, there will be things that we'll have to deal with as we have in the past. So, you'll see adjustments like this occur from time to time.\nCarlos De Alba: All right. Understand, Richard. Thank you very much for the color.\nRichard Adkerson: Okay.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Alex Hacking with Citi.\nAlex Hacking: Yes. Good morning. Thanks, Richard and Kathleen. I just wanted to ask around the production guidance. In the last quarter, in the teeth of COVID crisis and copper prices extremely low, you cut your production guidance for this year and in particular next year where you took a couple of hundred million pounds out of South America. Is that something that gets revisited if copper prices are sustained at these levels, or those kind of revised mine plans locked in that? Thank you.\nRichard Adkerson: Well, they are revised mine plans that we're following. And we are not. We\u2019re tweaking but we're not making any major adjustments to those until we have clarity in this market situation. But as clarity occurs, the plans will be adjusted, the resources are there some of this -- the cut production was a lower margin production. And if prices increase, it becomes a profitable again. So, there will be timing impacts as to how it ramps up and so forth. So, it'll be part of our future. But, as you know all too well, this is not a turn on it, turn off [ph] it thing. You ratchet back. It has impacts. To ramp it back up takes some time.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Chris LaFemina with Jefferies.\nChris LaFemina: Hey. Good morning, Richard, Kathleen. Thank you for taking my question. For me, the most impressive data point in this earnings release was the unit cost performance in the Americas, especially on a site production and delivery cost basis where you had very substantial reductions from the first quarter to second quarter. I suppose that's a function of the changes to your operating plans. My question relates to the guidance. So, if you look at the unit cost guidance for 2020, in particular to South America, it implies that site production and delivery costs will rise in the second half of the year. And I'm wondering why that might be. And I suppose, related to that is Cerro Verde production. I think in the last quarter, you had guided to second half 2020 mill rate of 400,000 tons per day. And in the press release today, you -- in the presentation today, you are guiding to 350,000 tons per day. So I'm wondering if there is some kind of cost increase that we should expect for Cerro Verde in the second half a year. I would have thought that with the mill rate going up from the run rate in the second quarter to the second half of the year, unit costs might actually fall further, but it does not appear to be the case. So, just if you can give us some clarity as to what exactly is going on by cost outlook for the second half of the year in South America in particular.\nKathleen Quirk: The main change in the second half compared to the second quarter in South America relates to increasing the Cerro Verde mining rate. And during the second quarter, the mining rate was lower than what we expect. In order to get the mil rate up on a sustained basis, we'll have to begin increasing the mining rate. So, that's what that reflects in the second half. But, to your point about the cost reductions, the team has just done incredible work in bringing down costs. I mentioned the use of reduction in contract costs, contract labor costs. We've had some headwinds on some of the currency exchange rates and energy costs from the low levels that we had in the second quarter. Those have reversed a little bit. But, the discipline of driving the cost performance and balancing that with production is something that our team is very focused on. So that's, to the prior question, about increasing copper volumes, we're being very careful to make sure that we have sustainable cost savings and the cost structure before starting to ramp up. But specifically on South America the increase relates to an increase in mining rate at Cerro Verde from the second quarter levels.\nChris LaFemina: Okay. Thanks for that. And so, I one other question related\u2026\nRichard Adkerson: Yes. Let me come in here because I really appreciate the comments you made about the performance in Americas. And this goes back to the rationale when put we Phelps Dodge and Freeport together. But, the Americas operations are characterized with these very large, lower grade ore deposits, which is kind of the world forward in the copper industry. And Red Conger and Josh Olmsted had such experience with this, but they're doing such a great job and it's the operations in the field, the way they're managing the team, we operate all the mines that we have interest in. So, we're able to achieve synergies across the board. Our global supply chain group has done just a great job in working with our suppliers and coming in with cost. We've had a playbook for this. I mean, we've done this before and we're doing again very effectively. But, these guys really need to be recognized for dealing with this entirely different set of management challenges than you have with this high-grade mine we have in Grasberg. And I want to also recognize Kathleen and Steve Higgins, our Chief Administration Officer for what we've done with G&A. This is really significant. Our Company changed dramatically at the end of 2016 when we exited the oil and gas business, restructured our management team. But, at that year, we really only had $700 million in G&A. Now, our current expectations are that we go down to $355 million. It's been in steps over these years, but that's almost a 50% reduction in G&A over the past now four years. And this has been done as a process. We made some major steps. We had to furlough some people unfortunately. We had a incentivized early retirement, severance plan. We've reduced our head cut off and our centralized groups by something over 30%. But, this is all part of the things that have come out from this COVID initiative and they all have long-lasting benefits. As a company, we\u2019ll never work in the same way that we did before this COVID thing change. There's going to be less office space, less meetings, less travel. We proved to ourselves that we can work effectively. We did not go back to work in Phoenix when the Governor opened the state up. The halls are and offices are empty in our headquarters. And yet, you can see the results from this core about how effectively we can operate in this kind of environment. And we're learning lessons from that that we will carry forward to the way we do business in the future.\nChris LaFemina: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jatinder Goel with Exane BNP Paribas.\nJatinder Goel: Good morning. Just a quick question, thinking more long term. Richard, you alluded that when market conditions allow, you can look at Lone Star expansion. And you also indicated about 5-million-ton gap emerging in the market by 2030. To me, the real constrains for you appear to be balance sheet and potentially management capacity till Grasberg is delivered. So, from a long-term perspective, you've got three things probably on your plate, Lone Star, El Abra, and Kucing Liar, which you can look after Grasberg is delivered and balance sheet is at a more normal capacity. How quickly you can move to develop either or all of those projects and what could be the order of priority? So, just trying to get some sense on your earliest possible timeline and order of priority. Thank you.\nRichard Adkerson: The timelines are long. One of the issues that\u2019s so supportive of copper supply is simply how long it takes from identifying a resource to doing the feasibility studies for how it's to be developed? How it\u2019s to permitted in processing and so forth? So, all of these things will take long time -- long term. And that is a key reason of why the outlook for copper as a commodity is so strong. The current projects that are being pursued today are not in aggregate significant to the market but are significant to companies but they're being delayed. So you ask about our situation. The Kucing Liar fits into our long term mine plan for Grasberg and that's something that we're assessing and we'll consider and look at going forward. Lone Star has the opportunity for oxide expansion, which is growing. That could be done with a limited amount of investment in new facilities. But longer term, there's a large sulphide resource, and this will be long term but it is very, very large. And that would require very, very large concentrator expansion. We have great opportunities at El Abra with our partner Codelco in Chile. We have great opportunities in the U.S. at other properties, including Bagdad, Morenci, Sierrita, our properties in New Mexico. And so, all of these things are being studied. We are going to be very-disciplined about it. First steps for cash flow will be using debt, increasing shareholder -- returns to shareholders, and then we will -- we have restrained spending in the project evaluation area, as we have across the board and our country for the current time. As the situation improves, we'll return to investing in the evaluation process. And from that, we'll come to timing schedule that you have. We don't have one right now. But we will keep you informed as this unfolds and we start spending again and getting in the process for evaluation. But, key, positive feature about Freeport is this opportunity to grow our business internally to develop resources which we get no value for currently today in our stock price. If we develop those ourselves, all that value goes to our shareholders as opposed to making an acquisition where substantial value goes to the owners of the asset being acquired. I know that's not a clear answer to your question, but it's a truthful answer to where we are.\nJatinder Goel: That's very helpful. Thank you so much for the clarification.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Lucas Pipes with B. Riley FBR.\nLucas Pipes: Hey. Good morning, everyone, and congrats on another very strong quarter. Richard, in light of current gold prices, I wondered if you have considered changing your float into foremost in copper, second in gold or something along those lines?\nRichard Adkerson: Lucas, gold, like copper, has its ups and downs and often gold is up when copper is down, copper\u2019s up when gold is down. I remember years ago when gold was really high, I decided to change the name to Freeport Gold and Copper. That was before...\nLucas Pipes: And you already touched on my question that is gold equities tend to trade at substantially lower discount rates. And I wondered how you're thinking about that types that changing names or changing slogans. Thank you very much, Richard.\nRichard Adkerson: Well, we have over the years looked at a number of strategic alternatives involving our gold asset. Back in the days, before Phelps Dodge, Freeport was a company that was two-thirds copper, one-third gold, and we really struggled to attract investors because of the different objectives of gold investors and copper objectives. And really, we found the only way we could track investors was paying extraordinarily high dividends. And for those of -- you are all too young to remember that, but that was where we were. We made the commitment to the copper business. The gold component of Grasberg is as I talked about earlier a key reason of why that asset is so fabulously attracted. And so, we're a price taker with gold. We continually review options about dealing with it. But, today we concluded that its greatest value to us is funding the cost of Grasberg. Just think about this having 1.5 billion pounds of copper was no cost or negative cost. And so, that's the role we see it playing in our Company.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research.\nJohn Tumazos: Thank you very much. Congratulations on the great production, and thank you for the update on the next smelter. Some of the other companies have cut back on exploration, waste stripping, underground development or maintenance and the struggle to keep up production. Are there any of those functions that have been delayed at some of your sites such that 2022, 2023, 2024 output targets might be a little uphill or tougher to meet?\nRichard Adkerson: Kathleen, let me start. So, John, that's a great point. And I mean, you could look back in our history and with the -- in 2008, when the price of copper just cratered from $4 a pound at midyear to approaching $2 a pound by midway in the third, fourth quarter, we did have to make some of those changes. I mean, we parked a hundred trucks at Morenci, right Red? It was something on that order, cut production in half. And that resulted in a multiyear ramp up. So breaking our business apart from exploration, we have essentially terminated all greenfield exploration, which is pretty limited for us anyway, considering our brownfield opportunities. We continue to do work at key operations. That's not going to be a constraint for us going forward. Grasberg, we really have looked at cost hard, made some reductions, but done nothing to slow down the ramp-up of our future. So, we did defer a mill improvement, but which could have some impact, but it was only a short term. Now with prices being where they are, that's not going to be an issue. With the Americas, as I said, we've been very -- so, we're doing this in a way that preserves as much as the future as we can. But, as Kathleen illustrated with Cerro Verde, when you cut back the mill and you cut back mine rates, there is a timing issues in getting the mine rates back up to rates that feeds the mill. So, there will be some impact, but we are so mindful of that that I think we've been very effective in minimizing that impact. In any event, we're going to update this every quarter. And so, we give a lot of details. So, you'll be able to see that as we go forward.\nKathleen Quirk: Yes. I was just going to say, the mining rate reduction that we took in the U.S. was deliberate in terms of getting the cost structure as low as possible. And so, the metal production rates that we show in our forecast are consistent with the level of mining rates that we are deliberately working towards. It's not like a situation where we have an update at the metal forecast to coincide with the mining rates. So, our mining rate and metal forecasts are aligned. In second quarter, we did have similar mining rates for Cerro Verde because of the pandemic. That was the only one where we mined less and kept the mill as full as possible, and we'll have to ramp up mining in the second half. But, the rest of the mining operations in the U.S. really were cut back deliberately, and we've reflected that in our metal forecast. If we were to ramp back up, which our current plans assume it will start ramping back mining rates in 2022 timeframe, you would start to see metal improve over time. But, we haven't shortcutted anything. And so, all of our mining rates in metal forecasts are in line.\nJohn Tumazos: If I could ask one more, and thank you for the two replies. You have the footnote on the Lone Star slide that the potential mineralization is over 50 billion pounds that I guess would be at least 3 billion tons of mineralized material. In your gut, do you think that the Lone Star is more like 3 billion tons or 5 or 10 or even bigger?\nRichard Adkerson: Hey, Red? Red, you're on the call, right?\nRed Conger: Yes. John, it\u2019s a huge district. We're very excited about it as we've reported in the past, lots of drilling to be conducted, where I think we're going to find that the full district has mineralization in it, where if you look at the maps, Lone Star is miles away from those progresses where we first started mining. So, lots of drilling yet to do, but the Lone Star deposit is what we know about, it as a mineralized material that you just cited. And we'll continue to drill and explore there and update those as we get more information.\nKathleen Quirk: Yes. And I think John, as you know, the oxide project that we're doing plus potential expansion of oxides is really not only economic in terms of the initial investments. But, it exposes the sulfide ores and makes that opportunity -- it's a long-term opportunity, but makes that opportunity more economic as we continue to mine the oxide. So, we're very excited about the district. And it's a long-term play but one that we feel will be a big part of Freeport\u2019s future going forward.\nJohn Tumazos: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question we'll have on the line of Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank.\nChris Terry: Hi, Richard and Kathleen. I hope you\u2019re both well. Just a quick one for me and that is the 2021-2022 volumes were just down a touch versus the last quarter, just comparing the two presentations. So, I think it's 100 million pounds or so. Is that just a bring forward effect where you've done better in 2020, or is there something else to that? It\u2019s very minor, but sort of check?\nKathleen Quirk: Yes No, the main difference was the mining and milling in South America. We have some -- we assumed a lower rate in Cerro Verde. We were previously at 400 sooner than what's in our current plans, and we've made some minor adjustments also to El Abra. So, they were minor revisions but did end up impacting 2021 and 2022.Grasberg is unchanged.\nChris Terry: Okay, thanks. Actually, one follow-up just to complete one of the questions from a bit early just on the cost side. I mean you commented on sort of some of the ups and downs. You had the tailwind from, I think, in Indonesia on the currency last quarter and then oil down drastically. And then, there's ups and downs on mining rights. But from a macro sense, just given that we've now seen copper start to rebound, are we entering environment, where you start to get inflation in general on some of the costs for the business as well, just more from the macro variables?\nKathleen Quirk: The main thing that we\u2019ve seen really is on the currency rates. We've had the energy prices from our prior forecasts were up about 18%, from April forecasts. But, we've also had -- and some of this has been offset with gold. But, the way that the dollar has raised against some of these currencies has had an impact on our costs in Indonesia with the rupiah rate and to a lesser extent in Chile and Peru. But,, that's really the only thing we have seen is really these macro, currency exchange rates and the energy prices. We haven't seen -- and we continue to work with our suppliers, we haven't seen inflation in other areas. And of course, with the level of employment, et cetera, the labor rate pressure is not what it is sometimes when you see copper prices rallying. So, we're going to continue to focus on driving out as much cost as we can, using this time period to execute the plans, the revised plans and drive costs as low as we can. And in the U.S. and in South America, the costs really have a big impact on value, because the lower the costs, the bigger the resource. And so, we will focus on that as we go through 2020.\nChris Terry: Great, thanks. Thanks, Kathleen, and congrats on a great turnaround in the quarter.\nRichard Adkerson: Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Brian MacArthur with Raymond James.\nBrian MacArthur: Just two quick questions. First of all, I just want to confirm, the forecast through 2022 and all your production, your cash flows, is Chino in there or is it not?\nKathleen Quirk: It is not. It's currently remained idled and we're still evaluating next steps with respect to restart.\nBrian MacArthur: Perfect. Thank you. My second question and I know maybe getting a little ahead of myself here, but obviously you're going to generate an awful lot of cash flow going forward. And as Richard said, you've been working for 15 years to get everything underground, set up the Grasberg, which have a lot of work. And you've sort of had ongoing major project costs of $1 billion a year and you get down to $900 million in 2022. And I understand too in 2022, the ownership changes in a little bit. But what does the ongoing capital look at -- look like sort of post 2022, once we get the GBC developed, everything's up and running, how long can you do it, like just keep generating without major capital go into KL or something? Because I would think post that period, you've had substantial capital to build this thing for 15 years. Some of that on a runway should come off or is that right?\nKathleen Quirk: Yes. And we've got -- in terms of our current plans, we project the capital will decline in 2022 from 2021, as we mentioned, but even further beginning in 2023. We're looking at KL and relooking at the project and running scenarios and trade-off analysis to look at the capital involved in developing KL, which involves potentially having some additional processing equipment to handle pyrite ores. We're looking at if there is a higher NPV option that involves lower capital that would mine the areas that are -- that have less pyrite. And so, actually from a value standpoint, it could be something that's more valuable than just full out development of the whole resource. So, we're currently in those -- in progress with those analyses. But, for the foreseeable future, as we get a Grasberg ramped up, the capital will decline. And we don't have -- we don't have a major decision to make. In the next few years, we will want to settle on what the KL plan is, but in terms of capital outlays, we don't have major increases in capital forecast in our plans for Kucing Liar. We want to deliver the Grasberg and Deep MLZ first. \nBrian MacArthur: It makes great sense, but would capital down like a lot at Grasberg in \u201820 -- like when I say go down a lot, I mean you've been spending about $1 billion in development a year plus sustaining, give or take, will that go down like $200 million or $300 million for a few years, or I guess that\u2019s all dependent on whether... \nKathleen Quirk: Aside from KL, you could see CapEx at Grasberg going down to $300 million or $400 million level. And ultimately, we'll have to make decision on what the plan is for KL. But, it'll go down significantly beginning in 2023 and beyond. So, just the cash flow from GBC -- from Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ are going to be massive. And we'll look at reinvesting that into KL over time.\nBrian MacArthur: Kathleen, you did say to 3 to $400 million, right?\nKathleen Quirk: Right. It'll go down to 3 to $400 million, right, from over $1 billion.\nBrian MacArthur: Yes. Right. Great. Thank you very much. Again, congratulations on the great progress that has been made.\nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of Michael Dudas with VRP.\nMichael Dudas: Thanks Richard and Kathleen. What a difference a quarter makes, huh?\nKathleen Quirk: We were just saying the same thing.\nMichael Dudas: My question is, Richard, do you think how your company and the industry has evolved and managed through COVID in the past four months and what will happen in the future? Do you think that the industry or maybe Freeport particularly and industry in general will be look -- perceived as a better partner from a labor and a government standpoint? So, as we move forward in the next several years of higher prices and development and maybe some issues with regard to royalties and such, do you think that what\u2019s come out that will be helpful to the industry and that could also maybe be helpful on ESG or any type of thing? Thank you.\nRichard Adkerson: Yes, I do. In fact, early this morning, I added to my notes that I was going to say that I said earlier actually when we're done with COVID, in many respects [Technical Difficulty] closer to communities and governments. [Technical Difficulty] I recall, going into February, going into March, when we started working remotely, Kathleen and I were looking at each other and saying, okay, now what are we going to do? And by April, we had a plan. Well, that's the situation for all these communities and all these governments, and people are still struggling with that. And so, by our being aggressive in investing in healthcare protocols, testing equipment and doing things to help these communities in Indonesia, I mean, we have two PCR labs. Here in the United States, what does it take often, a week to two weeks to get PCR results? Well, we have two PCR labs, one in Lone and one to the Highlands, which we're working with community use, and that's much appreciated. We had to build an oxygen facility in for Arequipa. So by showing that we are competent in managing these, by showing we have sensitivities to workers\u2019 families and the communities by working with governments to do that, we're showing both, competency, sensitivity and the fact that we are committed to being good partners. So, I think all of that's going to be beneficial. We've achieved that in steps. We moved our headquarters to Arizona several years ago. We made a big commitment to show people of Arizona that we could be good partners. And now, we are broadly regarded as being great partners. So, that's an excellent point. And ESG matters are growing in importance and significance to investors. We know that. We believe that's a good trend. And we will measure up well by that, because that's just what our commitment is.\nMichael Dudas: It\u2019s quite encouraging. Thank you, Richard.\nRichard Adkerson: So, thank you all for\u2026\nOperator: Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to management.\nRichard Adkerson: Thank you, Gina. Thanks all of you joining us. We appreciate your interest, appreciate the good questions. Of course, it is -- a quarter\u2019s made a heck a difference, but it is so great now to be focused totally on what we are doing operationally with our business. We look forward to reporting continued progress. As always, if any of you have questions or need some more information, contact David Joint, and we\u2019ll be responsive. Good luck to everybody. Take care. This thing is not controlled yet. So, all of you be careful and watch out for your families and friends.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kathleen Quirk",
            "content": "Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our conference call. Earlier this morning, we reported our second quarter 2020 operating and financial results. And a copy of the press release and slides are available on our website at fcx.com. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet. And anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the Risk Factors described in our 2019 Form 10-K and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q, each filed with the SEC as updated by FCX's subsequent filings with the SEC. On the call today is Richard Adkerson, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Red Conger is on the call, as well as Mark Johnson; Steve Higgins, Rick Coleman and Mike Kendrick . I'll start by briefly summarizing the financial results and then turn the call over to Richard who will be going through the presentation materials. As usual, after our prepared remarks, we'll open the call up for questions. Today FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of $53 million, or $0.03 per share in the second quarter of 2020. The results included net credits of $9 million or roughly $0.01 per share, primarily associated with favorable metals inventory adjustments and an income tax credit, and those were mostly offset by COVID-19-related costs and employee separation programs. Adjusted net income after these special items totaled $44 million or $0.03 per share in the second quarter. Our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation for the second quarter totaled $754 million. That was above our July 6 estimate of approximately $650 million, primarily reflecting slightly higher sales volumes in the quarter and lower costs than our prior estimates. A reconciliation of our EBITDA is available on slide 38 of our side deck. Copper sales during the second quarter were 759 million pounds. That was about 10% higher than our April, 2020 estimate. And that reflected better than anticipated production rates in Indonesia and North America, and the timing of shipments from Cerro Verde. Our second quarter gold sales of 184,000 ounces were 12% higher than our April 2020 estimate, reflecting a strong performance in Indonesia. The average realized copper price during the quarter for copper was $2.55 per pound. That was below the year ago quarterly average of $2.75 per pound. And gold realized prices averaged $1,749 per ounce during the second quarter, above last year's second quarter of $1,351 per ounce. Consolidated average unit net cash costs averaged $1.47 per pound in the second quarter of 2020. That was lower than a year-ago quarter and also lower than our April 2020 estimate of a $1.63 per pound, reflecting the higher copper and gold sales volumes and strong execution of our cost reduction initiatives. We generated strong cash flows during the quarter, totaling $491 million in cash flows from operations and funded capital expenditures, totaling $527 million during the period. We ended the quarter with consolidated debt, totaling $9.9 billion and consolidated cash totaled $1.5 billion, with strong liquidity and no borrowings under our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard who will be referring to our slide presentation materials. Richard, please go ahead. Great. Thanks, Richard. And I'll just briefly review our financial outlook, beginning on slide 17, and then we'll take your questions. On slide 17, we're summarizing our sales outlook for 2020 through 2022. As Richard indicated, our global team is performing at a high level. We've increased our 2020 sales outlook by about 60 million pounds of copper and 50,000 ounces of gold, reflecting the strong second quarter performance. As reflected in the charts, our sales volumes estimates are expected to grow by over 20% in 2021 and 30% in 2022, compared to 2020 levels. Notably, volumes in 2022 are expected to increase by nearly 1 billion pounds of copper from 2020 levels. This reflects the projected addition of volumes from Grasberg as we move toward design capacity and the increased Cerro Verde volumes as we continue to restore full production levels. Our gold volumes, as I said, in 2020, are slightly above our prior estimates and are similar to the guidance that we provided for 2021 and 2022. For moly, we've adjusted the sales outlook slightly to better match our supply with current market conditions. We show on the next slide, slide 18, our volumes by quarter. And as you'll see, we're expecting a strong second half with sales increasing throughout the year. And you'll know, by the fourth quarter, we're very close to our 2021 run rate for annual volumes. Our teams remain very-focused on executing the plan safely and finishing the year strong. Turning to costs on the next slide, slide 19. You can see, we moved very quickly in March and April to adjust our cost structure. We modified our mine plans to reduce mining rates and to reduce higher cost production, and we successfully implemented a series of cost savings initiatives to drive long-term benefits. As Richard mentioned, in addition to the operating cost reductions, we also took steps to reduce overhead and exploration costs, and those initiatives were also successfully implemented during the second quarter. We reduced our North American mining rates in the second quarter by about 25%, compared to the year-ago quarter. We also reduced our contract labor significantly, and our team stepped up -- internal-team stepped up to fill in the gaps. We continue to effectively implement the cost containment programs that have been underway in Indonesia. And as a result of these combined initiatives, our unit cash cost declined from $1.90 per pound on a net unit cost basis in the first quarter to $1.47 per pound in the second quarter. This was over 10% better than our April forecast. We're continuing to manage all costs very carefully and expect our net unit cash costs to trend lower in the second half of the year and into 2021, as we increase volumes at a very-low incremental cost. Our current forecast incorporates current market conditions for energy prices, currency rates and other input costs. These input costs have increased somewhat from our April forecast, but this has been offset by improved gold prices. So, we're continuing to expect our net unit cash costs for the year to be roughly $1.53, that's similar to the average cost we estimated of $1.55 in April. And in 2021, the average is expected to decline to below $1.20 per pound. With the rising volumes and declining cash costs, we expect our margins and cash flows expand in the second half of the year. As you look at slide 20, this provides the EBITDA and cash flow sensitivities, and shows the significant cash flow generation that we expect from the business, bringing in the additional volumes into 2021 and 2022 and beyond. As you'll see, if we assume gold prices flat at $1,800 per ounce, and molybdenum flat at $7 per pound, we would generate between $6 billion and $8 billion of annual EBITDA at copper prices ranging between $2.75 per pound and $3.25 per pound. Operating cash flows which are reflected at the bottom of the chart would range between $4 billion and $5 billion at these price levels. This provides significant amount of cash flow to fund our capital expenditures and provides excess cash flows for further balance sheet improvement and returns to shareholders. We're all very-focused on this. We're very close to getting there, as you'll see from the results we expect in the fourth quarter of this year. And much of the capital that was required to generate this result has already been spent to achieve this. And we'll continue to maintain our focus on delivering these results. On slide 21, we present the capital spending plans. We continue to manage the capital plans in line with the revised estimates we laid out in April. As a reminder, we reduced our 2020 capital spending by about $800 million. And we're tracking very well against those plans. The bulk of the $2 billion capital budget for 2020 is related to the Grasberg underground development, which will pay back quickly as we reach capacity rates. As Richard indicated, the spending for Lone Star in 2020 is largely behind us and we'll begin to generate cash flow from that operation. We have adjusted slightly to 2021 capital budget down from $2.3 billion to $2.2 billion that was originally estimated at the beginning of the year to total $2.4 billion. And we're presenting our 2022 estimates. And as you'll see the spending at Grasberg will begin to decline and decline after 2022 as well. We're going to continue to manage our capital spending levels very carefully. We remain very-disciplined in carrying out our revised operating plans. Turning to our financial and liquidity position. You'll see we had strong liquidity at the end of June, totaling $5 billion and our financial position is strong. We've taken steps to protect the balance sheet and liquidity and we undertook a series of capital markets transactions over the last 12 months to extend out our debt maturity profile and provide flexibility. We also worked with our banks and achieved amendment of our credit facility during the second quarter, which provides substantial flexibility and gives us access to the liquidity under the bank credit facility. We show our net debt at the end of June of $8.4 billion, that's a debt of just under $10 billion net of our cash position of $1.5 billion. And that equates to about 2.5 times the estimated 2020 EBITDA. Notably, that relates if you look at 2021 EBITDA, the leverage is 1.4 times. If we were to apply the 2021 projected excess cash flow to net debt reduction, we'd have $5.3 billion of net-debt at the end of 2021 or less than one time the 2021 EBITDA. Our uses of excess cash will be considered by the Board. There's a strong commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet to drive shareholder returns over the long-term, and our Board will consider financial policy as we go forward. But, we show at the bottom of the chart, the average duration of our debt, which is currently just under 11 years. And as you can see, we've built significant flexibility with the maturity schedule that is very attractive profile over the next few years. Regarding financial policy, as we've covered throughout this call, we remain focused on safeguarding our people and our business, and maintain strong liquidity and balance sheet strength as we manage through uncertainty during the pandemic. As previously reported, our Board has indicated it does not expect to declare dividends in 2020, but this will be evaluated on a regular basis. And as we successfully execute these plans in 2021, we expect to be in a much stronger position with increased cash flows, enhanced flexibility to consider shareholder returns. So that's just a summary of our quarter and outlook. And now, operator, we'd like to take questions. That's right. Yes. This is Kathleen. There were just minor revisions to the Deep MLZ and GBC drawbells. And you can see at the end of 2021, we had 213 for Deep MLZ and 322, and those have been reduced by 3 each. It's not been anything significant and just slight timing differences. By the end of 2022 in Deep MLZ we're just slightly below, but it doesn't change the ore extraction levels and it's pretty much the same plan that we've been on. The main change in the second half compared to the second quarter in South America relates to increasing the Cerro Verde mining rate. And during the second quarter, the mining rate was lower than what we expect. In order to get the mil rate up on a sustained basis, we'll have to begin increasing the mining rate. So, that's what that reflects in the second half. But, to your point about the cost reductions, the team has just done incredible work in bringing down costs. I mentioned the use of reduction in contract costs, contract labor costs. We've had some headwinds on some of the currency exchange rates and energy costs from the low levels that we had in the second quarter. Those have reversed a little bit. But, the discipline of driving the cost performance and balancing that with production is something that our team is very focused on. So that's, to the prior question, about increasing copper volumes, we're being very careful to make sure that we have sustainable cost savings and the cost structure before starting to ramp up. But specifically on South America the increase relates to an increase in mining rate at Cerro Verde from the second quarter levels. Yes. I was just going to say, the mining rate reduction that we took in the U.S. was deliberate in terms of getting the cost structure as low as possible. And so, the metal production rates that we show in our forecast are consistent with the level of mining rates that we are deliberately working towards. It's not like a situation where we have an update at the metal forecast to coincide with the mining rates. So, our mining rate and metal forecasts are aligned. In second quarter, we did have similar mining rates for Cerro Verde because of the pandemic. That was the only one where we mined less and kept the mill as full as possible, and we'll have to ramp up mining in the second half. But, the rest of the mining operations in the U.S. really were cut back deliberately, and we've reflected that in our metal forecast. If we were to ramp back up, which our current plans assume it will start ramping back mining rates in 2022 timeframe, you would start to see metal improve over time. But, we haven't shortcutted anything. And so, all of our mining rates in metal forecasts are in line. Yes. And I think John, as you know, the oxide project that we're doing plus potential expansion of oxides is really not only economic in terms of the initial investments. But, it exposes the sulfide ores and makes that opportunity -- it's a long-term opportunity, but makes that opportunity more economic as we continue to mine the oxide. So, we're very excited about the district. And it's a long-term play but one that we feel will be a big part of Freeport's future going forward. Yes No, the main difference was the mining and milling in South America. We have some -- we assumed a lower rate in Cerro Verde. We were previously at 400 sooner than what's in our current plans, and we've made some minor adjustments also to El Abra. So, they were minor revisions but did end up impacting 2021 and 2022.Grasberg is unchanged. The main thing that we've seen really is on the currency rates. We've had the energy prices from our prior forecasts were up about 18%, from April forecasts. But, we've also had -- and some of this has been offset with gold. But, the way that the dollar has raised against some of these currencies has had an impact on our costs in Indonesia with the rupiah rate and to a lesser extent in Chile and Peru. But,, that's really the only thing we have seen is really these macro, currency exchange rates and the energy prices. We haven't seen -- and we continue to work with our suppliers, we haven't seen inflation in other areas. And of course, with the level of employment, et cetera, the labor rate pressure is not what it is sometimes when you see copper prices rallying. So, we're going to continue to focus on driving out as much cost as we can, using this time period to execute the plans, the revised plans and drive costs as low as we can. And in the U.S. and in South America, the costs really have a big impact on value, because the lower the costs, the bigger the resource. And so, we will focus on that as we go through 2020. It is not. It's currently remained idled and we're still evaluating next steps with respect to restart. Yes. And we've got -- in terms of our current plans, we project the capital will decline in 2022 from 2021, as we mentioned, but even further beginning in 2023. We're looking at KL and relooking at the project and running scenarios and trade-off analysis to look at the capital involved in developing KL, which involves potentially having some additional processing equipment to handle pyrite ores. We're looking at if there is a higher NPV option that involves lower capital that would mine the areas that are -- that have less pyrite. And so, actually from a value standpoint, it could be something that's more valuable than just full out development of the whole resource. So, we're currently in those -- in progress with those analyses. But, for the foreseeable future, as we get a Grasberg ramped up, the capital will decline. And we don't have -- we don't have a major decision to make. In the next few years, we will want to settle on what the KL plan is, but in terms of capital outlays, we don't have major increases in capital forecast in our plans for Kucing Liar. We want to deliver the Grasberg and Deep MLZ first. Aside from KL, you could see CapEx at Grasberg going down to $300 million or $400 million level. And ultimately, we'll have to make decision on what the plan is for KL. But, it'll go down significantly beginning in 2023 and beyond. So, just the cash flow from GBC -- from Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ are going to be massive. And we'll look at reinvesting that into KL over time. Right. It'll go down to 3 to $400 million, right, from over $1 billion. We were just saying the same thing."

We're very excited about it as we've reported in the past, lots of drilling to be conducted, where I think we're going to find that the full district has mineralization in it, where if you look at the maps, Lone Star is miles away from those progresses where we first started mining. So, lots of drilling yet to do, but the Lone Star deposit is what we know about, it as a mineralized material that you just cited. And we'll continue to drill and explore there and update those as we get more information."

            "content": "Okay. Thank you, Kathleen. And good morning to each of you, and we appreciate you participating in our call today. Hope you and your families are staying well and safe. This has been a very trying time over the past four months. Work has been intense. Life is challenging. I'm pleased that our team has shown the discipline preserver. [Ph] We faced lots of problems, but I want to say that this quarterly report as we previewed earlier is really a good news for our Freeport team and the great work we've been doing. I'll refer to the slides and going to slide 3. At Freeport, we are of course continuing to prioritize the health and safety of our workers, and we're also working hard to support communities where we operate as we serve our customers with their ongoing requirements for copper. In late April, we laid out a comprehensive plan to share with our stakeholders at that time to describe how we were going to manage the COVID-19 health and economic issues, keep our people safe and how we were going to safeguard our business to protect the value of our assets for what we are convinced will be a very-positive long-term future. Since that time, over the past three months, I've been extremely proud of our Freeport team for the way they responded to this plan and this crisis in a very short period, making tough decisions during the height of this unprecedented crisis, and more importantly, how our team is executing these plans safely with a spirit of commitment and cooperation. We have had a real sense of urgency in implementing these plans. We moved very quickly to reduce costs and capital spending. And you can see this in our second quarter results and our annual guidance that we're providing today. Our management and healthcare -- worker healthcare today has been affected. Pleased that in addition to manage these health issues, our team has also achieved strong safety performance during the quarter. And that's particularly gratifying because of our concerns as people might be distracted, but that's not been the case. We have been able to produce safely our products, using strict operating protocols, distancing, enhancing protective equipment for our workers, sanitation, and particularly significant investments in testing and tracing isolated, infected people and treating those that are sick. We've actually had only a handful of people to be seriously sick and the vast majority of the people that have encountered the disease today have recovered. Many have not had any symptoms. But that's not deterred us from going forward with this program to protect their safety. Our workforce is adhering to global health standards. We're making sure everyone focuses on their own personal safety and the wellbeing of people around them. We are continuing and enhancing and responding to these protocols as we go forward. Our global team of workers is of course critical to our Company's success. And we recognize and I personally appreciate the dedication, commitment and their cooperation during this challenging time. Other than government imposed restrictions at Cerro Verde, there have only been very limited impacts from the pandemic at our operating sites. But knowing just how fast this virus can spread, we remain diligent and steadfast in protecting people. As I said in April, we laid out our plans to address our business and boost liquidity in what was then a very weak and volatile market environment. As a reminder, we laid out our plan to reduce costs and capital spending in 2020 by over $2 billion, the reduction of about 15% of our planned copper production, totaling about 400 million pounds, an aggressive management of all costs, including G&A and exploration. Our execution of this plan has been very effective. You see that in our second quarter results, which are better than the revised forecast. Our sales volume exceeded our April guidance about 10% for copper, 12% for gold, all achieved very safely in the face of this global crisis. Our team maintained focus, drive and came together to meet the challenges as we've done [Technical Difficulty] in the past at Freeport. Copper prices have improved dramatically during the quarter. Our plan was based in April on a $2.30 per pound copper price and we had contingencies for much lower prices. Even though prices are higher, we are staying the course, remaining disciplined and executing our cost containment plans. We're convinced this is prudent in light of the uncertainties and dynamic nature of the ongoing pandemic. We're not letting down our guard at all or taking any victory laps. We're more focused than ever as an organization to drive long-term values that we see in our assets. In a few seconds, I'll be reporting more in detail on the progress our team has made at Grasberg. The team there continues to shine in its operations, and it's really key to our long-term strategy. We are on schedule and ramping up to deliver large, low-cost, sustainable production, volume of copper and gold for years to come. The team has consistently been meeting or beating forecasts. That's been our situation for several quarters. Now, I'm pleased to report that we're on track with our ramp up plan. And I also want to especially acknowledge the Cerro Verde team for their exceptional work during this quarter to restore operations at our site near Arequipa in Peru. We've worked very closely with the Peruvian government and the local authorities. We developed a safe plan for return to operations at Cerro Verde. By June, we were operating at 80% of our 2019 rates. We're continuing to increase productivity with protocols that protect workers in the community surrounding Arequipa. The Lone Star project in Eastern Arizona advanced during the quarter on schedule and that is now being commissioned. We also continued to build flexibility in our balance sheet, through extending maturities at attractive rates. We're working with our bank group to provide enhanced downside protection to maintain liquidity through our bank credit facility. All of this has effectively safeguarded our business, allowed us to navigate this period of uncertainty and retain the massive upside we see in our asset that is now increasingly close to being in front of us. Our Company benefits from a major way from having an extraordinary long life and durable reserve base and resource space, premier position in copper, which has a compelling long-term outlook and significant exposure to gold markets. And I'm confident that continued strong execution will make these assets even more valuable to our shareholders in the future. Now, turning to slide 4. We talk about our commitment to our communities. This has been longstanding on wavering. Communities are home for our workers and their families. They're essential to our long-term success. Across the gold, we supported communities here in this time with much of the medical supplies, food, monetary support. In many respects, dealing with COVID is bringing us closer to communities -- bringing us closer communities, where we operate to fight a common cold. Our people are stepping up to help communities to meet this growing need. And as a company, we're continuing to find ways to make a difference. On slide 5, we talk about our commitment to all stakeholders. Our focus is on our shareholders of course, but equally on our workers, communities and environment. And this has been embedded in Freeport's culture for many years. We cannot be successful in generating long-term value for shareholders, unless we address sustainability issues appropriately. In fact, we learned that many years ago. While this commitment is being highlighted through our actions in response to the COVID pandemic, in our recent report -- published annual report and sustainability, which you can find on our website, summarizes all of our programs in this important area. I'm pleased to note, we've recently published our first climate report, which details our efforts to-date and our plans to address climate-related risks and opportunities to go forward. And of course, copper is going to play a key role broadly in dealing with carbon reduction and as the world focuses more on climate issues. As I mentioned and shown on slide 6, copper prices have recovered sharply from the lows in March. We're now back to the point where they were earlier in the year at the height of the crisis. Speaking candidly, this recovery came sooner and stronger than we and others anticipated, similarly to what we saw in 2009-2010. China's economy is recovering strongly and steadily from the first quarter low, being led by its industrial sector, infrastructure spending and the government's actions to stimulate the Chinese economy. Around the world, ongoing monetary and physical stimulus is helping to offset the negative economic downturn from COVID. We're beginning to see a restart in the global economies. We're also seeing some positive signs as businesses reopen in the western world, particularly with automobile production beginning to improve. Supplies of copper during this COVID pandemic have been affected, both mine supply and scrap availability are lower. Notably, inventories have remained low and have actually moved even lower in recent months. Now, this is very notable because it's not typical of past commodity downturns. Typically, in downturns, inventories rise and then have to be worked off when recovery occurs. Currently low inventories are a good omen for copper as it positions the metal for material gains as economic activity rebounds. Now, having said this, we at Freeport are cognizant of the risk of current uncertainties. We will continue to operate our business prudently until there's clarity. As economies around the world recover and improve, copper will be a major benefit. And prices are still well-below what is needed to incentivize investments and new projects, which results in a tight market as we go forward. Slide 7, we show how to become clearly and more widely acknowledged that copper's importance in a global economy will be key to achieving decarbonization initiatives, that will require greater intensity for the use of copper. Copper is strongly supported by fundamentals as an essential metal in the overall global economy. And as the economy recovers and the world grows, more copper will be needed. But, momentum is growing in efforts to reduce carbon around the world. I'm personally convinced this is going to be a mandate for all companies and governments, mandate by people as we go forward. From electric vehicles and charging stations to 5G and other technical applications, all of this is driven by electronics, and electronics require copper. Copper is essentially not only in times when the economy is growing, but also times like these when healthcare, water and food supply, communication and technology, critically important. Telecommunications, digital technologies, cloud applications have never been more important than in today's world. The current pandemic is bringing to light what copper can achieve in improving global health. Studies have demonstrated that copper can destroy viruses like COVID-19. Use in healthcare equipment, facilities, public places will undoubtedly grow significantly. Our Company, Freeport is foremost in copper. Copper is widely considered the best position major commodity from a supply-demand standpoint. And Freeport will be a major beneficiary of these trends. Now, beginning on slide eight, I'll give you a brief update on our operations and projects. At Cerro Verde, its production was impacted during the quarter by the government order, which restricted operating rights for Cerro Verde and other mines in Peru. Our Cerro Verde team is doing terrific work in working with the government and our workforce, and implementing protocols to demonstrate to the government and our workers that we can operate safely. During the quarter, we managed to increase rates from about a third of capacity to about 80% of 2019 levels. Our current plans assume we operate at about 350,000 tons per day through the mill for the balance of the year. We will continuously monitor conditions in the region and work to increase rates over time. We have demonstrated in the past that the modern concentrator complex at Cerro Verde, the largest in the world, copper industry, can produce at rates over 400,000 metric tons per day. Cerro Verde has been a large contributor to the local economy, one of the largest employers in the region, has a bright long term future. Cerro Verde is simply a great long term asset for Freeport. Now, for the good stuff. At Grasberg, I'm very pleased to report of the positive progress on our underground ramp-up. For several quarters now, our team has consistently been meeting or beating expectations. And this quarter's progress is particularly noteworthy in light of doing this with having to manage the impact of the pandemic. Combined production from our two major mines, the Grasberg Block Cave and the Deep MLZ mine averaged nearly 55,000 tons of ore per day. This is ahead of our forecast, and almost 50% above the first quarter of this year. By the end of the quarter, we were producing 70,000 tons of ore per day, containing high grades of copper and gold, and we expect to exit 2020 at 95,000 tons per day. We added 46 new drawbells during the quarter. These are the rock funnels that are used to collect ore simultaneously which add scale. We now have 260 drawbell locations and growing these. Infrastructure is in place. What we're doing now is basic Block Cave mining, advancing the cave front, building drawbells and commencing production. On slide 9, we show a new chart this quarter to illustrate the pace of our underground production ramp-up. The annualized run rate in the second quarter, this is really notable is now at about close to 50% of the ultimate goal of producing an average of 1.55 billion pounds of copper and 1.6 million ounces of gold from the underground ore bodies. This is triple what we achieved a year ago. As indicated in the graph, we expect to average about 70% of the annual targeted run rate by the fourth quarter of this year, and by the end of 2021 be at 90% of the targeted run rates. We expect to continue to add new drawbells to allow us to increase production. Basically, we'll now continue to do what we now have been doing over the last several quarters. But, when this all down, it's straight forward that all of this is achievable because of the more than 15 years we've been investing in this program. Making the decision to continue this investment during our negotiations with Indonesian government of our contract, the investments we've made in developing the infrastructure, the technical expertise of our team and managing Block Cave and a social license we have earned in Grasberg position us over the many years, we've been there. We are now positioned for achieving this success that we've been pointing to for such a long period of time. But, we know better than anybody in the world the risk inherent in Block Cave mining and there are issues that we will face. But, the progress today demonstrates validity in our confidence. We've gone a long way in derisking the long-term plan. We recently achieved a major milestone, which was expected. The Grasberg Block Cave has now intersected the massive Grasberg open pit. This is a milestone. It was also a situation that we had to be prepared to manage because it evolved certain unknowns. Gratified to say that Mark Johnson and has team are dealing with this, and we don't perceive this as being a problem. And now, the massive Grasberg open pit will literally crumble into the Block Cave mine we're developing. The value creation from this transformation is truly magic. Notably, the gold benefit at Grasberg production has been and will be a major benefit with combined rates -- combined with rates of high grades of copper. At full production, Grasberg mine is the largest gold mine, even though the gold is a byproduct of the copper operations. The high grades of copper combined with this gold component make Grasberg one of the mining industry's truly most valuable fabulous asset in its history. As gold prices, approximate $1,800 an ounce, revenues from gold are projected to completely offset the total cost of production at Grasberg. EBITDA from this operation would average $4.5 billion to $5 billion a year at copper and gold prices. Really want to say and emphasize that our partnership with the government of Indonesia remains strong and I would say grow stronger every day. We're now fully aligned in our mutual objectives of creating values for all stakeholders. And what a much improved situation it is for all of us to be focused on developing and operating this asset and not to be sidetracked by dealing with contract issues, as we were for so long. I can't say enough about how pleased I am with the agreement we reached in December 2018 and how it's being operated. I want to say, as indicated in our April report, we continue to experience delays with the development of the proposed new smelter in the Gresik area of Eastern Java. We're continuing to do running planning and site work to a certain degree, but COVID is a real serious problem in the Gresik area, and it is delaying progress with this project, with workers and with contractors. We are continuing our discussions with the government regarding our request for a year's delay in completing the project. We are also engaged in discussing with partners and representatives of government alternative scenarios that would be true beneficial to the government and the PT-FI. These matters are currently under consideration, and we'll keep you informed of what happens with this. There's nothing easy about this project we're doing. It takes a world class team in terms of competency with years of experience, strong track record of success. This is a unique asset in a unique physical setting. We're meeting this challenge. We met the challenge of dealing with the unexpected seismic events with the Deep MLZ mine, with hydraulic fracking solution that is now working and is proving to be very effective. We are confident about our team's ability to meet these challenges and confident that going forward that the biggest risks we face are behind us. Slide 9 shows -- illustrates what I've been talking about in terms of the progress that we're making towards getting to our long-term goal, which we will subsequently reach by the end of just next year, 18 months from now. Many of you'll recall how we were talking about dealing with this 15 years ago, and now we're 18 months away. As I said, in terms of targeted production, we're at about 50% way there in terms of throughput from our two major mines. We are a third of the way there and moving forward. Slide 10 covered the smelter, which I've talked about. Slide 11, we talk about our Lone Star mine in Eastern Arizona. This is the mine as most of you know, that's directly adjacent to the Safford mine where we're using available production facilities as the Safford mine ages and has availability for capacity. It's just across the mountain range from Morenci in an area of the world that we're very well familiar with and very well accepted. Our progress at Lone Star was excellent in the quarter, commissioning work has begun. We are ramping up placement of ore on a newly constructed leach pad. At Safford, the pre-stripping we undertook to explore the ore is substantially behind us now. And we're setting up for the production phase at the beginning of this quarter, third quarter. Project capital of $825 million is largely behind us, technically a bit lower than the original budget. Initial project is forecasted at 200 million pounds of copper annually. We're evaluating exciting opportunities to increase production over time with low capital. This is a tremendous resource with great expansion opportunities. But for now, we're focused on optimizing the initial project. We'll turn to major expansions of Lone Star when market conditions warrant. Over the long term, this asset will be a significant future cornerstone asset for Freeport in the United States in our outlook. I want to point out the United States has major advantages for mining investments compared with other countries around the world in general. For our Company, there are no taxes in the far U.S. investments for many, many years to come. We pay no royalties because we own lands and fleet. Energy costs are lower. We have a flexible workforce with no unions. We now have an improved regulatory framework. Freeport has achieved through hard work, community and government support for our businesses, and in the United States benefits from a strong rule of law. Slide 12, we summarize the work we've been talking about over the past year that our Company has been doing with automation. We continue to leverage the technology tools we've developed to unlock bottlenecks, use machine learning, drive to have our best operating performance every hour of every day. We have reduced the budget for this initiative -- the spending budget for this initiative, but our teams continue to progress the work we started in 2018 and 2019, using internal resources with minimal capital investment. We continue to be encouraged by the power of these two, and the results we've generated to-date. And I can say, the enthusiasm of our team for this initiative is very-high. Now, putting this altogether on slide 13, you will see that we're on a path to double our EBITDA from 2020 levels as we go forward. Execution of these plans now well underway, will allow us to grow copper volumes by over 20% in 2021, gold volumes by 75%, reduce our net unit cost by over 20% and significantly expand our margin and cash flows. Assuming an average of $2.70 copper for 2020, this takes into account the first year actual average in $285 million copper for the balance of the year. EBITDA would approximate $3.4 billion. This expands to $7 billion per year at $2.75 to $3 copper. Our gold revenues are expected to approximate $2.7 billion per year at $1,800 gold. So, you can see the very positive exposure we have to gold prices. Through our decisive actions announced in April for 2020, we have protected the downside, while we've retained the growth in cash flows for 2021 and beyond. That was the objective of the whole exercise. This combination of growing volumes with the potential -- has the potential to coincide with [Technical Difficulty] copper prices to enable us to strengthen our balance sheet and then returned to the day when we can provide significant cash returns to our shareholders. We at Freeport have all worked so hard to position our Company for this opportunity. And it's particularly gratifying now to see this firmly within our line of sight. Slide 14. I'm so proud of our organization and what we refer to internally as The Freeport Edge. Our management team has extensive experience in managing tough market environments. Leadership teams across our Company are seasoned battle-hardened. They have been effective and successful in past downturns. Each crisis is different, but in each of our past experiences, Freeport as a company has come out stronger. We have a management structure and a team that is collaborative, experienced and decisive. We never cut corners on important issues involving worker safety, environmental obligations, responsibilities to our communities, and commitments to governments. We keep a long-term focus on our license to operate around the world that we have worked so hard to earn. We've shown that we can adjust to market conditions quickly. We've done this on multiple occasions and we're doing it now. We've developed contingency plans for further actions required to take this on a site by site basis. Value orientation is real hallmark of this Freeport organization. Freeport is foremost in copper in the industry. And copper is a great place to be. Freeport's portfolio of assets are large and high quality. We are an established an industry leader by developing and operating mines that are among the largest in the world. Our assets are long-lived and durable with embedded options for reserve and resource growth. We have strong franchises in the USA, South America and Indonesia. We have industry-leading technical capabilities through a strong track record of project execution demonstrated over many years. We've earned the trust and respect of our partners, our customers, our suppliers, financial markets, most importantly, our workers, communities, and host companies, where we operate. Really important that our Block Caving experience in our company is one of the most extensive and longstanding is the history of the global mining industry. We've been successfully operating Block Cave mines in Indonesia since the early 1980s. And we have an important molybdenum Block Caving operation in Colorado at our Henderson mine. This experience and capabilities and competency is critically important as we're introducing Grasberg with the largest Block Caving operation in the world. And I can tell you it's highly valued by our Indonesian partners. Our experience and battle-tested management has demonstrated the capabilities to perform in good times and in bads. We are confident in our ability to live with these plans safely and efficiently. Before turning the presentation back to Kathleen, I want to close by sincerely thanking all of our Freeport people. They inspire me every day. I want to recognize them for their strength and resiliency, their dedication and performance. I'm personally proud to be part of this team over all these years. I can tell you, we're all motivated and committed to persevering and achieving success for all of our stakeholders. Kathleen? So, Dave, we've always approached those questions not from the standpoint of developing any particular financial metrics, but assessing commodity markets cash flows and where we stand. We will want to reduce our debt from the current levels. We were doing that -- on a track to do that before COVID. And so, as these cash flows recover, and Kathleen talks about capital spending going down, we will have much higher volumes and the prospects for higher copper prices will have opportunities in the relative near-term, beginning in 2020, by the end of 2021, to achieve that goal of reducing debt going forward. Now, I want to compliment Kathleen and her team for the actions they have been taken over the past 10 months or so. We've had three bond offerings now that have been very successful at rates that are really attractive considering the fact that we are just beyond being an investment grade, still we expect someday to get back to the investment grade. But, now, we spread out our maturities. We work with flexibility of the bank group, so we can achieve all that. So, I can't give you anything other than, if this world unfolds like we hope it will and expect it to the very near-future, we're going to be able to return paying dividends, and looking at the possibility of buying stock back, depending on how the equity market reacts to our improved situation. I quite frankly expect the equity market to react positively in a significant way. But, let me just say, I know you understand this, Dave, because you followed us so closely over the years. But, to be clear to everyone else, the smelter, if we go forward with the current plan, and as I said, that's under discussion, will be financed by PT-FI where we have a 49% equity interest. But, because of our shareholders agreement with the government of Indonesia and the state-owned company, MIND ID, we consolidate. So, we have a 49% interest. We finance by that entity. But, it will show up as consolidated debt because we consolidate PT-FI, which is really good for the way we present our financial statements. One of the positive things about this is these considerations within Indonesian government are being led by the Minister and the Ministry of State Owned Enterprises, whereas in the past, we had to deal with that on our own. We have aligned interest with the state owned enterprises. And a number of alternatives are being considered, which would be alternatives to building the smelter is presently contemplating. It's a complicated political situation, it goes without saying. But the economic benefits to the government are really strong if we were to pursue other alternatives that would require significantly less capital from PT-FI. Thanks, Dave. I'll just say, this is a -- as I mentioned earlier, this is a complicated operation, Mark Johnson is on the call and nobody knows that better than him. So, there are going to be ups and downs and adjustments and so forth. That's part of our everyday life out there. But, of what we set out to do and what we're doing, and we have confidence that over time, we'll do it. But, having said that, there will be things that we'll have to deal with as we have in the past. So, you'll see adjustments like this occur from time to time. Okay. Well, they are revised mine plans that we're following. And we are not. We're tweaking but we're not making any major adjustments to those until we have clarity in this market situation. But as clarity occurs, the plans will be adjusted, the resources are there some of this -- the cut production was a lower margin production. And if prices increase, it becomes a profitable again. So, there will be timing impacts as to how it ramps up and so forth. So, it'll be part of our future. But, as you know all too well, this is not a turn on it, turn off [ph] it thing. You ratchet back. It has impacts. To ramp it back up takes some time. Yes. Let me come in here because I really appreciate the comments you made about the performance in Americas. And this goes back to the rationale when put we Phelps Dodge and Freeport together. But, the Americas operations are characterized with these very large, lower grade ore deposits, which is kind of the world forward in the copper industry. And Red Conger and Josh Olmsted had such experience with this, but they're doing such a great job and it's the operations in the field, the way they're managing the team, we operate all the mines that we have interest in. So, we're able to achieve synergies across the board. Our global supply chain group has done just a great job in working with our suppliers and coming in with cost. We've had a playbook for this. I mean, we've done this before and we're doing again very effectively. But, these guys really need to be recognized for dealing with this entirely different set of management challenges than you have with this high-grade mine we have in Grasberg. And I want to also recognize Kathleen and Steve Higgins, our Chief Administration Officer for what we've done with G&A. This is really significant. Our Company changed dramatically at the end of 2016 when we exited the oil and gas business, restructured our management team. But, at that year, we really only had $700 million in G&A. Now, our current expectations are that we go down to $355 million. It's been in steps over these years, but that's almost a 50% reduction in G&A over the past now four years. And this has been done as a process. We made some major steps. We had to furlough some people unfortunately. We had a incentivized early retirement, severance plan. We've reduced our head cut off and our centralized groups by something over 30%. But, this is all part of the things that have come out from this COVID initiative and they all have long-lasting benefits. As a company, we'll never work in the same way that we did before this COVID thing change. There's going to be less office space, less meetings, less travel. We proved to ourselves that we can work effectively. We did not go back to work in Phoenix when the Governor opened the state up. The halls are and offices are empty in our headquarters. And yet, you can see the results from this core about how effectively we can operate in this kind of environment. And we're learning lessons from that that we will carry forward to the way we do business in the future. The timelines are long. One of the issues that's so supportive of copper supply is simply how long it takes from identifying a resource to doing the feasibility studies for how it's to be developed? How it's to permitted in processing and so forth? So, all of these things will take long time -- long term. And that is a key reason of why the outlook for copper as a commodity is so strong. The current projects that are being pursued today are not in aggregate significant to the market but are significant to companies but they're being delayed. So you ask about our situation. The Kucing Liar fits into our long term mine plan for Grasberg and that's something that we're assessing and we'll consider and look at going forward. Lone Star has the opportunity for oxide expansion, which is growing. That could be done with a limited amount of investment in new facilities. But longer term, there's a large sulphide resource, and this will be long term but it is very, very large. And that would require very, very large concentrator expansion. We have great opportunities at El Abra with our partner Codelco in Chile. We have great opportunities in the U.S. at other properties, including Bagdad, Morenci, Sierrita, our properties in New Mexico. And so, all of these things are being studied. We are going to be very-disciplined about it. First steps for cash flow will be using debt, increasing shareholder -- returns to shareholders, and then we will -- we have restrained spending in the project evaluation area, as we have across the board and our country for the current time. As the situation improves, we'll return to investing in the evaluation process. And from that, we'll come to timing schedule that you have. We don't have one right now. But we will keep you informed as this unfolds and we start spending again and getting in the process for evaluation. But, key, positive feature about Freeport is this opportunity to grow our business internally to develop resources which we get no value for currently today in our stock price. If we develop those ourselves, all that value goes to our shareholders as opposed to making an acquisition where substantial value goes to the owners of the asset being acquired. I know that's not a clear answer to your question, but it's a truthful answer to where we are. Lucas, gold, like copper, has its ups and downs and often gold is up when copper is down, copper's up when gold is down. I remember years ago when gold was really high, I decided to change the name to Freeport Gold and Copper. That was before... Well, we have over the years looked at a number of strategic alternatives involving our gold asset. Back in the days, before Phelps Dodge, Freeport was a company that was two-thirds copper, one-third gold, and we really struggled to attract investors because of the different objectives of gold investors and copper objectives. And really, we found the only way we could track investors was paying extraordinarily high dividends. And for those of -- you are all too young to remember that, but that was where we were. We made the commitment to the copper business. The gold component of Grasberg is as I talked about earlier a key reason of why that asset is so fabulously attracted. And so, we're a price taker with gold. We continually review options about dealing with it. But, today we concluded that its greatest value to us is funding the cost of Grasberg. Just think about this having 1.5 billion pounds of copper was no cost or negative cost. And so, that's the role we see it playing in our Company. Kathleen, let me start. So, John, that's a great point. And I mean, you could look back in our history and with the -- in 2008, when the price of copper just cratered from $4 a pound at midyear to approaching $2 a pound by midway in the third, fourth quarter, we did have to make some of those changes. I mean, we parked a hundred trucks at Morenci, right Red? It was something on that order, cut production in half. And that resulted in a multiyear ramp up. So breaking our business apart from exploration, we have essentially terminated all greenfield exploration, which is pretty limited for us anyway, considering our brownfield opportunities. We continue to do work at key operations. That's not going to be a constraint for us going forward. Grasberg, we really have looked at cost hard, made some reductions, but done nothing to slow down the ramp-up of our future. So, we did defer a mill improvement, but which could have some impact, but it was only a short term. Now with prices being where they are, that's not going to be an issue. With the Americas, as I said, we've been very -- so, we're doing this in a way that preserves as much as the future as we can. But, as Kathleen illustrated with Cerro Verde, when you cut back the mill and you cut back mine rates, there is a timing issues in getting the mine rates back up to rates that feeds the mill. So, there will be some impact, but we are so mindful of that that I think we've been very effective in minimizing that impact. In any event, we're going to update this every quarter. And so, we give a lot of details. So, you'll be able to see that as we go forward. Hey, Red? Red, you're on the call, right? Thanks a lot. Yes, I do. In fact, early this morning, I added to my notes that I was going to say that I said earlier actually when we're done with COVID, in many respects [Technical Difficulty] closer to communities and governments. [Technical Difficulty] I recall, going into February, going into March, when we started working remotely, Kathleen and I were looking at each other and saying, okay, now what are we going to do? And by April, we had a plan. Well, that's the situation for all these communities and all these governments, and people are still struggling with that. And so, by our being aggressive in investing in healthcare protocols, testing equipment and doing things to help these communities in Indonesia, I mean, we have two PCR labs. Here in the United States, what does it take often, a week to two weeks to get PCR results? Well, we have two PCR labs, one in Lone and one to the Highlands, which we're working with community use, and that's much appreciated. We had to build an oxygen facility in for Arequipa. So by showing that we are competent in managing these, by showing we have sensitivities to workers' families and the communities by working with governments to do that, we're showing both, competency, sensitivity and the fact that we are committed to being good partners. So, I think all of that's going to be beneficial. We've achieved that in steps. We moved our headquarters to Arizona several years ago. We made a big commitment to show people of Arizona that we could be good partners. And now, we are broadly regarded as being great partners. So, that's an excellent point. And ESG matters are growing in importance and significance to investors. We know that. We believe that's a good trend. And we will measure up well by that, because that's just what our commitment is. So, thank you all for... Thank you, Gina. Thanks all of you joining us. We appreciate your interest, appreciate the good questions. Of course, it is -- a quarter's made a heck a difference, but it is so great now to be focused totally on what we are doing operationally with our business. We look forward to reporting continued progress. As always, if any of you have questions or need some more information, contact David Joint, and we'll be responsive. Good luck to everybody. Take care. This thing is not controlled yet. So, all of you be careful and watch out for your families and friends."

Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan Conference Call, where management will discuss revised operating plans in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and first quarter financial results. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nKathleen Quirk: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan conference call. Earlier this morning, we reported our revised operating plans and our first quarter operating and financial results. A copy of today's press release and the presentation materials are available on our website at fcx.com. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet. And anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today\u2019s call. And a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we\u2019d like to remind everyone that today\u2019s press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. We\u2019d like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the Risk Factors described in our 2019 Form 10-K. On the call today is Richard Adkerson, our Chief Executive Officer; Red Conger is on; Mark Johnson is on from Indonesia, we\u2019ve got a number of other of our senior executives on the phone as well and they will be available to participate in our Q&A session. Our comments today in the prepared materials will be principally focused on our plans and our outlook and how we are addressing current market conditions. I'll briefly summarize our financial results for the first quarter and then turn the call over to Richard who will be reviewing our revised plans. As usual we'll open up the call for Q&A after our prepared remarks. We announced revised operating plans as you've seen in the, in the press release, we've had a series of cost reductions and capital expenditure reductions. We've also reduced our copper production volumes by 400 million pounds in response to market conditions in an effort to reduce our costs and capital expenditures. In terms of our first quarter results, we reported a net loss attributable to common stock of $491 million in the quarter that was $0.34 a share which included $256 million or $0.18 per share associated with inventory valuation adjustments and other items that are detailed in our press release attachment on VI. Adjusted net loss attributable to common stock totaled $235 million or $0.16 per share in the first quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA or earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation for the first quarter totaled $189 million. And we've included a reconciliation of our EBITDA calculation on Page 43 of our slide materials. Our first quarter sales, copper and gold were slightly higher than our January 2020 estimates. We sold 729 million pounds of copper during the quarter and 144,000 ounces of gold that mostly reflected higher production from PT Freeport Indonesia partially offset by lower sales volumes in the Americas. Our average realized price in the first quarter was $2.43 per pound that was 16% lower than a year ago average price of $2.90 per pound and the realized price for gold in the first quarter was just over $1,600 per ounce which was 24% above the first quarter of the prior year. Our consolidated average unit net cash costs were also lower than our expectations. They averaged a $1.90 per pound of copper in the first quarter and the estimate going into the quarter was about $2 per pound. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $600 million. That included roughly $300 million for projects that we're doing to increase production and reduce unit costs in Indonesia and also our Lone Star Project in the U.S. and Arizona. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.6 billion and consolidated debt of $10 billion. We had no borrowings under our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility and have significant liquidity as we manage volatility during 2020. I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard who will be referring to our slide materials.\nRichard Adkerson: So good morning, thank each of you for participating in today's call. I hope you and your families are well and staying safe during this very difficult time for everyone. Our Freeport family extends sympathy and support to all those that are impacted by the virus. And also by the very significant economic hardship that is brought over so many people. We appreciate particularly the global health care providers, government authorities and others who are on the frontlines working often at personal peril to protect our people and all people around the world. At Freeport, we are prioritizing the health and safety of our workers. While we support the communities where we operate, as we serve customers with the ongoing requirements of copper. The copper is an essential metal for the global economy even in today's world. The plan we're announcing today is a comprehensive response by our company following a carefully planned-process-to develop proactive actions, first to save our people and our business and then to protect the value of our assets for the long-term. Very proud of our Freeport team for the response they developed in a very short period during a time when the world faces this unprecedented pandemic crisis. Our team has responded in the right way with the right attitude of commitment and cooperation. Our revised plan will target year end 2020 financial liquidity that at current copper prices actually exceeds the liquidity that we had targeted in our annual plan announced just a quarter ago and that was when copper prices were 20% - more than 20% higher than today\u2019s price. What we had to do with this plan was offset the loss of approximately $1.7 billion of cash flow from lower prices. We've done this by reducing spending, revising mine plans, and taking a series of financial initiatives. Importantly, we have contingency plans to preserve our business if the copper price were to fall further. What this plan will do is carry us over the brighter days for our company. When production volumes increased substantially with the ramp up of our new underground mines in Indonesia, 2021, and as the world economy recovers, whenever that might be. Our Freeport team has done fabulous work by making tough decisions in developing the plan, while we are protecting our workers, treating them fairly, I personally cannot thank our team enough for the work done in developing this plan. We fully recognize the uncertainties we all face about the duration and extent of the pandemic and its impact on the growing economies. Having said that, I'm confident the actions we are taking will allow Freeport to navigate this period of uncertainty and position our company for long-term success. Starting with Slide 3, I emphasize again that health and well-being of our people is number one priority. As we protect our workers, we are addressing the current financial challenge using our experience and successfully responding to past financial crisis. We have an existing playbook that we're following. But we're also taking into account current conditions and uncertainties. We are now undertaking aggressive proactive actions focused on protecting liquidity, by cutting costs, maximizing cash flows. Situation is dynamic and uncertain; we\u2019re prepared to do further adjustments to preserve liquidity and protect long-term values if we have to. Our company benefits in a major way from having extraordinary long lived and durable reserves and resources. I'm confident that the actions we're announcing today and our preparations to respond to further as required will make these assets even more valuable for shareholders in the future. Turning to Slide 4, we have implemented prudent health protocols in all of our locations. We do what we can to avert a spread of coronavirus in our operations. We're monitoring and following all the guidelines of international health organizations and governments. The effort is being led by a dedicated team of medical advisors and providers. Our procedures are robust, forward looking, proactive rather than reactive. Our international medical providers are administering, tracing, quarantine procedures on an ongoing basis. We severely restricted and in most cases, eliminated travel, group meetings have been eliminated, working virtually, and all work that can be done remotely is being done remotely. In our operations, physical distancing in mining processing is being achieved. Ours is not like a factory where people are working totally together. Truck drivers, shovel operators, other operators can work with social distance. At the site we provide housing, meals, transportation. We are being diligent with sanitization isolation of workers showing symptoms and treating workers who have potential illness with state-of-the-art equipment and facilities. Our management of worker health to-date has been very effective. We've experienced a limited less than 50 confirmed cases to-date across our global workforce which approaches 70,000 workers. But knowing just how fast this virus can spread, we remain diligent and proactive in protecting our people. Slide 5 addresses our commitment to communities where we operate. This commitment is longstanding and unwavering. These communities are the homes for our workers and their families. They are essential to our long term success. Across the globe we're supporting communities during this time of great need. We are prioritizing critical needs caused by COVID-19 and we continue to [technical difficulty]. Slide 6 presents the global span of our work force including employees and contractors. While a lot of countries are dealing with the pandemic in varying degrees, our workforce is adhering to global health standards, focusing on their personal safety, and the well-being of those around them. Our global team of workers is critical to our company's success and we fully recognize that. I personally appreciate the dedication, commitment, cooperation during this challenging time. Slide 7 we note that copper is a metal strategic to the world and its importance is growing. Freeport is a long time leading supplier of copper to the global economy. We're working closely with customers to meet their needs in today's world, protecting our business so we can reliably serve customers in the future. Copper is essential to global economy not only in times when the economy is growing but also in times like these when health care, water, food supply, communications and technology are critically important. Telecommunications, digital technologies, and cloud applications have ever been more important than in today's world. And copper is an essential element in meeting these requirements. On Slide 8 I want to note that many of you probably have seen recent reports on the growing recognition of copper's anti-microbial properties. Copper can play a significant role in preventing transmission of viruses and bacteria. This has been known for a long time. Our industry has supported research efforts and education efforts for the public to understand the benefits of copper in fighting the spread of infections in normal times. The current pandemic is bringing to light what copper can achieve in improving public health. Studies have demonstrated that copper can destroy viruses like COVID-19. Copper's use in health care equipment and facilities and in public places will undoubtedly grow significantly when the cost of copper which has been a barrier in the past is measured by the enormous cost to society that is being brought on by this pandemic. Freeport will be at the forefront of leading the world to understand the benefits, the greater uses of copper globally. To learn more about this, I refer you to the Copper Development Association's website and you can read articles about it almost every day in the press. On Slide 9, we talk about just how quickly the market conditions change. [Technical difficulty] seems like a lifetime. When FCX reported its fourth quarter results, the global economy was showing clear signs of progress. The phase one deal with China was encouraging after trade issues had burdened copper prices for the previous 18 months. The copper price was then $2.85 a pound and seem poised to move higher. Now, we have copper prices today about $0.50 per pound lower than in late January. And in recent times, we've seen copper trade down to near $2 a pound, totally unexpected. Meantime, the gold prices have risen dramatically. Gold is a benefit to operations in Indonesia. Oil markets are in turmoil. Diesel fuel roughly 8% of operating cost has declined roughly about 50%, dollar strengthened that lowers our U.S. dollar cost for expenditures in current local currencies. Many other input costs have dropped. The rapid change in markets required us to move quickly and aggressively digest our plans. Freeport's 2020 revenues were already abnormally low because of the transition of Grasberg to underground mining. We completed mining the massive Grasberg high volume open pit in December 2018. Today, PT-FI is effectively managing the coronavirus self-challenge. PT-FI is progressing at own schedule with the ramp up of its massive underground mines. This has been the critical strategic initiative for our company for many years. Continued progress with this ramp up will place Freeport in a much stronger cash flow position even if copper prices stay low in 2021 and beyond. The gold benefit of Grasberg's production is a major benefit as I said, the gold component Grasberg\u2019s production is a major benefit. It\u2019s what together with the good copper grades make this one of the mining industries, most fabulous assets. Of course gold is having its day in the sun, copper's day will come. On Slide 10, we talk about this transition that Grasberg moved to underground mining and with a current ramp up. We've incorporated in our original plans, our budget going into 2020 are prior to the current pandemic, doing the proactive steps to protect our balance sheet and liquidity. Over the past four years, we have cut what was then crippling debt levels in 2016 in half. During 2019, we extended our $3.5 billion bank credit facility currently undrawn for a new five-year term extending to 2024. Kathleen and her team also worked with our banks to obtain amendments to our bank credit revolving covenants, to give us flexibility during the Grasberg ramp-up. In recent months we've had two bond offerings raising a total of $2.5 billion in long-term notes at attractive rates which we used to refinance debt maturities. Today we have no significant near-term debt maturities. Slide 11 now addresses the aggressive actions we're now taking. Our team undertook a comprehensive and iterative process involving site managements across the company. Red Conger and his team in the Americas were facing the challenge this time around of not being supported by cash flows going out of - coming out of Indonesia. Cash we're generating in Indonesia is going into continuing to develop the underground. So what they got to do for each operation each individual mine was to develop a plan to maximize near-term cash flow at low prices while protecting long-term values. All the savings reflected in our new plans that we\u2019re reporting today are supported by detailed analysis. We left no stone unturned. This was not a top down exercise. The objective was set at the top. But our operating teams developed these plans and now own them. They are committed to executing them and our senior management team and our administrative organizations will support them. Everybody is on board. Our Board of Directors has deferred common stock dividends in 2020 prioritizing this. The Board will review dividend actions on a regular basis with the goal of restoring dividends when conditions improve. The chart on the right, summarizes the combined impact of these actions. Based on our January plan at $2.85 copper, we would have ended the year with a consolidated cash position of $1 billion before returning to significant cash flow generation in 2021 with Grasberg's ramp up and beyond. Despite this $0.50 a pound current reduction in copper prices, our revised plan is at $2.30 copper, plans we're announcing today project $1.7 billion in cash at year-end and increase in liquidity without raising new capital. This is a major accomplishment. Three, four weeks ago, we wouldn't have anticipated. We have stress test our plans at lower prices to ensure we have a plan to bridge us through 2020 regardless of prices, and put us in a strong position as we enter 2021 when we will be adding large-scale, low-cost volumes for Grasberg. Significantly, we've reserved a plan to double EBITDA in 2021 from this year's levels without higher copper prices. Slide 12 illustrates the impact of this. Execution of these plans will set us up for significant improvements in 2021, in part from changes in copper prices. Projecting a 26% increase in copper sales, volumes in 2021, 75% increase in gold volumes. The outlook takes into account approximately 400 million pounds of Americas production that we are idling in this plan. And our projections include that remaining idle in 2021, which we're adjusting if conditions improve. Our unit cost projected to decline, 2021 EBITDA would double, 2020 levels at $2.30 copper and $1,600 gold. Cash flow benefit from potential higher gold prices noted as well, many expect, as well as the potential for a return of copper prices to the levels we saw earlier this year. Looking at Slide 13, we note that our management team has had extensive experience in managing tough market environments. The leadership teams across the company are seasoned and have been effective and successful in past downturns. Prices is different, but in each of our past experiences, Freeport has come out stronger. We have a management structure and a team that is collaborative, experienced and decisive. Never cut corners on important issues involving worker safety or environmental obligations. We keep a long-term focus on our license to operate around the world that we worked so hard to earn. We adjust to market conditions quickly, develop contingency plans for further actions as required, do this on a site-by-site basis, a planned safeguard to protect long-term values. This is a real hallmark of this Freeport organization. Highlighted on the slide are actions we took in 2008, 2009 crisis [technical difficulty] 2014 and reached critically low levels in 2015 and 2016 when our company was heavily burdened by debt from our discontinued oil and gas business. Note where share prices were for FCX during each of these crises and the improvement within two years that follow. We're all committed to successful execution of these plans. We're all intensely focused on restoring value in our shares. Now I want to provide you a brief update of our operations and projects. Slide 14 addresses Cerro Verde. As reported previously, the Peruvian government declared a national emergency, which was just extended to May 10. This government order affects Cerro Verde and other mines in Peru. Our Cerro Verde team is doing great work in managing smaller-scale operations during this period while we protect the health of a much reduced workforce and as we work with the government to explain our health protocols so that we can position Cerro Verde for a restore to normal operations. Cerro Verde has been operating in excess of designed capacity for several quarters, chiefly mill throughput of over 400,000 metric tons per day, leading up to March 16. We are currently operating about 1/3 of this level. Our plans are developing and ramping up Cerro Verde late in the second quarter and returning to higher production levels in the second half. Returning Cerro Verde to normal production is important to the government of Peru and the community of Arequipa. Cerro Verde has been a large contributor to the national and local economy, one of the largest employers in the region. Slide 15 covers our new mine that we are developing in Eastern Arizona, adjacent to our Safford mine, very close to Morenci, called Lone Star. And we're nearing completion of this new mine, and we will commence production in the coming months. The project is 90% complete. Capital is largely behind us. We're advancing on schedule with pres-tripping, which we expect to complete in the third quarter. We've started to ramp up placement of ore on newly constructed leach pad at the nearby Safford operation. Project is forecast to add 200 million pounds of copper per year initially, with opportunities to increase production over time with low capital intensity. While we have great expansion opportunities at Lone Star, we are deferring those until the market conditions more. We remain excited about the long-term opportunity for Lone Star. We believe it will be a significant future cornerstone asset for Freeport in the United States. At Grasberg, very pleased to report that our Grasberg underground ramp-up is proceeding on schedule. Great cave propagation for the Grasberg Block Cave and the Deep MLZ mine continue to go well. We have achieved important milestones to establish large-scale production from these high-grade low-cost little blocks. Been consistently meeting or exceeding key performance indicators. I congratulate Mark Johnson & our PTF team for its noteworthy performance in advancing this massive undertaking in such an effective manner. During the first quarter, production from the Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ together averaged over 37,000 tons per day, slightly in excess of our forecast at the beginning of the year, and over 44% higher than prior quarter rates. By the end of the first quarter, we were producing at a combined rate of over 40,000 metric tons per day. Rates will be increasing continually as we go forward. We've added almost 50 new drawbells at the 2 mines during the quarter compared with 34 in the fourth quarter. We now have 250 open drawbells, which are the rock funnels that allow us to gain scale in ore production. These are high-grade, large copper and gold ore bodies. It's noteworthy that the first quarter mill rate throughput was only about half of last year's first quarter yet PT-FI's quarterly metal production was similar to last year's first quarter. This demonstrates that these underground ore bodies can produce scale because of their grades. At full rates, the production of these 2 ore bodies is projected to average over 1.3 billion pounds of copper, 1.3 million ounces of gold per year. In the earlier years, we'll have higher grades, and that will yield higher metal production. Average net unit costs are expected to average less than $0.20 a pound in the first 5 years of full production rates. $0.20 a pound, that's notable and rare for large-scale operations in the global copper industry. Our PT-FI team deserves complements for their extraordinary performance in managing the health situation while continuing to execute on this major project. We have a workforce of about 30,000 people, a large portion of that work in the highlands, where they live in dorms, eat in mess halls. Our team is supported by world-class medical providers. They've been proactive with a series of actions to help us prevent any major outbreak at this remote location. Our testing and screening activities in one of the most remote places in the world are much more advanced than much of what we're seeing today in communities in the United States. Our PT-FI development operating team is supported by FCX's global world-class technical organization. PT-FI in Indonesia is benefiting now [technical difficulty] that was put in place in late 2018, where now we have a 51% shareholder that's a state owned company, named MIND ID and now we have a much more positive relationship with the government of Indonesia after our December 2018 IUPK permit. Unlike years past, now all stakeholder interest in our business in Indonesia are aligned. Slide 17 talks about the smelter that we committed to construct as part of the IUPK. We're facing delays with this project. It's located far from our operations in Papua, in a densely populated area of Eastern Java. We have notified the government of delays because of worker restrictions and supply chain issues, and we're in discussions to extend the December 2023 project deadline. We're also reviewing with the government other issues related to the smelter that might be mutually beneficial to PT-FI and the government. We do not expect to incur capital expenditures of significance in 2020 on the smelter as a result of the delays that we're experiencing. Slide 18 looks at copper markets. Copper prices have dropped from a weaker demand from the declining GDP, of course. On the other hand, supplies of copper have been impacted by the pandemic. Copper mines and development projects are being curtailed or canceled. Scrap market, which provides a large part of refined copper to the market, is currently very weak. We're encouraged by data now coming out of China, indicating an emerging recovery. There is strong likelihood around the world that ongoing stimulus actions will help economies recover. Despite the long - the near-term uncertainties, we're not trying to base our business on ours or anybody else's ability to predict these near-term situations. The long-term copper outlook for copper remains highly positive, and in some ways, being supported by the supply curtailments we're now seeing. Copper is strongly supported by fundamentals, has an essential role in the overall global economy, the major element in efforts to reduce carbon in the world, and the world is increasingly turning to electronics in so many respects, extended from electric vehicles, charging stations, but also 5G and other technical factors are going to require more electronics in the world. Supplies of copper continue to be limited. No one can predict with confidence when economies will recover. Copper is a highly attractive commodity to move - and is positioned to move substantially higher as economic conditions improve. Freeport will be a major beneficiary of this movement. I've included Slide 19 as an infographic, developed by the Copper Development Associations, what I thought does a great job of illustrating broad ranges of uses of copper in the economy. I'll just refer it to you and ask you to take a look at it when you have a moment to consider it. Slide 20 will present our reserve and resource position. We have long-lived and valuable resources that will be available for all organic growth development for decades to come. Volumes we've elected to curtail the current market will be more valuable in the future as economic conditions improve. Before turning to Kathleen, who will review the financial outlook in more detail, I want to close with the following. Freeport is foremost in copper. Looking beyond the current troubled conditions, copper is widely considered the best-positioned major commodity for our supply - from a supply demand standpoint. Freeport's portfolio of copper assets are large and high quality. We're an established industry leader, we operate the mines that we have interest in, which are among the largest in the world. And by operating all of our assets, it provides us valuable synergies and flexibility across the portfolio to deal with times like these and to take advantages of the brighter days to come. Our assets are long-lived, durable, with embedded option for reserve and resource growth. Strong franchises in the United States, South America and Indonesia. Near term, Freeport is in advanced stage for a major increase in margin and cash flows beginning in 2021, apart from copper price movements and extended for 20 years and further. We have industry-leading technical capabilities through strong track record of execution over many years. We've earned the trust and respect of our partners, our customers, our suppliers, financial markets, most importantly, our workers, communities and those countries where we operate. Our block caving experience is one of the most extensive and longest-standing in the history of the global mining industry. We've been operating block caves in Indonesia since the early 1980s, and we have an important aluminum of block cave operation in Colorado. This is a critically important factor as we transition Grasberg to the largest block caving operation in the world. Our experienced and battle testing management team has demonstrated the capabilities to perform in good times and bad. We are confident of our ability to \"improve our metal\" as we've done in the past. Slide 22, I want to close by talking about our people. Again, I want to recognize the strength and resiliency of the entire Freeport family who inspire me every day. I'm proud to be part of this team. We're all motivated and committed to persevere and achieve success for all of our stakeholders. Kathleen, I'll let you take over.\nKathleen Quirk: Okay, thank you, Richard. I'll turn to Slide 24 and run through some of the details of our operating plans and financial outlook before we begin the Q&A session. On 24, we present a summary of our revised operating plans. As Richard was saying earlier, as we develop the new plans, we focus on reducing operating costs and capital expenditures while maintaining safety, reliability and the integrity of the long-range plans. In the Americas, we reduced mining rates across the board by about 20% in total. What this did, it had the impact of reducing all elements of our operating costs and the capital that higher mining rates would require. We note that this material is still there and available to us in the future as market conditions warrant. At our molybdenum mine in Colorado, the Climax mine, we're going to reduce the mining rate there by about 50% to better match our supply and - the supply and current market conditions. In the Americas, we've reduced capital by $500 million and that included the capital associated with our innovation initiatives that we previously estimated at $150 million of capital in 2020 that would add production as we go forward. We have suspended that project, but we're still using the data analytics tools and the agile way of working to drive cost performance and other things like recoveries and initiatives that do not require significant capital. We believe these tools will be very useful to us. As we drive efficiency. We'll use them rather than driving higher production levels, we'll use them to manage costs and improve our recoveries in our Americas mines. In Indonesia, our mine plans are basically the same as our prior plans. We incorporated updated market rates for energy and the favorable impacts of the stronger dollar on our foreign-denominated labor costs. We also tightened our belt to reduce spending in a number of areas throughout the operation. Now have combined these savings, reduced costs in Indonesia by about 10% for 2020. We also benefit from a higher gold price, which our prior plan was based on $1,500 gold, and we've adjusted this plan to $1,600 gold. And as you know, gold is currently over $1,700 per ounce today. Our capital spending in Indonesia was reduced by over $200 million in 2020. About half of this is the timing of installation of planned mill upgrades, which we deferred by a year as a result of the pandemic and current constraints on international contractors. We've also reduced spending forecasts associated with the proposed smelter in Indonesia that Richard referred to earlier as a result of project delays and the current discussions with the Indonesian government. Looking at Slide 25, and this is also in our press release. It's a financial summary of the revised plan for 2020 compared to the January plan that we prepared in conjunction with our earnings call in late January. Because of the sequencing of our mine plans during the year, we expected the first quarter to be the weakest of the year. We also expect, under the current plan, for capital expenditures to exceed our operating cash flows in the second quarter. But as you can see here on the slide, we expect our operating cash flows for the full 9-month period in the balance of this year to exceed capital expenditures by $400 million. And that's a $200 million improvement in cash flows for the full year compared to our previous plan despite a $0.50 decline in assumed average copper prices. In addition to the cost and capital reductions, our plan reflects a number of cash flow benefits associated with reductions in materials and supplies inventories, an acceleration of tax refunds and a series of other items to improve our cash flow. Importantly, we boosted liquidity during the year compared to our prior plans, and our net debt is lower. Richard mentioned, we've gone through a process of stress testing these plans at various prices and believe we have a plan that will bridge us through 2020 and put us in a strong position as we enter 2021 with the addition of large scale, low-cost volumes from Grasberg. Turning to Slide 26. We show our sales outlook for 2020 through 2022. As you'll note in this slide, the sales volumes are about 400 million pounds per annum, lower than our previous estimates. This reflects the curtailments that we're making in the Americas, reducing our mining rates. And it also includes a small change in 2022 associated with the deferral of the upgrade of the mill project, which has a slight impact on our mine plan for the ramp-up of the Deep MLZ. You see the gold sales are similar to our prior levels. There's a small change in 2022 related to the timing of the mill upgrade. Molybdenum sales are down about 10% from our prior estimates, and that reflects the change at the Climax mine and also the reduction in byproduct moly resulting from mine plan changes in our Americas copper mines. On Slide 27, we present a summary by region of our unit net cash costs. We separated the first quarter from the rest of the year so you can see the impacts of our actions. Net unit cash costs on a consolidated basis in the first quarter were $1.90 per pound. This was better than our plan, which projected about just over $2 in the first quarter. And our first quarter was expected in the original plan to be our highest in the year. But as you'll see, what we've done with our cost structure in the balance of the year is driving a significant decline in net unit cash costs compared with the first quarter. Cash costs in the 9-month average would be $1.44 per pound. That is $0.46 a pound or 24% below the first quarter average. We expect to average for the year, $1.55, taking into account the first quarter results and move to a unit cost level of about $1.20 per pound in 2021. We show at the bottom of the page, the makeup of our cost by region. You can see energy on these pie charts, which includes diesel and electrical power. And that represents, combined, the diesel and other sources of energy, 17% of our consolidated costs. Diesel represents about 8% and our diesel prices have declined more than 50% since the start of 2020. Moving to Slide 28, and you've seen us present EBITDA and operating cash flow in this format over many quarters. But it's designed to show at various prices what our EBITDA and cash flow generating capacity is using the average volumes and costs for 2021 and 2022. We hold gold flat in this scenario at $1,600 per ounce and molybdenum at $9 per pound and vary the copper prices for 2021 and 2022 between $2.50 and $3. And you can see here, we would generate a $2.50 copper, over $5 billion in EBITDA and over $3 billion of operating cash flow. And as prices move, we could generate over $7 billion at $3 copper and over $4.5 billion of operating cash flows. We present sensitivities on the right side of the chart, so you can make your own adjustments as to different copper market or gold market outlooks. We expect, as Richard was talking about, to manage our situation from a financial standpoint in 2020. Before getting into 2021, we will generate - we expect to generate very significant increases in cash margins and cash flow. We've cut spending. I'm now on Slide 29. So these cash flows that we generate will be available to fund CapEx and also have excess cash flows for other initiatives, including debt reductions and other initiatives that we have. We cut CapEx from $2.8 billion to $2 billion, and we show the details of where that came from. For 2021, we're currently estimating $2.3 billion in capital expenditures. That's about $100 million lower than our prior estimate. The focus of our plans to date, our revised plans to date, have been mainly on capital expenditures in 2020. We're continuing to review 2021. And we're reviewing those for potential additional reductions depending on market conditions, which we'll be evaluating in the coming months. Our plans, appropriately cut spending and capital and again, preserving the strong outlook that we have over the next several years. I'll just close on our financial policy that we covered throughout the call. We remain focused on safeguarding our people and our business, and maintaining strong liquidity and balance sheet strength as we manage uncertainty during the pandemic and the economics - associated economic impacts. Under current market conditions and priorities, our Board does not expect to declare dividends in 2020. This will be evaluated on a regular basis. And as we successfully execute our plans and enter 2021, we expect to be in a much stronger position with increased cash flow, enhanced flexibility to consider shareholder returns. Thanks for your attention today. And operator, we'd now like to open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alex Hacking with Citi.\nAlex Hacking: Good morning Richard and Kathleen, and hope you guys are staying safe and doing well. let me ask a couple of questions on Grasberg, if that's okay. The first question would be, how are the supply chains holding up there? Are you able to get access to the consumables and other things that you need? Or are you having to run down stockpiles? And then I guess, secondly, on Grasberg. Congratulations on all the steps that you're taking there to keep everyone safe. But in a worst-case scenario where there is a significant outbreak, what is the contingency plan? I mean, it's obviously very difficult to kind of safely halt underground mining there. So maybe you could discuss a little bit what the contingency would be in a worst-case scenario. Thank you very much.\nRichard Adkerson: Okay. Thank you for your question. Mark Johnson, would you comment? Mark is actually in Papua now at Grasberg. Can you comment on the supply chain issues and how we're dealing with it?\nMark Johnson: Yes. To date, we haven't had any problems. Nothing's been interrupted. We're - we always have to maintain a supply up in the highlands. But no issues on - obviously, we have a large community up here. That's one of our concerns, but no problem. Like some of the places in the states, we haven't had a run on any of our grocery stores, our medical supplies, all those key things, plus all the things that we're doing for production and for our development, we haven't had any issues. On the contingency plans. One of the things that we've looked at in a worst-case scenario, as you mentioned, is the mines that we'd be - need to have some consideration. At Big Gossan, we could shut off and turn on if we needed to. It's a stope mine. But we've got - we work with our consultants and we understand what sort of minimum draw rates we would need in our block caves to keep them going. We could drop our personnel dramatically and to just do that minimum draw. For instance, in the Deep MLZ, right now, we run 8 loaders, about the same in the GBC. That's our core production. So the core production is a relatively small amount of people and equipment. A lot of our effort is in the continued expansion, the construction to achieve those out years that we've got. So it's an ongoing process. Our contingency plan in the worst-case scenario would be to minimize those activities and focus on the production activities.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets.\nDavid Gagliano: Hi, thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the comprehensive update, the quick actions, the cost improvements, the cash savings, everything that you highlighted today. Clearly, you've been through this before. My question is regarding the out years. It looks to me, on my side, like a 2021 and 2022 reductions in copper volumes are mainly tied to the AI initiative CapEx cut, at least for North America. So my question, just to verify, do the '21 and 2022 copper volume targets assume that the North American operations are back up and running at normal rates? Or does it assume they continue to operate at the roughly 20% lower rate? And under what underlying market conditions do you plan to ramp those operations back up to normal again?\nKathleen Quirk: Dave, it's Kathleen. Our mining rates that we have put in here, the 20% reduction in 2020, continues into part of 2021. We have some mines that are starting to ramp up, but we still have idled production during that period of time. So when we were pursuing in our previous plans, the initiatives, we were calling America's concentrator where we were increasing both mining rates and milling rates. We're not doing that at this point. So we could, if market conditions were to improve dramatically, and we'd have to take a long, hard look at that because, as you know, this is not a light switch that can go on and off. But we could start bringing back production and - over time and increase our mining and milling rates again. So this assumes that we remain in a curtailed mode at most of the - really all the operations through the first part of next year. And then some of the operations are increasing mining rates and others aren't. So it's a mixed bag, but we could. There's nothing about our prior plans that would stop us from increasing production. It may delay but because of the mining rate change this year, it may delay the timing to get to those volumes. But as we talked about, the volumes are still there and could be added over time if market conditions warrant.\nDavid Gagliano: Okay. And just as a related follow-up, just can you give us a sense as to when you say if market conditions warrant, is there - what's the market condition that would warrant a full...\nKathleen Quirk: Well, our prior plan at the beginning of the year was based on the context of a copper market of $2.75 to $3. And as Richard was saying, the things - the ground work was in place for potentially higher prices as we go forward. So I think you'd have to see prices move back to those levels and have more economic certainty around the economy. But we're going to be very disciplined about executing these plans, really focused on costs, really focused on capital in the near term to make sure that we can preserve our financial position during 2020. And then as we get into 2021, we can start looking beyond at what the market conditions are and whether we restore full mining operations at that point.\nRichard Adkerson: And Dave, realistically, this situation is not likely to turn on at one point. Different countries are going to be in different situations. And things will occur step-by-step, and there will be uncertainties along the way. So it would be fair to say that given our overriding objective of protecting the long-term values of our assets, we will be very measured on how we respond.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank.\nChris Terry: I just had a follow-on to David's question just now. So Slide 26, just on the production. Understand North America, I think that was probably reasonably we were flagged that there might be adjustments there. But in terms of South America, appreciate Cerro Verde is offline currently. The 2021, 2022 impact of South America, can you just talk through that? I know you have a little bit of leaching on Cerro Verde. Is that the carryover effect of less mining into 2021? Or is that - what exactly is happening there? I'm just trying to think about how you could maybe increase that if, again, maybe back to copper conditions, but just trying to understand the mechanics of 2021 in particular.\nKathleen Quirk: Yes. Well, we've also reduced production at El Abra. We deferred a significant capital item there. And so we're reducing our mining rate at El Abra, and that's also contributing to the lower production in South America. But we do show - under our plans, we do show Cerro Verde production increasing in 2021 from the 2020 levels. But our El Abra mine is about flat like it was in 2020 when you compare it. So that's a significant reduction from our prior plans.\nChris Terry: Okay. Okay. That's helpful. Just one more, if I may. I just wanted to follow up on the comments on the smelter. So the concept is still the kind of $3.5 billion level, but you just pushed back 2020, but you're still working out exactly negotiations on that. Is that the right way to think about it? Thanks.\nKathleen Quirk: Richard, do you want me to take that one?\nRichard Adkerson: Well, let me ask you to repeat the question. Unfortunately, I had a little static in my line here.\nChris Terry: Sure. No, I just wanted to just be - a little bit more detail on the smelter in terms of the concept. I think what you're saying is it's still kind of the $3.5 billion. You're just going to push out 2020, and you're in the process of renegotiating it. I just wanted to understand that, that was correct.\nRichard Adkerson: So I wouldn't characterize it as a renegotiation. We reluctantly decided that we would have to commit to build the smelter in order to get a resolution of the long-standing issues we've had with the government of Indonesia about extending our operating rights. And that was one key concession that we made along with facilitating the government through a state-owned company, acquiring 51% of the shares. That, as you know, was achieved principally by Rio Tinto deciding to sell their joint venture interest to the government. Of course, in return, we got clear-cut operating rights, fixed fiscal and financial terms to 2041 and established a positive new working relationship with the government. So we've made that commitment to the government, and we're executing on that commitment. The facts are we can't proceed as we have planned because of the worker restrictions at Gresik where the smelter relocated and supply chain issues with contractors and the like. In the meantime, the government in Indonesia, like governments around the world, are struggling with state revenues because of lower economic activity and investments. So we are engaging with the government as to whether this new circumstance might provide a way that would be mutually advantageous for the government, for our MIND ID, through PT-FI to reconsider what we're doing with the smelter. But throughout all this, we are being clear-cut that we made this commitment to the government. And unless the government agrees to some changes, which the current circumstances might lead them to consider, we are proceeding with fulfilling our commitment to build a smelter.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley.\nCarlos De Alba: Hopefully, everyone has been fine. So my question is first on working capital. The company generated cash flow from working capital reduction or lower levels of working capital in Q1. How do you see that going forward during the remainder of the year? And the second question, if I may, is regarding the positive surprise for the second quarter in a row in terms of gold production or shipments out of Indonesia. Can you maybe provide a little bit more color as to what is going on there? And if there is - this is something that maybe you have room to continue to surprise to the outside? Thank you.\nKathleen Quirk: Okay. With respect to the working capital question, we are projecting a large working capital source in 2020. As we mentioned, that is one of our initiatives here, to release cash from the balance sheet through the materials. As we curtail mining operations, we'll have the ability to use existing inventories as opposed to having to buy new consumables to a certain degree. So we'll have a reduction in materials and supplies. We're also bringing forward some tax refunds that were projected over the next several years, and we're bringing those forward into 2020. And there are a number of other cash flow initiatives that we have developed over the last several weeks in the context of our revised plans. And so we are showing a large source of working capital throughout the year.\nCarlos De Alba: Kathleen, if I may. So this will continue in Q2, Q3, above and beyond what we saw already in Q1 then?\nKathleen Quirk: Right. Yes.\nRichard Adkerson: Let me just add that, again, complementing people. Kathleen and her team has done a great job with financing. Steve Higgins, who heads up our administrative team is doing an excellent job in managing worker issues and HR and other matters. Danny Hughes, who heads up our global supply team, is doing a fabulous job. And we have tremendously positive relationships with our suppliers. We are often one of their largest customers, in many cases, the largest customer. And so as we face this problem, we sit down with our suppliers, and we're able to find ways to reduce costs, deal with payment terms and the like. Same way with our customers. We all understand each other's problems. We worked together many years. Some of this you're seeing is a result of all those long-term relationships, but also how diligent our whole team is being in finding ways, I said we left no stone unturned, in finding ways to generate cash, and we're going to continue to do that on an ongoing basis.\nKathleen Quirk: In terms of the question on the gold. We did experience some higher grades and - of gold, and that will - we still are projecting that our grades are consistent with our plans. And you'll have pluses and minuses with how the grades are measuring against the plans. We did have some higher grades. And Mark, I don't know if you want to comment any further about gold grades and recoveries as we go forward.\nRichard Adkerson: Yes. I was going to add that, Kathleen, before Mark talked. Mark, I've been noting just how strong our recoveries have been and recoveries have been above plan in many respects. So maybe you could talk about that.\nMark Johnson: Yes. In the first quarter, what we - the significant difference that we saw in grades in both copper and gold was in the Deep MLZ. We were essentially on or just above target as far as the tonnes. But for both the copper and gold grades, we were about 18% above plan. What's driving that is really, we're mining the Deep MLZ for the cave management. We've talked about the seismicity. And so we're very cognizant of how we pull the cave and it's - our intent is to draw it in a very even fashion, and we've got a great system now where we can track every single bucket, and we know exactly where each bucket of material came from. Just happened in the first quarter to manage the cave on a daily basis, the grades came out. Like Kathleen said, it was an advancement. It's not a change in our model. We just happen to be able to pull - by following the cave plan, we ended up with better grades. And those grades are quite good on both - the copper grade for Deep MLZ was at 1.9% copper and 1.9 gram per tonne gold. And the plan for both those were right in the 1.6 range. So that was a welcome surprise. Recoveries have been quite good. As Richard said, we've been - particularly, on copper, we were over 92% copper recovery. Obviously, these - our experience has been over the life of mining the Grasberg and the other ore bodies here, the better the grade, the better the recoveries, and that's been tracking well. As we mine these very high grades at Gras, at Deep MLZ and the grades at GBC are also very respectable and very high-grade deposit at Big Gossan. So we track well on that, and then we've been right in the 80% recovery range for the gold, which is very close to our expectations.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Chris LaFemina with Jefferies.\nChris LaFemina: Hi, Richard and Kathleen, thank you for taking my question. It's good to see the improvements in your balance sheet and liquidity over the last few years. Very different from what you looked like in 2015. And also good to see the operational flexibility. It looks like you are actually generating positive free cash flow at current spot prices, which is encouraging. My question relates to how some of the operational changes that you're making today might affect the long-term performance of your assets. I recall back in 2008, some mining companies revised their mine plans. They reduced their CapEx in response to low prices, which helped in the short term, but those changes led to an extended period of higher cost and higher sustaining CapEx. And I'm wondering if that's something that is likely to happen at Freeport? Or is it just that you are taking these short-term measures without necessarily jeopardizing the longer-term structural integrity of your assets?\nRichard Adkerson: Well, thanks, Chris. The word jeopardizing is not one that would be - that would apply here. But the effects of not spending some of this money now will carry over to future production levels because certain of the capital costs that we're deferring will have to be recovered in the future, and it will push out some production. But this will not, in any significant way, jeopardize the value, the resources because the resources are still there but it could - it will result in some delays of when that production occurs. You see that at Grasberg, where we are delaying spending on incremental crushing capacity at the mill for the time being, and that will have an impact. What we'll do is update you each quarter as we go through this and get better views of it. But again, it's not a question of destroying resources but there will be some impact on future timing. Let me ask Red. Red, do you have a comment on this?\nRed Conger: Yes. Richard, you're absolutely correct. And just one specific example would be El Abra that Kathleen mentioned earlier that we're slowing down the production right there in order to push out capital expenditures and a new leach pad that's required for future production. So when things look up, we'll make that investment and be able to increase the volumes there if markets warrant.\nChris LaFemina: As a follow-up, sorry.\nKathleen Quirk: The other thing I would just add, Red's team is very strong with all of the operations that during this downturn, we're not going to compromise safety. We're not going to be cannibalizing equipment. We're going to keep the equipment that we are using in good condition. It's just that we're not using all of our equipment. So we're postponing what we need to do in terms of rebuilding and things to meet a higher mining plan. But we're not doing things that don't - we aren't doing things that would destroy asset value, and Red keeps preaching that to the team. So I just wanted to add that.\nChris LaFemina: As a follow-up, it will be, I suppose, interesting to see whether companies that don't have liquidity, don't have positive cash flow and are taking actions to kind of protect their balance sheet. We'll have to do things that will lead to less production for an extended period of time. In other words, the question really is, well, do you think this leads ultimately, this downturn leads to an extended period of less than expected global copper production as a result of initiatives that companies are taking today to protect themselves? In which case, we can have higher prices in an upturn than we would have had otherwise?\nRichard Adkerson: No question about that. I think the feature that was most supportive of copper prices is the supply situation in copper. Supply was going to be tested in any event before all this happened. And now, with development projects being delayed, curtailments occurring, which is we just spoke about, has some impact. And as you say, Chris, we know what it's like to be a company where you don't have flexibility with liquidity. That's where we were in 2016. And as a result, we had to sell assets beyond copper, but also some copper assets. So this is - depending on severity and the link of this lasting, there's going to be a longer run impact on copper supplies, and that will ultimately be supporting the prices.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Oscar Cabrera with CIBC.\nOscar Cabrera: Thank you, operator and good morning everyone. Richard, I just wanted to explore a little bit more the cost reduction that your team did. And by the way, congratulations to the team on a quick turnaround. Something that took less than - in a few weeks, whereas a lot of the mining companies are not providing this level of detail. So your site production and delivery costs with your original plan was about $2.04 a pound. This was now reduced to $1.80. I was wondering if you could provide us with an estimate of how much lower can this go. And you talked about diesel costs being lower as well as getting help from a - depreciating exchanges around the world. So I was wondering if you could provide just a ballpark estimate of what percentage of that accounted for the reduction.\nKathleen Quirk: Oscar, this is Kathleen. So it was a combination of many things. But in the Americas, we removed production. So that flows through all the costs, all the mining and labor costs. And so that had an effect on removing all of the cost of production associated with those pounds. We also benefited from lower energy costs, which was about $0.07 a pound compared to our prior forecast. Energy costs are lower than when we prepared this forecast. They're down probably another 15%, 20% from the time we prepared this forecast. But from a long-term perspective, we're using about $1 per gallon of diesel in these forecasts. And that had about a $0.07 impact on the Americas cost. Of course, in the U.S., our currencies, it's all a U.S. dollar business. Where we really saw the benefit of the currency impact was in Indonesia. And as I mentioned, that reduced our cost by - the absolute cost of energy plus the currency benefits by about 10% in Indonesia. And the big driver in Indonesia, though, is the volume aspect, and that's really what's going to drive our cash costs lower. But as you've seen, we reduced our - we were previously estimating over the next 5 years, about $0.30 a pound for production costs in Indonesia, and we're now using roughly $0.20 a pound for those costs, and that reflects some savings in the cost structure that we've been driving over many months, not just because of the COVID and the economic situation. But as we transitioned out of Grasberg into the underground, we've been - Mark and his team have been leading a zero-based budgeting process to bring overall costs down in Indonesia.\nOscar Cabrera: But I mean, year-end 2020, if need be, could cost be reduced further, i.e., there - are there other sources you could use like cutting more production to lower the $1.80 that you're showing now?\nKathleen Quirk: I think what we're doing really is looking at what's cash flow positive. And so we look down at cutting production further. At $2 copper, that may not make sense. But we'll iterate on that some more as we go forward. But if you really look into our second half cash costs at $2 copper, our Americas business is generating cash flow. And so prices would have to decline substantially for us to take it down further. But you noted how quickly we moved here, and we're continuing to evaluate, to be flexible to have a flexible operating structure regardless of prices.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research.\nJohn Tumazos: Thank you very much for taking my question and for your service to the company. Concerning the exciting antimicrobial properties of copper, for weaving into linens and masks and things, I guess that would use wire rod and wire products consistent with infrastructure. But for countertops, tables, chairs, restaurant, public applications, it would need sheet. And there's a very limited amount of foil or strip and electronics and a very limited architectural roofing applications. Would you be willing to contribute capital for a sheet rolling mill or a JV with other copper producers or fabricators or apply for stimulus money, which the government might grant to get the supply going? It could be a multimillion tonne market.\nRichard Adkerson: John, we've lost part of your question. I think I understand your question.\nJohn Tumazos: Do you want to build a hot strip mill for copper sheet?\nRichard Adkerson: I think the more likely thing - the way forward with that is for our company, and hopefully, I feel confident, other companies will join us, is to provide the technical basis for these things and then to work with entrepreneurs, venture capital firms and so forth to develop these new industries. We tried this in the past and we ran into barriers because of the cost of refitting and so forth. Now the world has changed and people are seeing this. And this flood of articles is coming out, telling the truth about copper. So we think that will create a market, and we will be working with the industry as a company to help promote this going forward. I think there would be some likelihood for government support of entrepreneurial-type companies. Going forward, our primary focus is going to continue to be in developing and operating mines. But we will - we've already begun talking and developing a team to see how we might help lead this movement to doing something that - positive for copper markets, of course, but more importantly, would be positive for the world because these impacts of health protection are real. And we just see how much they are needed in today's world. And even before that, the number of infections that people get going to hospitals for surgeries and things like knee replacements that occur because of infections from hospitals is staggering. So this is just bringing to light a contribution that copper as a metal can make the world. And we are going to be a leader in demonstrating that.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Lucas Pipes with B. Riley FBR.\nLucas Pipes: Good morning, everyone, and congratulations on a very impressive response to this - especially under these very difficult circumstances. I wanted to follow up to Chris' question earlier on trade-offs between today's cuts and future production. Is there a way to maybe quantify in a little bit more detail what the impact to production could look like for the Americas, call it, starting around 2023?\nRichard Adkerson: Well, it's just too early to do that. I mean, we're in a period of uncertainty right now. Our focus has been on bridging from the loss of cash flows from the lower copper price to ensure that we could bridge our company to the higher volumes from Grasberg. And so that's what we're doing with this plan. We're going to focus on executing this plan. For any of us to sit here today and be able to predict where the world is going to be any period of time even in the short run, there's huge uncertainties. And beyond that, there are as well. So we're just not in a position right now to say what we're going to do. But I think what you can get comfort in is that we have the flexibility of addressing to whatever the world has. We have a track record of doing that. You can look and see what we did beginning in 2010, 2011, what we did in 2016, '17 and see how we did it, and that's what we're going to keep working on. So this is an unfolding story, work in process. But as a company, we have a lot of flexibility in dealing with whatever comes down the road, positive or negative.\nKathleen Quirk: And right now, our plans show pretty flat going out to that point over the next 5 years for Americas. But as Richard said, it's going to be dynamic as we assess the situation going forward.\nLucas Pipes: Yes. I understand. I appreciate the color. And again, I think you've done a really great job responding to this unanticipatable environment here. Second question, just in terms of your relative cost position and the industry response. Obviously, there's been a lot of supply being taken offline to safety concerns and precautions. Do you anticipate - first, what's kind of - what's your relative cost position today? And then do you anticipate a broader supply response from the copper miners due to the decline in prices? Thank you.\nRichard Adkerson: Well, we have mines that range in cost structures from the lowest end of the industry to mines that are relatively high cost because of the nature of the portfolio we put together years ago when we combined Grasberg with Phelps Dodge portfolio of assets. And by having these assets together is what enables us to reduce mines that are relatively low margin during good times and generate profits and extend resources with having the ability to scale back production when prices are low. And that was the huge issue that Phelps Dodge faced years ago, and the strategic benefit we achieved by putting these sets of assets together. So we can calculate an average as a company and compare that average with other companies. But when we manage the business, the management is focused on site-by-site. And so what you're seeing here today is a layering of actions to reduce high cost production, drive our costs down. And even within areas of mines like Morenci, there are elements of production within that large mine that get adjusted and others do not. So there's no - the average is calculated, but the management is managed site-by-site.\nKathleen Quirk: I think the other thing to add here is we benefit from having very long life reserves. And when you're looking at - aside from the Grasberg reinvestment - investment program we're making right now, once we get into production at Grasberg, CapEx will decline. You'll be generating a lot of free cash flow. But also in the Americas, we have a very long life reserve base and additional resources. So when you look at the cash cost plus the CapEx, and you think about, we're not having to spend a lot of CapEx to replace reserves because we've got such a long reserve profile. And we don't have the reinvestment risk that some other short life mines might have. So when we look at this and when we went through this plan with Red and the Americas team, we were really looking at what is the cash cost less the capital that comes with it? And sometimes, when you're trying to build production and grow, you've got a lot of capital that comes with that. And so right now, we're operating on the plan to have as lower cash costs but also what is the lowest cash cost plus capital expenditures that makes sense for us right now. And that's really the plan we're focused on.\nOperator: Now we will turn the call over to management for any closing remarks.\nRichard Adkerson: Well, it's been a long call. I appreciate your attention. I think the length of this call is warranted because of the uncertainties we face, and we wanted to make sure that we did our best to try to explain to you what we're doing with the company. As you can tell, we're more than pleased with where we are in a very difficult and uncertain situation. Our guard is up. We're not going to let down at all because none of us are quite sure what else we might have to deal with. And so thank you for your attention. If you have follow-up questions, or comments, please get in touch with David Joint, and we'll respond to them. I hope all of you stay healthy and your families and friends can do so as well. It's time to be reflective about what this situation is doing to so many people around the world, and our hearts and prayers go out to everyone. Thank you a lot.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kathleen Quirk",
            "content": "Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan conference call. Earlier this morning, we reported our revised operating plans and our first quarter operating and financial results. A copy of today's press release and the presentation materials are available on our website at fcx.com. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet. And anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call. And a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the Risk Factors described in our 2019 Form 10-K. On the call today is Richard Adkerson, our Chief Executive Officer; Red Conger is on; Mark Johnson is on from Indonesia, we've got a number of other of our senior executives on the phone as well and they will be available to participate in our Q&A session. Our comments today in the prepared materials will be principally focused on our plans and our outlook and how we are addressing current market conditions. I'll briefly summarize our financial results for the first quarter and then turn the call over to Richard who will be reviewing our revised plans. As usual we'll open up the call for Q&A after our prepared remarks. We announced revised operating plans as you've seen in the, in the press release, we've had a series of cost reductions and capital expenditure reductions. We've also reduced our copper production volumes by 400 million pounds in response to market conditions in an effort to reduce our costs and capital expenditures. In terms of our first quarter results, we reported a net loss attributable to common stock of $491 million in the quarter that was $0.34 a share which included $256 million or $0.18 per share associated with inventory valuation adjustments and other items that are detailed in our press release attachment on VI. Adjusted net loss attributable to common stock totaled $235 million or $0.16 per share in the first quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA or earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation for the first quarter totaled $189 million. And we've included a reconciliation of our EBITDA calculation on Page 43 of our slide materials. Our first quarter sales, copper and gold were slightly higher than our January 2020 estimates. We sold 729 million pounds of copper during the quarter and 144,000 ounces of gold that mostly reflected higher production from PT Freeport Indonesia partially offset by lower sales volumes in the Americas. Our average realized price in the first quarter was $2.43 per pound that was 16% lower than a year ago average price of $2.90 per pound and the realized price for gold in the first quarter was just over $1,600 per ounce which was 24% above the first quarter of the prior year. Our consolidated average unit net cash costs were also lower than our expectations. They averaged a $1.90 per pound of copper in the first quarter and the estimate going into the quarter was about $2 per pound. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $600 million. That included roughly $300 million for projects that we're doing to increase production and reduce unit costs in Indonesia and also our Lone Star Project in the U.S. and Arizona. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.6 billion and consolidated debt of $10 billion. We had no borrowings under our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility and have significant liquidity as we manage volatility during 2020. I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard who will be referring to our slide materials. Okay, thank you, Richard. I'll turn to Slide 24 and run through some of the details of our operating plans and financial outlook before we begin the Q&A session. On 24, we present a summary of our revised operating plans. As Richard was saying earlier, as we develop the new plans, we focus on reducing operating costs and capital expenditures while maintaining safety, reliability and the integrity of the long-range plans. In the Americas, we reduced mining rates across the board by about 20% in total. What this did, it had the impact of reducing all elements of our operating costs and the capital that higher mining rates would require. We note that this material is still there and available to us in the future as market conditions warrant. At our molybdenum mine in Colorado, the Climax mine, we're going to reduce the mining rate there by about 50% to better match our supply and - the supply and current market conditions. In the Americas, we've reduced capital by $500 million and that included the capital associated with our innovation initiatives that we previously estimated at $150 million of capital in 2020 that would add production as we go forward. We have suspended that project, but we're still using the data analytics tools and the agile way of working to drive cost performance and other things like recoveries and initiatives that do not require significant capital. We believe these tools will be very useful to us. As we drive efficiency. We'll use them rather than driving higher production levels, we'll use them to manage costs and improve our recoveries in our Americas mines. In Indonesia, our mine plans are basically the same as our prior plans. We incorporated updated market rates for energy and the favorable impacts of the stronger dollar on our foreign-denominated labor costs. We also tightened our belt to reduce spending in a number of areas throughout the operation. Now have combined these savings, reduced costs in Indonesia by about 10% for 2020. We also benefit from a higher gold price, which our prior plan was based on $1,500 gold, and we've adjusted this plan to $1,600 gold. And as you know, gold is currently over $1,700 per ounce today. Our capital spending in Indonesia was reduced by over $200 million in 2020. About half of this is the timing of installation of planned mill upgrades, which we deferred by a year as a result of the pandemic and current constraints on international contractors. We've also reduced spending forecasts associated with the proposed smelter in Indonesia that Richard referred to earlier as a result of project delays and the current discussions with the Indonesian government. Looking at Slide 25, and this is also in our press release. It's a financial summary of the revised plan for 2020 compared to the January plan that we prepared in conjunction with our earnings call in late January. Because of the sequencing of our mine plans during the year, we expected the first quarter to be the weakest of the year. We also expect, under the current plan, for capital expenditures to exceed our operating cash flows in the second quarter. But as you can see here on the slide, we expect our operating cash flows for the full 9-month period in the balance of this year to exceed capital expenditures by $400 million. And that's a $200 million improvement in cash flows for the full year compared to our previous plan despite a $0.50 decline in assumed average copper prices. In addition to the cost and capital reductions, our plan reflects a number of cash flow benefits associated with reductions in materials and supplies inventories, an acceleration of tax refunds and a series of other items to improve our cash flow. Importantly, we boosted liquidity during the year compared to our prior plans, and our net debt is lower. Richard mentioned, we've gone through a process of stress testing these plans at various prices and believe we have a plan that will bridge us through 2020 and put us in a strong position as we enter 2021 with the addition of large scale, low-cost volumes from Grasberg. Turning to Slide 26. We show our sales outlook for 2020 through 2022. As you'll note in this slide, the sales volumes are about 400 million pounds per annum, lower than our previous estimates. This reflects the curtailments that we're making in the Americas, reducing our mining rates. And it also includes a small change in 2022 associated with the deferral of the upgrade of the mill project, which has a slight impact on our mine plan for the ramp-up of the Deep MLZ. You see the gold sales are similar to our prior levels. There's a small change in 2022 related to the timing of the mill upgrade. Molybdenum sales are down about 10% from our prior estimates, and that reflects the change at the Climax mine and also the reduction in byproduct moly resulting from mine plan changes in our Americas copper mines. On Slide 27, we present a summary by region of our unit net cash costs. We separated the first quarter from the rest of the year so you can see the impacts of our actions. Net unit cash costs on a consolidated basis in the first quarter were $1.90 per pound. This was better than our plan, which projected about just over $2 in the first quarter. And our first quarter was expected in the original plan to be our highest in the year. But as you'll see, what we've done with our cost structure in the balance of the year is driving a significant decline in net unit cash costs compared with the first quarter. Cash costs in the 9-month average would be $1.44 per pound. That is $0.46 a pound or 24% below the first quarter average. We expect to average for the year, $1.55, taking into account the first quarter results and move to a unit cost level of about $1.20 per pound in 2021. We show at the bottom of the page, the makeup of our cost by region. You can see energy on these pie charts, which includes diesel and electrical power. And that represents, combined, the diesel and other sources of energy, 17% of our consolidated costs. Diesel represents about 8% and our diesel prices have declined more than 50% since the start of 2020. Moving to Slide 28, and you've seen us present EBITDA and operating cash flow in this format over many quarters. But it's designed to show at various prices what our EBITDA and cash flow generating capacity is using the average volumes and costs for 2021 and 2022. We hold gold flat in this scenario at $1,600 per ounce and molybdenum at $9 per pound and vary the copper prices for 2021 and 2022 between $2.50 and $3. And you can see here, we would generate a $2.50 copper, over $5 billion in EBITDA and over $3 billion of operating cash flow. And as prices move, we could generate over $7 billion at $3 copper and over $4.5 billion of operating cash flows. We present sensitivities on the right side of the chart, so you can make your own adjustments as to different copper market or gold market outlooks. We expect, as Richard was talking about, to manage our situation from a financial standpoint in 2020. Before getting into 2021, we will generate - we expect to generate very significant increases in cash margins and cash flow. We've cut spending. I'm now on Slide 29. So these cash flows that we generate will be available to fund CapEx and also have excess cash flows for other initiatives, including debt reductions and other initiatives that we have. We cut CapEx from $2.8 billion to $2 billion, and we show the details of where that came from. For 2021, we're currently estimating $2.3 billion in capital expenditures. That's about $100 million lower than our prior estimate. The focus of our plans to date, our revised plans to date, have been mainly on capital expenditures in 2020. We're continuing to review 2021. And we're reviewing those for potential additional reductions depending on market conditions, which we'll be evaluating in the coming months. Our plans, appropriately cut spending and capital and again, preserving the strong outlook that we have over the next several years. I'll just close on our financial policy that we covered throughout the call. We remain focused on safeguarding our people and our business, and maintaining strong liquidity and balance sheet strength as we manage uncertainty during the pandemic and the economics - associated economic impacts. Under current market conditions and priorities, our Board does not expect to declare dividends in 2020. This will be evaluated on a regular basis. And as we successfully execute our plans and enter 2021, we expect to be in a much stronger position with increased cash flow, enhanced flexibility to consider shareholder returns. Thanks for your attention today. And operator, we'd now like to open the call for questions. Dave, it's Kathleen. Our mining rates that we have put in here, the 20% reduction in 2020, continues into part of 2021. We have some mines that are starting to ramp up, but we still have idled production during that period of time. So when we were pursuing in our previous plans, the initiatives, we were calling America's concentrator where we were increasing both mining rates and milling rates. We're not doing that at this point. So we could, if market conditions were to improve dramatically, and we'd have to take a long, hard look at that because, as you know, this is not a light switch that can go on and off. But we could start bringing back production and - over time and increase our mining and milling rates again. So this assumes that we remain in a curtailed mode at most of the - really all the operations through the first part of next year. And then some of the operations are increasing mining rates and others aren't. So it's a mixed bag, but we could. There's nothing about our prior plans that would stop us from increasing production. It may delay but because of the mining rate change this year, it may delay the timing to get to those volumes. But as we talked about, the volumes are still there and could be added over time if market conditions warrant. Well, our prior plan at the beginning of the year was based on the context of a copper market of $2.75 to $3. And as Richard was saying, the things - the ground work was in place for potentially higher prices as we go forward. So I think you'd have to see prices move back to those levels and have more economic certainty around the economy. But we're going to be very disciplined about executing these plans, really focused on costs, really focused on capital in the near term to make sure that we can preserve our financial position during 2020. And then as we get into 2021, we can start looking beyond at what the market conditions are and whether we restore full mining operations at that point. Yes. Well, we've also reduced production at El Abra. We deferred a significant capital item there. And so we're reducing our mining rate at El Abra, and that's also contributing to the lower production in South America. But we do show - under our plans, we do show Cerro Verde production increasing in 2021 from the 2020 levels. But our El Abra mine is about flat like it was in 2020 when you compare it. So that's a significant reduction from our prior plans. Richard, do you want me to take that one? Okay. With respect to the working capital question, we are projecting a large working capital source in 2020. As we mentioned, that is one of our initiatives here, to release cash from the balance sheet through the materials. As we curtail mining operations, we'll have the ability to use existing inventories as opposed to having to buy new consumables to a certain degree. So we'll have a reduction in materials and supplies. We're also bringing forward some tax refunds that were projected over the next several years, and we're bringing those forward into 2020. And there are a number of other cash flow initiatives that we have developed over the last several weeks in the context of our revised plans. And so we are showing a large source of working capital throughout the year. Right. Yes. In terms of the question on the gold. We did experience some higher grades and - of gold, and that will - we still are projecting that our grades are consistent with our plans. And you'll have pluses and minuses with how the grades are measuring against the plans. We did have some higher grades. And Mark, I don't know if you want to comment any further about gold grades and recoveries as we go forward. The other thing I would just add, Red's team is very strong with all of the operations that during this downturn, we're not going to compromise safety. We're not going to be cannibalizing equipment. We're going to keep the equipment that we are using in good condition. It's just that we're not using all of our equipment. So we're postponing what we need to do in terms of rebuilding and things to meet a higher mining plan. But we're not doing things that don't - we aren't doing things that would destroy asset value, and Red keeps preaching that to the team. So I just wanted to add that. Oscar, this is Kathleen. So it was a combination of many things. But in the Americas, we removed production. So that flows through all the costs, all the mining and labor costs. And so that had an effect on removing all of the cost of production associated with those pounds. We also benefited from lower energy costs, which was about $0.07 a pound compared to our prior forecast. Energy costs are lower than when we prepared this forecast. They're down probably another 15%, 20% from the time we prepared this forecast. But from a long-term perspective, we're using about $1 per gallon of diesel in these forecasts. And that had about a $0.07 impact on the Americas cost. Of course, in the U.S., our currencies, it's all a U.S. dollar business. Where we really saw the benefit of the currency impact was in Indonesia. And as I mentioned, that reduced our cost by - the absolute cost of energy plus the currency benefits by about 10% in Indonesia. And the big driver in Indonesia, though, is the volume aspect, and that's really what's going to drive our cash costs lower. But as you've seen, we reduced our - we were previously estimating over the next 5 years, about $0.30 a pound for production costs in Indonesia, and we're now using roughly $0.20 a pound for those costs, and that reflects some savings in the cost structure that we've been driving over many months, not just because of the COVID and the economic situation. But as we transitioned out of Grasberg into the underground, we've been - Mark and his team have been leading a zero-based budgeting process to bring overall costs down in Indonesia. I think what we're doing really is looking at what's cash flow positive. And so we look down at cutting production further. At $2 copper, that may not make sense. But we'll iterate on that some more as we go forward. But if you really look into our second half cash costs at $2 copper, our Americas business is generating cash flow. And so prices would have to decline substantially for us to take it down further. But you noted how quickly we moved here, and we're continuing to evaluate, to be flexible to have a flexible operating structure regardless of prices. And right now, our plans show pretty flat going out to that point over the next 5 years for Americas. But as Richard said, it's going to be dynamic as we assess the situation going forward. I think the other thing to add here is we benefit from having very long life reserves. And when you're looking at - aside from the Grasberg reinvestment - investment program we're making right now, once we get into production at Grasberg, CapEx will decline. You'll be generating a lot of free cash flow. But also in the Americas, we have a very long life reserve base and additional resources. So when you look at the cash cost plus the CapEx, and you think about, we're not having to spend a lot of CapEx to replace reserves because we've got such a long reserve profile. And we don't have the reinvestment risk that some other short life mines might have. So when we look at this and when we went through this plan with Red and the Americas team, we were really looking at what is the cash cost less the capital that comes with it? And sometimes, when you're trying to build production and grow, you've got a lot of capital that comes with that. And so right now, we're operating on the plan to have as lower cash costs but also what is the lowest cash cost plus capital expenditures that makes sense for us right now. And that's really the plan we're focused on."

            "content": "Yes. Richard, you're absolutely correct. And just one specific example would be El Abra that Kathleen mentioned earlier that we're slowing down the production right there in order to push out capital expenditures and a new leach pad that's required for future production. So when things look up, we'll make that investment and be able to increase the volumes there if markets warrant."

Our Freeport family extends sympathy and support to all those that are impacted by the virus. And also by the very significant economic hardship that is brought over so many people. We appreciate particularly the global health care providers, government authorities and others who are on the frontlines working often at personal peril to protect our people and all people around the world. At Freeport, we are prioritizing the health and safety of our workers. While we support the communities where we operate, as we serve customers with the ongoing requirements of copper. The copper is an essential metal for the global economy even in today's world. The plan we're announcing today is a comprehensive response by our company following a carefully planned-process-to develop proactive actions, first to save our people and our business and then to protect the value of our assets for the long-term. Very proud of our Freeport team for the response they developed in a very short period during a time when the world faces this unprecedented pandemic crisis. Our team has responded in the right way with the right attitude of commitment and cooperation. Our revised plan will target year end 2020 financial liquidity that at current copper prices actually exceeds the liquidity that we had targeted in our annual plan announced just a quarter ago and that was when copper prices were 20% - more than 20% higher than today's price. What we had to do with this plan was offset the loss of approximately $1.7 billion of cash flow from lower prices. We've done this by reducing spending, revising mine plans, and taking a series of financial initiatives. Importantly, we have contingency plans to preserve our business if the copper price were to fall further. What this plan will do is carry us over the brighter days for our company. When production volumes increased substantially with the ramp up of our new underground mines in Indonesia, 2021, and as the world economy recovers, whenever that might be. Our Freeport team has done fabulous work by making tough decisions in developing the plan, while we are protecting our workers, treating them fairly, I personally cannot thank our team enough for the work done in developing this plan. We fully recognize the uncertainties we all face about the duration and extent of the pandemic and its impact on the growing economies. Having said that, I'm confident the actions we are taking will allow Freeport to navigate this period of uncertainty and position our company for long-term success. Starting with Slide 3, I emphasize again that health and well-being of our people is number one priority. As we protect our workers, we are addressing the current financial challenge using our experience and successfully responding to past financial crisis. We have an existing playbook that we're following. But we're also taking into account current conditions and uncertainties. We are now undertaking aggressive proactive actions focused on protecting liquidity, by cutting costs, maximizing cash flows. Situation is dynamic and uncertain; we're prepared to do further adjustments to preserve liquidity and protect long-term values if we have to. Our company benefits in a major way from having extraordinary long lived and durable reserves and resources. I'm confident that the actions we're announcing today and our preparations to respond to further as required will make these assets even more valuable for shareholders in the future. Turning to Slide 4, we have implemented prudent health protocols in all of our locations. We do what we can to avert a spread of coronavirus in our operations. We're monitoring and following all the guidelines of international health organizations and governments. The effort is being led by a dedicated team of medical advisors and providers. Our procedures are robust, forward looking, proactive rather than reactive. Our international medical providers are administering, tracing, quarantine procedures on an ongoing basis. We severely restricted and in most cases, eliminated travel, group meetings have been eliminated, working virtually, and all work that can be done remotely is being done remotely. In our operations, physical distancing in mining processing is being achieved. Ours is not like a factory where people are working totally together. Truck drivers, shovel operators, other operators can work with social distance. At the site we provide housing, meals, transportation. We are being diligent with sanitization isolation of workers showing symptoms and treating workers who have potential illness with state-of-the-art equipment and facilities. Our management of worker health to-date has been very effective. We've experienced a limited less than 50 confirmed cases to-date across our global workforce which approaches 70,000 workers. But knowing just how fast this virus can spread, we remain diligent and proactive in protecting our people. Slide 5 addresses our commitment to communities where we operate. This commitment is longstanding and unwavering. These communities are the homes for our workers and their families. They are essential to our long term success. Across the globe we're supporting communities during this time of great need. We are prioritizing critical needs caused by COVID-19 and we continue to [technical difficulty]. Slide 6 presents the global span of our work force including employees and contractors. While a lot of countries are dealing with the pandemic in varying degrees, our workforce is adhering to global health standards, focusing on their personal safety, and the well-being of those around them. Our global team of workers is critical to our company's success and we fully recognize that. I personally appreciate the dedication, commitment, cooperation during this challenging time. Slide 7 we note that copper is a metal strategic to the world and its importance is growing. Freeport is a long time leading supplier of copper to the global economy. We're working closely with customers to meet their needs in today's world, protecting our business so we can reliably serve customers in the future. Copper is essential to global economy not only in times when the economy is growing but also in times like these when health care, water, food supply, communications and technology are critically important. Telecommunications, digital technologies, and cloud applications have ever been more important than in today's world. And copper is an essential element in meeting these requirements. On Slide 8 I want to note that many of you probably have seen recent reports on the growing recognition of copper's anti-microbial properties. Copper can play a significant role in preventing transmission of viruses and bacteria. This has been known for a long time. Our industry has supported research efforts and education efforts for the public to understand the benefits of copper in fighting the spread of infections in normal times. The current pandemic is bringing to light what copper can achieve in improving public health. Studies have demonstrated that copper can destroy viruses like COVID-19. Copper's use in health care equipment and facilities and in public places will undoubtedly grow significantly when the cost of copper which has been a barrier in the past is measured by the enormous cost to society that is being brought on by this pandemic. Freeport will be at the forefront of leading the world to understand the benefits, the greater uses of copper globally. To learn more about this, I refer you to the Copper Development Association's website and you can read articles about it almost every day in the press. On Slide 9, we talk about just how quickly the market conditions change. [Technical difficulty] seems like a lifetime. When FCX reported its fourth quarter results, the global economy was showing clear signs of progress. The phase one deal with China was encouraging after trade issues had burdened copper prices for the previous 18 months. The copper price was then $2.85 a pound and seem poised to move higher. Now, we have copper prices today about $0.50 per pound lower than in late January. And in recent times, we've seen copper trade down to near $2 a pound, totally unexpected. Meantime, the gold prices have risen dramatically. Gold is a benefit to operations in Indonesia. Oil markets are in turmoil. Diesel fuel roughly 8% of operating cost has declined roughly about 50%, dollar strengthened that lowers our U.S. dollar cost for expenditures in current local currencies. Many other input costs have dropped. The rapid change in markets required us to move quickly and aggressively digest our plans. Freeport's 2020 revenues were already abnormally low because of the transition of Grasberg to underground mining. We completed mining the massive Grasberg high volume open pit in December 2018. Today, PT-FI is effectively managing the coronavirus self-challenge. PT-FI is progressing at own schedule with the ramp up of its massive underground mines. This has been the critical strategic initiative for our company for many years. Continued progress with this ramp up will place Freeport in a much stronger cash flow position even if copper prices stay low in 2021 and beyond. The gold benefit of Grasberg's production is a major benefit as I said, the gold component Grasberg's production is a major benefit. It's what together with the good copper grades make this one of the mining industries, most fabulous assets. Of course gold is having its day in the sun, copper's day will come. On Slide 10, we talk about this transition that Grasberg moved to underground mining and with a current ramp up. We've incorporated in our original plans, our budget going into 2020 are prior to the current pandemic, doing the proactive steps to protect our balance sheet and liquidity. Over the past four years, we have cut what was then crippling debt levels in 2016 in half. During 2019, we extended our $3.5 billion bank credit facility currently undrawn for a new five-year term extending to 2024. Kathleen and her team also worked with our banks to obtain amendments to our bank credit revolving covenants, to give us flexibility during the Grasberg ramp-up. In recent months we've had two bond offerings raising a total of $2.5 billion in long-term notes at attractive rates which we used to refinance debt maturities. Today we have no significant near-term debt maturities. Slide 11 now addresses the aggressive actions we're now taking. Our team undertook a comprehensive and iterative process involving site managements across the company. Red Conger and his team in the Americas were facing the challenge this time around of not being supported by cash flows going out of - coming out of Indonesia. Cash we're generating in Indonesia is going into continuing to develop the underground. So what they got to do for each operation each individual mine was to develop a plan to maximize near-term cash flow at low prices while protecting long-term values. All the savings reflected in our new plans that we're reporting today are supported by detailed analysis. We left no stone unturned. This was not a top down exercise. The objective was set at the top. But our operating teams developed these plans and now own them. They are committed to executing them and our senior management team and our administrative organizations will support them. Everybody is on board. Our Board of Directors has deferred common stock dividends in 2020 prioritizing this. The Board will review dividend actions on a regular basis with the goal of restoring dividends when conditions improve. The chart on the right, summarizes the combined impact of these actions. Based on our January plan at $2.85 copper, we would have ended the year with a consolidated cash position of $1 billion before returning to significant cash flow generation in 2021 with Grasberg's ramp up and beyond. Despite this $0.50 a pound current reduction in copper prices, our revised plan is at $2.30 copper, plans we're announcing today project $1.7 billion in cash at year-end and increase in liquidity without raising new capital. This is a major accomplishment. Three, four weeks ago, we wouldn't have anticipated. We have stress test our plans at lower prices to ensure we have a plan to bridge us through 2020 regardless of prices, and put us in a strong position as we enter 2021 when we will be adding large-scale, low-cost volumes for Grasberg. Significantly, we've reserved a plan to double EBITDA in 2021 from this year's levels without higher copper prices. Slide 12 illustrates the impact of this. Execution of these plans will set us up for significant improvements in 2021, in part from changes in copper prices. Projecting a 26% increase in copper sales, volumes in 2021, 75% increase in gold volumes. The outlook takes into account approximately 400 million pounds of Americas production that we are idling in this plan. And our projections include that remaining idle in 2021, which we're adjusting if conditions improve. Our unit cost projected to decline, 2021 EBITDA would double, 2020 levels at $2.30 copper and $1,600 gold. Cash flow benefit from potential higher gold prices noted as well, many expect, as well as the potential for a return of copper prices to the levels we saw earlier this year. Looking at Slide 13, we note that our management team has had extensive experience in managing tough market environments. The leadership teams across the company are seasoned and have been effective and successful in past downturns. Prices is different, but in each of our past experiences, Freeport has come out stronger. We have a management structure and a team that is collaborative, experienced and decisive. Never cut corners on important issues involving worker safety or environmental obligations. We keep a long-term focus on our license to operate around the world that we worked so hard to earn. We adjust to market conditions quickly, develop contingency plans for further actions as required, do this on a site-by-site basis, a planned safeguard to protect long-term values. This is a real hallmark of this Freeport organization. Highlighted on the slide are actions we took in 2008, 2009 crisis [technical difficulty] 2014 and reached critically low levels in 2015 and 2016 when our company was heavily burdened by debt from our discontinued oil and gas business. Note where share prices were for FCX during each of these crises and the improvement within two years that follow. We're all committed to successful execution of these plans. We're all intensely focused on restoring value in our shares. Now I want to provide you a brief update of our operations and projects. Slide 14 addresses Cerro Verde. As reported previously, the Peruvian government declared a national emergency, which was just extended to May 10. This government order affects Cerro Verde and other mines in Peru. Our Cerro Verde team is doing great work in managing smaller-scale operations during this period while we protect the health of a much reduced workforce and as we work with the government to explain our health protocols so that we can position Cerro Verde for a restore to normal operations. Cerro Verde has been operating in excess of designed capacity for several quarters, chiefly mill throughput of over 400,000 metric tons per day, leading up to March 16. We are currently operating about 1/3 of this level. Our plans are developing and ramping up Cerro Verde late in the second quarter and returning to higher production levels in the second half. Returning Cerro Verde to normal production is important to the government of Peru and the community of Arequipa. Cerro Verde has been a large contributor to the national and local economy, one of the largest employers in the region. Slide 15 covers our new mine that we are developing in Eastern Arizona, adjacent to our Safford mine, very close to Morenci, called Lone Star. And we're nearing completion of this new mine, and we will commence production in the coming months. The project is 90% complete. Capital is largely behind us. We're advancing on schedule with pres-tripping, which we expect to complete in the third quarter. We've started to ramp up placement of ore on newly constructed leach pad at the nearby Safford operation. Project is forecast to add 200 million pounds of copper per year initially, with opportunities to increase production over time with low capital intensity. While we have great expansion opportunities at Lone Star, we are deferring those until the market conditions more. We remain excited about the long-term opportunity for Lone Star. We believe it will be a significant future cornerstone asset for Freeport in the United States. At Grasberg, very pleased to report that our Grasberg underground ramp-up is proceeding on schedule. Great cave propagation for the Grasberg Block Cave and the Deep MLZ mine continue to go well. We have achieved important milestones to establish large-scale production from these high-grade low-cost little blocks. Been consistently meeting or exceeding key performance indicators. I congratulate Mark Johnson & our PTF team for its noteworthy performance in advancing this massive undertaking in such an effective manner. During the first quarter, production from the Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ together averaged over 37,000 tons per day, slightly in excess of our forecast at the beginning of the year, and over 44% higher than prior quarter rates. By the end of the first quarter, we were producing at a combined rate of over 40,000 metric tons per day. Rates will be increasing continually as we go forward. We've added almost 50 new drawbells at the 2 mines during the quarter compared with 34 in the fourth quarter. We now have 250 open drawbells, which are the rock funnels that allow us to gain scale in ore production. These are high-grade, large copper and gold ore bodies. It's noteworthy that the first quarter mill rate throughput was only about half of last year's first quarter yet PT-FI's quarterly metal production was similar to last year's first quarter. This demonstrates that these underground ore bodies can produce scale because of their grades. At full rates, the production of these 2 ore bodies is projected to average over 1.3 billion pounds of copper, 1.3 million ounces of gold per year. In the earlier years, we'll have higher grades, and that will yield higher metal production. Average net unit costs are expected to average less than $0.20 a pound in the first 5 years of full production rates. $0.20 a pound, that's notable and rare for large-scale operations in the global copper industry. Our PT-FI team deserves complements for their extraordinary performance in managing the health situation while continuing to execute on this major project. We have a workforce of about 30,000 people, a large portion of that work in the highlands, where they live in dorms, eat in mess halls. Our team is supported by world-class medical providers. They've been proactive with a series of actions to help us prevent any major outbreak at this remote location. Our testing and screening activities in one of the most remote places in the world are much more advanced than much of what we're seeing today in communities in the United States. Our PT-FI development operating team is supported by FCX's global world-class technical organization. PT-FI in Indonesia is benefiting now [technical difficulty] that was put in place in late 2018, where now we have a 51% shareholder that's a state owned company, named MIND ID and now we have a much more positive relationship with the government of Indonesia after our December 2018 IUPK permit. Unlike years past, now all stakeholder interest in our business in Indonesia are aligned. Slide 17 talks about the smelter that we committed to construct as part of the IUPK. We're facing delays with this project. It's located far from our operations in Papua, in a densely populated area of Eastern Java. We have notified the government of delays because of worker restrictions and supply chain issues, and we're in discussions to extend the December 2023 project deadline. We're also reviewing with the government other issues related to the smelter that might be mutually beneficial to PT-FI and the government. We do not expect to incur capital expenditures of significance in 2020 on the smelter as a result of the delays that we're experiencing. Slide 18 looks at copper markets. Copper prices have dropped from a weaker demand from the declining GDP, of course. On the other hand, supplies of copper have been impacted by the pandemic. Copper mines and development projects are being curtailed or canceled. Scrap market, which provides a large part of refined copper to the market, is currently very weak. We're encouraged by data now coming out of China, indicating an emerging recovery. There is strong likelihood around the world that ongoing stimulus actions will help economies recover. Despite the long - the near-term uncertainties, we're not trying to base our business on ours or anybody else's ability to predict these near-term situations. The long-term copper outlook for copper remains highly positive, and in some ways, being supported by the supply curtailments we're now seeing. Copper is strongly supported by fundamentals, has an essential role in the overall global economy, the major element in efforts to reduce carbon in the world, and the world is increasingly turning to electronics in so many respects, extended from electric vehicles, charging stations, but also 5G and other technical factors are going to require more electronics in the world. Supplies of copper continue to be limited. No one can predict with confidence when economies will recover. Copper is a highly attractive commodity to move - and is positioned to move substantially higher as economic conditions improve. Freeport will be a major beneficiary of this movement. I've included Slide 19 as an infographic, developed by the Copper Development Associations, what I thought does a great job of illustrating broad ranges of uses of copper in the economy. I'll just refer it to you and ask you to take a look at it when you have a moment to consider it. Slide 20 will present our reserve and resource position. We have long-lived and valuable resources that will be available for all organic growth development for decades to come. Volumes we've elected to curtail the current market will be more valuable in the future as economic conditions improve. Before turning to Kathleen, who will review the financial outlook in more detail, I want to close with the following. Freeport is foremost in copper. Looking beyond the current troubled conditions, copper is widely considered the best-positioned major commodity for our supply - from a supply demand standpoint. Freeport's portfolio of copper assets are large and high quality. We're an established industry leader, we operate the mines that we have interest in, which are among the largest in the world. And by operating all of our assets, it provides us valuable synergies and flexibility across the portfolio to deal with times like these and to take advantages of the brighter days to come. Our assets are long-lived, durable, with embedded option for reserve and resource growth. Strong franchises in the United States, South America and Indonesia. Near term, Freeport is in advanced stage for a major increase in margin and cash flows beginning in 2021, apart from copper price movements and extended for 20 years and further. We have industry-leading technical capabilities through strong track record of execution over many years. We've earned the trust and respect of our partners, our customers, our suppliers, financial markets, most importantly, our workers, communities and those countries where we operate. Our block caving experience is one of the most extensive and longest-standing in the history of the global mining industry. We've been operating block caves in Indonesia since the early 1980s, and we have an important aluminum of block cave operation in Colorado. This is a critically important factor as we transition Grasberg to the largest block caving operation in the world. Our experienced and battle testing management team has demonstrated the capabilities to perform in good times and bad. We are confident of our ability to \"improve our metal\" as we've done in the past. Slide 22, I want to close by talking about our people. Again, I want to recognize the strength and resiliency of the entire Freeport family who inspire me every day. I'm proud to be part of this team. We're all motivated and committed to persevere and achieve success for all of our stakeholders. Kathleen, I'll let you take over. Okay. Thank you for your question. Mark Johnson, would you comment? Mark is actually in Papua now at Grasberg. Can you comment on the supply chain issues and how we're dealing with it? And Dave, realistically, this situation is not likely to turn on at one point. Different countries are going to be in different situations. And things will occur step-by-step, and there will be uncertainties along the way. So it would be fair to say that given our overriding objective of protecting the long-term values of our assets, we will be very measured on how we respond. Well, let me ask you to repeat the question. Unfortunately, I had a little static in my line here. So I wouldn't characterize it as a renegotiation. We reluctantly decided that we would have to commit to build the smelter in order to get a resolution of the long-standing issues we've had with the government of Indonesia about extending our operating rights. And that was one key concession that we made along with facilitating the government through a state-owned company, acquiring 51% of the shares. That, as you know, was achieved principally by Rio Tinto deciding to sell their joint venture interest to the government. Of course, in return, we got clear-cut operating rights, fixed fiscal and financial terms to 2041 and established a positive new working relationship with the government. So we've made that commitment to the government, and we're executing on that commitment. The facts are we can't proceed as we have planned because of the worker restrictions at Gresik where the smelter relocated and supply chain issues with contractors and the like. In the meantime, the government in Indonesia, like governments around the world, are struggling with state revenues because of lower economic activity and investments. So we are engaging with the government as to whether this new circumstance might provide a way that would be mutually advantageous for the government, for our MIND ID, through PT-FI to reconsider what we're doing with the smelter. But throughout all this, we are being clear-cut that we made this commitment to the government. And unless the government agrees to some changes, which the current circumstances might lead them to consider, we are proceeding with fulfilling our commitment to build a smelter. Let me just add that, again, complementing people. Kathleen and her team has done a great job with financing. Steve Higgins, who heads up our administrative team is doing an excellent job in managing worker issues and HR and other matters. Danny Hughes, who heads up our global supply team, is doing a fabulous job. And we have tremendously positive relationships with our suppliers. We are often one of their largest customers, in many cases, the largest customer. And so as we face this problem, we sit down with our suppliers, and we're able to find ways to reduce costs, deal with payment terms and the like. Same way with our customers. We all understand each other's problems. We worked together many years. Some of this you're seeing is a result of all those long-term relationships, but also how diligent our whole team is being in finding ways, I said we left no stone unturned, in finding ways to generate cash, and we're going to continue to do that on an ongoing basis. Yes. I was going to add that, Kathleen, before Mark talked. Mark, I've been noting just how strong our recoveries have been and recoveries have been above plan in many respects. So maybe you could talk about that. Well, thanks, Chris. The word jeopardizing is not one that would be - that would apply here. But the effects of not spending some of this money now will carry over to future production levels because certain of the capital costs that we're deferring will have to be recovered in the future, and it will push out some production. But this will not, in any significant way, jeopardize the value, the resources because the resources are still there but it could - it will result in some delays of when that production occurs. You see that at Grasberg, where we are delaying spending on incremental crushing capacity at the mill for the time being, and that will have an impact. What we'll do is update you each quarter as we go through this and get better views of it. But again, it's not a question of destroying resources but there will be some impact on future timing. Let me ask Red. Red, do you have a comment on this? No question about that. I think the feature that was most supportive of copper prices is the supply situation in copper. Supply was going to be tested in any event before all this happened. And now, with development projects being delayed, curtailments occurring, which is we just spoke about, has some impact. And as you say, Chris, we know what it's like to be a company where you don't have flexibility with liquidity. That's where we were in 2016. And as a result, we had to sell assets beyond copper, but also some copper assets. So this is - depending on severity and the link of this lasting, there's going to be a longer run impact on copper supplies, and that will ultimately be supporting the prices. John, we've lost part of your question. I think I understand your question. I think the more likely thing - the way forward with that is for our company, and hopefully, I feel confident, other companies will join us, is to provide the technical basis for these things and then to work with entrepreneurs, venture capital firms and so forth to develop these new industries. We tried this in the past and we ran into barriers because of the cost of refitting and so forth. Now the world has changed and people are seeing this. And this flood of articles is coming out, telling the truth about copper. So we think that will create a market, and we will be working with the industry as a company to help promote this going forward. I think there would be some likelihood for government support of entrepreneurial-type companies. Going forward, our primary focus is going to continue to be in developing and operating mines. But we will - we've already begun talking and developing a team to see how we might help lead this movement to doing something that - positive for copper markets, of course, but more importantly, would be positive for the world because these impacts of health protection are real. And we just see how much they are needed in today's world. And even before that, the number of infections that people get going to hospitals for surgeries and things like knee replacements that occur because of infections from hospitals is staggering. So this is just bringing to light a contribution that copper as a metal can make the world. And we are going to be a leader in demonstrating that. Well, it's just too early to do that. I mean, we're in a period of uncertainty right now. Our focus has been on bridging from the loss of cash flows from the lower copper price to ensure that we could bridge our company to the higher volumes from Grasberg. And so that's what we're doing with this plan. We're going to focus on executing this plan. For any of us to sit here today and be able to predict where the world is going to be any period of time even in the short run, there's huge uncertainties. And beyond that, there are as well. So we're just not in a position right now to say what we're going to do. But I think what you can get comfort in is that we have the flexibility of addressing to whatever the world has. We have a track record of doing that. You can look and see what we did beginning in 2010, 2011, what we did in 2016, '17 and see how we did it, and that's what we're going to keep working on. So this is an unfolding story, work in process. But as a company, we have a lot of flexibility in dealing with whatever comes down the road, positive or negative. Well, we have mines that range in cost structures from the lowest end of the industry to mines that are relatively high cost because of the nature of the portfolio we put together years ago when we combined Grasberg with Phelps Dodge portfolio of assets. And by having these assets together is what enables us to reduce mines that are relatively low margin during good times and generate profits and extend resources with having the ability to scale back production when prices are low. And that was the huge issue that Phelps Dodge faced years ago, and the strategic benefit we achieved by putting these sets of assets together. So we can calculate an average as a company and compare that average with other companies. But when we manage the business, the management is focused on site-by-site. And so what you're seeing here today is a layering of actions to reduce high cost production, drive our costs down. And even within areas of mines like Morenci, there are elements of production within that large mine that get adjusted and others do not. So there's no - the average is calculated, but the management is managed site-by-site. Well, it's been a long call. I appreciate your attention. I think the length of this call is warranted because of the uncertainties we face, and we wanted to make sure that we did our best to try to explain to you what we're doing with the company. As you can tell, we're more than pleased with where we are in a very difficult and uncertain situation. Our guard is up. We're not going to let down at all because none of us are quite sure what else we might have to deal with. And so thank you for your attention. If you have follow-up questions, or comments, please get in touch with David Joint, and we'll respond to them. I hope all of you stay healthy and your families and friends can do so as well. It's time to be reflective about what this situation is doing to so many people around the world, and our hearts and prayers go out to everyone. Thank you a lot."

            "name": "Mark Johnson",
            "content": "Yes. To date, we haven't had any problems. Nothing's been interrupted. We're - we always have to maintain a supply up in the highlands. But no issues on - obviously, we have a large community up here. That's one of our concerns, but no problem. Like some of the places in the states, we haven't had a run on any of our grocery stores, our medical supplies, all those key things, plus all the things that we're doing for production and for our development, we haven't had any issues. On the contingency plans. One of the things that we've looked at in a worst-case scenario, as you mentioned, is the mines that we'd be - need to have some consideration. At Big Gossan, we could shut off and turn on if we needed to. It's a stope mine. But we've got - we work with our consultants and we understand what sort of minimum draw rates we would need in our block caves to keep them going. We could drop our personnel dramatically and to just do that minimum draw. For instance, in the Deep MLZ, right now, we run 8 loaders, about the same in the GBC. That's our core production. So the core production is a relatively small amount of people and equipment. A lot of our effort is in the continued expansion, the construction to achieve those out years that we've got. So it's an ongoing process. Our contingency plan in the worst-case scenario would be to minimize those activities and focus on the production activities. Yes. In the first quarter, what we - the significant difference that we saw in grades in both copper and gold was in the Deep MLZ. We were essentially on or just above target as far as the tonnes. But for both the copper and gold grades, we were about 18% above plan. What's driving that is really, we're mining the Deep MLZ for the cave management. We've talked about the seismicity. And so we're very cognizant of how we pull the cave and it's - our intent is to draw it in a very even fashion, and we've got a great system now where we can track every single bucket, and we know exactly where each bucket of material came from. Just happened in the first quarter to manage the cave on a daily basis, the grades came out. Like Kathleen said, it was an advancement. It's not a change in our model. We just happen to be able to pull - by following the cave plan, we ended up with better grades. And those grades are quite good on both - the copper grade for Deep MLZ was at 1.9% copper and 1.9 gram per tonne gold. And the plan for both those were right in the 1.6 range. So that was a welcome surprise. Recoveries have been quite good. As Richard said, we've been - particularly, on copper, we were over 92% copper recovery. Obviously, these - our experience has been over the life of mining the Grasberg and the other ore bodies here, the better the grade, the better the recoveries, and that's been tracking well. As we mine these very high grades at Gras, at Deep MLZ and the grades at GBC are also very respectable and very high-grade deposit at Big Gossan. So we track well on that, and then we've been right in the 80% recovery range for the gold, which is very close to our expectations."

Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead ma'am.\nKathleen Quirk: Thank you and good morning. Welcome to the Freeport McMoran conference call. Earlier this morning we reported our fourth quarter and year-end 2021 operating and financial results and a copy of today's press release and slides are available on our website at FCX.com. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin today's comments, we'd like to remind everyone that our press release and certain of our comments on today's call include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings. On the call with me today are Richard Adkerson, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Johnson, who heads up our Indonesian Operations; Josh Olmsted, who heads up our Americas Business; Mike Kendrick, who leads Molybdenum business; we\u2019ve also have Rick Coleman and Cory Stevens, who support our team with engineering and construction, technical services and support for our growth projects; and Steve Higgins, our Chief Administrative Officer. I'll start by briefly summarizing our financial results, and then I'll turn over the call to Richard who'll review the slide materials on our -- in our presentation. And I'll make some comments, and then we'll open up the call for questions. Today, FCX reported fourth quarter 2021 net income attributable to common stock of $1.1 billion or $0.74 per share, and adjusted net income after excluding net charges totaling $0.3 billion or $0.21 per share was $1.4 billion or $0.96 per share for the quarter. For the year ended 2021, our net income attributable to common stock totaled $4.3 billion, $2.90 per share, and adjusted net income totaled $4.6 billion or $3.13 per share. We have a reconciliation of our adjusted net income on VII in as part of today's release. Our adjusted earnings before interest taxes and depreciation for the fourth quarter totaled $3.2 billion and for the year totaled $10.9 billion. We've got a reconciliation of our EBITDA calculations on Page 43 of our presentation materials. Our team delivered great volume growth during the year, our copper sales of over a billion pounds during the fourth quarter, approximated our guidance going into the period. And for the year we sold 3.8 billion pounds of copper that was a 19% increase from 2020. Our fourth quarter 2021 gold sales of 395,000 ounces or about 5% above our guidance went into the quarter. And that reflected higher throughput rates in Indonesia. Our annual gold sales totaled 1.4 million ounces for the year and were 59% above the 2020 total. We benefited during the quarter from positive pricing for copper. Our average realized price of $4.42 per pound in the fourth quarter was more than $1 per pound higher than the fourth quarter of 2020. Our realized gold price of $1,808 per ounce was slightly below the year-ago quarter. And our results also benefited from improved molybdenum prices, our realization in the fourth quarter of 2021 of over $19 per pound was almost double the year-ago periods realization. Unit net cash costs during the fourth quarter averaged $1.29 per pound of copper. That was slightly above our estimate of $1.26 going into the quarter, but that reflected a charge -- a non-recurring charge associated with the successful completion of our multi-year collective labor agreements at Cerro Verde in Peru. Strong cash flow generation again during the quarter, we generated $2.3 billion of operating cash flows. And for the year we generated $7.7 billion of operating cash flow, and that exceeded our capital spending of $2.1 billion for the year. As you saw in November of 2021, our board approved a new share purchase program, authorizing purchases of up to $3 billion of FCX common stock. Through January 25, we acquired 15.4 million shares at a total cost of $600 million and that was an average price of $39 per share. The board also approved in November, an increase in common stock dividends for 2022, effectively doubling our common stock dividend. And on December 22, we declared dividends totaling $0.15 per share that will be paid on February 1 of this year to shareholders of record as of January 14. Our balance sheet is strong. You'll see that in the results. The net debt at the end of the year, totaled $1.4 billion. And we had no borrowings under our $3.5 billion revolver. So we've got strong liquidity with $8 billion of cash at the end of 2021. I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard who'll be referring to our presentation materials on our website.\nRichard Adkerson: Thanks, Kathleen. And hello everyone. The end of 2021 is a special time for our Freeport team. We've met a series of multi-year complex challenges with great success. You start by looking at the debt picture, which Kathleen mentioned, just six years ago, our debt was a $20 billion, and the way to manage it was really unclear. We have now reached the point where our debt is de minimis. We have started a program of shareholder returns with higher dividends and share buybacks. We have assets in our outlook that will allow us to increase those over time. Our credit rating has been raised to investment grades by two of the agencies. Then you look at the Grasberg underground project, which goes back much further. We begin our initial plans for this underground operation in the mid-1990s. We began spending capital 20 years ago. By the end of the year, we met our target by reaching our metal long-term run rate. We are taking steps successfully and have the way forward to increase our mining rate to well over 200,000 tonnes per day from the underground that's just remarkable. During this period of ramping up Grasberg, we had challenges in our dealings with Indonesian government about our contract of work. We resolved those three years ago. And I'm pleased to report that our relationships with the government of Indonesia is one now cooperation, working together mutually for common goals. Relationships have never been better. Then two years ago, we started facing COVID. That was a huge uncertainty for us. At the time, we took aggressive steps to be prepared to manage the risks that were emerging. We've successfully managed our way through that and achieved our debt reduction Grasberg underground from that standpoint. ESG is on everybody's mind these days. It's always been part of our psyche at Freeport, because of the nature of operations that we've begun aggressive efforts to deal with climate change, impacts of our operations. We're working with the copper industry with this copper mark designation, which we have been a leader and working with ICMM with communities. I became Chairman about a year ago, I made commitments to myself to strengthen Freeport's board. This year, we've added six new directors for our well-known highly regarded CEOs with extensive international business experience who add a lot to our board. We have two women, we added that both our financial experts, experienced in audit committee dealings, one is proudly is an Hispanic. It's just been a great work by our team, we have a real sense of accomplishment. And we're really looking forward now to the future with optimism, commitment and excitement. Turning to our results, our copper volumes grew by 19% compared with the prior year, reflecting this ramp up in Indonesia. Our unit costs decline despite rising energy costs in other unit and other input cost. Our team's done a great job of managing the challenges of supply chain and cost inflation. We generate strong margins. Our EBITDA and cash flow rose by 2.5x over 2020. And we ended the year with just over $1 billion in net debt. And we're well prepared with our long live reserve and resource base to advance organic growth over time. Now with the ramp up at Grasberg reaching the point of where it is. We're now looking to our operations in the Americas for future growth. It's nice to talk about accomplishments, but we're all focused on what we go, where we go from here. How we build more value for our company. And we have a great opportunity to do that. Copper, over 20 years ago, our company made a commitment to copper and it was driven by a supply side constraints that we saw in the global marketplace, at that time growth in China. And we have fundamentally stuck with that. We -- our board made a diversion with this oil and gas deal, but that's behind us now. But the fundamental outlook for copper as positive as it was 20 years ago, is now even more positive and it becoming increasingly positive, it is driven by coppers role in the global economy, just fundamentally the need for copper and as the world develops, so that in China. China continues to be an important part of the market. Global growth will occur outside China. But the new elements of demand are really significant. Any investments in carbon reduction and everyone's talking about carbon reduction, require significantly more copper than then the world is required in the past. Electrification is the key to climate change. And two-third to three quarters of coppers use is dealt with electrification, whether it's electric vehicles, alternative energy generations, all of these require much more copper than the traditional power. Then you look beyond that to technology advances in communication is artificial intelligence. Expanding connectivity is infrastructure is developed around the world public health initiatives. All of these are creating what I'm calling a new era of copper demand. And these are broad based. They're inevitable. Copper will be affected by risk to the global economy from time-to-time. But underlying that is a long-term, very positive outlook for copper. And our company is solidly positioned to benefit from that. If you add that together with supply and scarcity and the demand factors, and you have a real compelling case for investing in our company. We're seeing increasing scarcity in supply, at a time when demand is growing so significantly. There are a limited number of projects, which have been under development for some time now that are scheduled to come on stream in the near-term. But when you look beyond that, it's hard to find actionable projects that are can be developed within a very short period of time. It just takes a long time. And then there's increasing political risk around the world that will have its impact on copper supply development. Notably in Chile and Peru, where 40% of the world's copper comes from, there's new President who run on agendas that are oriented towards social programs that require more revenues to implement and how the industry and the governments deal with that will be very important. But beyond that, you see this in countries like the United States, you see others countries restricting new supply development for community social issues. Countries around the world are demanding more of miners in terms of revenues that goes beyond Chile and Peru, ranging all the ways from Asia to Central America to Africa. All of these things add into supply constraints at a time when the world needs more copper. We're focused on the long-term outlook for our markets. We always prepare ourselves and recognize that near-term risk may emerge to the global economy. Now we're strong financially to deal with those risk. We structured our business in a way that we have flexibility to manage it, so we're much more comfortable today about whether our company is positioned to take advantage for what we believe will be a very positive view for copper as a commodity. If you look at our reserve base, the report reserves this year, based on mine plans of $2.50 copper. We don't limit ourselves to looking at projects on that basis, because we have an optimistic view about copper that we have a more than $2.50 copper, we have more than a 25 year reserve life approved in probable reserves. And beyond that in our incremental mineral resources, we have enormous amounts of copper that over time will be brought into reserves as we doing Asian drilling and engineering work that you bring those into reserves and up with the new projects. This is really a key asset for Freeport. It provides us a lot of options for the future. When you look at the scarcity in the industry for development opportunities. Report does not need to rely on acquisitions to support our long-term future. We always monitor opportunities, but we have the assets within our company and how to sustain our business in growing significantly over time. With these favorable markets, our margins and cash flows are growing. We have well established plans. Our whole team globally is focused on executing plans to produce more copper, produce it at a lower cost. We built a strong foundation for the future. We had significant sales increase in 2021 that growth factored in. For the near-term. There's no 13% in 2022 improving in 2023. We have the risk in our plans, expect growing margins and are really prepared to execute to generate the cash to support returns to shareholders as we invest in future growth. Looking at the slide now, now that shows the successful ramp up of the Grasberg in underground. I just wish you all had seen him, because I got a big smile on my face. When I look at this. It's really significant with what we've done there. Our team there is just really to be complimented. Meeting all these challenges. It's not -- was not to ensure of a monumental task. As I mentioned earlier, it was years to achieve this. The underground development. Turning to the next slide, over 350 miles of tunnels seven miles of an underground railroad with tea and electric trains running for huge crushers, five miles of conveyor belts, these shafts to take large numbers of people down underground. It's all underground, over 500 drawbells have been open, almost 350,000 meters of undercut. And we're really on track to achieve long-term sustainable rates of in excess of 200,000 tonnes a day from our mines through our mills. This gives us a very strong base of long-term, we've done this now to create return Grasberg to be the second largest copper mine in the world, the largest single gold mine even though it's a byproduct, look at it fourth quarter when we had our net cash costs in the face of all this inflation of only $0.08 per pound for the second largest copper mine in the world. We achieve long-term run rate of 1.6 billion pounds of copper a year, over 750,000 tonnes. All this looks simple on paper, but man it was a challenge to get it done and our team deserves a tremendous amount of credit for doing this. Now we look at where are we going to grow for the future? How are we going to sustain our business for the future? This new lease technologies that we're working in the Americas is a huge opportunity for Freeport. Our company historically was a leader in developing leaching. Our Morenci Mine in Arizona is the world's largest leaching operation in today's global copper market. And this technology that we will have to improve recoveries and achieve recoveries from historical waste stacks is creating copper that no one thought we had the opportunity to recover is really significant for us. Then we have our mine in Northwestern Arizona, the Bagdad mine which has a long reserve life, set up perfectly for mill expansions and to achieve greater volumes out of it in a relatively straightforward way. In Eastern Arizona, we have the Lone Star mine, which I truly believe someday will be the All Star Mine for Freeport, we're working in expanding recoveries from the oxide ore that is there, taking advantage of facilities that are nearby us, Safford mine, which is where production is declining, as planned. But underneath that the Lone Star mine has a sulfide resource that I really believe will make it be the All Star Mine for us. The project in Chile that the world will need we're waiting to see how things unfold there. And then this Kucing Liar mine that we have undeveloped at Grasberg is going to be an important part of our future there. This will be one of the world's largest Block Cave mines in its own way 80,000 tonnes a day. It's got resource of six billion pounds of copper, five million ounces of gold for 2041. We're talking with the government now with preliminarily about rights beyond that, and that mine will be producing well below 2041. Well, that's on stream, we are targeting getting up to 240,000 tonnes a day of mine rate, mill rate out of the operations Grasberg. There's a slide on Lone Star that I referred to earlier, you can see the data how we are increasing it, but the real there, the oxide development will be profitable at the volumes attractive cost. But the real long-term price there is this sulfide resource and underlies the oxide. It's very large, it take time to do it. But it'll have a complex we believe ultimately similar to the Morenci mine, which is the largest mine in North America. Now, this unique technology is something you'll hear a lot about from us, throughout the energy industry. We will be a leader here, we are looking at several different types of technologies. All of them are excited, Cory is leading our team here. And it's really a new element of demand just in our existing waste stacks. We have, we believe we have almost 40 billion pounds of copper in those stacks. And even small recoveries out of that could result in copper, that would be equivalent to developing a whole new mine. So it's early stage technology, lot of work to do, a lot of excitement by our team about doing this. So it's really good. I want to close by just recognizing our team around the world. I'm so proud to be part of this team. We got a group of people that are technically competent, that are highly motivated that work together cooperatively that are buying into making Freeport, the foremost copper company in the world and keeping it there. And we have the capabilities on hand to meet and exceed our expectations, exceptional opportunities for our business. And I want you to know that regardless of what you read out in London, I'm planning on staying part of this team for as long as God's willing to allow me to do it. I'm having more fun now than I've had in years. And I'm really excited to be part of this team as we go forward. So Kathleen, I will turn it to you.\nKathleen Quirk: All right, thank you Richard. And I'll just start on Slide 17 and make some comments on our operating and financial matters and then we can turn it over to your questions. We're providing some additional details on our fourth quarter operating activities on Slide 17. And as Richard said, the Lone Star mine, he has now renamed it is All Star Mine but it continues to perform above the design capacity, you'll recall we commissioned the mine in the second half of 2020. And last year, we produced 265 million pounds of copper. That was a 30% increase from the original design of 200 million pounds per year. We've incorporated now a further incremental expansion into our plants, which will take us up to 300 million pounds per year by 2023, with an investment of approximately $250 million. And as Richard mentioned, as we accelerate the mining of the upside ores, this will expose us to a larger sulfide opportunity. At Morenci, we're gaining momentum on our leach initiatives. We have substantial material that has already been placed on leach stockpiles, which provide an opportunity to increase our copper production at a low incremental costs and notably a low carbon footprint. We're applying new technologies and using data analytics and censoring to measure our success. And we're very encouraged by some early wins and are optimistic that there's much more to come. We started the effort at Morenci because of its significance, but the early wins at Morenci have allowed, the team at Morenci to share its findings across the portfolio. And this gives us a significant value opportunity for Freeport, and we hoped to report progress, ongoing progress to you as we go through the year. We also continue to ramp-up mining and milling rates at Morenci and we estimate that production from Morenci will be about 10% more copper in 2022 compared with 2021. In South America, our teams there doing great work to restore production to pre-pandemic levels. The 2021 sales from South America were about 8% higher than 2020 and we're projecting an additional increase in 2022. We continue to target a full restoration at Cerro Verde of its mill operations during this year. And we'll be on our way to getting back to a billion pounds per annum from this large scale operation. Our team at Cerro Verde continues to do outstanding work and managing the pandemic and had really a terrific fourth quarter. We were also successful in finalizing our multi-year labor agreements at Cerro Verde during 2021. At El Abra in Chile, we're making good progress and increasing our stacking rates of material on our leach pads there and we're also advancing construction of a new leach pad to accommodate the higher rates. We're expecting a 30% increase in 2022 production at El Abra off of a relatively low base. But we plan to sustain a level of 200 million to 250 million pounds per year for the next several years as we assess opportunities there for future growth. At Grasberg as Richard mentioned, the highlight of the year was really reaching our targeted net metal run rate in the fourth quarter. This was an enormous milestone of success for us. We're all proud of it. We're focused on sustaining this during 2022 and we'll have opportunities to increase our mill throughput rates in the second half of next year with the completion of our new SAG circuit which is under construction. Our team at Grasberg is as energetic as ever working to advance Kucing Liar and several other projects in the portfolio. Our next slide of Slide 18 is just an update on our progress to develop new smelting capacity in Indonesia to meet our commitments to the government. The site for the new smelter is starting to take shape as you can see from the photo on the slide. In the fourth quarter we completed the pile support for the flash furnace and are starting to pour concrete. We also completed agreements in the fourth quarter with our Japanese partner to expand the existing smelter at P.T. Smelting. We're focused on completing these projects as efficiently and timely as possible. We've been funding the cost of the smelter through a $1 billion bank credit facility that PT-FI secured and we're planning additional debt financing at PT-FI which can be obtained at attractive rates to complete the project. As indicated on the slide, the long-term cost of the financing for the smelter would be essentially offset by a phase out of the 5% export duty, so the economic impact is not material, we provide on Slide 19, a three year outlook for volumes and just we're pleased to report our execution is on track, we have some minor offsetting changes to our prior guidance for copper sales for 2022 and 2023 and now included our current outlook for 2024. After delivering a 19% increase in copper in 2021, we're projecting a 13% increase in 2022. And this includes higher production across the portfolio. We've got further growth planned for 2023 in our leasing plans and our sales for copper in 2022, we estimate about 36% will come from the U.S., 27% from South America, and about 37% from Grasberg. We're showing on Slide 20 how the quarterly volumes work out we're expecting grades will be lower in the first half at several of our sites in the Americas and that will be increasing throughout the year. You can see our gold sales are fairly steady and roughly 400,000 ounces per quarter during 2022. On Slide 21, we show a comparison of our net unit cash costs for 2021, and we roll that forward to 2022. And you can see that the costs are pretty similar between the years. For some time, our global team has been focused on cost management and efficiency projects to extend equipment lives, improve energy efficiencies, maintenance practices, and using technology to help us in all of this. This is serving us very well in the current environment. And we're also supported by is the great global supply chain team who's doing terrific work with our site operations management and through our partnerships with long-term suppliers to address our business needs. As you'll see on the slide, our estimated, consolidated year in cash costs for 2022 are expected to be very similar to 2021. We've got increases that we're experiencing in for input costs, including energy, sulfuric acid, we've got some higher labor and outside services costs for 2022 compared to 2021, and higher costs for materials and supplies, but that essentially is being offset by our higher volumes. We're going to continue to focus on cost management provide our operators with technology driven solutions to assist with the current cost pressures and inflationary environment. Richard mentioned the strong cash flows that we're generating, and we see that continuing in the future. On Slide 22, we show the significance of our cash flow using our volume and cost estimates and prices ranging from $4 to $5 copper, and holding gold flat at $1,800 per ounce and molybdenum at $19 per pound. We show modeled results excuse me using the average of 23 and 24 and you see here that annual EBITDA over this period would range from $12 billion per annum at $4 copper to over $16 billion per annum at $5 copper, and our operating cash flows would range from nearly $9 billion a year to $12 billion per year using these scenarios. As demonstrated in the last several quarters, we're generating significant free cash flow and this trend is expected to continue with cash flows significantly above our capital spending. Moving to capital spending, we show on Slide 23 our outlook for capital. For 2021, our capital expenditures, excluding the smelter costs totaled $1.9 billion and that was slightly below our guidance excluding the smelter of $2 billion. We're projecting capital of $3.3 billion in 2022 and $2.7 billion in 2023. The primary change from our guidance -- prior guidance for 2022 reflects the addition of the incremental Lone Star expansion, and our plans to advance the Circular project at Atlantic Copper. You'll also notice a large decrease in spend on the Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ beginning in 2023. And you've also seen here the discretionary projects that we're advancing to improve profitability and value as we go forward and about 20% of the capital for the next two years reflects recent value enhancing additions. And those are detailed more on Slide 24, where we have a summary of the discretionary capital, we've added to our plan since achieving our net debt targets last year and commenced our shareholder return policy. These projects all have solid financial returns, great operational benefits and again represent value enhancing investments using a portion of the 50% of free cash flow, we are earmarking for organic investments and balance sheet improvement. Our free cash flow generation is significant. And that's supported by growing volumes, positive markets and low capital requirements. You'll see on Slide 25, and Richard highlighted this, not only the last what we've done over the last several years, but just in 2021 alone, we reduced our net debt on nearly $5 billion and our EBITDA continues to grow. We're really in a fantastic position to execute our strategy, maintain a solid balance sheet and return substantial cash to shareholders. Our financial policy is summarized on Slide 26 is centered around a strong balance sheet and combined with the performance based payout policy that provides for up to 50% of free cash flow to be used for shareholder returns with the balance for growth and further balance sheet improvements. As you'll see on Slide 27, we commenced the implementation of the policy following our board's actions in November of last year. We purchased nearly $500 million in stock in the fourth quarter, and through January to-date, our purchases, cumulative purchases total $600 million. We're well on our way to using our $3 billion authorization. Our Board also approved a variable dividend for 2022 which essentially doubles our common stock dividend. The combination of the share purchase program, and our dividends are designed to distribute 50% of our cash flow, while maintaining the balance sheet in a super strong position and providing flexibility for our long-term investments. So in summary, I just want to echo what Richard said, we're well positioned for success in 2022 and beyond. Our team is passionate about execution. We've got momentum, and we look forward to building on the success. And operator will now like to turn the call back to you to start the Q&A session.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from the line of Emily Chieng from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nEmily Chieng: Good morning, Kathleen and thank you for the update this morning. My question is just around the Bagdad expansion. I believe in this slide. There is a comment around potential for construction to commence in 2023 with a potential 2026 turn out. That's could you talk about the progress you've made to date there and advancing sort of technical studies as well as any final hurdles to be met before project sanction and early indication of what CapEx could potentially look like for this CapEx?\nKathleen Quirk: Emily, we are starting feasibility of that project now. And we've been working on various scoping level studies over the past several years, as we've been discussing, but we are starting the feasibility study, and that will really define the final cost estimates. But we think it'll be efficient, because we've got a lot of infrastructure already there. We're adding a new concentrator that really take into account the efficiencies that we've gained that Bagdad existing concentrator in recent years. And once we go forward and get the feasibility studies done, we have a limited permitting process we believe and that's what gives us hope that that project could be in operation in 2026. The economics of it will be -- we believe will be positive in really advancing in an efficient matter -- manner the production that double the production there, because it is a very long reserve life approximating roughly 80 years. And so we're bringing that, looking to bring that value forward.\nEmily Chieng: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lawson Langer from Bank of America Securities.\nLawson Langer: Hello, good morning, Richard and Kathleen. Very nice to hear from you both and thank you for today's update. Maybe I can ask about the All Star Mine. Could you also -- could you update us in your thoughts in terms of what's driving the current outperformance? Is that just better recoveries or is there other aspects at play? And then when we think about the current Lone Star mine and your expansion to 300 million pounds. I mean, it's outperforming by 5% or 6%. So, how should we think about that 300 million pounds? Should we think about it in terms of being more like 318 million pounds to 320 million pounds? Thank you.\nKathleen Quirk: Josh, do you want to take that?\nRichard Adkerson: Yes, Josh, why don't you respond to it. Josh is our Chief Operating Officer for the Americas.\nJoshua Olmsted: Good morning. Yes, realistically if we look at Lone Star and what we've been able to achieve since we've started up. We really leveraged a lot of the learnings that we had seen from our exercises and experience at Bagdad with respect to identifying bottlenecks in the process, and leveraging the workforce through kind of an agile way of working. And as we've done that the team at Lone Star has been able to identify opportunities that really eliminated bottlenecks and allows us to work on incremental gains over time. And as we think about the next step in that. It was just a continuation of that same process in the sense of identifying what's limiting our ability to maximize the production of the site. And so the team has done a great job of going through that entire system, identifying what those bottlenecks are. And we put projects in place to really attack those bottlenecks and maximize where we're at. The 300 million pounds is probably at the limit of our current existing Hydromet facilities and the tank house capacity. So anything above and beyond that would be a bit of a challenge. But I'm not going to say that the team there isn't going to continue to look for opportunities to add additional incremental pounds. But I think that 300 million pound target that we're headed for is, is pretty close to that limit based on what we have today.\nLawson Langer: Yes, thanks very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Christopher LaFemina with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nChristopher LaFemina: Hi, thanks. Hi, Richard and Kathleen, thank you for taking my question.\nRichard Adkerson: Hi, Chris.\nChristopher LaFemina: So if we look at the progress that's report in the last five or six years, you've obviously overcome some really substantial challenges. And the company has -- you find yourself in a position of clear strength today. And you're kind of unleashing what is ultimately a massive organic growth pipeline with probably more growth than we even are aware of today, just because the resources are so substantial. And you talked today Richard about leaching technologies, as you mentioned last quarter as well, but you talked about this as a huge opportunity. And my question around that is, first of all, how much production potential could we see from these new leaching technologies? What's the timeframe? Is it in any good guidance yet? We're sort of operating costs, just like the economic benefit that you will realize from this leaching. And I guess the reason why I asked that question is because a lot of other major copper miners are talking about various new leaching technologies being substantial. And it really comes down to -- there's going to be an economic benefit due to having more volumes. But the question then is, what does it mean for overall global copper supply and demand? So how much when is it coming online, it is in your guidance and what sort of operating costs?\nKathleen Quirk: We do have a small amount of benefit factored into our guidance from some early successes at Morenci. But that's just a very small fraction of what we expect to get. We do have some, and this is unfolding, Chris. So it's going to be evolving as we go. But we've kind of internally said, let's go after trying to get 100 million pounds to 200 million pounds from this -- in the near-term. And so where we're looking to gradually improve where we are in 2022, and you'll be hearing more about it. But from a cost standpoint, if you think about where the incremental costs of this is. We've got much of this materials already in our leach stockpiles. So we've already expanded the funds to mine it, and it's in stock piles. And so it's a very low incremental cost to be able to recover it. So that's the opportunity for us, as we look at it having low incremental capital to go after it low incremental operating costs. We have latent tank house capacity, Josh mentioned. We're filling the tank house at Safford. But at all of our mines, we've got some tank house capacity that that we can fill, if we're able to get more recoveries. So economically, this is a real opportunity for us. But when you're talking about 100 million pounds to 200 million pounds, and we've got 38 billion pounds of material and stockpiles, that's a small amount, but it does have value to us. And we hope to go capture it. But in terms of this being a sea change for supply for the industry. We just don't -- we don't see it, it'll take time. And it'll come out over time. But it is, it's a meaningful value opportunity for us as a company given our set of circumstances with the large stockpiles in the latent tank house capacity. And Cory I don't know if you want to add anything to that. But that's where we are with it.\nCory Stevens: Thanks. No Kathleen, you covered it well.\nRichard Adkerson: Thank you. Cory Stevens, by the way is stepping up to lead our project development engineering and he is the key guy leading us on this -- in this deal. And Chris, in an earlier life back in the 80s, I was working in the oil and gas business when the shale business really got initially kicked off. And so this team here will tell you, I'm always looking around corners to say is there some kind of shale, oil and gas development it could change the industry like that did for the petroleum industry. And this is a huge opportunity for us, huge in the sense of being able to add value of significance. But in terms of being a shallow kind of sea change for the industry, as Kathleen called it. We think that's not in the guards.\nChristopher LaFemina: That's very helpful. Thank you, Richard.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas from Vertical Research. Your line is now open.\nMichael Dudas: Good morning, Richard, Kathleen.\nKathleen Quirk: Good morning.\nMichael Dudas: My questions around given the -- you highlighted that this coffee and supply growth that you see in the pipeline being somewhat thin. Can you may be characterized, like from where you thought a year ago, three or today. Given the political dynamics, especially in the two largest copper producing countries, and given your kind of positioning in much better jurisdiction. So it seems, is that going really be a delayed and further just in the next six to 12 months, as the industry kind of figures out how to best negotiate and deal with those new government's? And certainly, there could be some other opportunities over the next several quarters on those issues limiting. Even getting some of these much needed projects to get out in the marketplace by the end of this decade?\nRichard Adkerson: There's no question. I mean, you just look at our situation at our El Abra. We would be in a different situation with El Abra this what. It's a political issues about royalties and the fiscal regime for our copper production in Chile were different. We would be moving more aggressively right now with El Abra. What we're doing is we're preparing ourselves to move forward, but we're not we're deferring any decision to move forward until we get some clarity from the government in Chile. And so that's just one example. There's no question. It's affecting people. It's some have stability agreements. And the question is, the government's going to honor stability agreements. You've seen recently in other countries where miners have had to go back and change deals were they thought they had firm contractual agreements. We had to make some concessions in Indonesia to get our issue with the government resolve there, which we did in a favorable basis. But that's just reality around the world today.\nMichael Dudas: And if the U.S. look like it's a much better place to be relative to some of these other countries. Certainly your investment, what you're talking about today seems like you want to enhance and accelerate that in your asset profile?\nRichard Adkerson: Yes, well, in the U.S. I would make a distinction between Greenfield developments and brownfield developments. And all of our developments are Brownfield, it's places where we have established operations, and a solid track record of doing things in the right way. And we have developed a positive relationships with local communities and with governments, state, local governments, and with indigenous people. That's a different deal than trying to go in and developing a new mine, where there's not an existing mine, because mines inevitably significant mines have impacts on the physical environment where they operate on the local communities. There's competition for water resources. There's issues related to historical factors with indigenous people and all that make it much more complicated. You can tick off a list of projects in the U.S. that way. But there also international projects that face the same deal. So for us, the U.S. is particularly attractive, favorable tax situation, support for mines by communities. It's not true in other places in terms of having community, educational systems, health care systems. We were in other countries, we escalate and provide all that. So it's very attractive for us. We own all of our, virtually all of our lands in the U.S. and fee. So there's no royalties. And you think you look at the royalty rates that are being jacked up around the world, and that's a big difference. And then we have the company specific situation of having a significant net operating loss carry forward, maybe the only good. I'm trying to think was another, maybe the only good thing that came out on the oil and gas deal. We got a big NOL that protects us from taxes for years to come. Even though in U.S. we have lower tax rates, fundamentally than we do internationally. So for all those reasons, our established presence in the U.S. is really the big one that makes it so attractive to us.\nMichael Dudas: Appreciate that. Thank you, Richard.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Hacking with Citi. Your line is now open.\nAlex Hacking: Yes. Good morning, Richard and Kathleen, and thanks for the call. I just want to follow-up on a couple of the earlier questions. The CapEx for Bagdad, if that moves ahead. Would that be planned CapEx or discretionary? I assume it would be discretionary. And then just quickly on Lone Star. The increase in the production right, that you've achieved and it's been announced? Does that meaningfully pull forward the potential for the sulfide project by years or does it not really matter? Thanks.\nRichard Adkerson: No, well, Bagdad is totally discretionary. I mean, we could continue to operate the existing scale of business that we have there. If that were to make sense, I think what the markets we're facing and the opportunities that that poses, it's highly likely we'll do it, but it is discretionary. And we will update the market on plans as we make commitments to go forward, which I expect us to do. And the point about Lone Star is, you can just look back at the other major projects around the world where to get to the mineral resource you have to sometimes take years of investment in stripping to remove overburden to get down to the ore. Here, we have the benefit of mining the overburden, which is oxide ore profitably. And by doing that, we are stripping that material that is overlays the sulfide resource. So it is tremendously beneficial to the long-term development this opportunity. And as I said, we're going to make money out of this oxide. And at the end of the day, we're continuing drilling, continuing economic studies. But I see a future of building a major mill complex at Lone Star to process this very large sulfide resources we're talking about is 50 billion tonnes of ore.\nKathleen Quirk: And Alex, I think if you were asking about specifically Bagdad with respect to the financial policy, the answer is yes. In terms of how we will treat that 50% that we're retaining of free cash flow. We're earmarking for future investments and growth as well as to maintain our balance sheet. So that's how we're thinking about it.\nAlex Hacking: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Carlos De Alba from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nCarlos De Alba: Good morning, Rich and team. Just a question around cash costs for the year I guess for the first quarter, how should we -- could you provide a bit more color, I would have expected higher -- guidance for higher costs in the first quarter above and beyond the 135 per pound given the comment of lower grade suspected in the first half of the year. Are there other factors that will mitigate the negative implications on costs from the lower grade suspected in the first semester?\nKathleen Quirk: Yes, well and part of it too is waiting, waiting the low cost in Indonesia to the higher costs in the U.S. and South America. So that's why you're not seeing much fluctuation between the first quarter and the full-year.\nCarlos De Alba: Thank you, Kathleen.\nRichard Adkerson: You think about as Indonesia ramps up, fourth quarter was $0.08 a pound for the year it was on the order of less than $0.20, I don't know, $0.18, $0.19 per pound and we see costs going forward with higher volumes in that same range in Indonesia. So, it's a big factor in our business and our team has done a good job of controlling costs and we're like everybody else, we have our energy costs and other input costs are going up. So it's just what we have to deal with. But that was the whole basis for putting these companies together, back in 2007 was to match up the Indonesian assets, which is special because of its copper grades and its gold content with these lower grade mines in America, which are profitable but which have higher costs. And so that's just a carryover benefit for what we did so many years ago.\nCarlos De Alba: Thanks for the color, Richard.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Glick from JPMorgan.\nRichard Adkerson: Let me correct myself, I said 50 billion tonnes of ore at on start and 50 billion tonnes of copper resource.\nMichael Glick: Good morning, guys, just relative to your financial policy, could you remind us how often you'll revisit the variable portion of the policy on a practical basis?\nKathleen Quirk: Our board reviews it on a regular basis formally, it's at least annually, but it's something that we review with the board on an ongoing basis.\nMichael Glick: Okay, got it. Thank you.\nRichard Adkerson: You can see the example for that what we did in the third quarter, when we started the policy of paying variable dividend buying stock back a year ago, when we started looking at this, we had planned to do that at our first meeting in 2022. But we have made such progress, markets were so good, we advanced it. So just a little color on the way we run Freeport, we don't have an annual planning process. We update our long-term plans every quarter and we go through a really disciplined process to do that. So everything is real time. So while we talked about looking at this financial policy on an annual basis, as Kathleen says, we talk with our board about it continually. And if things change, we don't limit ourselves to acting on any kind of straight jacket timeframe.\nMichael Glick: Got it. Thank you. That's helpful color.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Abhi Agarwal from Deutsche Bank.\nAbhi Agarwal: Thanks, operator. Good morning, Richard and Kathleen. Thanks a lot for your presentation. Richard, you mentioned that you are in preliminary talks with the Indonesian government to extend the contract of work to beyond 2041. Can you share a bit more detail around what the critical path is for that agreement to be signed? Thank you.\nRichard Adkerson: Yes, we have preliminary talks, we really tried to address that years earlier. And it was just so complicated to get everything else done. It's in everybody's interest, all stakeholders interest for us to have a continuation of operations beyond 2041. It makes no sense for anybody for us to run this business with any kind of drop date. And so there's a broad acknowledgement that we need to do it. It's very preliminary, so I don't have the answers to your questions about how we structured, what we would mean. But I can say that these preliminary talks are being very well received. And there's a recognition that it's in everybody's interest for us to go beyond 2041.\nAbhi Agarwal: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Tumazos from John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC.\nJohn Tumazos: Thank you.\nRichard Adkerson: Hey, John.\nJohn Tumazos: First on Moly, recently as 2017-18, the output was 95 million pounds. And industry statistics are 5.4% decline in World Mine Output last year through November. So I guess a lot of the copper mines are having lower Moly grades, world steel and stainless steel outputs are rising. Do you have any opportunities to expand Moly throughput further to offset the lower grades at Cerro Verde or some of the other copper mines?\nKathleen Quirk: Well, John, we have two primary molybdenum mines in Colorado, the Climax mine and the Henderson mine and we did cut back production from those mines, when the market was in a different situation than it is today. But we do have the opportunity to expand production from our primary mines, particularly at Climax and we're doing some work now to advance some stripping activities, so that we do have more flexibility in the future to raise our primary molybdenum mine production to respond to this increased demand and limited supplies of Bolivia. So we do have a lot of optionality in our primary mine for molybdenum.\nJohn Tumazos: Thank you. Concerning the costs in Indonesia for smelting, you're reporting $0.24 for treatment charges and $0.20 for export duties. That I guess those are averages where some of the output is in country at Gresik and some of it is exported concentrates. If it were say half and half domestic versus export, would it be right to think of the costs of something like $0.18, when you export concentrates to Asia and $0.30 for the treatment costs at your own smelter. And then the export duties would be nothing if you treated them at your own smelter more than $0.20 for that portion, you're exporting maybe $0.40?\nRichard Adkerson: Yes, you're directionally right, John. And maybe we'll get back to you with some details, because I think some of the export numbers that you talked about are in the range of what we're doing it is $0.16 to $0.18. And we do pay this export duty while the cost for domestic processing at the smelter, will be much higher particularly when you provide for any kind of cost factor for the capital that will go into it, it will eliminate the export duty and so the net economic effect on PT-FI together with the fact that the cost of the smelter will be included in PT-FI's consolidated tax return. So any kind of cost to go through there will serve to reduce taxes. So the reduction in taxes not having to pay the export duty. In a broad sense offsets the economics to PT-FI buildings smelter.\nKathleen Quirk: Yes, so as we're thinking about it John, the capital costs, amortization over the long period of the smelter will essentially offset the duty. And then really, when you look at the operating costs, the cash operating costs of the smelter, it shouldn't be that much different than exporting than TCRCs, so that's kind of how we were thinking about the two elements.\nRichard Adkerson: And that was a point that I think, I just don't have the numbers in front of me, John, but I don't think the cost of processing at PT smelting is as high as you indicated, the current deal, and we're expanding that smelter by 30% too as part of this effort to achieve the goal of in country processing. But it's a very efficient smelter. We built it back in the mid-90s. And it's kind of its world class in terms of its cost management.\nJohn Tumazos: Thank you. So out of complicated details.\nRichard Adkerson: Yes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jatinder Goel from BNP Paribas Exane.\nJatinder Goel: Thank you, operator. Good morning, Richard and Kathleen and good afternoon for those in the other time zones. Question on your 2024 copper guidance, can you please indicate where which operations will drop volumes, there'll be a 300 million pounds drop year-in-year in 2024 and Grasberg is now flat. So which operations will see that drop? And is that just a one year blip or is that a continued trend just to understand because Grasberg will lose 150 million pounds in 2025, as well. But just trying to put that discretionary and growth CapEx in perspective with the guidance and what we can't see beyond 2024. Thank you.\nRichard Adkerson: I'll like Kathleen, maybe Josh, talk to that. But I just make a point that these mine clan projections are subject to constant adjustments for various reasons that and some of them results in some volumes going from one year to another, but they all reflect steps taken to maximize the long-term values of the mine, we don't run these mines to achieve any kind of targeted, predetermined targets for volumes. But as I said, we have a dynamic, real time planning process in our goals throughout all those planning process is how do we maximize the long-term NPV and the resources that we have. And so you will, you look back at our history, there's continuous shifting of volumes from one year to the next and specifically.\nKathleen Quirk: Specific to '23 versus '24, we do have some lower grades in some of the U.S. operations, notably at Morenci and some slightly lower grades at Cerro Verde from '23 to '24. But as we talked about earlier, we don't have anything in here for of any consequence for this leaching opportunity. And so we are all motivated to get additional volumes with low capital intensity from that leaching opportunity. And then we've got Bagdad coming in beyond that. And we've got a series of other opportunities as well. But that's, it's really some grade as Richard was talking about, we do have grades shifting from year-to-year and do have some lower grades in 2024 versus '23.\nJatinder Goel: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Terentiew from Stifel.\nAlex Terentiew: Hi, yes everybody. Thanks for taking my call. Just a couple of follow-ups to some questions already asked, first at that Kucing Liar in the Indonesian license discussions beyond 2041, is the pace of investment at that project dependent on those talks. And the second follow-up question if I may is on the Moly business. The price has obviously been quite strong the past year gone from about $12 to $19, can you give us any insight as to the demand outlook, I understand you guys have an opportunity, interesting opportunities to expand but anything you can say about demand outlook for the next one or two years?\nKathleen Quirk: On the KL, all of our economics will run on the basis of the 2041. So if we are successful in extending it, there's going to be a lot more reserves from KL and other orebodies that come in. But we've run the economics in our plans based on the 2041 date, and it's a very attractive project that Mark can talk to you more about this but we're really leveraging all the learnings that we gained from Deep MLZ and Grasberg Block Cave to continue our momentum in extending development and leverages off of all the infrastructure we have there. So it's really a good project on its own. And we'll just be even better if we're able to extend beyond the 2041.\nRichard Adkerson: Just one quick comment on that. With all these years of uncertainty related to our deal with Indonesian government now, the 2041, we've done in the fact that we had such resources already discovered to fill up our mill and so forth. We haven't done much exploratory type drilling in Grasberg district for some time now. And so that's one of the main factors that makes it desirable for all stakeholders would be for us to have a deal that goes beyond 2041, which would then allow us to undertake more delineation core drilling, our exploratory core drilling, just look at that schematic that we had on the orebodies that are there, and where they're located and where they've come from. And historically, it's just clear that that while we don't know yet, because we haven't drilled it, but the high likelihood is there's a lot more resources there that haven't yet been identified.\nAlex Terentiew: Okay, there's great, thanks, guys.\nKathleen Quirk: Mike Kendrick is on the line. And he can share with you some of our feelings about the outlook for demand from Moly.\nMichael Kendrick: Thanks, Kathleen. Well, a few thoughts on that is we're positive on the outlook for Moly over the next few years, you things like energy, whether it's traditional energy sources that require Moly bearing steels or if it's renewables are all very positive right now. Infrastructure development, all around the world uses Moly and is we've seen whether it's here, Europe, China, Asia, all very positive indicators and pollution control in general uses a lot of stainless steel. And there again, we're seeing very positive indicators. Our customer base, both in Europe, United States have positive outlooks over the next few years. And then if you look at the Chinese five year plan, there's definitely an up scaling of materials that they're using throughout their economy and what they're emphasizing. So we're relatively optimistic on demand.\nAlex Terentiew: That's great. Thank you.\nMichael Kendrick: Thanks, Mike.\nMichael Kendrick: You bet.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley.\nCarlos De Alba: Thank you very much for squeezing me in for the second time. Just on working capital, if I maybe Kathleen, the sensitivity on a number you provide guidance on international operations is around $8 billion this year, and that is made of $1.3 billion working capital and other uses. So I don't know exactly how much is working capital, but assuming that is the majority of the $1.3 billion, could you give us some color on that, I mean that's a bigger number for working capital than I was expecting?\nKathleen Quirk: Yes, and you saw we had a benefit, a large benefit during 2021. A big portion of that is the timing of our tax payments internationally. You generally paying on the prior-year schedule. And so there's some timing variances when you have rising volumes or rising profitability. And so that's just the timing of tax payments.\nCarlos De Alba: Got it, thank you very much.\nOperator: Now, let's go over to management for any closing remarks.\nRichard Adkerson: Yes, thank you all for participating in the call today. It is real pleasure to be able to report great progress our team is making and we look forward to continuing that progress and are really excited about what lies ahead for us. So thank you for your interest and if you have any further questions or need for follow-up, please contact David Joint and we will respond to you. Have a good day everyone.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kathleen Quirk",
            "content": "Thank you and good morning. Welcome to the Freeport McMoran conference call. Earlier this morning we reported our fourth quarter and year-end 2021 operating and financial results and a copy of today's press release and slides are available on our website at FCX.com. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin today's comments, we'd like to remind everyone that our press release and certain of our comments on today's call include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings. On the call with me today are Richard Adkerson, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Johnson, who heads up our Indonesian Operations; Josh Olmsted, who heads up our Americas Business; Mike Kendrick, who leads Molybdenum business; we've also have Rick Coleman and Cory Stevens, who support our team with engineering and construction, technical services and support for our growth projects; and Steve Higgins, our Chief Administrative Officer. I'll start by briefly summarizing our financial results, and then I'll turn over the call to Richard who'll review the slide materials on our -- in our presentation. And I'll make some comments, and then we'll open up the call for questions. Today, FCX reported fourth quarter 2021 net income attributable to common stock of $1.1 billion or $0.74 per share, and adjusted net income after excluding net charges totaling $0.3 billion or $0.21 per share was $1.4 billion or $0.96 per share for the quarter. For the year ended 2021, our net income attributable to common stock totaled $4.3 billion, $2.90 per share, and adjusted net income totaled $4.6 billion or $3.13 per share. We have a reconciliation of our adjusted net income on VII in as part of today's release. Our adjusted earnings before interest taxes and depreciation for the fourth quarter totaled $3.2 billion and for the year totaled $10.9 billion. We've got a reconciliation of our EBITDA calculations on Page 43 of our presentation materials. Our team delivered great volume growth during the year, our copper sales of over a billion pounds during the fourth quarter, approximated our guidance going into the period. And for the year we sold 3.8 billion pounds of copper that was a 19% increase from 2020. Our fourth quarter 2021 gold sales of 395,000 ounces or about 5% above our guidance went into the quarter. And that reflected higher throughput rates in Indonesia. Our annual gold sales totaled 1.4 million ounces for the year and were 59% above the 2020 total. We benefited during the quarter from positive pricing for copper. Our average realized price of $4.42 per pound in the fourth quarter was more than $1 per pound higher than the fourth quarter of 2020. Our realized gold price of $1,808 per ounce was slightly below the year-ago quarter. And our results also benefited from improved molybdenum prices, our realization in the fourth quarter of 2021 of over $19 per pound was almost double the year-ago periods realization. Unit net cash costs during the fourth quarter averaged $1.29 per pound of copper. That was slightly above our estimate of $1.26 going into the quarter, but that reflected a charge -- a non-recurring charge associated with the successful completion of our multi-year collective labor agreements at Cerro Verde in Peru. Strong cash flow generation again during the quarter, we generated $2.3 billion of operating cash flows. And for the year we generated $7.7 billion of operating cash flow, and that exceeded our capital spending of $2.1 billion for the year. As you saw in November of 2021, our board approved a new share purchase program, authorizing purchases of up to $3 billion of FCX common stock. Through January 25, we acquired 15.4 million shares at a total cost of $600 million and that was an average price of $39 per share. The board also approved in November, an increase in common stock dividends for 2022, effectively doubling our common stock dividend. And on December 22, we declared dividends totaling $0.15 per share that will be paid on February 1 of this year to shareholders of record as of January 14. Our balance sheet is strong. You'll see that in the results. The net debt at the end of the year, totaled $1.4 billion. And we had no borrowings under our $3.5 billion revolver. So we've got strong liquidity with $8 billion of cash at the end of 2021. I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard who'll be referring to our presentation materials on our website. All right, thank you Richard. And I'll just start on Slide 17 and make some comments on our operating and financial matters and then we can turn it over to your questions. We're providing some additional details on our fourth quarter operating activities on Slide 17. And as Richard said, the Lone Star mine, he has now renamed it is All Star Mine but it continues to perform above the design capacity, you'll recall we commissioned the mine in the second half of 2020. And last year, we produced 265 million pounds of copper. That was a 30% increase from the original design of 200 million pounds per year. We've incorporated now a further incremental expansion into our plants, which will take us up to 300 million pounds per year by 2023, with an investment of approximately $250 million. And as Richard mentioned, as we accelerate the mining of the upside ores, this will expose us to a larger sulfide opportunity. At Morenci, we're gaining momentum on our leach initiatives. We have substantial material that has already been placed on leach stockpiles, which provide an opportunity to increase our copper production at a low incremental costs and notably a low carbon footprint. We're applying new technologies and using data analytics and censoring to measure our success. And we're very encouraged by some early wins and are optimistic that there's much more to come. We started the effort at Morenci because of its significance, but the early wins at Morenci have allowed, the team at Morenci to share its findings across the portfolio. And this gives us a significant value opportunity for Freeport, and we hoped to report progress, ongoing progress to you as we go through the year. We also continue to ramp-up mining and milling rates at Morenci and we estimate that production from Morenci will be about 10% more copper in 2022 compared with 2021. In South America, our teams there doing great work to restore production to pre-pandemic levels. The 2021 sales from South America were about 8% higher than 2020 and we're projecting an additional increase in 2022. We continue to target a full restoration at Cerro Verde of its mill operations during this year. And we'll be on our way to getting back to a billion pounds per annum from this large scale operation. Our team at Cerro Verde continues to do outstanding work and managing the pandemic and had really a terrific fourth quarter. We were also successful in finalizing our multi-year labor agreements at Cerro Verde during 2021. At El Abra in Chile, we're making good progress and increasing our stacking rates of material on our leach pads there and we're also advancing construction of a new leach pad to accommodate the higher rates. We're expecting a 30% increase in 2022 production at El Abra off of a relatively low base. But we plan to sustain a level of 200 million to 250 million pounds per year for the next several years as we assess opportunities there for future growth. At Grasberg as Richard mentioned, the highlight of the year was really reaching our targeted net metal run rate in the fourth quarter. This was an enormous milestone of success for us. We're all proud of it. We're focused on sustaining this during 2022 and we'll have opportunities to increase our mill throughput rates in the second half of next year with the completion of our new SAG circuit which is under construction. Our team at Grasberg is as energetic as ever working to advance Kucing Liar and several other projects in the portfolio. Our next slide of Slide 18 is just an update on our progress to develop new smelting capacity in Indonesia to meet our commitments to the government. The site for the new smelter is starting to take shape as you can see from the photo on the slide. In the fourth quarter we completed the pile support for the flash furnace and are starting to pour concrete. We also completed agreements in the fourth quarter with our Japanese partner to expand the existing smelter at P.T. Smelting. We're focused on completing these projects as efficiently and timely as possible. We've been funding the cost of the smelter through a $1 billion bank credit facility that PT-FI secured and we're planning additional debt financing at PT-FI which can be obtained at attractive rates to complete the project. As indicated on the slide, the long-term cost of the financing for the smelter would be essentially offset by a phase out of the 5% export duty, so the economic impact is not material, we provide on Slide 19, a three year outlook for volumes and just we're pleased to report our execution is on track, we have some minor offsetting changes to our prior guidance for copper sales for 2022 and 2023 and now included our current outlook for 2024. After delivering a 19% increase in copper in 2021, we're projecting a 13% increase in 2022. And this includes higher production across the portfolio. We've got further growth planned for 2023 in our leasing plans and our sales for copper in 2022, we estimate about 36% will come from the U.S., 27% from South America, and about 37% from Grasberg. We're showing on Slide 20 how the quarterly volumes work out we're expecting grades will be lower in the first half at several of our sites in the Americas and that will be increasing throughout the year. You can see our gold sales are fairly steady and roughly 400,000 ounces per quarter during 2022. On Slide 21, we show a comparison of our net unit cash costs for 2021, and we roll that forward to 2022. And you can see that the costs are pretty similar between the years. For some time, our global team has been focused on cost management and efficiency projects to extend equipment lives, improve energy efficiencies, maintenance practices, and using technology to help us in all of this. This is serving us very well in the current environment. And we're also supported by is the great global supply chain team who's doing terrific work with our site operations management and through our partnerships with long-term suppliers to address our business needs. As you'll see on the slide, our estimated, consolidated year in cash costs for 2022 are expected to be very similar to 2021. We've got increases that we're experiencing in for input costs, including energy, sulfuric acid, we've got some higher labor and outside services costs for 2022 compared to 2021, and higher costs for materials and supplies, but that essentially is being offset by our higher volumes. We're going to continue to focus on cost management provide our operators with technology driven solutions to assist with the current cost pressures and inflationary environment. Richard mentioned the strong cash flows that we're generating, and we see that continuing in the future. On Slide 22, we show the significance of our cash flow using our volume and cost estimates and prices ranging from $4 to $5 copper, and holding gold flat at $1,800 per ounce and molybdenum at $19 per pound. We show modeled results excuse me using the average of 23 and 24 and you see here that annual EBITDA over this period would range from $12 billion per annum at $4 copper to over $16 billion per annum at $5 copper, and our operating cash flows would range from nearly $9 billion a year to $12 billion per year using these scenarios. As demonstrated in the last several quarters, we're generating significant free cash flow and this trend is expected to continue with cash flows significantly above our capital spending. Moving to capital spending, we show on Slide 23 our outlook for capital. For 2021, our capital expenditures, excluding the smelter costs totaled $1.9 billion and that was slightly below our guidance excluding the smelter of $2 billion. We're projecting capital of $3.3 billion in 2022 and $2.7 billion in 2023. The primary change from our guidance -- prior guidance for 2022 reflects the addition of the incremental Lone Star expansion, and our plans to advance the Circular project at Atlantic Copper. You'll also notice a large decrease in spend on the Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ beginning in 2023. And you've also seen here the discretionary projects that we're advancing to improve profitability and value as we go forward and about 20% of the capital for the next two years reflects recent value enhancing additions. And those are detailed more on Slide 24, where we have a summary of the discretionary capital, we've added to our plan since achieving our net debt targets last year and commenced our shareholder return policy. These projects all have solid financial returns, great operational benefits and again represent value enhancing investments using a portion of the 50% of free cash flow, we are earmarking for organic investments and balance sheet improvement. Our free cash flow generation is significant. And that's supported by growing volumes, positive markets and low capital requirements. You'll see on Slide 25, and Richard highlighted this, not only the last what we've done over the last several years, but just in 2021 alone, we reduced our net debt on nearly $5 billion and our EBITDA continues to grow. We're really in a fantastic position to execute our strategy, maintain a solid balance sheet and return substantial cash to shareholders. Our financial policy is summarized on Slide 26 is centered around a strong balance sheet and combined with the performance based payout policy that provides for up to 50% of free cash flow to be used for shareholder returns with the balance for growth and further balance sheet improvements. As you'll see on Slide 27, we commenced the implementation of the policy following our board's actions in November of last year. We purchased nearly $500 million in stock in the fourth quarter, and through January to-date, our purchases, cumulative purchases total $600 million. We're well on our way to using our $3 billion authorization. Our Board also approved a variable dividend for 2022 which essentially doubles our common stock dividend. The combination of the share purchase program, and our dividends are designed to distribute 50% of our cash flow, while maintaining the balance sheet in a super strong position and providing flexibility for our long-term investments. So in summary, I just want to echo what Richard said, we're well positioned for success in 2022 and beyond. Our team is passionate about execution. We've got momentum, and we look forward to building on the success. And operator will now like to turn the call back to you to start the Q&A session. Emily, we are starting feasibility of that project now. And we've been working on various scoping level studies over the past several years, as we've been discussing, but we are starting the feasibility study, and that will really define the final cost estimates. But we think it'll be efficient, because we've got a lot of infrastructure already there. We're adding a new concentrator that really take into account the efficiencies that we've gained that Bagdad existing concentrator in recent years. And once we go forward and get the feasibility studies done, we have a limited permitting process we believe and that's what gives us hope that that project could be in operation in 2026. The economics of it will be -- we believe will be positive in really advancing in an efficient matter -- manner the production that double the production there, because it is a very long reserve life approximating roughly 80 years. And so we're bringing that, looking to bring that value forward. Josh, do you want to take that? We do have a small amount of benefit factored into our guidance from some early successes at Morenci. But that's just a very small fraction of what we expect to get. We do have some, and this is unfolding, Chris. So it's going to be evolving as we go. But we've kind of internally said, let's go after trying to get 100 million pounds to 200 million pounds from this -- in the near-term. And so where we're looking to gradually improve where we are in 2022, and you'll be hearing more about it. But from a cost standpoint, if you think about where the incremental costs of this is. We've got much of this materials already in our leach stockpiles. So we've already expanded the funds to mine it, and it's in stock piles. And so it's a very low incremental cost to be able to recover it. So that's the opportunity for us, as we look at it having low incremental capital to go after it low incremental operating costs. We have latent tank house capacity, Josh mentioned. We're filling the tank house at Safford. But at all of our mines, we've got some tank house capacity that that we can fill, if we're able to get more recoveries. So economically, this is a real opportunity for us. But when you're talking about 100 million pounds to 200 million pounds, and we've got 38 billion pounds of material and stockpiles, that's a small amount, but it does have value to us. And we hope to go capture it. But in terms of this being a sea change for supply for the industry. We just don't -- we don't see it, it'll take time. And it'll come out over time. But it is, it's a meaningful value opportunity for us as a company given our set of circumstances with the large stockpiles in the latent tank house capacity. And Cory I don't know if you want to add anything to that. But that's where we are with it. Good morning. And Alex, I think if you were asking about specifically Bagdad with respect to the financial policy, the answer is yes. In terms of how we will treat that 50% that we're retaining of free cash flow. We're earmarking for future investments and growth as well as to maintain our balance sheet. So that's how we're thinking about it. Yes, well and part of it too is waiting, waiting the low cost in Indonesia to the higher costs in the U.S. and South America. So that's why you're not seeing much fluctuation between the first quarter and the full-year. Our board reviews it on a regular basis formally, it's at least annually, but it's something that we review with the board on an ongoing basis. Well, John, we have two primary molybdenum mines in Colorado, the Climax mine and the Henderson mine and we did cut back production from those mines, when the market was in a different situation than it is today. But we do have the opportunity to expand production from our primary mines, particularly at Climax and we're doing some work now to advance some stripping activities, so that we do have more flexibility in the future to raise our primary molybdenum mine production to respond to this increased demand and limited supplies of Bolivia. So we do have a lot of optionality in our primary mine for molybdenum. Yes, so as we're thinking about it John, the capital costs, amortization over the long period of the smelter will essentially offset the duty. And then really, when you look at the operating costs, the cash operating costs of the smelter, it shouldn't be that much different than exporting than TCRCs, so that's kind of how we were thinking about the two elements. Specific to '23 versus '24, we do have some lower grades in some of the U.S. operations, notably at Morenci and some slightly lower grades at Cerro Verde from '23 to '24. But as we talked about earlier, we don't have anything in here for of any consequence for this leaching opportunity. And so we are all motivated to get additional volumes with low capital intensity from that leaching opportunity. And then we've got Bagdad coming in beyond that. And we've got a series of other opportunities as well. But that's, it's really some grade as Richard was talking about, we do have grades shifting from year-to-year and do have some lower grades in 2024 versus '23. On the KL, all of our economics will run on the basis of the 2041. So if we are successful in extending it, there's going to be a lot more reserves from KL and other orebodies that come in. But we've run the economics in our plans based on the 2041 date, and it's a very attractive project that Mark can talk to you more about this but we're really leveraging all the learnings that we gained from Deep MLZ and Grasberg Block Cave to continue our momentum in extending development and leverages off of all the infrastructure we have there. So it's really a good project on its own. And we'll just be even better if we're able to extend beyond the 2041. Mike Kendrick is on the line. And he can share with you some of our feelings about the outlook for demand from Moly. Yes, and you saw we had a benefit, a large benefit during 2021. A big portion of that is the timing of our tax payments internationally. You generally paying on the prior-year schedule. And so there's some timing variances when you have rising volumes or rising profitability. And so that's just the timing of tax payments."

            "name": "Richard Adkerson",
            "content": "Thanks, Kathleen. And hello everyone. The end of 2021 is a special time for our Freeport team. We've met a series of multi-year complex challenges with great success. You start by looking at the debt picture, which Kathleen mentioned, just six years ago, our debt was a $20 billion, and the way to manage it was really unclear. We have now reached the point where our debt is de minimis. We have started a program of shareholder returns with higher dividends and share buybacks. We have assets in our outlook that will allow us to increase those over time. Our credit rating has been raised to investment grades by two of the agencies. Then you look at the Grasberg underground project, which goes back much further. We begin our initial plans for this underground operation in the mid-1990s. We began spending capital 20 years ago. By the end of the year, we met our target by reaching our metal long-term run rate. We are taking steps successfully and have the way forward to increase our mining rate to well over 200,000 tonnes per day from the underground that's just remarkable. During this period of ramping up Grasberg, we had challenges in our dealings with Indonesian government about our contract of work. We resolved those three years ago. And I'm pleased to report that our relationships with the government of Indonesia is one now cooperation, working together mutually for common goals. Relationships have never been better. Then two years ago, we started facing COVID. That was a huge uncertainty for us. At the time, we took aggressive steps to be prepared to manage the risks that were emerging. We've successfully managed our way through that and achieved our debt reduction Grasberg underground from that standpoint. ESG is on everybody's mind these days. It's always been part of our psyche at Freeport, because of the nature of operations that we've begun aggressive efforts to deal with climate change, impacts of our operations. We're working with the copper industry with this copper mark designation, which we have been a leader and working with ICMM with communities. I became Chairman about a year ago, I made commitments to myself to strengthen Freeport's board. This year, we've added six new directors for our well-known highly regarded CEOs with extensive international business experience who add a lot to our board. We have two women, we added that both our financial experts, experienced in audit committee dealings, one is proudly is an Hispanic. It's just been a great work by our team, we have a real sense of accomplishment. And we're really looking forward now to the future with optimism, commitment and excitement. Turning to our results, our copper volumes grew by 19% compared with the prior year, reflecting this ramp up in Indonesia. Our unit costs decline despite rising energy costs in other unit and other input cost. Our team's done a great job of managing the challenges of supply chain and cost inflation. We generate strong margins. Our EBITDA and cash flow rose by 2.5x over 2020. And we ended the year with just over $1 billion in net debt. And we're well prepared with our long live reserve and resource base to advance organic growth over time. Now with the ramp up at Grasberg reaching the point of where it is. We're now looking to our operations in the Americas for future growth. It's nice to talk about accomplishments, but we're all focused on what we go, where we go from here. How we build more value for our company. And we have a great opportunity to do that. Copper, over 20 years ago, our company made a commitment to copper and it was driven by a supply side constraints that we saw in the global marketplace, at that time growth in China. And we have fundamentally stuck with that. We -- our board made a diversion with this oil and gas deal, but that's behind us now. But the fundamental outlook for copper as positive as it was 20 years ago, is now even more positive and it becoming increasingly positive, it is driven by coppers role in the global economy, just fundamentally the need for copper and as the world develops, so that in China. China continues to be an important part of the market. Global growth will occur outside China. But the new elements of demand are really significant. Any investments in carbon reduction and everyone's talking about carbon reduction, require significantly more copper than then the world is required in the past. Electrification is the key to climate change. And two-third to three quarters of coppers use is dealt with electrification, whether it's electric vehicles, alternative energy generations, all of these require much more copper than the traditional power. Then you look beyond that to technology advances in communication is artificial intelligence. Expanding connectivity is infrastructure is developed around the world public health initiatives. All of these are creating what I'm calling a new era of copper demand. And these are broad based. They're inevitable. Copper will be affected by risk to the global economy from time-to-time. But underlying that is a long-term, very positive outlook for copper. And our company is solidly positioned to benefit from that. If you add that together with supply and scarcity and the demand factors, and you have a real compelling case for investing in our company. We're seeing increasing scarcity in supply, at a time when demand is growing so significantly. There are a limited number of projects, which have been under development for some time now that are scheduled to come on stream in the near-term. But when you look beyond that, it's hard to find actionable projects that are can be developed within a very short period of time. It just takes a long time. And then there's increasing political risk around the world that will have its impact on copper supply development. Notably in Chile and Peru, where 40% of the world's copper comes from, there's new President who run on agendas that are oriented towards social programs that require more revenues to implement and how the industry and the governments deal with that will be very important. But beyond that, you see this in countries like the United States, you see others countries restricting new supply development for community social issues. Countries around the world are demanding more of miners in terms of revenues that goes beyond Chile and Peru, ranging all the ways from Asia to Central America to Africa. All of these things add into supply constraints at a time when the world needs more copper. We're focused on the long-term outlook for our markets. We always prepare ourselves and recognize that near-term risk may emerge to the global economy. Now we're strong financially to deal with those risk. We structured our business in a way that we have flexibility to manage it, so we're much more comfortable today about whether our company is positioned to take advantage for what we believe will be a very positive view for copper as a commodity. If you look at our reserve base, the report reserves this year, based on mine plans of $2.50 copper. We don't limit ourselves to looking at projects on that basis, because we have an optimistic view about copper that we have a more than $2.50 copper, we have more than a 25 year reserve life approved in probable reserves. And beyond that in our incremental mineral resources, we have enormous amounts of copper that over time will be brought into reserves as we doing Asian drilling and engineering work that you bring those into reserves and up with the new projects. This is really a key asset for Freeport. It provides us a lot of options for the future. When you look at the scarcity in the industry for development opportunities. Report does not need to rely on acquisitions to support our long-term future. We always monitor opportunities, but we have the assets within our company and how to sustain our business in growing significantly over time. With these favorable markets, our margins and cash flows are growing. We have well established plans. Our whole team globally is focused on executing plans to produce more copper, produce it at a lower cost. We built a strong foundation for the future. We had significant sales increase in 2021 that growth factored in. For the near-term. There's no 13% in 2022 improving in 2023. We have the risk in our plans, expect growing margins and are really prepared to execute to generate the cash to support returns to shareholders as we invest in future growth. Looking at the slide now, now that shows the successful ramp up of the Grasberg in underground. I just wish you all had seen him, because I got a big smile on my face. When I look at this. It's really significant with what we've done there. Our team there is just really to be complimented. Meeting all these challenges. It's not -- was not to ensure of a monumental task. As I mentioned earlier, it was years to achieve this. The underground development. Turning to the next slide, over 350 miles of tunnels seven miles of an underground railroad with tea and electric trains running for huge crushers, five miles of conveyor belts, these shafts to take large numbers of people down underground. It's all underground, over 500 drawbells have been open, almost 350,000 meters of undercut. And we're really on track to achieve long-term sustainable rates of in excess of 200,000 tonnes a day from our mines through our mills. This gives us a very strong base of long-term, we've done this now to create return Grasberg to be the second largest copper mine in the world, the largest single gold mine even though it's a byproduct, look at it fourth quarter when we had our net cash costs in the face of all this inflation of only $0.08 per pound for the second largest copper mine in the world. We achieve long-term run rate of 1.6 billion pounds of copper a year, over 750,000 tonnes. All this looks simple on paper, but man it was a challenge to get it done and our team deserves a tremendous amount of credit for doing this. Now we look at where are we going to grow for the future? How are we going to sustain our business for the future? This new lease technologies that we're working in the Americas is a huge opportunity for Freeport. Our company historically was a leader in developing leaching. Our Morenci Mine in Arizona is the world's largest leaching operation in today's global copper market. And this technology that we will have to improve recoveries and achieve recoveries from historical waste stacks is creating copper that no one thought we had the opportunity to recover is really significant for us. Then we have our mine in Northwestern Arizona, the Bagdad mine which has a long reserve life, set up perfectly for mill expansions and to achieve greater volumes out of it in a relatively straightforward way. In Eastern Arizona, we have the Lone Star mine, which I truly believe someday will be the All Star Mine for Freeport, we're working in expanding recoveries from the oxide ore that is there, taking advantage of facilities that are nearby us, Safford mine, which is where production is declining, as planned. But underneath that the Lone Star mine has a sulfide resource that I really believe will make it be the All Star Mine for us. The project in Chile that the world will need we're waiting to see how things unfold there. And then this Kucing Liar mine that we have undeveloped at Grasberg is going to be an important part of our future there. This will be one of the world's largest Block Cave mines in its own way 80,000 tonnes a day. It's got resource of six billion pounds of copper, five million ounces of gold for 2041. We're talking with the government now with preliminarily about rights beyond that, and that mine will be producing well below 2041. Well, that's on stream, we are targeting getting up to 240,000 tonnes a day of mine rate, mill rate out of the operations Grasberg. There's a slide on Lone Star that I referred to earlier, you can see the data how we are increasing it, but the real there, the oxide development will be profitable at the volumes attractive cost. But the real long-term price there is this sulfide resource and underlies the oxide. It's very large, it take time to do it. But it'll have a complex we believe ultimately similar to the Morenci mine, which is the largest mine in North America. Now, this unique technology is something you'll hear a lot about from us, throughout the energy industry. We will be a leader here, we are looking at several different types of technologies. All of them are excited, Cory is leading our team here. And it's really a new element of demand just in our existing waste stacks. We have, we believe we have almost 40 billion pounds of copper in those stacks. And even small recoveries out of that could result in copper, that would be equivalent to developing a whole new mine. So it's early stage technology, lot of work to do, a lot of excitement by our team about doing this. So it's really good. I want to close by just recognizing our team around the world. I'm so proud to be part of this team. We got a group of people that are technically competent, that are highly motivated that work together cooperatively that are buying into making Freeport, the foremost copper company in the world and keeping it there. And we have the capabilities on hand to meet and exceed our expectations, exceptional opportunities for our business. And I want you to know that regardless of what you read out in London, I'm planning on staying part of this team for as long as God's willing to allow me to do it. I'm having more fun now than I've had in years. And I'm really excited to be part of this team as we go forward. So Kathleen, I will turn it to you. Yes, Josh, why don't you respond to it. Josh is our Chief Operating Officer for the Americas. Hi, Chris. Thank you. Cory Stevens, by the way is stepping up to lead our project development engineering and he is the key guy leading us on this -- in this deal. And Chris, in an earlier life back in the 80s, I was working in the oil and gas business when the shale business really got initially kicked off. And so this team here will tell you, I'm always looking around corners to say is there some kind of shale, oil and gas development it could change the industry like that did for the petroleum industry. And this is a huge opportunity for us, huge in the sense of being able to add value of significance. But in terms of being a shallow kind of sea change for the industry, as Kathleen called it. We think that's not in the guards. There's no question. I mean, you just look at our situation at our El Abra. We would be in a different situation with El Abra this what. It's a political issues about royalties and the fiscal regime for our copper production in Chile were different. We would be moving more aggressively right now with El Abra. What we're doing is we're preparing ourselves to move forward, but we're not we're deferring any decision to move forward until we get some clarity from the government in Chile. And so that's just one example. There's no question. It's affecting people. It's some have stability agreements. And the question is, the government's going to honor stability agreements. You've seen recently in other countries where miners have had to go back and change deals were they thought they had firm contractual agreements. We had to make some concessions in Indonesia to get our issue with the government resolve there, which we did in a favorable basis. But that's just reality around the world today. Yes, well, in the U.S. I would make a distinction between Greenfield developments and brownfield developments. And all of our developments are Brownfield, it's places where we have established operations, and a solid track record of doing things in the right way. And we have developed a positive relationships with local communities and with governments, state, local governments, and with indigenous people. That's a different deal than trying to go in and developing a new mine, where there's not an existing mine, because mines inevitably significant mines have impacts on the physical environment where they operate on the local communities. There's competition for water resources. There's issues related to historical factors with indigenous people and all that make it much more complicated. You can tick off a list of projects in the U.S. that way. But there also international projects that face the same deal. So for us, the U.S. is particularly attractive, favorable tax situation, support for mines by communities. It's not true in other places in terms of having community, educational systems, health care systems. We were in other countries, we escalate and provide all that. So it's very attractive for us. We own all of our, virtually all of our lands in the U.S. and fee. So there's no royalties. And you think you look at the royalty rates that are being jacked up around the world, and that's a big difference. And then we have the company specific situation of having a significant net operating loss carry forward, maybe the only good. I'm trying to think was another, maybe the only good thing that came out on the oil and gas deal. We got a big NOL that protects us from taxes for years to come. Even though in U.S. we have lower tax rates, fundamentally than we do internationally. So for all those reasons, our established presence in the U.S. is really the big one that makes it so attractive to us. No, well, Bagdad is totally discretionary. I mean, we could continue to operate the existing scale of business that we have there. If that were to make sense, I think what the markets we're facing and the opportunities that that poses, it's highly likely we'll do it, but it is discretionary. And we will update the market on plans as we make commitments to go forward, which I expect us to do. And the point about Lone Star is, you can just look back at the other major projects around the world where to get to the mineral resource you have to sometimes take years of investment in stripping to remove overburden to get down to the ore. Here, we have the benefit of mining the overburden, which is oxide ore profitably. And by doing that, we are stripping that material that is overlays the sulfide resource. So it is tremendously beneficial to the long-term development this opportunity. And as I said, we're going to make money out of this oxide. And at the end of the day, we're continuing drilling, continuing economic studies. But I see a future of building a major mill complex at Lone Star to process this very large sulfide resources we're talking about is 50 billion tonnes of ore. You think about as Indonesia ramps up, fourth quarter was $0.08 a pound for the year it was on the order of less than $0.20, I don't know, $0.18, $0.19 per pound and we see costs going forward with higher volumes in that same range in Indonesia. So, it's a big factor in our business and our team has done a good job of controlling costs and we're like everybody else, we have our energy costs and other input costs are going up. So it's just what we have to deal with. But that was the whole basis for putting these companies together, back in 2007 was to match up the Indonesian assets, which is special because of its copper grades and its gold content with these lower grade mines in America, which are profitable but which have higher costs. And so that's just a carryover benefit for what we did so many years ago. Let me correct myself, I said 50 billion tonnes of ore at on start and 50 billion tonnes of copper resource. You can see the example for that what we did in the third quarter, when we started the policy of paying variable dividend buying stock back a year ago, when we started looking at this, we had planned to do that at our first meeting in 2022. But we have made such progress, markets were so good, we advanced it. So just a little color on the way we run Freeport, we don't have an annual planning process. We update our long-term plans every quarter and we go through a really disciplined process to do that. So everything is real time. So while we talked about looking at this financial policy on an annual basis, as Kathleen says, we talk with our board about it continually. And if things change, we don't limit ourselves to acting on any kind of straight jacket timeframe. Yes, we have preliminary talks, we really tried to address that years earlier. And it was just so complicated to get everything else done. It's in everybody's interest, all stakeholders interest for us to have a continuation of operations beyond 2041. It makes no sense for anybody for us to run this business with any kind of drop date. And so there's a broad acknowledgement that we need to do it. It's very preliminary, so I don't have the answers to your questions about how we structured, what we would mean. But I can say that these preliminary talks are being very well received. And there's a recognition that it's in everybody's interest for us to go beyond 2041. Hey, John. Yes, you're directionally right, John. And maybe we'll get back to you with some details, because I think some of the export numbers that you talked about are in the range of what we're doing it is $0.16 to $0.18. And we do pay this export duty while the cost for domestic processing at the smelter, will be much higher particularly when you provide for any kind of cost factor for the capital that will go into it, it will eliminate the export duty and so the net economic effect on PT-FI together with the fact that the cost of the smelter will be included in PT-FI's consolidated tax return. So any kind of cost to go through there will serve to reduce taxes. So the reduction in taxes not having to pay the export duty. In a broad sense offsets the economics to PT-FI buildings smelter. And that was a point that I think, I just don't have the numbers in front of me, John, but I don't think the cost of processing at PT smelting is as high as you indicated, the current deal, and we're expanding that smelter by 30% too as part of this effort to achieve the goal of in country processing. But it's a very efficient smelter. We built it back in the mid-90s. And it's kind of its world class in terms of its cost management. Yes. I'll like Kathleen, maybe Josh, talk to that. But I just make a point that these mine clan projections are subject to constant adjustments for various reasons that and some of them results in some volumes going from one year to another, but they all reflect steps taken to maximize the long-term values of the mine, we don't run these mines to achieve any kind of targeted, predetermined targets for volumes. But as I said, we have a dynamic, real time planning process in our goals throughout all those planning process is how do we maximize the long-term NPV and the resources that we have. And so you will, you look back at our history, there's continuous shifting of volumes from one year to the next and specifically. Just one quick comment on that. With all these years of uncertainty related to our deal with Indonesian government now, the 2041, we've done in the fact that we had such resources already discovered to fill up our mill and so forth. We haven't done much exploratory type drilling in Grasberg district for some time now. And so that's one of the main factors that makes it desirable for all stakeholders would be for us to have a deal that goes beyond 2041, which would then allow us to undertake more delineation core drilling, our exploratory core drilling, just look at that schematic that we had on the orebodies that are there, and where they're located and where they've come from. And historically, it's just clear that that while we don't know yet, because we haven't drilled it, but the high likelihood is there's a lot more resources there that haven't yet been identified. Yes, thank you all for participating in the call today. It is real pleasure to be able to report great progress our team is making and we look forward to continuing that progress and are really excited about what lies ahead for us. So thank you for your interest and if you have any further questions or need for follow-up, please contact David Joint and we will respond to you. Have a good day everyone."

            "content": "Good morning. Yes, realistically if we look at Lone Star and what we've been able to achieve since we've started up. We really leveraged a lot of the learnings that we had seen from our exercises and experience at Bagdad with respect to identifying bottlenecks in the process, and leveraging the workforce through kind of an agile way of working. And as we've done that the team at Lone Star has been able to identify opportunities that really eliminated bottlenecks and allows us to work on incremental gains over time. And as we think about the next step in that. It was just a continuation of that same process in the sense of identifying what's limiting our ability to maximize the production of the site. And so the team has done a great job of going through that entire system, identifying what those bottlenecks are. And we put projects in place to really attack those bottlenecks and maximize where we're at. The 300 million pounds is probably at the limit of our current existing Hydromet facilities and the tank house capacity. So anything above and beyond that would be a bit of a challenge. But I'm not going to say that the team there isn't going to continue to look for opportunities to add additional incremental pounds. But I think that 300 million pound target that we're headed for is, is pretty close to that limit based on what we have today."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instruction]. I would like to hand the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nKathleen Quirk: Great. Thank you. And good morning, everyone. And welcome to the Freeport McMoRan conference call. Earlier this morning, we reported our third quarter 2021 operating and financial results and a copy of today's press release and the slides are available on our website at fcx.com. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet. And anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include Forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials, and to the risk factors described in FCX 's SEC filings. On the call with me today are Richard Adkerson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mark Johnson, our CEO of Indonesia, Josh Olmsted, Chief Operating Officer for the Americas, Steve Higgins, our Chief Administrative Officer, Rick Coleman, who runs our engineering and construction business, And Mike Kendrick who runs a Molybdenum business. I will start by briefly summarizing our financial results, and then we'll turn the call over to Richard, who will go through the materials in our slide presentation materials. After our formal remarks, we'll take your questions. Today, FCX reported third quarter 2021 net income attributable to common stock of 1.4 billion. That was $0.94 per share. And adjusted net income attributable to common stock of 1.3 billion or $0.89 per share. The $0.89 per share excludes net credits totaling $0.05 a share primarily associated with tax credits related to the release evaluation allowances at PT Freeport, Indonesia and a gain on the sale of FCX 's remaining cobalt business. The details of our adjusted net income are reflected in our press release on page roman numeral 7, we generated adjusted EBITDA for the Third quarter of roughly $3 billion. And we've got a reconciliation of the EBITDA on page 37 of our slide deck. Favorable results in the third quarter reflects strong execution by our team, growing our production volumes safely, efficiently, and responsibly. Our sales volumes for the quarter for copper exceeded a billion pounds that approximated our prior estimate in July of 2021 and was above the year-ago period. Gold sales of 400,000 ounces for approximately 12% higher than our prior estimate and also significantly above the year-ago period. We also benefited from positive pricing for copper. Our third quarter average realized copper price was 420 per pound. That was substantially above the year-ago period. And gold prices were slightly below the year-ago period. We also benefited from improved Molybdenum prices in the quarter, where prices nearly doubled from the year-ago period. Net unit cash costs were $1.24 per pound in the third quarter. That was lower than our estimate going into the period. And we had some good performance from our leach production, which reduced our unit production cost in the period. Generated strong cash flows and we've been doing that every quarter this year. Generating $2 billion of operating cash flow, which exceeded capital spending of roughly 500 million during the quarter. Our balance sheet is strong. We ended the quarter with consolidated debt of 9.7 billion and consolidated cash of 7.7 billion, which resulted in net debt of $2 billion. We had no borrowings under our credit facility and have $3.5 billion available. We also announced today some liability management where we called for redemption. Our outstanding notes due 2022, that has a total principal amount of 524 million. I now want to turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to the slide presentation materials. Richard go ahead.\nRichard Adkerson: Thanks to everyone. Thank you for joining our call. Really pleased to be able to review our strong performance for this quarter, where we are with the Company. It's a special time several years ago in call I said if we could be fortunate enough to ramp up our underground production at Gras berg at the same time, we had a positive copper market, it would be a great time for Freeport. And this is really a great time for us. We're going to focus on the future. But just one comment. I was last at jobsite two years ago in October, and we were just completing the mining of the open pit and starting to ramp up the Grasberg Block Cave. And so during this 2-year period, our progress has been nothing short of remarkable. And I really congratulate our team at job site but also in the Americas for what we've been able to accomplish even in the face of all the distractions and challenges that COVID brought on. I hope you and all your family and your colleagues are staying healthy. This thing's not over. We're keeping our guards up, I encourage you to as well. We have at Freeport, had a successful program to get vaccines to our people internationally. Over 90% of our people in South America are now vaccinated and 85% in Popolo and Indonesia are vaccinated. We continue to be challenged as some of our operations in the United States, which is come in across our country unfortunate. But we're encouraging our people and making some progress there. But the news is we've been able to meet the challenge of COVID and accomplished what we're reporting to you today. Our copper volumes have grown over 20% from a year ago, and that reflects this really exceptional execution of our business. With these prices that we have today, we're generating very strong margin. Our EBITDA doubled from a year ago. Our strong operating cash flows that Kathleen mentioned in the quarter are really exceptional. And particularly when you look at our capital expenditures, we're only $500 million. Now this is generating cash flows too. Now that we've met our debt target and we met that at the end of June, way ahead of what we anticipated at the beginning of the year, we're now focused on managing these cash flows and that's a happy time for us looking at investments for our long-term future. At the same time, we are being able to increase returns to shareholders and maintain a really strong balance sheet, which is going to be real hallmark of our Company going forward. Everybody is focused on carbon reduction, climate initiatives, and 26 coming up next month. It's going to be all over the papers. We published our second report on our climate initiatives. We put a lot more resources into it. We're really focused on it. As a Company compared with other natural resource Companies, we have much limited scope 3 emissions and other natural resources, and we're really focused on our scope 1 and 2 emissions, and have a plan to achieve targets that we believe are realistic and achievable. and the other 28 members of ICMM International Council, mining and metals, which I chair, have signed a commitment to work towards having zero net carbon emissions by 205. And everybody is working hard on it. We're also continuing to make progress to certify all of our operations with international copper associations, Copper Mart. And this clearly demonstrates our commitment to responsible production. You recall that I became chairman earlier this year. When that occurred, I made a real commitment to build the kind of board that the Company like ours really needs and deserves. We've added four new members in 2021. We added two this quarter., Marcela Donadio and Sara Lewis. That brings us to a total of eight independent directors, which have a broad range of experience. And it's going to be a real strength of our Company going forward. Underlying all of this is the fundamental outlook for coppers, incredibly favorable. Copper's role in the economy and as the economy changes with global investments and infrastructure, and I know we have a controversy here, but countries around the world are going to build infrastructure. Less-developed countries are going to develop. The world is getting increasingly focused on electrification with modern technology, 5G, and artificial intelligence. And then a new major element that people are talking about and recognizing now for demand that's coming, it's not here in real significance now, is all the investments that people are going to be making to reduce carbon. And across the board, those investments are result in significant demands for copper. And then you got, we'll talk about this more, commodity really supported by supply factors. I mentioned our climate report reported in September is on our website. I encourage you all to take a look at it. It really details work in much more comprehensive way than we did in our first report last year about how our Company will work to reduce green house gas emissions, and how we are approaching climate scenario analysis and reporting in line with recommendations of the task force and climate related financial disclosures. We are, as a Company and as an organization, firmly committed to this. We see it in our everyday lives with the forest fires and our operations in the West and hurricanes on the Gulf Coast, weather patterns all around the world. We all know we need to do this, and we're committed to do our part for our Company. And as I said, as the rest of the world, the rest of industry focuses on this, it's going to create a lot of copper demand. We established a car target to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions in Indonesia, about 30%, which is a new target for us. We have this aspirational goal of net zero by 2050. Our two big issues are 1. The coal power plant in Indonesia, lot of power required for our massive operations there. We're now investing in a dual fuel powered plant there. We're looking to a future of power being generated by biodiesel initially natural gas, looking at hydro-power opportunity. So we're working on that. And then the other major issue is how to convert our big haul truck fleet, massive trucks, diesel driven, to how to work with our suppliers and others in the industry to convert that to electrical powered or hydrogen powered vehicles. We'll hear a lot more about this in the -- we just know that our Company is committed to deal with our own emissions and to work with industry and communities in general to meet the things we need to meet with climate change. Copper's essential to that, just the strategic metal in many respects for the future. The world is getting increasingly electrified and more than 65% of the world's copper is used to deliver electricity. And when you look at electric vehicles, charging stations, clean power from wind, solar, all of these require significantly more copper to operate than the way that things are currently doing now. And so it's a challenging time for us and we're serious about this challenge but it is also a great opportunity for us as a responsible global copper producer. So we've got these rising demand and supply is a real issue for this industry. Even today, with the economic uncertainties in China and globally, copper inventories are remarkably low. The LME recently hit a 47 year-low. Shanghai was lower than it's been since 2009. And while we will be some new projects that were started 4 or 5 years ago, delayed by COVID coming on stream in the next couple of years, that will bring some new, new copper to the market. Beyond that, the coverage is pretty empty in terms of new supply projects of any significance. And the world today, the opportunities are smaller. They're more difficult to develop and produce. Permitting still requires a very long period of time.  And so the industry really 1. Has an issue with meeting the demand with supply. And that's going to require actions across a lot of fronts, more scrap, some substitution. But copper, as a commodity, is so much better than any alternatives that in whatever environment you can envision for the world going forward absent some doomsday situation in the global economy. It's just in a situation of where copper prices have to be strong, and in my view stronger than they are today. Turning to slide 7, what this means for our Company is with all the work we've done today in preparing our business and building our assets, we're going to have really significant margins in cash flows. Six years ago, our Company was facing real challenges and we worked our way through that very successfully. As we were working so hard and facing dealing with some real tough problems, in dealing with unsustainable debt level at that time. We all looked at ourselves and talked about the assets we had in our Company, the long-term assets, the quality of the team, our track record, our capabilities, and that's really what inspired us all to work so hard to get to where we are today. Copper volumes are 20%, gold volumes are 50% higher than they were a year ago and they'll be growing another 15%, 20% next year. It's a great feeling as we were ending the quarter and looking at September in particularly, to recognize that the capital and execution risk to achieve these higher volumes which we've been pointing to for a very long period of time, Those risks are behind us. The higher volumes are coming with low incremental cost. At copper prices from $4 to $5, we would generate annual EBITDA for the next couple of years on the order of $12.5 billion to $17 billion per year. And our capital expenditures, and we have a new project that we'll be talking about in Indonesia, including that our capital expenditures will range on the order of $2 to $2.5 billion a year. So that means we're where we're wanting to be, where we're targeting to, where we thought we would be. But the important part is, now we've done it, we're just not pointing to it. And slide 8 shows that this ramp up of the Grasberg Mine. man that was -- this slide looks like this was really a straight forward, easy to accomplish deal. There are challenges everyday out there. I'd say this is the most complicated mine in the world, when it was an open pit mine. And now in the industries historically, a historic, large underground mine, is,-- it is truly remarkable. In third quarter was 90% of our target annualized rate. We were at target in September. We're now on track to reach full rates metal production by the end of the year, and our team in Indonesia just needs to be congratulated and recognized for meeting all of these targets and strategically so important for us. And it was a real matter of concern back in March of 2020 when we had COVID facing this. It's easy on paper, but man, it's a challenge every day. And I had a great meeting with our team in advance of this call. The excitement, morale, and so forth is just exceptional. It's really something special for our Company. And we now look forward to taking the steps that we need to take to sustain this for the life of this. We're beginning to talk with the government and getting positive initial responses about extending our operating rights beyond 2041 Because of the ramp up, the limit of the operating rights, we haven't done much exploratory drilling, extension type core drilling. Our feeling and our confidence is there's a lot more resources beyond what we're developing now. And we're explaining that to the government. As I said, initial reactions is positive. And I'm confident that we will not be facing an end -- this operation 2041, that makes no sense for any stakeholder. We need to look at it to take advantage of the long-term resources available to us. Slide 9 talks about our growth of our Company. A real strength of Freeport is its large reserve base, 30, 35 years life in it. Proved and probable reserves, which gives us a sustainable ability of our operations for very long period of time. But beyond that, we have resources that are even larger than our reserves that are ground Fuel Resources, which is really important in the Americas Because that means that we are not trying to permit gain community approval to build new mines. We have great support for our communities. We've involved them. We share our benefits with them. And so as a result, we have these multiple options for long-term ground field, low-risk growth. And I'm really encouraged by the opportunities we had in United states where we have great community support. We have the benefit of strong communities and supporting schools, hospitals, education, great workforce, great community. We pay our people really well. We make sure they have living wages. And we're sensitive to them. So here we see across the board in Baghdad, in northwest Arizona, long reserve life, do a concentrated project, we can double production. Lone Star. You're going hear a lot about Lone Star in Freeport's future. This -- this resource has a long-term opportunity to be a flagship asset. It's just across the ridge from Morenci, the largest mine in North America. We honestly believe this can be another long-term Morenci. And It's got -- right now, we're having real success with our new oxide mine, we started this past year. It's expanding, we've got further expansions. We're able to make it economic by using available production facilities at our nearby Safford mine that's winding down. And then processing this oxide is really a stripping operation for this enormous sulfide deposit. going on now. There's a big sulfide resource there. It would be a big capital projects to build a mill with desalinization plant. We're looking at a number of alternatives there. Chile is going through a process of the government. The people assessing how they're going to tax and what's the fiscal regime is going to be for mining projects. We're going to wait to see how that plays out before making any investment decision. But in the meantime, we're getting more -- we're getting prepared, working with communities, working with -- preparing for permitting and so forth. This will be a project the world will ultimately need going forward. We've got a neat project. It's not very big in Europe with our landing copper smelter, where we're going to be recycling electronic equipment. This responds to people wanting to see this sort of thing happening. It's a way of generating some copper without carbon emissions of significance investments. And so we're looking for that and looking at other opportunities like that. And then this reaching the air in Indonesia is really special. I was actually out there in the 90s when we were driving the drift, which was a de -watering drift going underneath the Grasberg open pit. As we drive in the pit, we found this ore body. The engineers give our geologists a hard time about it because they literally pierce this ore body that we're not seeing previously that lives really go south flank of the Grasberg pit. And we've been working on getting the right mine plan, the timing part. In the context of if you turn to slide 10, you can see where it's located. It's an ore body that's in a separate mineralization zone from our DOZ, and Grasberg pit. It's along fault line. It may have resources adept. It has some complicated geology and mineralogy, but this is a big mine. If 90,000 tons a day block cave, you only think of that. It is not being a huge mine because it's next the Grasberg Block Cave. But just like 60% size of Deep MLZ, 40% the size of Grasberg Block Cave, 350 million tons of ore, good copper and gold grades, 90,000 tons a day from a block cave. That's big by global standards. And it's going to occur over a number of years. It will help sustain our high level of low cost production out of Grasberg, 500 million pounds of copper a year, 500,000 ounces of gold, when it's ramped up in 2030. Capital expenditures going to be spent over a number of years. Use existing infrastructure. Just to ask your goal analysts, how they feel if gold Companies were to announce that gold mines was $500,000 a year in 500 million pounds of copper year. This is a significant opportunity for us. 12, I mentioned Lonestar. You can see how we're ramping up the oxides. We've got 2-3 reserves about 5.5 billion pounds. The real price here is sulfides underlying it. We've done some drilling to identify that we're doing preliminary plans and process it and so forth. Mineral potential is 50 billion pounds -- 50 billion pounds. This is a long-term opportunity, but we're a long-term Company. And this is going to be a flagship opportunity for us going forward. Another area that's emerging, and our guys in this call are really excited about it, is new opportunities to apply technology to leaching. Now, and Freeport predecessors were long leaders in leaching going back to the very start of SX - EW leaching. The opportunities globally for traditional SX - EW leaching are diminishing, because they've been accessed and taken advantage of it. But this opens up a whole new round of opportunities for us that had production with limited capital and low carbon emissions. This will range from looking at a series of additives and approaches for existing leached tax, which would allow us to recover more from those. We're also really getting excited by using these data analytics efforts that we started several years ago. To apply those to leach tax and know more about what we're doing, what the consequences are of taking certain actions. So it's a combination of things, there are several alternatives we're looking at. The opportunities are really significant. Our guys estimate we had almost 40 billion pounds of copper in our existing stock piles. This is not -- this has already been mined. It's mountain reserves and resources, and any production plant. If we can record -- if we're going to cover just a piece of this, it's a size of a new mine. Low capital, low operating costs, low carbon footprint. A lot of this is at Morenci, but there are other places. And it could even apply to some old historical mines that have old lead stacks that we can use it for. It's an emerging thing. But we are excited about it, and our Company's particularly well situated to take advantage of that because of the history that we've had with these older mines and what this could mean for it. So this is a stay tuned deal. We're not building in our plans yet. But just like a development project, low capital, low-cost, low carbon. So it's really good. So listen, we're just feeling great about Freeport. I mean, we just -- we've been to the awards together. Our team is -- we're adding some really new resources to our team despite COVID, we're bringing in support. We got young people in our organization stepping up to leadership positions. You know, it's a dynamic Company. It's remarkable that through all the trials and tribulations went through, we had very limited numbers of people to leave us. Our people look at each other and we're inspired by each other, and it's just great. Strong cash flows. We're going to be responsible. We have this great track record of doing all this. If you look at our success, we've had in developing projects all around the world, different kinds of mining, different kinds of processing technology. Market outlook is great, you got these organic growth opportunities. And really as a shareholder myself, the prospects of seeing returns on those shareholders coming of significance is just a great feeling. So I hope you can -- sense how we feel about our Company and our outlook, and really appreciate your interest. And I'm going to turn it over to Kathleen before we open up for questions.\nKathleen Quirk: Great. Thank you, Richard. I'm just going to cover some brief comments on financial and operating matters and then we'll open up for questions. Starting on Slide 16, we provide some additional details on our operating activities. Richard mentioned Lonestar, and the performance there has been really strong. Our operations are exceeding our design capacity, which was originally 200 million pounds. We're exceeding that now by 25%, and we're continuing to optimize and planning for the next increment of production from Oxides as we study the longer-term opportunities. Richard mentioned the leach work that we're doing. It's a major focus at Morenci. We have a big effort underway to enhance recoveries and we're deploying a very -- a variety of initiatives. Some of these have already produced results. And that did enable us to increase expected recovery from some of our leach material in the third quarter. And what this does, is it gets us more volumes but also allows us to reduce unit costs, having a bigger pool to spread costs over. So that's a really positive thing and more to come there. We've incorporated some of this into our plans, but we're optimistic that additional copper pounds can be added as we go forward. At Morenci, we're continuing to work to increase mining rates. We're targeting getting up to 900,000 tons of material per day in 2023. That's a major undertaking. It's 30% higher than where we were in 2012. As we reported, we have started -- we started the historic Morenci Mill, which had been idled since the first half of 2020, and that's proceeding. We started the mill and the third quarter. We did experience some delays, but those are largely behind us. We also had as probably a lot of you've seen the the weather conditions in the Southwest that we experienced this summer. We did experience severe wet weather and some power issues during monsoon season, and we always have monsoon season. But this this year was more severe than normal and that did impact some of our operations in the third quarter. And again, that's behind us as well. I want to just echo what Richard said about our team in South America. The team has overcome significant challenges in dealing with the pandemic. We've been operating at about 95% of capacity over the last several months, and that's in the face of still restrictions on movement around and our team just does great work in managing this and being creative about how to manage it safely. We're optimistic that as we look forward into 2022, maybe the government restrictions can be lifted safely and we can return to a more normal operating environment there and achieve higher rates at Cerro Verde. El Abra mine in Chile is making great progress. We're increasing the stacking rate of material where we're storing production that we had curtailed during 2020. And we're focused on sustaining a level of production and elaborate in the 200-250 million pound per year range, as we look to potentially expand that as we go forward. Richard talked about the terrific results at Grasberg. Team there is just continuing to deliver results quarter-after-quarter. We expect to be at our quarterly run rate for metal beginning here in the fourth quarter. And for the next several quarters, we project the mill will run at about a 175,000 tons per day, until 2023, when we install the new SAG Mill, which is currently under construction. And that will support higher rates as we continue to ramp up the Grasberg Block Cave And the Deep MLZ and then make room for the Kucing Liar project that Richard mentioned. A lot of talk right now about inflation. Our team is really focused on cost management and efficiency projects. We're focused on extending equipment lines, ways to improve our energy efficiency, ways to efficiently implement maintenance practices and really use technology in all of this. We have like everyone else experienced some cost increases. Those have really principally been associated with the energy price increases. To a lesser extent, we've had some other impacts on our consumables, the impact of steel prices on some of our consumables. We've had higher sulfuric acid costs, freight costs. But we really want to send appreciation to our global supply chain team. They are doing excellent work in keeping our operations stocked with critical supplies and managing in these uncertain times. And they've just done an outstanding job in keeping our business business continuity going. I will note that we have seen very strong prices in Molybdenum and those have more than offset some of these inflationary pressures we've had on the cost side. Turning to the smelter. On Slide 17, we provide an update of our activities with the Greenfield smelter we're developing in and the work we're doing with our partner at PT Smelting to expand the facility there. We were focused on completing this project as efficiently, as timely as possible. We're advancing the engineering in commercial arrangements. And we've commenced preparing the land for construction. You probably have seen in press reports that the president of Indonesia recently visited the site in a groundbreaking ceremony. And that just indicates the significance of this project to the country. We've got a billion-dollar bank credit facility in place for PT-FI to use to advance the projects. And we are going to plan additional debt financing for the project, which can be obtained at attractive rates just on the project long term. As we previously discussed, the long-term costs for the financing for the smelter will essentially be offset by a phase out of the 5% export duty. So the economic impact to PT-FI is not material. And this is a project that is shared 51% by our shareholder of PT-FI, shareholder MIND ID in the balance of FCX. Turning to our volumes, and Richard talked about the growth in volumes, we've had great success and execution. We've got our three-year outlook listed on Slide 18. And this is generally consistent with our previous guidance. We made some relatively minor adjustments to the fourth quarter of 2021. But you'll see here that the execution of our plan is on track. We'll share one on Slide 19, the strong cash flow generation of this business. We've got very significant free cash flows using our volume and cost estimates and prices ranging from $4 to $5 copper. Holding gold flat at $1,800 and Molybdenum at current prices around $19 per pound. The real growth in our volumes with low incremental costs and show EBITDA ranging from $12.5 billion per annum on average for 2022 and 2023 at $4 copper and 17 billion if $5 copper as Richard has mentioned. And operating cash flows, and this is net of tax, ranges from $9 billion to over $12 billion, which provides significant cash flows not only to invest in our business and fund programs, grow our business, but also increase capital returns to investors. Our capital spending plans are detailed on the next slide, slide 20. You'll see here that we reduced our outlook for 2021 for capital spending from $2.2 billion previously to $2.2 billion and that excludes the smelter investment. But that reflects really timing. We've had really a timing issue in getting these projects going and so that would just -- some of that falling over into 2022. We've also added the -- in our forecast plans to commence development of the Kucing Liar ore body that Richard mentioned previously. So you're talking about $9 to $12 billion of operating cash flows and capex below $3 billion. Very strong free cash flow. We've got growing volumes, strong markets, low capital requirements. And that's really allowed us just over the past 12 months to reduce our debt, our net debt by nearly $6 billion. And so we're down now to $2 billion in net debt. I know some of you remember a time when it was multiples of this. And so we're in a great situation from a balance sheet standpoint. Our credit metrics are extremely strong and it positions us well as we go forward to invest in future growth and increase our payouts to shareholders. The last Slide 22, refers to our financial policy. It is centered around our strong balance sheet. The combination of the strong balance sheet and the success in growing our volumes will put us in a strong position. Our board had established earlier this year a policy that provides for up to 50% of free cash flow to be used for shareholder returns with the balance available for growth and further balance sheet improvements. With the achievement of our net debt targets, we look forward to the implementation of this policy. We expect our board will determine the structure and size of additional payouts to shareholders with our annual results. And this will be something that we update and it gets reviewed periodically. So that concludes our remarks. We look forward to reporting our progress and continuing to build on our momentum as we go forward. And operator, we'd now like to turn the call over for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from the line of Michael Glick with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nMichael Glick: Good morning. Just on the cost side, the trajectory in 4Q looks good as Grasberg ramps. But relative to the trajectory in 4Q and really into '22, how should we think about inflationary pressures given what's happened with coal in Indonesia, frayed power, particularly in Europe and Spain, diesel consumables and labor as well. And are there any annual contract resets we should be mindful of going into 2022?\nKathleen Quirk: We've built into our projections current levels of energy costs. We do have a coal contract in Indonesia that is done annually. But for the most part, our energy costs are floating with the market. Because of the volume increase that we're expecting next year and that really we've got a big fixed cost business, so it comes at a low cost. We are projecting that our unit costs will decline year-on-year from '21 to '22, and we've got additional growth. So while costs inflation is a factor for us, it's being managed well and producing volumes at low incremental costs will help us drive costs lower in the place -- in the face of rising inflation.\nMichael Glick: Great. Thank you.\nRichard Adkerson: Yeah. Michael, I raised this question with our team getting ready for this because quite frankly when I saw the out years I was pleasantly surprised because of everything you're reading just generally about things. But you know, the currency rates are helping us and these background of credits or aren't really important to us. And of course in Indonesia, their gold is growing and Molybdenum is doing well. And our team has just done a great job in managing these things. We benefit because Freeport manages America's business as one business. We operate all the mines that we operate, and we have incredibly good relationships with suppliers. We're premium customer for all of our major suppliers. So some we're watching and we're -- some of our costs are correlated to copper prices. So it's a factor, but I was struck. I was expected to be more, quite frankly, myself. And it's turning out to be in our plans.\nMichael Glick: Awesome. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Emily Chang with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nEmily Chang: Good morning, Richard and Kathleen. My question is just around capitals for tonnes. You clearly well below your net debt target here. But could you give us some color as to what's driving the hesitation around, maybe accelerating this announcement. Is it a macro uncertainty you talked a little bit about earlier or are we still balancing what the cadence of growth projects is in the next couple of years before announcing something positive then? Thank you.\nRichard Adkerson: Usually it's just more a question of how quickly this is developed. When we set the policy, we were anticipating meeting our debt target sometimes out in the future. And it happened so quickly. Business has gone so well. We've added new board members. And so we accept much earlier, a process that would result in this being addressed after the beginning of the year when we got our annual results. And so we'll be talking with our board about it. We are also having engagements with a number of our significant shareholders about stock buybacks and dividends. From the traditional thinking, it is seems to be shifting some. But it's nothing about reluctance about the future that's causing us to do that. And we have regular scheduled board meetings and we talk about it every board meeting. So it's just more of a question of how we set process early on. And clearly we're making progress much faster because of markets, but also because of our execution than we had anticipated. And so it's a good situation, but that's why we are where we are.\nKathleen Quirk: And there's no hesitation, Emily, on this. We just got to implement it.\nRichard Adkerson: Yeah.\nEmily Chang: Appreciate and looking forward to it.\nRichard Adkerson: All of us are, Emily, but thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nDavid Gagliano: Hey, thanks for taking my questions. Obviously a lot going on here. The leaching potential itself and opportunity, etc. I just wanted to focus in on Kucing Liar for a minute. In respect it's early days, but Kucing Liar obviously been a well-known part of the Grasberg district for a long time. Now that you're starting to develop it, I just have 2 questions. First of all, if you could talk about the cadence of the upcoming capital spending over the next 10 years. And then secondly, talk about the primary developmental risks as you see it today. Again, I know it's early days that you referenced complicated geology, mineralogy, what are in your view, the primary developmental its challenges for Kucing Liar? That's it for me.\nKathleen Quirk: David, on the capex, like our rather Block caves, is spread out over a long period of time. So it'll start out next year somewhere in the and so that's done over approximate 10-year period. And the production will come on to seek when that all this is sequenced together, but the production will come on to sequence when we have availability in the mill, as we have some declines with other ore bodies. But Mark, if you want to give some background about KL. As Richard was saying, this is just a natural progression for us. It gives us really a place to continue to use all, everything we learned from Deep MLZ and Grasberg Block Cave to extend that to KL. And so we're -- we think it's a natural time to begin transitioning to develop another ore body there.\nMark Johnson: Yeah. And David, it's going to look very much like Deep MLZ instead of similar elevation. It is going to benefit from the lessons learned at Deep MLZ, for instance, our plans now would be that we would apply this hydrofracking technology to it in advance. Where with Deep MLZ, we ended up having to play a bit of catch-up. So we've got a much better geotechnical knowledge and how to address that part of the risks. It does with Kathleen says it benefits. It, ties in development, some of the infrastructure it shares. There's common parts of the ore flow system, ventilation access we're driving three headings, starting very soon. And they all tie off of the development that's either off of the big DAS or off of drifting that goes back to GBC. The previous KL reserve had much more complex metallurgy and geology. Over the last couple of years, we changed our mine planning approached, we focused on what turned out to be much higher value material that was a little bit lower grade, but the material could be processed through our current mill. So that took away a lot balances that the previous kale mine plant had. We had to change our flotation circuit. We have much more of the environmental management with pyrite concentrate that would be generated. So this plan, it's above 0.9 Copper, 0.9 per ton gold. The times that Richard mentioned are very much driven by this 2041 dates that we're working on. And this deposit has a lot of growth, both on the same footprint that we're working out now and at deeper levels. So I feel like this is going to be our chance to take all the lessons learned. We're looking at the potential of applying electrical -- electric mining equipment there. So I think we get a fresh start with a lot of experience that's going to apply itself. And KL is going to benefit from it.\nRichard Adkerson: I want to tell you today that when Mark -- the original reserve, as Mark said, had all this material and our gold recovers are very low and processing is complicated. And dealing with the Pyrite tails was real complicated. I was just so impressed with Mark and his mine planning team came in with this new plan, which makes it much more traditional, much less risky, much less capital intensive, and in fact, created more value. Because originally we were only getting 50% recovery out of that pyrite laden gold and ore. So it's a great example of having really good mine planning theme and lead by mark.\nDavid Gagliano: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. Just a quick follow-up on the time of the CapEx. So 4 billion over roughly 10 years, 200 million in 2022, is the lion's share of the spend likely towards the latter half of the decade? Is that reasonable to say? Can you give us a little more color on the timing of that ramp?\nKathleen Quirk: It'll average around that.\nRichard Adkerson: It's pretty consistent. Because we develop most of the access and ventilation and all those sorts of things, it's not chunky. This is --\nDavid Gagliano: Okay.\nRichard Adkerson: -- more or less mine development. And that occurs on a regular pattern.\nDavid Gagliano: Okay. Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris LaFemina with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nChris La Femina: Hi, Richard, hi Kathleen, How are you?\nKathleen Quirk: Thanks, Chris. great.\nChris La Femina: Just a follow-up question on the KL project? It sounds like the gold grades there are quite a bit higher than they are at the Grasberg Block Cave, and the DMLZ, and the copper grades are similar. So is this a project where we should expect operating costs to be at least as well, if not lower than what you're going to get from the two current Block Cave projects? And secondly --\nRichard Adkerson: The answer -- the answer is yes.\nChris La Femina: Certainly lower cost. And what should we also think about it as just being sort of a mine life extension to the Grasberg Block Cave or is it would it be a period where you have I mean, you obviously constrained by the mill capacity, but would you be a period where you might have higher production as this is online along with you still operating the Block -- the Grasberg Block Cave.\nRichard Adkerson: It just fits in really well with great changes with our existing mines. It just folds right in. It's a sustainability of production projects as opposed to a significant growth project.\nMark Johnson: And one thing I might add to it is with the SEK3 projects, we get up to a mill capacity of 240, that milligrand, somewhere around 220. So scale benefits somewhat off the mill capacity that they provide. And then as Richard and Kathleen mentioned, it just fits in nicely as the grades and some of the deposits thing to decline, kale comes up. And so we're able to adjust those other mine plans and room for kale to be that 90,000 ton producer. And want the grades at are better than the grades, for instance, at Deep MLZ.\nRichard Adkerson: And Chris, to put that in perspective, way back in the 1990s when we were designing the Grasberg open pit and looking forward to life beyond the pit, our original targets was a 120,000 tons states we can mill. So over time, this amazing ore body is allowing us to go from anticipated a 120,000 ton per day mill rate from the underground to 240,000 tons from the underground. Just to put it in perspective.\nChris La Femina: And sorry, if I could a second question regarding your projects. It's really actually incredible when you think about over the last five years you went from being in a position where you were kind of managing the balance sheet, trying to develop these two really difficult underground projects in Indonesia, negotiating with the government regarding ownership at Grasberg. And you probably couldn't have drawn it up any better as to how it's progressed in terms of development of the projects, the deleveraging of the balance sheet, the ramp up of the Grasberg Block Cave in DMLZ has been really impressive. I think there was a lot of skepticism in the market about whether you can actually deliver on that, and it seems like you are delivering. But now you are kind of unleashing this massive organic growth pipeline, which is probably underappreciated until recently. I mean, you've kind of been highlighting in recent quarters, but now we're there. So you're going to be developing these projects and you're obviously talking as well about this kind of catalytic leaching and leaching thread of old leach stacks, power doors which historically have not been commercial. Is this a technology that you think could potentially be revolutionary in the industry in terms of leading to a lot of supply growth from old what had been leach stockpiles? Do we have to worry about the copper supply demand balance as a result of these sorts of new technologies leading to lots of growth?\nRichard Adkerson: That's again, Chris, question I've been asking our team all along. In a prior life, I actually worked with the first Company out in Houston that is a very first fracking operations for the whole oil and gas industry way back in 80s. And so I've asked that question. And while it's a tremendous opportunity and particularly good for our Company considering the nature of our stockpiles and the history of our operations in the way we've dealt with low grade, this will be beneficial. People are really going to be pursuing it. There are -- is not just one technology is being pursued, but a series of different options. So it's an evolving story. It's not likely to be the account of game changer that fracking was in the oil and gas business.\nChris La Femina: That's great. Thank you for that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Lawson Winder from Bank of America Securities. Your line is now open.\nLawson Winder: Hi, good morning and thank you for the update. It's nice to hear from both of you. There's so much to discuss, but I'd like to actually touch on your efforts around ESG, particularly in Indonesia. I mean, it's really exciting that you're targeting a certain percent reduction in emissions by 2030. And I was wondering, how do you think about the cost of that? Or what is the cost that you've factored in order to achieve that? And then when you think about it, maybe some of the other way in terms of IRR, if you assume some carbon pricing assumption around where maybe European coke prices today, but what kind of IRR can you get on those types of investments? Thank you.\nRichard Adkerson: So that -- I kind of hate people who say that's a good question. And some people will say it all the time, but that is real good question. And it's something that is really underappreciated right now. And we're particularly focused on it within ICMM, because here we had the 28 largest mining companies, we represent about a third of the global mining industry, unanimously, making this commitment. And as I said, with Freeport, because of our limited scope, three emissions, it's not as big a challenge as it is for some other miners and resource companies. But we don't know yet what the cost of this is going to be. And it's going to be significant. There's just no way around it. Met with senior management caterpillar and to try to think about designing 400 ton haul trucks, we can make the grades of these big pits that we have. The battery in those, at this current level of technology is changing, but then battery weighs a time. It's life is very short, so you've got to deal with all the recharging and trying systems and so forth. So there are lots of unknowns here. There's no question it's going to involve a lot of costs. And right now, while people are really making these commitments in good faith, they're doing it at a time, and we talked about this in our climate report, of where it's going to rely on technology advances and some of those things there's more questions than answers and with all that right now. We have a good -- I think we've got our arms around converting the Coal Plant in Indonesia, and that's one of our big things. But the questions is how do you deal with halogen electrifying shovels and -- I know our shovels are already electric, but just light vehicles and so forth. In our underground mines, we have a big electric train helping us deliver ore, but there would have to be some investments there. So it's going to be an unfolding story and you raised the point that people following us and companies in our industry ought to really be tracking. Because as we sit here today, there's more questions than answers in that area. I just want to add on to that. That's going to be another factor. That's going to be a barrier to supply development in the copper business. I mean, low grade end-of-life mines -- And we got 30 years or so to have this on wine. But it's going to affect mine life. It's going to affect the economics of project development. All of those things are going to come into play. So in your list of items that are are barriers to supply development, this is a factor that you can add to it.\nLawson Winder: Very fair.\nKathleen Quirk: One of the other things to keep in mind in Indonesia is we have -- with the transition to underground when we were mining and at the surface, we had to move both ore and waste to get the metal production here on the ground. It's very efficient. You're with the block-caving and you really just mining ore and so it is more efficient. As Richard said, we've got some electrical applications underground. Mark talked about expanding that as we as we look at new developments in KL. So there are some benefits that we have in Indonesia from the change from surface mining to our underground mining.\nRichard Adkerson: Yeah. We were moving 800 thousand to a million metric tones a day in that open pit mine. Think about that. We still don't have to move material around to manage waste and deal with our tailing system and so forth. But that's a big change. But we've got plans in developing new mines in the world. This is kind of a conundrum. The world needs more copper and yet more copper until technology breaks through, is going to result in more carbon emissions. And this is not the only industry where that's an issue that's unknown right now. But it's certainly true in our industry.\nLawson Winder: Thank you for your thoughts.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Orest Wowkodaw from Scotia Bank. Your line is now open.\nOrest Wowkodaw: Yes. Good morning. I was wondering if you can get some details on the potential timeline for the Baghdad concentrator expansion. How much time's involved for permitting something like that. And even with the Lonestar expansion, is it fair to say that probably we wouldn't see any capex for either in 2022?\nRichard Adkerson: Well, I'll let others answer. We will have capex for Lonestar with this oxide, cause we're expanding to oxide. We started out at a certain level and we're stepping it up. But Kathleen, you were are calling somebody?\nKathleen Quirk: It will be a small amount of capital in 2022. And at Baghdad, we're really jsut advancing feasibility next year. We're thinking Baghdad is probably still five years out or so before we will have production. And so you won't have meaningful capex for another couple of years associated with it. And Lone Star, the next increment of expansion is relatively low in terms of capital intensity. The longer-term opportunity is more 20, 30 type, but it's meaningful. The big thing that we really were focused on is growth through these low capital intensive opportunities to get more out of what we already have, either through automation or this leach technologies that we're pursuing. And so that's really where we can impact things in the short-term.\nRichard Adkerson: I'm going to put an exclamation point to what Kathleen just said about Baghdad. Because going back to the early 2000, there was just a feeling that higher prices would bring production. I mean that's been the history of the copper industry. But here we are at Baghdad where we already have the reserves. We have established operations, full support of the community, and we're just talking about shortening the reserve life by building a new concentrate. And that's five years out. That's as a easy a project as you're going to find in this industry. So that's what I was just saying. This coming situation, absent some doomsday global economic situation, there's just going to be a time when the world is going to be very short of copper.\nOrest Wowkodaw: I couldn't agree more. Richard, just as a quick follow-up. In terms of the capital allocation framework of paying out up to 50% of the effectively free cash flow. How does the smelter CapEx fit into that? Is that excluded from the formula or included?\nRichard Adkerson: It's excluded. And you need to keep that in mind because that is a PT-FI project. It's good. That was one of the goals I was trying to achieve when we were negotiating all of this back in 2018, is we consolidate PT-FI. The economics of -- and so that will show up as consolidated debt for us. But if it's financed at the subsidiary level, the obligation is going to be shared by the 2 shareholders; FCX and MIND ID. It will go into PT-FI's tax calculations. So the project will be something that will affect PT-FI 's taxes. When you step back from that Indonesian operations, I would really please -- I don't know if any of you review the Indonesia media coverage, but they just had these athletic games in Papua, where the president was there and senior government people. They had the ground breaking. I have never in 30 years seeing such positive comments in the media in Indonesia about Freeport, as we saw with this. And the president is recognizing what a great investment country made when they bought out Rio Tinto's joint venture interest in 2018. We've already started paying dividends. The dividends are going to be really spectacular for the government going forward. And when you look at the government's equity position, their 51% share of equity, which will step up to that in stages. You look at the tax rate, we have royalties, we pay. You look at the payments that are made for inter-Company transfers to FCX. The government's economic interest in the project. We exceed 70%. We were able to retain through the negotiations, the interest we had going into it. So this is truly something that all the parties are very happy with. And what a release it is to be working in Indonesia and not have to deal with the kind of complications we had for so many years.\nOrest Wowkodaw: Thanks, Richard.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Carlos with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open\nCarlos De Alba: Yes.Thank you very much. Good morning. Richard and Kathleen. Just on KL. How much, if anything, of the estimated 500 million pounds of copper at KL would be incremental. Or a 100% would be just you to replace a sustained and new production profile in Indonesia? And together with that and just following on the discussion that we just had on the prior question, how do you envision Richard arising on the negotiating a table for the potential extension of your rights in Indonesia. Would the government potentially get a higher stake in Indonesia? Or what is the scope of the negotiation.\nRichard Adkerson: So with your first question, Kathleen help me. Well, let me just say though. We give a five-year outlook for PT-FI's production. And is that in the press release or was that --\nKathleen Quirk: Yeah.\nRichard Adkerson: Okay. So Carlos, just follow that and you can see that is we said before, this is more of a question of sustaining production levels as opposed to a growth project. But you can see what we show for five years, and that will give you a view of the trend going forward. Now, with respect to your second question, it's really early stages. But we have broached it. I've talked with senior government people about it, and our partner MIND ID, the state-owned Company under the auspices of the minister state of enterprises, everybody recognizes the mutual benefits. For sure the government like a bigger interest. But think about the complications of that because with an extension, we will want to start, as Mark said, we've got opportunities to KL and elsewhere to invest and we will make those investments in advance of 2041. And so we have to balance out how you share those costs, where we basically have 50% economics of new investment, with what's our interest going to be going forward. So that's early days to be discussed. Tried to raise it earlier, but it was just not possible to get traction on those discussions. But the logic and benefits to all stakeholders for finding a way forward on this are clear cut.\nCarlos De Alba: I understand.\nRichard Adkerson: The alignment between FCX and the government is really good. To have the kind of incentives for both parties to have a win-win, that's what really we tried to design in 2018. And that's really what's happened.\nCarlos De Alba: Given everything that goes around developing a project of this magnitude, KL, what will be ideally the expansion of the time for those either you were looking for 20, 30 years or something around those lines?\nKathleen Quirk: Well, just to be clear on KL --\nRichard Adkerson: To be clear on KL -- yeah, Kathleen. Those economics are baked into 2041?\nCarlos De Alba: Okay.\nRichard Adkerson: So they're not dependent on extension. What the opportunity is is to make the KL bigger and to find other resources because we really have done very limited delineation type exploration work in a number of years. And so we don't know the answers, but we're optimistic that there's resources there that we don't know about yet. And the best answer is for projects like this to not have a time frame, but to have incentives for all the parties to work to maximize the resources over the long term. Time frames make no sense.\nCarlos De Alba: Thank you very much.\nRichard Adkerson: But I want to be clear. The KL economics are not dependent on an extension -- the current project.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian McArthur with Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nBrian Mc Arthur: Hi, good morning. Well, Richard, you just answered the question I had right there, so they don't try something else. Just on the Molybdenum business, obviously, doing a lot better. I see climax has come up a little bit. Like what's the strategy going forward, but like you plan to reference up more there and at Sierrita, which obviously has a big Molly credit. Why wouldn't it get fully ramped up bigger in the whole thing in the near-term too?\nRichard Adkerson: Well, we benefited at Freeport because there's some very significant investments in that Molybdenum business prior to our acquisition of Phelps Dodge. And then creating the processing facilities capabilities -- And Mike Kendrick is on the line. He can chip in on this, but rather than just being a metal producer and a byproduct producer, the past efforts created a really sustainable in this global leading business of where we're able to maximize the value of our ore resources in Colorado from our Molybdenum mines through the bi-product credits in North America and South America. And we can expect those to come with expansion projects and more. And so we were able to generate higher than the metal price value for Molybdenum back processing as a chemical products. And we run this thing as a business. It obviously ebbs and flows with the price of Molybdenum. Today's price look out 3 or 4 years and a lot of cash coming out of that business. But it's strategically important to us. We just got a great team. It's a global team. They work together very well. Colorado is a state where you've got -- all states are, but you got to be very careful about environmental management. City of Denver gets maybe 10% of its drinking water off the Climax mountain. And so it's a business that goes back 100 years, more than a 100 years for our predecessors and is strategically very important. And now, it's generating cash. Mike, you want to add anything?\nKathleen Quirk: I'm going, Richard. Brian, we do have opportunities to increase primary Molly production at the Climax mine. If you think about what the big deficits people are talking about in copper, there could be mounting deficits in Mali at some point. And so we want to be in a position -- and that's what our primary mines can do, is It's need market demand. And we've got -- we had curtailed capacity in the past to match up with markets. And now we have the opportunity potentially to increase. And so we're going to be doing some mine stripping and that sort of thing to be positioned so that the markets are there, we can be there to participate with this quality product that the market wants. So we're looking at all of that, and Mike, if you want to add something to that.\nMike Kendrick: No, I think you both have captured it really well, is that we've made -- three quarters made tremendous investments in the molly business over the last decade, including the Climax Mine, tremendously productive circuit at Cerro Verde and at our other by-products circuits in North America. And we've been able to take that with our downstream operations that we've inherited. And we've made incremental investments over time there, and they are very productive. And we can service not only the metallurgical, but the chemical industry and the lubricant industry very well. And as Kathleen says, we're definitely evaluating the next steps.\nBrian Mc Arthur: And sorry, just on Sierrita, given the big molly credit there, is that all the way back to full capacity yet?\nRichard Adkerson: Josh?\nJosh Olmsted: Yeah. Good morning. I was going to jump in with respect to Sierrita. So they've been -- we've been ramping back up at Sierrita in terms of the mine plan and stripping over the last 6 to 8 months. And so if you think about it from a molly perspective, it's really been driven by the sequencing and the great available in the mine. And so as the molly price has gone up, we're looking at what's the best way to optimize the value at Sierrita. But the upside is incremental. It's not significant because the mill is at its capacity as we sit today and going forward. There's opportunities, as Kathleen touched on earlier, with respect to incremental billing rate increases, which we're working on through the data analytics and digital type tools. But it will be incremental at best as we go forward.\nBrian Mc Arthur: Thank you very much.\nKathleen Quirk: Thanks, Brian.\nRichard Adkerson: Thanks, Brian.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Hacking from Citi.\nAlex Hacking: And thanks Mike. Mike question was already answered, which was around the economics of KL. If the contract of work is not extended beyond 2041, but you were very clear that the economics work in that scenario. So I will let someone ask the last question. Thanks.\nRichard Adkerson: Thanks, Alex.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Michael Dudas from Vertical Research. Your line is now open.\nMichael Dudas: Michael. Good morning, Richard, Kathleen. Great, great news on the relationship with the Indonesian Government.Maybe you could share some additional thoughts on what you're observing in Peru with the new administration. What's coming up in Chile in the fall on elections. And is there anything out of Washington with all the noise that's going to could impact mining, could impact potential investment or how the mining industry will react as some of this legislation comes forward?\nRichard Adkerson: Well, I got to discipline my comments with those questions.\nMichael Dudas: I'm sorry about that, Richard.\nRichard Adkerson: The world we live in. Chile is separate from Peru. And it's got a really, a lot of questions about it right now. It's driven by this wide spread feeling within the country of people as things were happening around the world dealing with income inequalities and social programs versus other government initiatives and so forth. And it's got a complicated election coming up. There's no clear-cut front runner right now. There's processes going on within the parliament within issues related to consideration of constitutional changes. And so it's really, from my perspective, muddy waters there. It's not chronically nearly as significant as Peru in terms of El Abra 's production is a small part of our production, but it is affecting our consideration of expansion. But we're working with the industry. We're not we're -- not top of the charts in terms of production there, so we're working with others on it. In Peru, Peru always, consistently has complicated presidential politics. And we've seen this story before, where a less leaning candidate gets into office and runs on platforms that are very much addressing -- getting more money out of mining companies. And President Castillo ran on that platform. He had the backing of the far left wing parties there. I've got to meet him within this past month. He came to Washington. It was a Sunday before and with a small group of mining executives, had dinner with him. And my first time to meeting -- he comes from a nonpolitical leader background. He was a teacher in the interior for Peru. And when he talked to the set and I, I found him to be very compelling in his emotional feelings about doing more to help the people from the region where he came from but also throughout Peru. The poor people in terms of education and so forth. And I didn't know what to expect when I went there. I had better feeling than I had going into it. He listened. I had the chance to have exchanges about different issues. None of us got into details about specific fiscal proposals and so forth. But he emphasized that he recognized the importance of mining place in Peru. And that's what always happens when people get an office to achieve social programs. They see how much mining contributes to the country financially. And that's needed to do other things. So I'm having a lot of conversations with other CEOs of countries that operate in Peru. After that meeting, he revamped his cabinet at the very upset of this administration and replaced a very aggressive guy that was prime minister. And so it's really wait and see thing, but I'm more encouraged about it. We're working with others in the industry. We need to be responsive. Here's concerns, and that's what I'm trying to. We focus all of our -- almost all of our community programs on the regions where we operate. I think we've got to take a broader view and show people in the interior that mining can help their lives. And so that's what I'm working on right now. And so I am more optimistic now than I was during the election. You'll hear different views by different miners there. People are very concerned, rightly so. Our situation is we have a new stability agreement. We're maximizing the operations at Cerro Verde. It's a big producer. A major contributor to our volumes. It's got the world's largest mine site, concentrate facilities. We have great relationships with the local community. So we want to build off that and try to reach out and find some common ground work for President Castillo. But it's uncertain. Man, what about the U.S? What can you say? I mean, It's just a head scratcher about what also is going on in Washington these days. The current administration recognizes the importance of minerals like copper to achieve their goals of climate change, And yet, I don't expect them to lessen up any requirements for permitting environmental management community issues runs against their political situation. So it's really uncertain. We're all hopeful we'll see some steps towards infrastructure building. The country really needs it. You see it in ports and roads, and bridges all over the country. But I just don't have any comment on the political situation other than be distressed about it. And we also need to have a more thoughtful approach to relationships with China in this country. And that's a byproduct parties and issue and it's a complicated one. But China is going to be important part of our world going forward and the country is too big and people are very smart. They work hard and they create a lot of economic loss of these. So anyway, I'm focused staying out of politics and focused on Freeport.\nMichael Dudas: You sound like a true ambassador, Richard, thank you.\nKathleen Quirk: He's right.\nOperator: Thank you. And Now we'll turn the call over to management for any closing remarks.\nRichard Adkerson: Well Kathleen, I thought, going into this thing, we had such a good quarter, we'd have a real short call, but I really appreciate your good questions. As always, there a lot of complicated issues to face with -- I woke up this morning, feeling on top of the world and then I opened my screen to see for the first in a number of days, a weekday in the market and I said, that was just God's way of reminding me about the business for him. But we couldn't be more po -- I think you get -- I hope you get the sense, not just for me, but from our whole team of just how good we feel about what we've done. And we're not going to focus on what we've done. We're focusing on where we go from here. And it's a long-range business. This is a long range Company. We don't feel any pressure to do -- to do anything from any kind of M&A standpoint, the overly aggressive and new investment decisions. We're going to approach this in a very straightforward, logical way. And in the meantime, make a lot of money and show shareholders some gratitude for sticking with us and being part of our Company. So thank you all. If you have follow-up questions, as always, let me and David know, and we will be responsive.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect",

            "content": "Yeah. Good morning. I was going to jump in with respect to Sierrita. So they've been -- we've been ramping back up at Sierrita in terms of the mine plan and stripping over the last 6 to 8 months. And so if you think about it from a molly perspective, it's really been driven by the sequencing and the great available in the mine. And so as the molly price has gone up, we're looking at what's the best way to optimize the value at Sierrita. But the upside is incremental. It's not significant because the mill is at its capacity as we sit today and going forward. There's opportunities, as Kathleen touched on earlier, with respect to incremental billing rate increases, which we're working on through the data analytics and digital type tools. But it will be incremental at best as we go forward."

            "content": "Yeah. And David, it's going to look very much like Deep MLZ instead of similar elevation. It is going to benefit from the lessons learned at Deep MLZ, for instance, our plans now would be that we would apply this hydrofracking technology to it in advance. Where with Deep MLZ, we ended up having to play a bit of catch-up. So we've got a much better geotechnical knowledge and how to address that part of the risks. It does with Kathleen says it benefits. It, ties in development, some of the infrastructure it shares. There's common parts of the ore flow system, ventilation access we're driving three headings, starting very soon. And they all tie off of the development that's either off of the big DAS or off of drifting that goes back to GBC. The previous KL reserve had much more complex metallurgy and geology. Over the last couple of years, we changed our mine planning approached, we focused on what turned out to be much higher value material that was a little bit lower grade, but the material could be processed through our current mill. So that took away a lot balances that the previous kale mine plant had. We had to change our flotation circuit. We have much more of the environmental management with pyrite concentrate that would be generated. So this plan, it's above 0.9 Copper, 0.9 per ton gold. The times that Richard mentioned are very much driven by this 2041 dates that we're working on. And this deposit has a lot of growth, both on the same footprint that we're working out now and at deeper levels. So I feel like this is going to be our chance to take all the lessons learned. We're looking at the potential of applying electrical -- electric mining equipment there. So I think we get a fresh start with a lot of experience that's going to apply itself. And KL is going to benefit from it. And one thing I might add to it is with the SEK3 projects, we get up to a mill capacity of 240, that milligrand, somewhere around 220. So scale benefits somewhat off the mill capacity that they provide. And then as Richard and Kathleen mentioned, it just fits in nicely as the grades and some of the deposits thing to decline, kale comes up. And so we're able to adjust those other mine plans and room for kale to be that 90,000 ton producer. And want the grades at are better than the grades, for instance, at Deep MLZ."

And we've been able to take that with our downstream operations that we've inherited. And we've made incremental investments over time there, and they are very productive. And we can service not only the metallurgical, but the chemical industry and the lubricant industry very well. And as Kathleen says, we're definitely evaluating the next steps."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Richard Adkerson",
            "content": "Thanks to everyone. Thank you for joining our call. Really pleased to be able to review our strong performance for this quarter, where we are with the Company. It's a special time several years ago in call I said if we could be fortunate enough to ramp up our underground production at Gras berg at the same time, we had a positive copper market, it would be a great time for Freeport. And this is really a great time for us. We're going to focus on the future. But just one comment. I was last at jobsite two years ago in October, and we were just completing the mining of the open pit and starting to ramp up the Grasberg Block Cave. And so during this 2-year period, our progress has been nothing short of remarkable. And I really congratulate our team at job site but also in the Americas for what we've been able to accomplish even in the face of all the distractions and challenges that COVID brought on. I hope you and all your family and your colleagues are staying healthy. This thing's not over. We're keeping our guards up, I encourage you to as well. We have at Freeport, had a successful program to get vaccines to our people internationally. Over 90% of our people in South America are now vaccinated and 85% in Popolo and Indonesia are vaccinated. We continue to be challenged as some of our operations in the United States, which is come in across our country unfortunate. But we're encouraging our people and making some progress there. But the news is we've been able to meet the challenge of COVID and accomplished what we're reporting to you today. Our copper volumes have grown over 20% from a year ago, and that reflects this really exceptional execution of our business. With these prices that we have today, we're generating very strong margin. Our EBITDA doubled from a year ago. Our strong operating cash flows that Kathleen mentioned in the quarter are really exceptional. And particularly when you look at our capital expenditures, we're only $500 million. Now this is generating cash flows too. Now that we've met our debt target and we met that at the end of June, way ahead of what we anticipated at the beginning of the year, we're now focused on managing these cash flows and that's a happy time for us looking at investments for our long-term future. At the same time, we are being able to increase returns to shareholders and maintain a really strong balance sheet, which is going to be real hallmark of our Company going forward. Everybody is focused on carbon reduction, climate initiatives, and 26 coming up next month. It's going to be all over the papers. We published our second report on our climate initiatives. We put a lot more resources into it. We're really focused on it. As a Company compared with other natural resource Companies, we have much limited scope 3 emissions and other natural resources, and we're really focused on our scope 1 and 2 emissions, and have a plan to achieve targets that we believe are realistic and achievable. and the other 28 members of ICMM International Council, mining and metals, which I chair, have signed a commitment to work towards having zero net carbon emissions by 205. And everybody is working hard on it. We're also continuing to make progress to certify all of our operations with international copper associations, Copper Mart. And this clearly demonstrates our commitment to responsible production. You recall that I became chairman earlier this year. When that occurred, I made a real commitment to build the kind of board that the Company like ours really needs and deserves. We've added four new members in 2021. We added two this quarter., Marcela Donadio and Sara Lewis. That brings us to a total of eight independent directors, which have a broad range of experience. And it's going to be a real strength of our Company going forward. Underlying all of this is the fundamental outlook for coppers, incredibly favorable. Copper's role in the economy and as the economy changes with global investments and infrastructure, and I know we have a controversy here, but countries around the world are going to build infrastructure. Less-developed countries are going to develop. The world is getting increasingly focused on electrification with modern technology, 5G, and artificial intelligence. And then a new major element that people are talking about and recognizing now for demand that's coming, it's not here in real significance now, is all the investments that people are going to be making to reduce carbon. And across the board, those investments are result in significant demands for copper. And then you got, we'll talk about this more, commodity really supported by supply factors. I mentioned our climate report reported in September is on our website. I encourage you all to take a look at it. It really details work in much more comprehensive way than we did in our first report last year about how our Company will work to reduce green house gas emissions, and how we are approaching climate scenario analysis and reporting in line with recommendations of the task force and climate related financial disclosures. We are, as a Company and as an organization, firmly committed to this. We see it in our everyday lives with the forest fires and our operations in the West and hurricanes on the Gulf Coast, weather patterns all around the world. We all know we need to do this, and we're committed to do our part for our Company. And as I said, as the rest of the world, the rest of industry focuses on this, it's going to create a lot of copper demand. We established a car target to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions in Indonesia, about 30%, which is a new target for us. We have this aspirational goal of net zero by 2050. Our two big issues are 1. The coal power plant in Indonesia, lot of power required for our massive operations there. We're now investing in a dual fuel powered plant there. We're looking to a future of power being generated by biodiesel initially natural gas, looking at hydro-power opportunity. So we're working on that. And then the other major issue is how to convert our big haul truck fleet, massive trucks, diesel driven, to how to work with our suppliers and others in the industry to convert that to electrical powered or hydrogen powered vehicles. We'll hear a lot more about this in the -- we just know that our Company is committed to deal with our own emissions and to work with industry and communities in general to meet the things we need to meet with climate change. Copper's essential to that, just the strategic metal in many respects for the future. The world is getting increasingly electrified and more than 65% of the world's copper is used to deliver electricity. And when you look at electric vehicles, charging stations, clean power from wind, solar, all of these require significantly more copper to operate than the way that things are currently doing now. And so it's a challenging time for us and we're serious about this challenge but it is also a great opportunity for us as a responsible global copper producer. So we've got these rising demand and supply is a real issue for this industry. Even today, with the economic uncertainties in China and globally, copper inventories are remarkably low. The LME recently hit a 47 year-low. Shanghai was lower than it's been since 2009. And while we will be some new projects that were started 4 or 5 years ago, delayed by COVID coming on stream in the next couple of years, that will bring some new, new copper to the market. Beyond that, the coverage is pretty empty in terms of new supply projects of any significance. And the world today, the opportunities are smaller. They're more difficult to develop and produce. Permitting still requires a very long period of time.  And so the industry really 1. Has an issue with meeting the demand with supply. And that's going to require actions across a lot of fronts, more scrap, some substitution. But copper, as a commodity, is so much better than any alternatives that in whatever environment you can envision for the world going forward absent some doomsday situation in the global economy. It's just in a situation of where copper prices have to be strong, and in my view stronger than they are today. Turning to slide 7, what this means for our Company is with all the work we've done today in preparing our business and building our assets, we're going to have really significant margins in cash flows. Six years ago, our Company was facing real challenges and we worked our way through that very successfully. As we were working so hard and facing dealing with some real tough problems, in dealing with unsustainable debt level at that time. We all looked at ourselves and talked about the assets we had in our Company, the long-term assets, the quality of the team, our track record, our capabilities, and that's really what inspired us all to work so hard to get to where we are today. Copper volumes are 20%, gold volumes are 50% higher than they were a year ago and they'll be growing another 15%, 20% next year. It's a great feeling as we were ending the quarter and looking at September in particularly, to recognize that the capital and execution risk to achieve these higher volumes which we've been pointing to for a very long period of time, Those risks are behind us. The higher volumes are coming with low incremental cost. At copper prices from $4 to $5, we would generate annual EBITDA for the next couple of years on the order of $12.5 billion to $17 billion per year. And our capital expenditures, and we have a new project that we'll be talking about in Indonesia, including that our capital expenditures will range on the order of $2 to $2.5 billion a year. So that means we're where we're wanting to be, where we're targeting to, where we thought we would be. But the important part is, now we've done it, we're just not pointing to it. And slide 8 shows that this ramp up of the Grasberg Mine. man that was -- this slide looks like this was really a straight forward, easy to accomplish deal. There are challenges everyday out there. I'd say this is the most complicated mine in the world, when it was an open pit mine. And now in the industries historically, a historic, large underground mine, is,-- it is truly remarkable. In third quarter was 90% of our target annualized rate. We were at target in September. We're now on track to reach full rates metal production by the end of the year, and our team in Indonesia just needs to be congratulated and recognized for meeting all of these targets and strategically so important for us. And it was a real matter of concern back in March of 2020 when we had COVID facing this. It's easy on paper, but man, it's a challenge every day. And I had a great meeting with our team in advance of this call. The excitement, morale, and so forth is just exceptional. It's really something special for our Company. And we now look forward to taking the steps that we need to take to sustain this for the life of this. We're beginning to talk with the government and getting positive initial responses about extending our operating rights beyond 2041 Because of the ramp up, the limit of the operating rights, we haven't done much exploratory drilling, extension type core drilling. Our feeling and our confidence is there's a lot more resources beyond what we're developing now. And we're explaining that to the government. As I said, initial reactions is positive. And I'm confident that we will not be facing an end -- this operation 2041, that makes no sense for any stakeholder. We need to look at it to take advantage of the long-term resources available to us. Slide 9 talks about our growth of our Company. A real strength of Freeport is its large reserve base, 30, 35 years life in it. Proved and probable reserves, which gives us a sustainable ability of our operations for very long period of time. But beyond that, we have resources that are even larger than our reserves that are ground Fuel Resources, which is really important in the Americas Because that means that we are not trying to permit gain community approval to build new mines. We have great support for our communities. We've involved them. We share our benefits with them. And so as a result, we have these multiple options for long-term ground field, low-risk growth. And I'm really encouraged by the opportunities we had in United states where we have great community support. We have the benefit of strong communities and supporting schools, hospitals, education, great workforce, great community. We pay our people really well. We make sure they have living wages. And we're sensitive to them. So here we see across the board in Baghdad, in northwest Arizona, long reserve life, do a concentrated project, we can double production. Lone Star. You're going hear a lot about Lone Star in Freeport's future. This -- this resource has a long-term opportunity to be a flagship asset. It's just across the ridge from Morenci, the largest mine in North America. We honestly believe this can be another long-term Morenci. And It's got -- right now, we're having real success with our new oxide mine, we started this past year. It's expanding, we've got further expansions. We're able to make it economic by using available production facilities at our nearby Safford mine that's winding down. And then processing this oxide is really a stripping operation for this enormous sulfide deposit. going on now. There's a big sulfide resource there. It would be a big capital projects to build a mill with desalinization plant. We're looking at a number of alternatives there. Chile is going through a process of the government. The people assessing how they're going to tax and what's the fiscal regime is going to be for mining projects. We're going to wait to see how that plays out before making any investment decision. But in the meantime, we're getting more -- we're getting prepared, working with communities, working with -- preparing for permitting and so forth. This will be a project the world will ultimately need going forward. We've got a neat project. It's not very big in Europe with our landing copper smelter, where we're going to be recycling electronic equipment. This responds to people wanting to see this sort of thing happening. It's a way of generating some copper without carbon emissions of significance investments. And so we're looking for that and looking at other opportunities like that. And then this reaching the air in Indonesia is really special. I was actually out there in the 90s when we were driving the drift, which was a de -watering drift going underneath the Grasberg open pit. As we drive in the pit, we found this ore body. The engineers give our geologists a hard time about it because they literally pierce this ore body that we're not seeing previously that lives really go south flank of the Grasberg pit. And we've been working on getting the right mine plan, the timing part. In the context of if you turn to slide 10, you can see where it's located. It's an ore body that's in a separate mineralization zone from our DOZ, and Grasberg pit. It's along fault line. It may have resources adept. It has some complicated geology and mineralogy, but this is a big mine. If 90,000 tons a day block cave, you only think of that. It is not being a huge mine because it's next the Grasberg Block Cave. But just like 60% size of Deep MLZ, 40% the size of Grasberg Block Cave, 350 million tons of ore, good copper and gold grades, 90,000 tons a day from a block cave. That's big by global standards. And it's going to occur over a number of years. It will help sustain our high level of low cost production out of Grasberg, 500 million pounds of copper a year, 500,000 ounces of gold, when it's ramped up in 2030. Capital expenditures going to be spent over a number of years. Use existing infrastructure. Just to ask your goal analysts, how they feel if gold Companies were to announce that gold mines was $500,000 a year in 500 million pounds of copper year. This is a significant opportunity for us. 12, I mentioned Lonestar. You can see how we're ramping up the oxides. We've got 2-3 reserves about 5.5 billion pounds. The real price here is sulfides underlying it. We've done some drilling to identify that we're doing preliminary plans and process it and so forth. Mineral potential is 50 billion pounds -- 50 billion pounds. This is a long-term opportunity, but we're a long-term Company. And this is going to be a flagship opportunity for us going forward. Another area that's emerging, and our guys in this call are really excited about it, is new opportunities to apply technology to leaching. Now, and Freeport predecessors were long leaders in leaching going back to the very start of SX - EW leaching. The opportunities globally for traditional SX - EW leaching are diminishing, because they've been accessed and taken advantage of it. But this opens up a whole new round of opportunities for us that had production with limited capital and low carbon emissions. This will range from looking at a series of additives and approaches for existing leached tax, which would allow us to recover more from those. We're also really getting excited by using these data analytics efforts that we started several years ago. To apply those to leach tax and know more about what we're doing, what the consequences are of taking certain actions. So it's a combination of things, there are several alternatives we're looking at. The opportunities are really significant. Our guys estimate we had almost 40 billion pounds of copper in our existing stock piles. This is not -- this has already been mined. It's mountain reserves and resources, and any production plant. If we can record -- if we're going to cover just a piece of this, it's a size of a new mine. Low capital, low operating costs, low carbon footprint. A lot of this is at Morenci, but there are other places. And it could even apply to some old historical mines that have old lead stacks that we can use it for. It's an emerging thing. But we are excited about it, and our Company's particularly well situated to take advantage of that because of the history that we've had with these older mines and what this could mean for it. So this is a stay tuned deal. We're not building in our plans yet. But just like a development project, low capital, low-cost, low carbon. So it's really good. So listen, we're just feeling great about Freeport. I mean, we just -- we've been to the awards together. Our team is -- we're adding some really new resources to our team despite COVID, we're bringing in support. We got young people in our organization stepping up to leadership positions. You know, it's a dynamic Company. It's remarkable that through all the trials and tribulations went through, we had very limited numbers of people to leave us. Our people look at each other and we're inspired by each other, and it's just great. Strong cash flows. We're going to be responsible. We have this great track record of doing all this. If you look at our success, we've had in developing projects all around the world, different kinds of mining, different kinds of processing technology. Market outlook is great, you got these organic growth opportunities. And really as a shareholder myself, the prospects of seeing returns on those shareholders coming of significance is just a great feeling. So I hope you can -- sense how we feel about our Company and our outlook, and really appreciate your interest. And I'm going to turn it over to Kathleen before we open up for questions. Yeah. Michael, I raised this question with our team getting ready for this because quite frankly when I saw the out years I was pleasantly surprised because of everything you're reading just generally about things. But you know, the currency rates are helping us and these background of credits or aren't really important to us. And of course in Indonesia, their gold is growing and Molybdenum is doing well. And our team has just done a great job in managing these things. We benefit because Freeport manages America's business as one business. We operate all the mines that we operate, and we have incredibly good relationships with suppliers. We're premium customer for all of our major suppliers. So some we're watching and we're -- some of our costs are correlated to copper prices. So it's a factor, but I was struck. I was expected to be more, quite frankly, myself. And it's turning out to be in our plans. Usually it's just more a question of how quickly this is developed. When we set the policy, we were anticipating meeting our debt target sometimes out in the future. And it happened so quickly. Business has gone so well. We've added new board members. And so we accept much earlier, a process that would result in this being addressed after the beginning of the year when we got our annual results. And so we'll be talking with our board about it. We are also having engagements with a number of our significant shareholders about stock buybacks and dividends. From the traditional thinking, it is seems to be shifting some. But it's nothing about reluctance about the future that's causing us to do that. And we have regular scheduled board meetings and we talk about it every board meeting. So it's just more of a question of how we set process early on. And clearly we're making progress much faster because of markets, but also because of our execution than we had anticipated. And so it's a good situation, but that's why we are where we are. Yeah. All of us are, Emily, but thanks. I want to tell you today that when Mark -- the original reserve, as Mark said, had all this material and our gold recovers are very low and processing is complicated. And dealing with the Pyrite tails was real complicated. I was just so impressed with Mark and his mine planning team came in with this new plan, which makes it much more traditional, much less risky, much less capital intensive, and in fact, created more value. Because originally we were only getting 50% recovery out of that pyrite laden gold and ore. So it's a great example of having really good mine planning theme and lead by mark. It's pretty consistent. Because we develop most of the access and ventilation and all those sorts of things, it's not chunky. This is -- -- more or less mine development. And that occurs on a regular pattern. The answer -- the answer is yes. It just fits in really well with great changes with our existing mines. It just folds right in. It's a sustainability of production projects as opposed to a significant growth project. And Chris, to put that in perspective, way back in the 1990s when we were designing the Grasberg open pit and looking forward to life beyond the pit, our original targets was a 120,000 tons states we can mill. So over time, this amazing ore body is allowing us to go from anticipated a 120,000 ton per day mill rate from the underground to 240,000 tons from the underground. Just to put it in perspective. That's again, Chris, question I've been asking our team all along. In a prior life, I actually worked with the first Company out in Houston that is a very first fracking operations for the whole oil and gas industry way back in 80s. And so I've asked that question. And while it's a tremendous opportunity and particularly good for our Company considering the nature of our stockpiles and the history of our operations in the way we've dealt with low grade, this will be beneficial. People are really going to be pursuing it. There are -- is not just one technology is being pursued, but a series of different options. So it's an evolving story. It's not likely to be the account of game changer that fracking was in the oil and gas business. So that -- I kind of hate people who say that's a good question. And some people will say it all the time, but that is real good question. And it's something that is really underappreciated right now. And we're particularly focused on it within ICMM, because here we had the 28 largest mining companies, we represent about a third of the global mining industry, unanimously, making this commitment. And as I said, with Freeport, because of our limited scope, three emissions, it's not as big a challenge as it is for some other miners and resource companies. But we don't know yet what the cost of this is going to be. And it's going to be significant. There's just no way around it. Met with senior management caterpillar and to try to think about designing 400 ton haul trucks, we can make the grades of these big pits that we have. The battery in those, at this current level of technology is changing, but then battery weighs a time. It's life is very short, so you've got to deal with all the recharging and trying systems and so forth. So there are lots of unknowns here. There's no question it's going to involve a lot of costs. And right now, while people are really making these commitments in good faith, they're doing it at a time, and we talked about this in our climate report, of where it's going to rely on technology advances and some of those things there's more questions than answers and with all that right now. We have a good -- I think we've got our arms around converting the Coal Plant in Indonesia, and that's one of our big things. But the questions is how do you deal with halogen electrifying shovels and -- I know our shovels are already electric, but just light vehicles and so forth. In our underground mines, we have a big electric train helping us deliver ore, but there would have to be some investments there. So it's going to be an unfolding story and you raised the point that people following us and companies in our industry ought to really be tracking. Because as we sit here today, there's more questions than answers in that area. I just want to add on to that. That's going to be another factor. That's going to be a barrier to supply development in the copper business. I mean, low grade end-of-life mines -- And we got 30 years or so to have this on wine. But it's going to affect mine life. It's going to affect the economics of project development. All of those things are going to come into play. So in your list of items that are are barriers to supply development, this is a factor that you can add to it. Yeah. We were moving 800 thousand to a million metric tones a day in that open pit mine. Think about that. We still don't have to move material around to manage waste and deal with our tailing system and so forth. But that's a big change. But we've got plans in developing new mines in the world. This is kind of a conundrum. The world needs more copper and yet more copper until technology breaks through, is going to result in more carbon emissions. And this is not the only industry where that's an issue that's unknown right now. But it's certainly true in our industry. Well, I'll let others answer. We will have capex for Lonestar with this oxide, cause we're expanding to oxide. We started out at a certain level and we're stepping it up. But Kathleen, you were are calling somebody? I'm going to put an exclamation point to what Kathleen just said about Baghdad. Because going back to the early 2000, there was just a feeling that higher prices would bring production. I mean that's been the history of the copper industry. But here we are at Baghdad where we already have the reserves. We have established operations, full support of the community, and we're just talking about shortening the reserve life by building a new concentrate. And that's five years out. That's as a easy a project as you're going to find in this industry. So that's what I was just saying. This coming situation, absent some doomsday global economic situation, there's just going to be a time when the world is going to be very short of copper. It's excluded. And you need to keep that in mind because that is a PT-FI project. It's good. That was one of the goals I was trying to achieve when we were negotiating all of this back in 2018, is we consolidate PT-FI. The economics of -- and so that will show up as consolidated debt for us. But if it's financed at the subsidiary level, the obligation is going to be shared by the 2 shareholders; FCX and MIND ID. It will go into PT-FI's tax calculations. So the project will be something that will affect PT-FI 's taxes. When you step back from that Indonesian operations, I would really please -- I don't know if any of you review the Indonesia media coverage, but they just had these athletic games in Papua, where the president was there and senior government people. They had the ground breaking. I have never in 30 years seeing such positive comments in the media in Indonesia about Freeport, as we saw with this. And the president is recognizing what a great investment country made when they bought out Rio Tinto's joint venture interest in 2018. We've already started paying dividends. The dividends are going to be really spectacular for the government going forward. And when you look at the government's equity position, their 51% share of equity, which will step up to that in stages. You look at the tax rate, we have royalties, we pay. You look at the payments that are made for inter-Company transfers to FCX. The government's economic interest in the project. We exceed 70%. We were able to retain through the negotiations, the interest we had going into it. So this is truly something that all the parties are very happy with. And what a release it is to be working in Indonesia and not have to deal with the kind of complications we had for so many years. So with your first question, Kathleen help me. Well, let me just say though. We give a five-year outlook for PT-FI's production. And is that in the press release or was that -- Okay. So Carlos, just follow that and you can see that is we said before, this is more of a question of sustaining production levels as opposed to a growth project. But you can see what we show for five years, and that will give you a view of the trend going forward. Now, with respect to your second question, it's really early stages. But we have broached it. I've talked with senior government people about it, and our partner MIND ID, the state-owned Company under the auspices of the minister state of enterprises, everybody recognizes the mutual benefits. For sure the government like a bigger interest. But think about the complications of that because with an extension, we will want to start, as Mark said, we've got opportunities to KL and elsewhere to invest and we will make those investments in advance of 2041. And so we have to balance out how you share those costs, where we basically have 50% economics of new investment, with what's our interest going to be going forward. So that's early days to be discussed. Tried to raise it earlier, but it was just not possible to get traction on those discussions. But the logic and benefits to all stakeholders for finding a way forward on this are clear cut. The alignment between FCX and the government is really good. To have the kind of incentives for both parties to have a win-win, that's what really we tried to design in 2018. And that's really what's happened. To be clear on KL -- yeah, Kathleen. Those economics are baked into 2041? So they're not dependent on extension. What the opportunity is is to make the KL bigger and to find other resources because we really have done very limited delineation type exploration work in a number of years. And so we don't know the answers, but we're optimistic that there's resources there that we don't know about yet. And the best answer is for projects like this to not have a time frame, but to have incentives for all the parties to work to maximize the resources over the long term. Time frames make no sense. But I want to be clear. The KL economics are not dependent on an extension -- the current project. Well, we benefited at Freeport because there's some very significant investments in that Molybdenum business prior to our acquisition of Phelps Dodge. And then creating the processing facilities capabilities -- And Mike Kendrick is on the line. He can chip in on this, but rather than just being a metal producer and a byproduct producer, the past efforts created a really sustainable in this global leading business of where we're able to maximize the value of our ore resources in Colorado from our Molybdenum mines through the bi-product credits in North America and South America. And we can expect those to come with expansion projects and more. And so we were able to generate higher than the metal price value for Molybdenum back processing as a chemical products. And we run this thing as a business. It obviously ebbs and flows with the price of Molybdenum. Today's price look out 3 or 4 years and a lot of cash coming out of that business. But it's strategically important to us. We just got a great team. It's a global team. They work together very well. Colorado is a state where you've got -- all states are, but you got to be very careful about environmental management. City of Denver gets maybe 10% of its drinking water off the Climax mountain. And so it's a business that goes back 100 years, more than a 100 years for our predecessors and is strategically very important. And now, it's generating cash. Mike, you want to add anything? Josh? Thanks, Brian. Thanks, Alex. Well, I got to discipline my comments with those questions. The world we live in. Chile is separate from Peru. And it's got a really, a lot of questions about it right now. It's driven by this wide spread feeling within the country of people as things were happening around the world dealing with income inequalities and social programs versus other government initiatives and so forth. And it's got a complicated election coming up. There's no clear-cut front runner right now. There's processes going on within the parliament within issues related to consideration of constitutional changes. And so it's really, from my perspective, muddy waters there. It's not chronically nearly as significant as Peru in terms of El Abra 's production is a small part of our production, but it is affecting our consideration of expansion. But we're working with the industry. We're not we're -- not top of the charts in terms of production there, so we're working with others on it. In Peru, Peru always, consistently has complicated presidential politics. And we've seen this story before, where a less leaning candidate gets into office and runs on platforms that are very much addressing -- getting more money out of mining companies. And President Castillo ran on that platform. He had the backing of the far left wing parties there. I've got to meet him within this past month. He came to Washington. It was a Sunday before and with a small group of mining executives, had dinner with him. And my first time to meeting -- he comes from a nonpolitical leader background. He was a teacher in the interior for Peru. And when he talked to the set and I, I found him to be very compelling in his emotional feelings about doing more to help the people from the region where he came from but also throughout Peru. The poor people in terms of education and so forth. And I didn't know what to expect when I went there. I had better feeling than I had going into it. He listened. I had the chance to have exchanges about different issues. None of us got into details about specific fiscal proposals and so forth. But he emphasized that he recognized the importance of mining place in Peru. And that's what always happens when people get an office to achieve social programs. They see how much mining contributes to the country financially. And that's needed to do other things. So I'm having a lot of conversations with other CEOs of countries that operate in Peru. After that meeting, he revamped his cabinet at the very upset of this administration and replaced a very aggressive guy that was prime minister. And so it's really wait and see thing, but I'm more encouraged about it. We're working with others in the industry. We need to be responsive. Here's concerns, and that's what I'm trying to. We focus all of our -- almost all of our community programs on the regions where we operate. I think we've got to take a broader view and show people in the interior that mining can help their lives. And so that's what I'm working on right now. And so I am more optimistic now than I was during the election. You'll hear different views by different miners there. People are very concerned, rightly so. Our situation is we have a new stability agreement. We're maximizing the operations at Cerro Verde. It's a big producer. A major contributor to our volumes. It's got the world's largest mine site, concentrate facilities. We have great relationships with the local community. So we want to build off that and try to reach out and find some common ground work for President Castillo. But it's uncertain. Man, what about the U.S? What can you say? I mean, It's just a head scratcher about what also is going on in Washington these days. The current administration recognizes the importance of minerals like copper to achieve their goals of climate change, And yet, I don't expect them to lessen up any requirements for permitting environmental management community issues runs against their political situation. So it's really uncertain. We're all hopeful we'll see some steps towards infrastructure building. The country really needs it. You see it in ports and roads, and bridges all over the country. But I just don't have any comment on the political situation other than be distressed about it. And we also need to have a more thoughtful approach to relationships with China in this country. And that's a byproduct parties and issue and it's a complicated one. But China is going to be important part of our world going forward and the country is too big and people are very smart. They work hard and they create a lot of economic loss of these. So anyway, I'm focused staying out of politics and focused on Freeport. Well Kathleen, I thought, going into this thing, we had such a good quarter, we'd have a real short call, but I really appreciate your good questions. As always, there a lot of complicated issues to face with -- I woke up this morning, feeling on top of the world and then I opened my screen to see for the first in a number of days, a weekday in the market and I said, that was just God's way of reminding me about the business for him. But we couldn't be more po -- I think you get -- I hope you get the sense, not just for me, but from our whole team of just how good we feel about what we've done. And we're not going to focus on what we've done. We're focusing on where we go from here. And it's a long-range business. This is a long range Company. We don't feel any pressure to do -- to do anything from any kind of M&A standpoint, the overly aggressive and new investment decisions. We're going to approach this in a very straightforward, logical way. And in the meantime, make a lot of money and show shareholders some gratitude for sticking with us and being part of our Company. So thank you all. If you have follow-up questions, as always, let me and David know, and we will be responsive."

            "content": "Great. Thank you. And good morning, everyone. And welcome to the Freeport McMoRan conference call. Earlier this morning, we reported our third quarter 2021 operating and financial results and a copy of today's press release and the slides are available on our website at fcx.com. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet. And anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include Forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials, and to the risk factors described in FCX 's SEC filings. On the call with me today are Richard Adkerson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mark Johnson, our CEO of Indonesia, Josh Olmsted, Chief Operating Officer for the Americas, Steve Higgins, our Chief Administrative Officer, Rick Coleman, who runs our engineering and construction business, And Mike Kendrick who runs a Molybdenum business. I will start by briefly summarizing our financial results, and then we'll turn the call over to Richard, who will go through the materials in our slide presentation materials. After our formal remarks, we'll take your questions. Today, FCX reported third quarter 2021 net income attributable to common stock of 1.4 billion. That was $0.94 per share. And adjusted net income attributable to common stock of 1.3 billion or $0.89 per share. The $0.89 per share excludes net credits totaling $0.05 a share primarily associated with tax credits related to the release evaluation allowances at PT Freeport, Indonesia and a gain on the sale of FCX 's remaining cobalt business. The details of our adjusted net income are reflected in our press release on page roman numeral 7, we generated adjusted EBITDA for the Third quarter of roughly $3 billion. And we've got a reconciliation of the EBITDA on page 37 of our slide deck. Favorable results in the third quarter reflects strong execution by our team, growing our production volumes safely, efficiently, and responsibly. Our sales volumes for the quarter for copper exceeded a billion pounds that approximated our prior estimate in July of 2021 and was above the year-ago period. Gold sales of 400,000 ounces for approximately 12% higher than our prior estimate and also significantly above the year-ago period. We also benefited from positive pricing for copper. Our third quarter average realized copper price was 420 per pound. That was substantially above the year-ago period. And gold prices were slightly below the year-ago period. We also benefited from improved Molybdenum prices in the quarter, where prices nearly doubled from the year-ago period. Net unit cash costs were $1.24 per pound in the third quarter. That was lower than our estimate going into the period. And we had some good performance from our leach production, which reduced our unit production cost in the period. Generated strong cash flows and we've been doing that every quarter this year. Generating $2 billion of operating cash flow, which exceeded capital spending of roughly 500 million during the quarter. Our balance sheet is strong. We ended the quarter with consolidated debt of 9.7 billion and consolidated cash of 7.7 billion, which resulted in net debt of $2 billion. We had no borrowings under our credit facility and have $3.5 billion available. We also announced today some liability management where we called for redemption. Our outstanding notes due 2022, that has a total principal amount of 524 million. I now want to turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to the slide presentation materials. Richard go ahead. Great. Thank you, Richard. I'm just going to cover some brief comments on financial and operating matters and then we'll open up for questions. Starting on Slide 16, we provide some additional details on our operating activities. Richard mentioned Lonestar, and the performance there has been really strong. Our operations are exceeding our design capacity, which was originally 200 million pounds. We're exceeding that now by 25%, and we're continuing to optimize and planning for the next increment of production from Oxides as we study the longer-term opportunities. Richard mentioned the leach work that we're doing. It's a major focus at Morenci. We have a big effort underway to enhance recoveries and we're deploying a very -- a variety of initiatives. Some of these have already produced results. And that did enable us to increase expected recovery from some of our leach material in the third quarter. And what this does, is it gets us more volumes but also allows us to reduce unit costs, having a bigger pool to spread costs over. So that's a really positive thing and more to come there. We've incorporated some of this into our plans, but we're optimistic that additional copper pounds can be added as we go forward. At Morenci, we're continuing to work to increase mining rates. We're targeting getting up to 900,000 tons of material per day in 2023. That's a major undertaking. It's 30% higher than where we were in 2012. As we reported, we have started -- we started the historic Morenci Mill, which had been idled since the first half of 2020, and that's proceeding. We started the mill and the third quarter. We did experience some delays, but those are largely behind us. We also had as probably a lot of you've seen the the weather conditions in the Southwest that we experienced this summer. We did experience severe wet weather and some power issues during monsoon season, and we always have monsoon season. But this this year was more severe than normal and that did impact some of our operations in the third quarter. And again, that's behind us as well. I want to just echo what Richard said about our team in South America. The team has overcome significant challenges in dealing with the pandemic. We've been operating at about 95% of capacity over the last several months, and that's in the face of still restrictions on movement around and our team just does great work in managing this and being creative about how to manage it safely. We're optimistic that as we look forward into 2022, maybe the government restrictions can be lifted safely and we can return to a more normal operating environment there and achieve higher rates at Cerro Verde. El Abra mine in Chile is making great progress. We're increasing the stacking rate of material where we're storing production that we had curtailed during 2020. And we're focused on sustaining a level of production and elaborate in the 200-250 million pound per year range, as we look to potentially expand that as we go forward. Richard talked about the terrific results at Grasberg. Team there is just continuing to deliver results quarter-after-quarter. We expect to be at our quarterly run rate for metal beginning here in the fourth quarter. And for the next several quarters, we project the mill will run at about a 175,000 tons per day, until 2023, when we install the new SAG Mill, which is currently under construction. And that will support higher rates as we continue to ramp up the Grasberg Block Cave And the Deep MLZ and then make room for the Kucing Liar project that Richard mentioned. A lot of talk right now about inflation. Our team is really focused on cost management and efficiency projects. We're focused on extending equipment lines, ways to improve our energy efficiency, ways to efficiently implement maintenance practices and really use technology in all of this. We have like everyone else experienced some cost increases. Those have really principally been associated with the energy price increases. To a lesser extent, we've had some other impacts on our consumables, the impact of steel prices on some of our consumables. We've had higher sulfuric acid costs, freight costs. But we really want to send appreciation to our global supply chain team. They are doing excellent work in keeping our operations stocked with critical supplies and managing in these uncertain times. And they've just done an outstanding job in keeping our business business continuity going. I will note that we have seen very strong prices in Molybdenum and those have more than offset some of these inflationary pressures we've had on the cost side. Turning to the smelter. On Slide 17, we provide an update of our activities with the Greenfield smelter we're developing in and the work we're doing with our partner at PT Smelting to expand the facility there. We were focused on completing this project as efficiently, as timely as possible. We're advancing the engineering in commercial arrangements. And we've commenced preparing the land for construction. You probably have seen in press reports that the president of Indonesia recently visited the site in a groundbreaking ceremony. And that just indicates the significance of this project to the country. We've got a billion-dollar bank credit facility in place for PT-FI to use to advance the projects. And we are going to plan additional debt financing for the project, which can be obtained at attractive rates just on the project long term. As we previously discussed, the long-term costs for the financing for the smelter will essentially be offset by a phase out of the 5% export duty. So the economic impact to PT-FI is not material. And this is a project that is shared 51% by our shareholder of PT-FI, shareholder MIND ID in the balance of FCX. Turning to our volumes, and Richard talked about the growth in volumes, we've had great success and execution. We've got our three-year outlook listed on Slide 18. And this is generally consistent with our previous guidance. We made some relatively minor adjustments to the fourth quarter of 2021. But you'll see here that the execution of our plan is on track. We'll share one on Slide 19, the strong cash flow generation of this business. We've got very significant free cash flows using our volume and cost estimates and prices ranging from $4 to $5 copper. Holding gold flat at $1,800 and Molybdenum at current prices around $19 per pound. The real growth in our volumes with low incremental costs and show EBITDA ranging from $12.5 billion per annum on average for 2022 and 2023 at $4 copper and 17 billion if $5 copper as Richard has mentioned. And operating cash flows, and this is net of tax, ranges from $9 billion to over $12 billion, which provides significant cash flows not only to invest in our business and fund programs, grow our business, but also increase capital returns to investors. Our capital spending plans are detailed on the next slide, slide 20. You'll see here that we reduced our outlook for 2021 for capital spending from $2.2 billion previously to $2.2 billion and that excludes the smelter investment. But that reflects really timing. We've had really a timing issue in getting these projects going and so that would just -- some of that falling over into 2022. We've also added the -- in our forecast plans to commence development of the Kucing Liar ore body that Richard mentioned previously. So you're talking about $9 to $12 billion of operating cash flows and capex below $3 billion. Very strong free cash flow. We've got growing volumes, strong markets, low capital requirements. And that's really allowed us just over the past 12 months to reduce our debt, our net debt by nearly $6 billion. And so we're down now to $2 billion in net debt. I know some of you remember a time when it was multiples of this. And so we're in a great situation from a balance sheet standpoint. Our credit metrics are extremely strong and it positions us well as we go forward to invest in future growth and increase our payouts to shareholders. The last Slide 22, refers to our financial policy. It is centered around our strong balance sheet. The combination of the strong balance sheet and the success in growing our volumes will put us in a strong position. Our board had established earlier this year a policy that provides for up to 50% of free cash flow to be used for shareholder returns with the balance available for growth and further balance sheet improvements. With the achievement of our net debt targets, we look forward to the implementation of this policy. We expect our board will determine the structure and size of additional payouts to shareholders with our annual results. And this will be something that we update and it gets reviewed periodically. So that concludes our remarks. We look forward to reporting our progress and continuing to build on our momentum as we go forward. And operator, we'd now like to turn the call over for questions. We've built into our projections current levels of energy costs. We do have a coal contract in Indonesia that is done annually. But for the most part, our energy costs are floating with the market. Because of the volume increase that we're expecting next year and that really we've got a big fixed cost business, so it comes at a low cost. We are projecting that our unit costs will decline year-on-year from '21 to '22, and we've got additional growth. So while costs inflation is a factor for us, it's being managed well and producing volumes at low incremental costs will help us drive costs lower in the place -- in the face of rising inflation. And there's no hesitation, Emily, on this. We just got to implement it. David, on the capex, like our rather Block caves, is spread out over a long period of time. So it'll start out next year somewhere in the and so that's done over approximate 10-year period. And the production will come on to seek when that all this is sequenced together, but the production will come on to sequence when we have availability in the mill, as we have some declines with other ore bodies. But Mark, if you want to give some background about KL. As Richard was saying, this is just a natural progression for us. It gives us really a place to continue to use all, everything we learned from Deep MLZ and Grasberg Block Cave to extend that to KL. And so we're -- we think it's a natural time to begin transitioning to develop another ore body there. It'll average around that. Thanks, Chris. great. One of the other things to keep in mind in Indonesia is we have -- with the transition to underground when we were mining and at the surface, we had to move both ore and waste to get the metal production here on the ground. It's very efficient. You're with the block-caving and you really just mining ore and so it is more efficient. As Richard said, we've got some electrical applications underground. Mark talked about expanding that as we as we look at new developments in KL. So there are some benefits that we have in Indonesia from the change from surface mining to our underground mining. It will be a small amount of capital in 2022. And at Baghdad, we're really jsut advancing feasibility next year. We're thinking Baghdad is probably still five years out or so before we will have production. And so you won't have meaningful capex for another couple of years associated with it. And Lone Star, the next increment of expansion is relatively low in terms of capital intensity. The longer-term opportunity is more 20, 30 type, but it's meaningful. The big thing that we really were focused on is growth through these low capital intensive opportunities to get more out of what we already have, either through automation or this leach technologies that we're pursuing. And so that's really where we can impact things in the short-term. Yeah. Well, just to be clear on KL -- I'm going, Richard. Brian, we do have opportunities to increase primary Molly production at the Climax mine. If you think about what the big deficits people are talking about in copper, there could be mounting deficits in Mali at some point. And so we want to be in a position -- and that's what our primary mines can do, is It's need market demand. And we've got -- we had curtailed capacity in the past to match up with markets. And now we have the opportunity potentially to increase. And so we're going to be doing some mine stripping and that sort of thing to be positioned so that the markets are there, we can be there to participate with this quality product that the market wants. So we're looking at all of that, and Mike, if you want to add something to that. Thanks, Brian. He's right."

In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today\u2019s call, and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today.  Before we begin our comments, we\u2019d like to remind everyone that today\u2019s press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. I\u2019d like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings. On the call with me today Richard Adkerson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Johnson, our Chief Operating Officer for Indonesia; Josh Olmsted, our Chief Operating Officer for the Americas; Mike Kendrick, who leads our molybdenum business; Rick Coleman, who leads our construction and growth projects; and Steve Higgins, our Chief Administrative Officer. I\u2019ll start by briefly summarizing our financial results, and then we\u2019ll turn the call over to Richard who\u2019ll review our outlook and the slide presentation materials that have been provided to you. As usual after our remarks we\u2019ll open up the call for questions. Today, FCX reported second quarter 2021 net income attributable to common stock of $1.08 billion, or $0.73 per share. That included net charges totaling $56 million or $0.04 per share, detailed on page Roman numeral seven of our press release. Adjusted net income attributable to common stock totaled $1.14 billion or $0.77 per share. Our adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2021 totaled $2.7 billion. And you can find a reconciliation of our EBITDA calculations on Page 35 of our slide deck materials. We had a strong second quarter, our copper sales of 929 million pounds, and gold sales of 305,000 ounces were significantly above the year ago quarter. But our sales were approximately 5% lower for copper and 8% lower for gold relative to our recent estimates, primarily reflecting the timing of shipments from Indonesia. Our annual guidance is consistent with our prior estimates. Our results in the second quarter benefited from strong pricing. Our second quarter average realized copper price of $4.34 a pound was 70% higher than a year ago quarterly average. Our net unit cash costs of $1.48 per pound of copper on average in the second quarter, with slightly above our estimate going into the quarter of $1.42 per pound, but that primarily related to nonrecurring charges associated with a new four-year labor agreement at Cerro Verde. Operating cash flow generation was extremely strong, totaling $2.4 billion during the quarter. That included $0.5 billion of working capital sources. And our operating cash flows significantly exceeded our capital expenditures of $433 million during the quarter. Our consolidated debt totaled $9.7 billion at the end of June, and our consolidated cash and cash equivalents totaled $6.3 billion at the end of June. Net debt was $3.4 billion at the end of the quarter and we achieved our targeted net debt level several months ahead of our schedule. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Richard and we\u2019ll be reviewing the slide materials that have been provided. Go ahead, Richard.\nRichard Adkerson: Thank you, Kathleen. Thanks, everybody for joining us. We are really pleased to reporting what\u2019s now becoming a string of really strong operating performances for our company. And with this great positive outlook for our business, we\u2019re all really enthusiastic about it. Hoping all of you are staying healthy through this pandemic. Vaccinations are giving us an opportunity to protect ourselves and those around us and we\u2019re working hard to encourage our people globally to take full advantage of this opportunity whenever possible. Our teams are working safely. We remained diligent with our COVID protocols that have been so effective. With the recent rise in cases globally we are refocusing, redoubling our efforts, restoring some protocols that we had listed \u2013 we had loosened to keep our team and community safe. Our results in the second quarter demonstrate really strong execution of our plans, really strong and favorable pricing for our products. Kathleen mentioned the shipping issue, logistics is an issue globally, if we\u2019ve been able to \u2013 we basically met or slightly exceeded our production targets. We\u2019ve been able to ship everything we produced. We would have beat our sales targets. We also common the mining industry had some one-off type issues affecting production. Without those and with shipping, we would have had a real strong beat on our previous guidance. Really important our Grasberg underground ramp-up is proceeding on schedule. This is a remarkable, and I would say a historic success for both our company and even the mining industry. Our team in Indonesia is doing remarkable and outstanding work and this is building value for our shareholders in long-term sustainable, low cost values for the future. Production, we\u2019re making money in the Americas, copper prices, production in the U.S. is increasing. Our Lone Star project in Eastern Arizona is really exciting. We have a series of ongoing value enhancing opportunities in the U.S., in front of us, and I\u2019m personally really encouraged about future growth in the U.S. In South America, our teams in Peru and Chile, are navigating the pandemic, effectively, we\u2019re restoring production that we have curtailed a year ago. We have achieved these outstanding financial results made possible by the hard work and investments we\u2019ve been making for many years. We\u2019re now generating significant cash flows, which will be sustainable for years in the future. This quarter alone, we had $2 billion of cash flow after capital spending. That\u2019s just remarkable considering where we were just a year ago. Kathleen mentioned, and it\u2019s notable that we reached our debt target, several months earlier than our forecast earlier this year. We ended the quarter with $3.4 billion of net debt. That\u2019s within the targeted range, we said of $3 to $4 billion. We reduced our debt by like 60% over the past year. We\u2019re now positioned in accordance with a financial policy that our board adopted earlier this year, and that we disclose to the market to shift our capital allocation priorities by increasing cash returns to shareholders. As we make discipline investments for future growth of our business. This policy will allow us to maintain a strong balance sheet with high grade credit metrics, while providing cash for increasing shareholder returns, and investing in our company\u2019s long-term future. Slide 4, talks about how we\u2019re devoting significant attention and resources to sustainability initiatives. And this has always been key to our company and our tradition of our company. We are committed to the sustainability principles of ICMM. We\u2019re also moving to certify all of our operations with a Copper Mark, a relatively new industry framework developed by the International Copper Association to ensure responsible production consistent with UN\u2019s sustainability development goals. Today, we lead the industry with six of our operations now certified. In the second quarter, we submitted five additional operating sites to this initiative, and we\u2019ve committed to validate all of our sites to this robust framework. Responsible production is critical in building and maintaining trust, which we\u2019ve earned over the years through long-standing partnerships with communities as we delivered a product copper value by society produced and safe, environmentally sound, innovative manner. Slide 5 talks about electrification, which is key to copper. Majority of copper goes into generating and transmitting electricity, and copper is critical in every aspect of achieving low-carbon goals for the global economy. This ranges from electric vehicles and supported infrastructure to clean energy from wind and solar copper is just simply essential to a green economy. This transition is now just beginning to unfold. It will add significantly to future demand for copper. And as the global leading copper producer Freeport is solidly positioned to benefit from this higher future demand. In addition, now companies around the world are responding to COVID with aggressive fiscal and monetary policies. This alone is creating important near-term copper demand beyond China. China\u2019s consumption remains strong, there\u2019s a mixed economic signals, but even with that demand for copper in China is strong and now it\u2019s higher consumption is being generated from economic recovery in developed countries around the world. And that\u2019s even in the face of an important sector of copper demand automobiles, which is being constrained by this chip problem. So this increasingly important incremental demand outside China, the long-term growth from global \u2013 from growth in emerging markets just as very positive for our outlook. Copper demand is also expanding from technology advances and communications, artificial intelligence applications, expanding connectivity through global infrastructure initiatives and efforts to improve health through using copper to fight viruses and other infections. Slide 6 talks about this growing demand, the global challenges and maintaining much less growing supply makes the outlook for copper compelling. I would say compelling is an understated word and really positive and enthusiastic about it. This recent pullback and copper pricing that we\u2019ve seen, is not altered in any way our conviction of the favorable long-term outlook for copper. This is a decision we made years ago, which underscores our strategy of Freeport to focus on copper, because of its favorable fundamentals, the nature of our assets, and our team. There are always actions that influence sentiment and short-term pricing at any point in time. But beyond that indisputable facts support a positive fundamental outlook for copper. Demand growth is inevitable, maintaining supply or growing supplies challenged, our prices will be required to support major new investments in copper, rising demand scarcity of supplies point to large impending structural deficit supporting much higher future copper prices. Our company has high quality assets, industry-leading experience, highly motivated team will allow us to benefit from these fundamentals. Portfolio of assets in copper business is rare, and not unique in our industry would be difficult not impossible to replicate these assets. With strong growing production, embedded Brownfield, low-risk growth from our large portfolio of undeveloped resources, our assets are extremely valuable in today\u2019s world and will come more valuable as these market develops market depth in some emerging the future. Slide 7 highlights our growing margins and cash flows. We\u2019ve had meaningful volume growth in recent quarters that you\u2019ve all seen this growth will continue. By the year 2021 copper value \u2013 copper volumes are projected to increase 20%, gold volumes 55% over 2020. Then looking forward to 2022, let\u2019s see a further growth of 15% to 20% over 2021 levels. The capital and execution risk to achieve these higher volumes are largely behind us. Our volumes will with low incremental costs. We had expand in margins, the prices ranging for $4 to $5 per pound for copper. We would generate annual EBITDA for 2022 and 2023 of $12 billion to $17 billion of copper with capital expenditures in the range of $2.5 billion a year. Looking back, there was always an overhang for Freeport related to execution risk with this underground development, Political risks in Indonesia, debt levels, you look back over the past three years, we have met and mitigated all these major risks that were overhanging our company. And it\u2019s been a really exciting gratifying time for our company. Slide 8 highlights great progress we\u2019re making with Grasberg underground ramp-up. I\u2019ve just met with Mark Johnson and his team in Indonesia and really congratulated him on the fabulous work they doing even in the face of COVID. In the second quarter, we achieved just under 80% of our target annualized run rates for metal sales, we will \u2013 we\u2019re on track to reach full rates for metal production by the end of the year and our team in Indonesia has just done a fabulous job in the face of dealing with pandemic in a challenging physical environment. We executed well designed operating protocols. We\u2019re dealing with this new upturn in cases in Indonesia in recent weeks. We\u2019re helping to support the government in our local community. We\u2019ve implemented travel other restrictions to mitigate the spread. We\u2019re encouraged by the increasing availability of vaccines at our job site in general in Indonesia. Number of our workers to significant number have already seen vaccines and received vaccines. We have a goal providing vaccines to all of our workforce in the second half of the year and we\u2019re supporting nearby communities and their efforts to respond to COVID. We have a real strong support from the government of Indonesia, a real positive partnership with PT-FI state-owned shareholders on that shareholder mine they were all working together and are aligned. I\u2019ve been working in path for 30 years, over 30 years, and I\u2019m personally proud and gratified by our team\u2019s accomplishments. Since we began investing in the underground over 20 years ago the transition from the open pit that began 18 months ago and dealing with COVID is just remarkable what we\u2019ve been able to do. Planning investing in this transition began in the 1990s, now experiencing the success especially for all of us in Freeport. We now look forward to continuing long-term success and Grasberg by building values in this world-class historic mining district with low-cost, high-volume and sustainable production. Slide 9 shows the multiple options for Brownfield low-risk growth across our global portfolio, increasingly encouraged by the opportunities in the U.S. where we have favorable community support across the board with where we operate, favorable tax situation, and a long history of working in a responsible way. We\u2019re expanding our mine production in Lone Star, Bagdad, other sites and we have exciting new opportunities from technology involving leach recovery from our historical operations. The Lone Star mine, our newest operation situated adjacent to our long-standing operations in Southeast Arizona. There we have strong community support and this new mines performing above design capacity. We\u2019re evaluating expansions of Lone Star\u2019s oxide ores. We\u2019re actually making a lot of money in what normally would be stripping operations. We\u2019re conducting long range planning for the development of a potentially world-class sulfide resource that lies beneath this oxide cover in our historical mining area. We have an opportunity and a strong likelihood of moving forward with constructing a new concentrating the double production in our Bagdad mine in Northwest Arizona. What we expect to finish this project next year. Emerging leaching technology, which I am pumped about provides substantial opportunities for added growth across our portfolio global resources. We\u2019re evaluating attractive expansion operation expansion, opportunity that El Abra mine in Chile, where we\u2019re partnered with CODELCO. This project would require significant capital investment along lead time, but it\u2019s attract large, major future expansion of El Abra is likely, but not now. We\u2019re deferring investment decision on this project until we have more clarity about the mining policy issues currently under consideration by the Government in Chile. We\u2019re also evaluating development of an underground deposit called Kucing Liar in the Grasberg district, operated by PT-FI. This copper gold resources involves the large block cave mine using the substantial infrastructure that we already have in place. We have expertise, long track record, Mark Johnson and his team has come up with revised development plans that make the project less capital intensive, economics better it\u2019s a large operation it\u2019d be a block cave with about 90,000 tons per day. So that\u2019s real big, 6 billion plus tons of copper resource, 6 million ounces of gold. And it fits right in with our plans. We have additional opportunities to invest in projects to support our copper, our carbon reduction, other sustainability goals, including investing to develop clean, renewable energy for our operations and communities. We\u2019re advancing plans for an exciting ESG type project to recover metals from the recycling of electronic devices at our Atlantic Copper processing facilities in Spain. Bottom line, we\u2019re going to be disciplined and devoting capital to new investments. We\u2019re going to be focused on value-added projects supported by long live reserves. We have a long track record of success in developing projects. We have established license to operate and positive relationship and support from communities where we have the opportunities to invest. Slide 10 goes back to Lone Star shows we\u2019re meeting, exceeding expectation. Original plan was 75,000 tons a day, 200 million pounds of copper, we now exceeded this, reaching the targeted rate of 95,000 tons a day on a sustained basis we have take outs capacity to do this yield 285 million pounds of copper. Looking at a further increment that would involve a relatively small investment in tankhouses, mining equipment, we use 300 or more pounds of copper, 80% more than our original design. The product here [ph] though is longer term; we have a major opportunity for Lone Star become a cornerstone asset for our company. Potential resource is 10 times more than our current reserve. As we mined these oxide ores, we\u2019re gaining access to this undermine potentially massive sulfide resource, long-term keystone asset for our company. Slide 11 talks about this reference I made earlier to leaching technology, gaining additional copper from material that\u2019s already mine. We\u2019re progressing this. We have lots of opportunity to apply. It\u2019s an exciting potentially have a new opportunity with low incremental cost and low-carbon footprint. We\u2019re engaged in multiple studies using a range of different technologies internally and externally to capture this value from existing stockpiles. Our estimate now is for 38 billion pounds of copper in these stockpiles. This is a material that\u2019s already been in mines. And if we can recover just 10% to 20% as material it would be like having a major new mine with variable capital and operating costs. A significant portion of this is in our flagship Morenci mine, largest mine in North America, where we are now applying artificial intelligence data analytics to help us understand what\u2019s going on with these leaching performance opportunities. Our team historically was instrumental in unlocking substantial values years ago with the venue SX/EW technology. We\u2019re now focused on taking this leaching technology to the next level by using modern approaches to it. We\u2019ve established a cross functional team of technical experts, metallurgist, mine planners, data scientists, geologists, business analysts, all working together to take full advantage of this really exciting opportunity. Slide 12, we have strong operating franchises in the U.S., South America and Indonesia gained the trust and respect of our partners, our customers, suppliers, financial markets, and more importantly, the workers, communities and host governments where we operate. We have significant large scale project development, operating expertise. Team Freeport has all the capabilities to undertake new projects and responsible, efficient manner. I\u2019m going to close on Slide 13 by recognizing people of Freeport. All around the globe their commitment, dedication, resilience, positive outlook, cooperative spirit is just gratifying. Our team is passionate about the role we\u2019re going to play achieving a better and more sustainable future for everyone. Team Freeport has the capabilities and drive to continue to meet, exceed our own high level of expectations and those of our stakeholders. We\u2019re living in a great, a time of great challenge and exceptional opportunity for our business, that our team, we\u2019re meeting the challenges, embracing the opportunities, our futures by with reported charging ahead responsibly, reliably and relentlessly. Kathleen, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to you to talk about our financial results.\nKathleen Quirk: Okay, great. Thank you, Richard. And I\u2019m going to start on Slide 15. And just make some brief comments on our operating manner \u2013 matters and go through our financials and then we\u2019ll open it up for questions. Richard talked about the great progress we\u2019re making at Lone Star. We\u2019re very focused now on sustaining the rates to keep our tankhouse full way, which has a capacity of 285 million pounds per year of copper, and looking at potential increments beyond that with relatively small and attractive investments. Richard also mentioned our plans at Bagdad, we\u2019re advancing studies to double the capacity there, and hope to be in a position to qualify a project and commence a project there next year. At Morenci, we\u2019ve started to increase our mining rates, which had been curtailed in the last 12 months. We averaged about 725,000 tons per day of mine material on the second quarter, and are ramping up to reach 800,000 tons per day, by the end of this year, going to 900,000 tons a day in 2023. We\u2019ve also advanced from 2022 to restart of some of Morenci milling capacity that was also idled last year to reduce costs. Now with the improvement in copper prices, these actions result in more profitable production. We\u2019re also very encouraged by the opportunity to add low cost production at Morenci through our Leach technology initiatives. In South America, the teams are continuing to work to restore production to pre-pandemic levels. We continue to target a full restoration at Cerro Verde in 2022. And we\u2019ve been running at about 95% of the mill capacity in recent months. You\u2019ve seen in our press release that the Cerro Verde team reached a new four-year labor agreement with a significant percentage of the workforce during the second quarter. That was in advance of our labor agreement exploration which is coming up at the end of August of this year. We\u2019re very pleased with the win-win outcome of the agreement and now working to conclude a mutually satisfactory agreement with the balance of employees. At El Abra in Chile, we\u2019re well on our way to restoring production levels that were curtailed last year. We\u2019re increasing the stalking rate of material on the leach pads and moving forward to add a new leach pad to accommodate the higher rates. This is capital that was always part of our plan, but was deferred last year as part of the capital conservation plans that we rolled out in April of last year. This allows El Abra to increase production on a sustained basis to about 200 million pounds to 250 million pounds per annum for the next several years. As we assess opportunities for a major expansion there. As Richard talked about Grasberg, we\u2019re continuing to deliver results and generating strong cash flows. As you recall, we started the second quarter was significantly more concentrate inventory than we normally carry. With a strong production volumes and some maintenance downtime at our port, weather issues at quarter end, sales were below our earlier estimates in the quarter. This is a really a short -term timing issue and we expect to be able to work inventory levels down in the second half of this year. We successfully commissioned at Grasberg the second crusher at our Grasberg Block Cave during the quarter, and that\u2019ll provide sufficient capacity for a ramp-up to 130,000 tons per day you\u2019ve seen the performance and the records achieved from the Grasberg Block Cave during the quarter. We\u2019re also moving to advance the installation of our third SAG mill there, that\u2019s been part of our plan to support the higher rates of throughput. We\u2019ve also identified an opportunity to invest in a new mill circuit that will allow us to increase copper and gold production in Indonesia through the achievement of higher mill recoveries when the initial phases of this project and the economics are highly attractive. Our global team also remains focused on cost management and efficiency projects to extend equipment lives improve energy efficiency, and maintenance practices with the use of technology. We have experienced some degree of costs increases this year principally from energy price increases and to a lesser extent the impact on consumables of steel price increases, increased freight costs and sulfuric acid costs. We\u2019ve had partially offsetting these items we\u2019ve had, the benefits of a weaker exchange rate in South America versus the U.S. dollar. The increases in costs have been offset by significant increase in molybdenum prices in recent months. And those who provided a very nice hedge to certain of these cost inflation items. We talk on slide, we\u2019ve seen in the release plans for to meet our commitments in Indonesia for the new smelter. On Slide 16, we provide an update on our plans to meet the commitments that we agreed to with the Indonesian government in 2018 to construct 2 million tons per year of in country processing facility of copper concentrate. We have been advancing the discussions with our Japanese partners to expand the existing smelter at PT Smelting that would fulfill a portion of the obligation. And there are several financial and operating benefits of expanding this facility, which has been expanded very efficiently in the past. After considering various alternatives for the balance of the commitment, we\u2019ve concluded that the best long-term option is to continue with our plans to construct a new Greenfield Smelter in East Java near the existing facilities at PT Smelting. We recently entered into an EPC contract with Chiyoda to construct a 1.7 million ton facility there. And we\u2019re now focused on completing the project as efficiently and as timely as possible. We show in the graph on Slide 16 on the right, the estimated timing of expenditures over roughly a three-year period, FCX is responsible for 49% of these expenditures. We recently completed a new $1 billion bank credit facility for PT-FI to advance these projects and are planning additional debt financing, which can be obtained at attractive rates to fund these activities. As indicated the long-term cost of the financing expected for the smelter, would be offset by a phase out of the 5% export duty. And we show a graph on the bottom of Slide 16, which shows you that the economic impact is not material as the cost of the smelter, would be essentially offset in lower duties, which we\u2019re currently paying. Slide 17, provides a three-year outlook for volumes. These are consistent with our previous guidance. We\u2019re continuing to pursue additional incremental near-term growth opportunities and conducting our longer range development planning. Moving to Slide 18, we show the significance of cash flow generation using these volumes and cost estimates and the prices ranging from $4 to $5 copper and holding, holding gold and molybdenum flat at $1,800 per ounce of gold and $16 per pound of molybdenum. But you see here on these graphs we would generate EBITDA in the range of over $12.5 billion per annum for 2022 and 2023 on average at $4 copper to $17 billion per annum at $5 copper, and at its operating cash flows net of taxes and interest would be $9 billion to $12 billion using these price assumptions. Is demonstrated in the second quarter we\u2019re generating very significant free cash flow and this trend is expected to continue with cash flows significantly above our capital spending, On Slide 19, we include our projected capital of $2.2 billion this year and $2.5 billion in 2022. As you\u2019ll note, we shifted about $100 million in expenditures from 2021 to 2022, which is timing related. And we\u2019ve advanced some capital from future years into 2022 to reflect the timing of additional leach pad construction at Lone Star and the addition of some highly attractive growth spending in Indonesia related to mill recoveries. We\u2019ve entered a period of outstanding free cash flow generation that growing volumes, strong markets and low capital requirements you\u2019ll see on Slide 20, and this is backward looking, but over the last 12 months, we\u2019ve reduced our net debt by $5 billion, and that included $2 billion in the second quarter alone. You\u2019ll see our credit metrics are strong, and less than 0.5 times EBITDA on a trailing 12 month basis, and we\u2019re projecting our credit metrics continue to be strong and improving. As Richard mentioned, we achieved our targeted net debt level several months ahead of our schedule. With our long lived asset base and growing production profile and strong markets will have the ability to continue to strengthen our balance sheet, provide increasing cash returns to shareholders, and build additional values in our asset base. The Slide on 21, just reiterates our financial policy, our performance base payout policy, which was established by our board earlier this year, providing that up to 50% of free cash flow would be used for shareholder returns with the balance available for growth and further balance sheet improvements. And with the recent achievement of our net debt target, we expect our board will consider additional payouts to shareholders with our 2021 results. We\u2019re looking forward to reporting on our continued progress and continuing to build additional values as we go forward. And now, operator, we\u2019d like to open the call up for questions.\nRichard Adkerson: Kathleen, I want to put an explanation point on your \u2013 the comments you made about cost management. They were going focused on inflation around the world and the impact on mining companies and as Kathleen said we\u2019ve had higher energy costs, our grinding material costs. But Josh Olmstead and our America\u2019s team has just done a great job in helping offset that Mike Kendrick in running our molybdenum business, which is a primary production business and a byproduct business. And with higher molybdenum prices is offsetting some of these cost increases, we\u2019ve got a high gold price would help us Danny Hughes is leading our supply chain group. So a combination of all these things is helping us as a company to really mitigate much of these increases in cost, working with logistics. So, I just wanted to make a note of that because I think it\u2019s important giving \u2013 given all of our concerns about, where inflation is leading us. So, let\u2019s do turn over to questions. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Emily Chieng of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nEmily Chieng: Good morning, Richard and Kathleen. Thanks for the update today and congratulations on getting to a net debt target. So, quickly maybe just following up on Kathleen\u2019s last point then just on capital return, is there a reason why you would wait till the end of full year 2021 before executing that capital returns program and just further on that train of thought there? Is there a preference yet between parts of special dividend or buyback program to shift to a variable dividend strategy? Thank you.\nKathleen Quirk: Thanks, Emily. We\u2019ve just reached the debt \u2013 net debt target at the end of June and so going forward, we would have up to 50% of the cash flows available as we generate them to consider additional payouts to shareholders. Our board will be reviewing this and we do expect that we will be following the policy that will be paying out up to 50% of the excess cash flow. We have not made any conclusions on whether it will be additional dividend payouts or share buybacks. And that\u2019ll be something that will be considered at the time, but the commitment is there to pay strong cash returns to shareholders with our free cash flow. And we expect over the next several months to continue to generate free cash flow. And that\u2019ll continue into next year and beyond.\nEmily Chieng: Great, that\u2019s helpful. And a quick one, if I could squeeze it in just on Grasberg, I believe that the end of Q1, you reached 75% of your full production there. Can you remind us where we are today, where you\u2019d expect to be at the end of 3Q? And that 100% production level is that a fourth quarter average or an exit rate? Thank you.\nKathleen Quirk: 78% was the average.\nRichard Adkerson: We\u2019re just under 80% right now, in terms of metal production targets. That\u2019s well ahead of schedule. We\u2019ll be at 100% by the end of this year.\nEmily Chieng: Thank you.\nKathleen Quirk: And that\u2019s the average for the fourth quarter Emily, so we\u2019ll \u2013 we expect to hit the run rates in the fourth quarter.\nEmily Chieng: Perfect. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you, Kathleen. Thanks, Richard.\nRichard Adkerson: Thank you, Emily.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets.\nDavid Gagliano: Hi, thank you for taking my questions. I just wanted to actually ask a little bit on the CapEx. I know capital spending changes. I know, Kathleen, you flagged it, by time I missed some of the commentary there. Can you walk through how much of the increase incremental sort of net increase are $200 million is just general cost creep, versus pulling projects forward? And what are those projects? Again, if you can just give us a little more detail on that? That\u2019s my first question. Then just since I\u2019m only getting one I just have another parts \u2013 question, which is the \u2013 just if you could talk a little bit about there\u2019s slight changes to the exit rates or extraction exit rate targets between the Block Cave and the DMLZ Zone. Block Cave went up, DMLZ Zone went down. And I was wondering, if you can just speak to the reason behind those changes? Thanks.\nKathleen Quirk: On the capital, we shifted a $100 million of capital from 2021 to 2022. And that really was a timing matter we haven\u2019t been spending as quickly as what was originally budget and budgeted. So, we\u2019ve just \u2013 $100 million is related to the timing. We\u2019ve also brought forward some capital that was in our plans in the future, dealing with constructing new leach pads at Lone Star. And then we also \u2013 the only new thing that we\u2019ve added in 2022 is this project that we talked about with respect to increasing mill recoveries at Grasberg and that I\u2019ll be spent over a multi-year period. It\u2019s roughly $400 million in total, but we\u2019ve got $100 million scheduled in 2022. Ultimately, that will add volumes. We expect, on the order of 50 million pounds of copper and 50,000 ounces of gold and it\u2019s a very attractive and short payout project. So that\u2019s a positive and that\u2019ll be used as one of the projects, just one of many, hopefully that will be used with our other 50% of cash flows. There really weren\u2019t \u2013 on the second question there really weren\u2019t any material changes with respect to the Deep MLZ and Grasberg, Block Cave. We update the plans every quarter. And there were really only minor changes between the two and really that the long-term plan for Grasberg and Deep MLZ is consistent with the previous forecasts and Mark, I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything there. But it\u2019s \u2013 we certainly very much in line with our previous forecasts.\nMark Johnson: Yes, the only minor changes throughout 2022 until, SAG3 is the mine plan is, or the mine rates are constrained by the mill throughput. What we did is, there\u2019s been some minor modifications, some of the values of GDC. During this constraint period, the grades of GDC are coming up. So, we swapped some of the GDC material for the higher value for slightly lower value material from the Deep MLZ.\nRichard Adkerson: Dave, good to hear your voice, let me just say, the higher capital spending is a positive. We\u2019ve come out of a period of time with capital constraints. Now, we\u2019re spending capital, not huge incremental amounts some of its timing, but to create new values. And the Deep MLZ is a huge success story, because we\u2019ve successfully met, manage the size of necessity issues that we encountered earlier. So in Mark\u2019s point, the key to our future success is these mine rates, we need to build a mine rates up. And we\u2019re successfully doing that. And we\u2019re dealing with this constraint at the mill by building SAG3 and making other investments. But the key to our future success was meeting our mine rate targets. And that\u2019s been a key for 15, 20 years. And for us to be able to achieve that is just something that we all feel so good about, and congratulating our team for doing that over the years.\nDavid Gagliano: That\u2019s helpful. Thanks very much.\nRichard Adkerson: Thanks, David.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Chris LaFemina with Jefferies.\nChris LaFemina: Hi, Richard. Hi, Kathleen, thank you for taking my question. My question was going to be about Grasberg and the shipping issues there. But actually, your answer to the last question brings something else to mine, which is your organic growth pipeline. So, it\u2019s really interesting how each quarter, you seem to identify a little bit more incremental volumes that you might be able to get out of some of your existing assets, you have the this mill project now the mill recovery project at Grasberg you have potential smaller expenses at Lone Star, low capital intensity, not a whole lot of new incremental volumes, but there is growth there potentially, anyway, that a lot of us may be we\u2019re not aware of. However, when I look at your production guidance at Grasberg or to the overall company, the guidance has not been increased to reflect any of this potential growth. And the question regarding that is, is that because these projects are not yet reflected in guidance, or is it just that they\u2019re small and there\u2019s a lot of moving parts here? And, it\u2019s kind of a rounding to what your guidance was? So, how do we think about the production beyond, say 2022, 2023 and how this manufacturer guidance?\nKathleen Quirk: Yes, I think it\u2019s the ladder Chris. The Grasberg mill project wouldn\u2019t come in terms of the recoveries until 2024. And it\u2019s, within the rounding, but I do believe we have some upside. As we look forward, I do believe we have some upside on a consolidated basis from these initiatives. That potentially could come in to 2022 and 2023.\nChris LaFemina: Okay, thank you.\nRichard Adkerson: Chris, let me say, this is the complicated business, I mean, we get to these numbers, and we look and see how that they look. But underneath that, they\u2019re always unexpected things that jump up, and in terms of, there\u2019s new challenge in measuring grade, these column heights in the underground development a large and so being able, we had higher grades, first quarter, slightly lower grades a second, that\u2019s just going to be a feature of what we have to deal with. So, there are just a lot of moving parts. Our team around the world keeps finding ways to incrementally improve things, those will unfold into our numbers over time, and there\u2019ll be a lot of moving parts. Shipping, for those of you who follows for a long period of time knows that, that\u2019s always a timing issue, that Grasberg afford there\u2019s a very shallow point of, a shallow sea there. We have a relatively complicated historical loading operation there. We have to lighter concentrates out to ships and in weather, shipping schedules, logistic issues will always have a timing impact. I just come back again. The real key to us is mine rates, mining rates incrementally improve things and that\u2019s just an ongoing process that we think.\nChris LaFemina: And sorry, is the shipping some of the shipping issues at Grasberg many of which are kind of ordinary and normal types of things? Is there a COVID impact there as well? Was that a factor in the last quarter? Was that not a reason for the shipping problem?\nKathleen Quirk: No, not really, we had some maintenance that we were doing on the ship loaders, which impacted us earlier in the quarter. And then we got hit by weather at the end of the quarter. So that\u2019s, that was really, what was it wasn\u2019t really COVID related.\nChris LaFemina: Okay, thank you.\nRichard Adkerson: We early of action to I mean, this is just an example. It wasn\u2019t major, but it has an impact. We have concentrated pipelines to go from the highlands down to the port, with a schedule plan, maintenance of some things happening, we had to advance this plan, that plan maintenance. So nothing unusual. This is typical of our operations there, since then, started ramping up the Grasberg in the 1990s. And so it\u2019ll be part of the things we\u2019ll have to deal with in the future. It just not the focus of our success, focus for success with this mine rate, ramp-up.\nChris LaFemina: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Hacking with Citi.\nAlex Hacking: Yes. Hi, good morning, Richard and Kathleen. You have the slide on the new leaching technology. I\u2019m very curious, in your view on this low grade sulfide, chalcopyrite leaching technology, it seems very promising. There\u2019s a lot of impressive people associated with it. It sounds like; you guys are testing it out. How do you, personally what\u2019s your view on the technology that doesn\u2019t seem promising to you? And then how do you judge sort of the potential future impact on Freeport and the copper industry more broadly, like 10 years from now, this technology plays out? How much additional copper do you think that Freeport could be producing? And how much additional copper do you think, could be produced globally using this technology? Thank you.\nRichard Adkerson: So Alex, and thanks for the question. It\u2019s, I want to make clear if there\u2019s not one technology, in play here, there\u2019s a series of efforts by different parties to develop different technologies. We have our own R&D work going on. And we\u2019re looking across the board and how this might apply to us. I think we are specially situated to take advantage of it because we have these large number and size of pass reaching operation, some of which are now totally inactive, that we can look to apply these to, so we have a special opportunity in industry. Others have some, but we have a special opportunity to look at this in two ways. One of it is to use the leaching technology and by the way, we\u2019re supplementing that with this artificial intelligence, data analytics opportunity to measure the impact of all this, but to apply this to inactive and existing leaching, leach pads, that we have a large abundance for us. So that\u2019s one thing. And then aspirationally it might provide a way to recover material from mining operations that would otherwise have to be recovered through mill investments. And it could be looking ahead an opportunity to minimize capital by recovering low grade sulfide deposits that would otherwise have to be mined and milled. So it\u2019s early stages, we don\u2019t have complete answers. I just want to share with you how exciting it is. It\u2019s an opportunity for us, opportunity for others the industry. This is not a shill all tight game changer for the fundamentals of copper supply [ph].\nKathleen Quirk: On Slide 11, the 38 billion pounds that are identified here. That represents material that\u2019s already been mined, that is not in our reserves, not in any of our production plans. And so just recovering, a small percentage of that ends up being potentially over time, a fairly large number. But Josh, you want to make some comments on your perspective?\nJosh Olmsted: Sure, thanks, Kathleen. Yes, just as Richard and Kathleen have talked to, it\u2019s really exciting with respect to the opportunity there. The thing that I think, for us that\u2019s unlocking it, even more than just the various technologies that are out there that we\u2019re studying and researching and running different pilot tests on is the combination of that, with the data analytics that Richard touched on. The data analytics that in the processes that we learned over the last several years in our application of that technology, on the milling side has now opened our eyes to opportunities on the leaching side. And that in combination with the various technologies is really exciting for us, because it\u2019s allowing us to look at things in a way that we haven\u2019t ever looked at previously. And we\u2019ve started to see some of the benefits of that at Morenci, as we\u2019ve done some of this pilot work, and that\u2019s, what\u2019s really looked ahead us getting us excited about what the potential is going forward. The other thing that I would note is, as Richard said, it\u2019s not, what I would call a fundamental game changer or step change for the industry. And it happens over time. But it\u2019s really low incremental costs, low-carbon footprint and an incremental adder as we go forward. But it\u2019s really exciting. There\u2019s lots of energy, if I think about the similar things that we saw with our agile efforts earlier, we\u2019re seeing similar things on the leaching side, as we engage with various levels of the organization, the employee engagement and the excitement and the passion and the ideas that they\u2019re bringing to the table, in combination with the models that we\u2019re generating is really good, I think untap or tap into I should say, that these opportunities bring value for us.\nRichard Adkerson: Yes, I got Cory Stevens is leading this had a session with this new team that\u2019s been formed. It\u2019s a large, Freeport is a large number of people recall him and his guys are adding to this, and I just walked away from this is a new opportunity. You\u2019ve heard me talk about years, for years about the outlook for the copper market being so positive. The assets that we have, the undeveloped reserves, the undeveloped resources we have. This is beyond that. This is not even it\u2019s not reserves, of course, it\u2019s not in our resources. So this is a brand new opportunity to be significant for Freeport, and nobody\u2019s better situated than us to take advantage of it.\nAlex Hacking: Thanks, I appreciate the color. Now, I\u2019ve read some other, sorry as I can say, I\u2019ve read some of the comments that, this could maybe add, 5% to global copper production on the long run. So, but sounds like, you think this is going to be more kind of longer dated and extending life of mine, and not really that kind of a potential game changer. Appreciate it. Thanks.\nRichard Adkerson: Me too early to say that Alex, way too early.\nAlex Hacking: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley.\nCarlos De Alba: Yes. Thank you very much, Richard and Kathleen, just continuing on the growth opportunities. I wonder, if you could update us on the 200 million pounds per year target that you had before the pandemic, you\u2019re driven by the innovation and productivity enhancements in Americas, is that get another growth opportunity for you guys or is more \u2013 or is not that now embedded in the praise that you have been describing today, just now in this call.\nKathleen Quirk: That is embedded. We\u2019ve continued that project. We internalized it. We were doing some external work and we to cut back on capital and operating we externalized \u2013 internalized it and that agile work way and using artificial intelligence is embedded in now in everything that we do. So that is in our plans, I\u2019d say the one area where it\u2019s not is at Cerro Verde, because we have not been able to get the mill, we\u2019re running roughly 95% of the pre-pandemic levels. We had plans prior to that to move well above 400,000 tons a day. And so I think with the pandemic passing, at some point, we will be able to go back to those initiatives at Cerro Verde and those are not in our plans. But in the year end they are.\nRichard Adkerson: This is not like building a concentrator to one time deal. It\u2019s an ongoing deal, we\u2019ll continue to add it, as Kathleen said, we\u2019ve been limited to what we could do with Cerro Verde the world\u2019s \u2013 with the world\u2019s largest concentrating milling operations are and because of our focus on mine rate ramp-up. At Grasberg, we haven\u2019t yet brought all those new tools and skills and opportunities, technology, the PT-FI and we\u2019ll be doing that in the future. So this is not a one-time deal, but an ongoing part of our business going forward. And our team is really bought into it.\nCarlos De Alba: All right. That\u2019s clear. And then just if I may ask on the smelter financing. So the idea still to get a broad financing for this venture initiative, and that means that from a cash flow perspective for Freeport it doesn\u2019t jeopardize the potential increasing in dividends or returns to shareholders correct, that you will be getting the money from the banks or whoever you get the money from. And therefore, the cash flow generation that the company has still allows for you guys to pay dividends and shares.\nKathleen Quirk: That\u2019s correct. Yes. The debt service would affect our dividend to the extent of 49% of the debt service. But that\u2019s all said with a duty phase out. So really, the dividends to FCX are not expected to be impacted.\nRichard Adkerson: And the costs of the smelter are tax deductible to PT-FI.\nCarlos De Alba: Then the financing costs you mean return?\nRichard Adkerson: No, I\u2019m talking about the operating costs and so forth.\nCarlos De Alba: Okay.\nRichard Adkerson: Appreciation. This is all of the PT-FI though. You nailed it, Marcos [ph], in your analysis. I\u2019m just pointing out that you\u2019ve got the relief from the 5% export duty. You\u2019ve got an operations where the depreciation and operating costs are tax deductible in the consolidated Indonesian tax return for PT-FI, which is substantial Indonesian taxpayers. The government gets almost 50% of the economics at PT-FI through taxes and royalties. Now, they have an equity ownership of 50%. So, 70% or more of the economics of Indonesia go to the government. FCX retains the interest is essentially all the interest we had going into these negotiations, which were years. I didn\u2019t think we could do. But what a fabulous outcome for all parties we had in 2018.\nCarlos De Alba: All right. Excellent. Thank you very much.\nKathleen Quirk: Thanks, Carlos.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Orest Wowkodaw with Scotiabank.\nOrest Wowkodaw: Hi, good morning. Just given what\u2019s happening in Chile and Peru with respect to potentially materially higher taxation of royalties in the future. I\u2019m just wondering if that is changing or thinking at all in terms of future growth, and whether we could see Freeport look to perhaps develop deposits outside of those countries in some of the emerging fronts, maybe something like Ecuador or others.\nRichard Adkerson: Excellent point. 40% of today\u2019s copper supply comes from Chile and Peru, 40%. And now we have both countries going through the political process that looking to get more for the governments away from the miners. We don\u2019t know how all this will turn out and it\u2019s going to take time to know that. Just certified the new President in Peru, Chile\u2019s got a long-term process looking at their constitution. We\u2019ve already said, that the impact in Chile is causing us to delay a decision on a world-class expansion opportunity, we have in El Abra. Other miners are also going to be affected by this. We really don\u2019t know what the outcome is. Bottom line, this is going to be supportive of future prices.\nKathleen Quirk: Our U.S. assets more valuable to your second point, we\u2019re not planning to go outside of our geographic footprint. We have opportunities in the U.S. and elsewhere.\nOrest Wowkodaw: Okay. Just as a follow-up. I mean, I know you have stability agreement in place of Cerro Verde, I think tell about, I think it\u2019s about 2029. But, I mean, given some of the comments from the new President in Peru, I mean, how much confidence do you have that that\u2019s going to be honored?\nRichard Adkerson: Well, you look back over our shoulder, there have been other Presidents in Peru overtime that have gone into office with similar types of comments, and when they get into office and reality of the importance of the mining industry to support their economies, become self evident. We don\u2019t know now. We\u2019re working with the rest of the industry in Peru to present a case by the importance of copper mining to that country. But we will have to work our way through this. It is an uncertainty. We don\u2019t have a significant growth opportunity in Peru, but we have a very substantial operation in Cerro Verde that significant in terms of our current and future levels of copper production. And so it wouldn\u2019t be helpful, are instructed to try to play the outcome for all this. We do have a strong stabilization agreement, which is relatively new replaced an older one, and it\u2019s stronger. But as we\u2019ve always done will work with the industry will try to work cooperatively with the government communities to contribute to Indonesia\u2019s efforts to relieve poverty, and that I mean, Peru\u2019s efforts, really poverty in that country.\nOrest Wowkodaw: Thank you for the color.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Abhi Agarwal with Deutsche Bank.\nAbhi Agarwal: Thanks. Thank you. Morning Richard and Kathleen, thanks a lot for the call. I just had one follow-up question to the previous question. So given you are focusing on Bagdad and Lone Star resource development over next year, I know it\u2019s early days, but when do you think you\u2019ll be able to make a decision? And is there any sort of CapEx guidelines here?\nKathleen Quirk: Well, with Lone Star where we\u2019re working this incrementally. We\u2019ve already been running this higher than the design rate, and we\u2019ve got plans and studies looking at is there a further increment and those will be sorted out in the next several months. With respect to Bagdad, that is a major project and we\u2019re advancing our engineer \u2013 our studies, feasibility studies, we\u2019re looking at all facets of water and tailings. And as I said, I\u2019m hopeful that we will be in a position to be able to qualify that project next year. We don\u2019t have the final capital expenditure estimates we\u2019ve been working to try to find mill setups that would be lower capital intensity than a traditional mill, but that work is still underway.\nAbhi Agarwal: Got it. Thank you. And if I could squeeze in one more question, please. So, if I look at Slide 7, with the 2Q Slide 7 and compared to the 1Q, the EBITDA sensitivities haven\u2019t changed, even though the gold price and the moly price assumptions have gone up. So is that basically a function of unit costs being assumed to be higher in 2022, 2023? Am I \u2013 did I missed something?\nKathleen Quirk: No. We do have some higher costs baked into our numbers with respect to the items we talked about earlier, principally energy and \u2013 more than offsetting the impact for these higher gold and molybdenum prices, but these are order of magnitude rounded numbers it should be slightly above these numbers, but we just continued with the order of magnitude that we previously presented. But we are including some cost inflation in our revised forecast.\nAbhi Agarwal: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Glick with JPMorgan.\nMichael Glick: Hey, good morning. Just one question for me. As it relates to the drought in the Southwestern U.S., I mean, it seems like a pretty tough situation there. And I know, agriculture is a lot bigger deal than mining in terms of water usage. But could you maybe speak to any potential impacts from that on operations and costs and just remind us of your water agreements in place?\nRichard Adkerson: It\u2019s \u2013 it is a concerning of the level of Colorado River, which is one of the major sources of water for operations. But this is not a new problem. We\u2019ve been doing with this consistently over the years. And we have taken steps, with communities with Native American groups, with a farming community to deal with it. So, we don\u2019t see \u2013 we see this is an ongoing process that we will have to devote resources and management to we don\u2019t see any kind of crisis emerging. But we\u2019re going to work cooperatively with everybody to try to conserve water when we do a great job right now with our conservation, reuse of water, and let it\u2019s going to be an ongoing management deal. All of that\u2019s built into our current cost structure and we won\u2019t anticipate major changes in that looking forward.\nMichael Glick: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Michael Dudas with VRP.\nMichael Dudas: Good morning, Richard and Kathleen. Turning back to the smelter, with the timeline of a 2024 completion, as Chiyoda, which I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a competitive process, is it a fixed price contract, is there a healthy enough contingency to take to respect all the potential changes with COVID and the supply chain issues, which everybody is certain to worry more about, and is their comfort level that the government along with PT-FIs those type of contract structure that would be there to achieve that target?\nKathleen Quirk: There is contingency in our estimate. It is not a fixed price contract for all the reasons that you just mentioned. We want to be able to help manage the costs and didn\u2019t want to have a lot of risks baked into the capital that may or may not occur. So, we felt this was the right structure, there\u2019s risk sharing within the contract. The government understands the situation in terms of COVID, we were delayed over the last 12, 15 months associated with the project. And the current situation is something we\u2019re also monitoring very closely. But we\u2019re keeping the government informed regularly about the timeline. And our commitment is to \u2013 with Chiyoda is to get this done as timely as possible, but recognizing their certain things that will be outside of our control, like the current COVID situation.\nMichael Dudas: And that 2.8 billion big change from maybe what was bought about two, three, four, several years ago?\nKathleen Quirk: Well, the scope is different. We had previously we were thinking of having two lines at the smelter for 2 million tons total and we reduced it to 1.7 tons, because of the expansion opportunity at PT Smelting. So the scope is a little different. And yes, there have been some changing cost factors you\u2019ve seen all the \u2013 what those are in terms of where construction costs are currently. But we\u2019ve done a good bit of value engineering over this period with Chiyoda, but all parties are committed to having an open book and making this the smelter as successful as possible and bringing it online as cost efficiently as possible. And so we were in the range of $3 billion, $2.5 billion, $3 billion before, but there\u2019s been some pluses and minuses. And we\u2019re slightly above that now.\nMichael Dudas: The open book risk sharing is definitely the way go here. Thanks a lot Kathleen.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Matthew Murphy with Barclays.\nMatthew Murphy: Hi, I\u2019m wondering as you\u2019re getting close to full throughput at Grasberg here. If you can give any color on underground mining costs, thinking like on a per ton basis, where you\u2019re at \u2013 where you\u2019re aiming to get and is it, where you had hoped to be?\nRichard Adkerson: Yes. We\u2019re achieving where we hope to be no question about that. We have to deal with some of these general factors, but just achieving the volumes having the gold credit, and high grades of copper, just allow us to do it, Mark, do you want to comment on this?\nMark Johnson: Yes. We\u2019ve had a lot of focus on operating unit rates. And we\u2019re very close to where we want to be, I think there\u2019s still some opportunities and just be more efficient with some of the mining. Obvious that GDC, the train haulage system has proved to be very efficient. That\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s a completely unmanned operation and that\u2019s going very well. Deep MLZ the fracking is helping out, we\u2019re seeing that the cave is continuing to mature, a lot less secondary blasting. So a lot of these things are settling down. But I\u2019d say it\u2019s very much in within the forecast that we had, and we think there\u2019s still some opportunities to continue to improve.\nMatthew Murphy: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of Jatinder Goel with Exane BNP Paribas.\nJatinder Goel: Hi, good morning. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. Just one question on those administrative fines in Indonesia, now, we\u2019re looking at 2024 timeline, and looks like you\u2019ve taken a minor provision in your accounts as well, any color you can provide on where we are on that discussion with the government? And is there any accessibility these fines should not be levied and should not be recovered to the same extent, as indicated in media previously?\nKathleen Quirk: Yes. We worked with the government during the quarter, and this third party that the government engaged and we engaged to review our performance against the plan and the schedule and what was related to the pandemic. And they looks like the fine will be in the $16 million range, which we\u2019ve fully accrued in the quarter we had previously accrued $13 million. And so it looks like that is behind us. We also with this provided a new schedule to the government of what the progress is expected to be. And so that is what will be measured against in the future. So, we\u2019re not expecting this to be an ongoing matter and it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re pleased with the resolution of it.\nJatinder Goel: Understood. That\u2019s very clear. Kathleen, if I can ask you very quick one, on moly, how sustainable do you think current strong prices are? And do you have much flex in the system to respond with better volumes from year to time the mines?\nKathleen Quirk: On the latter part of that we are looking at, we\u2019ve been operating primary mines are below their capacity. We are looking at potential options to increase production from the Climax mine. In terms of prices, we don\u2019t predict prices, but the market is Mike can tell you is been very tight. And we\u2019re seeing that that continue even during the summer months. And I don\u2019t know Mike you want to add?\nRichard Adkerson: Our Molybdenum business, it\u2019s a great business and leverage to prices and we\u2019re able to flex. Mike you want to make a comment on that?\nMike Kendrick: Sure. Yes, Kathleen is absolutely right, that we\u2019re looking at how we can expand production at Climax and putting together a ramp-up plan for that to respond to the economic conditions. And then with regards to price, I think the predominant feature is that the vast majority of Western Molybdenum comes from byproduct production. And right now, you\u2019re starting to see that you don\u2019t have these copper mines that are coming online and it correlates to our general story of how important copper is, but also that it\u2019s hard to find resources, bring them on and they come with molybdenum. So, we think there\u2019s kind of a natural correlation between the copper and the molybdenum story. And there\u2019s definitely a structural deficit this summer. And we\u2019ll have to see how it plays out over time.\nJatinder Goel: Excellent, thank you so much.\nRichard Adkerson: All right. Well, thanks, everyone. It\u2019s exciting times the best is yet to come. So hang on. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation.

            "content": "Sure, thanks, Kathleen. Yes, just as Richard and Kathleen have talked to, it's really exciting with respect to the opportunity there. The thing that I think, for us that's unlocking it, even more than just the various technologies that are out there that we're studying and researching and running different pilot tests on is the combination of that, with the data analytics that Richard touched on. The data analytics that in the processes that we learned over the last several years in our application of that technology, on the milling side has now opened our eyes to opportunities on the leaching side. And that in combination with the various technologies is really exciting for us, because it's allowing us to look at things in a way that we haven't ever looked at previously. And we've started to see some of the benefits of that at Morenci, as we've done some of this pilot work, and that's, what's really looked ahead us getting us excited about what the potential is going forward. The other thing that I would note is, as Richard said, it's not, what I would call a fundamental game changer or step change for the industry. And it happens over time. But it's really low incremental costs, low-carbon footprint and an incremental adder as we go forward. But it's really exciting. There's lots of energy, if I think about the similar things that we saw with our agile efforts earlier, we're seeing similar things on the leaching side, as we engage with various levels of the organization, the employee engagement and the excitement and the passion and the ideas that they're bringing to the table, in combination with the models that we're generating is really good, I think untap or tap into I should say, that these opportunities bring value for us."

            "content": "Yes, the only minor changes throughout 2022 until, SAG3 is the mine plan is, or the mine rates are constrained by the mill throughput. What we did is, there's been some minor modifications, some of the values of GDC. During this constraint period, the grades of GDC are coming up. So, we swapped some of the GDC material for the higher value for slightly lower value material from the Deep MLZ. Yes. We've had a lot of focus on operating unit rates. And we're very close to where we want to be, I think there's still some opportunities and just be more efficient with some of the mining. Obvious that GDC, the train haulage system has proved to be very efficient. That's \u2013 it's a completely unmanned operation and that's going very well. Deep MLZ the fracking is helping out, we're seeing that the cave is continuing to mature, a lot less secondary blasting. So a lot of these things are settling down. But I'd say it's very much in within the forecast that we had, and we think there's still some opportunities to continue to improve."

            "content": "Sure. Yes, Kathleen is absolutely right, that we're looking at how we can expand production at Climax and putting together a ramp-up plan for that to respond to the economic conditions. And then with regards to price, I think the predominant feature is that the vast majority of Western Molybdenum comes from byproduct production. And right now, you're starting to see that you don't have these copper mines that are coming online and it correlates to our general story of how important copper is, but also that it's hard to find resources, bring them on and they come with molybdenum. So, we think there's kind of a natural correlation between the copper and the molybdenum story. And there's definitely a structural deficit this summer. And we'll have to see how it plays out over time."

            "name": "Richard Adkerson",
            "content": "Thank you, Kathleen. Thanks, everybody for joining us. We are really pleased to reporting what's now becoming a string of really strong operating performances for our company. And with this great positive outlook for our business, we're all really enthusiastic about it. Hoping all of you are staying healthy through this pandemic. Vaccinations are giving us an opportunity to protect ourselves and those around us and we're working hard to encourage our people globally to take full advantage of this opportunity whenever possible. Our teams are working safely. We remained diligent with our COVID protocols that have been so effective. With the recent rise in cases globally we are refocusing, redoubling our efforts, restoring some protocols that we had listed \u2013 we had loosened to keep our team and community safe. Our results in the second quarter demonstrate really strong execution of our plans, really strong and favorable pricing for our products. Kathleen mentioned the shipping issue, logistics is an issue globally, if we've been able to \u2013 we basically met or slightly exceeded our production targets. We've been able to ship everything we produced. We would have beat our sales targets. We also common the mining industry had some one-off type issues affecting production. Without those and with shipping, we would have had a real strong beat on our previous guidance. Really important our Grasberg underground ramp-up is proceeding on schedule. This is a remarkable, and I would say a historic success for both our company and even the mining industry. Our team in Indonesia is doing remarkable and outstanding work and this is building value for our shareholders in long-term sustainable, low cost values for the future. Production, we're making money in the Americas, copper prices, production in the U.S. is increasing. Our Lone Star project in Eastern Arizona is really exciting. We have a series of ongoing value enhancing opportunities in the U.S., in front of us, and I'm personally really encouraged about future growth in the U.S. In South America, our teams in Peru and Chile, are navigating the pandemic, effectively, we're restoring production that we have curtailed a year ago. We have achieved these outstanding financial results made possible by the hard work and investments we've been making for many years. We're now generating significant cash flows, which will be sustainable for years in the future. This quarter alone, we had $2 billion of cash flow after capital spending. That's just remarkable considering where we were just a year ago. Kathleen mentioned, and it's notable that we reached our debt target, several months earlier than our forecast earlier this year. We ended the quarter with $3.4 billion of net debt. That's within the targeted range, we said of $3 to $4 billion. We reduced our debt by like 60% over the past year. We're now positioned in accordance with a financial policy that our board adopted earlier this year, and that we disclose to the market to shift our capital allocation priorities by increasing cash returns to shareholders. As we make discipline investments for future growth of our business. This policy will allow us to maintain a strong balance sheet with high grade credit metrics, while providing cash for increasing shareholder returns, and investing in our company's long-term future. Slide 4, talks about how we're devoting significant attention and resources to sustainability initiatives. And this has always been key to our company and our tradition of our company. We are committed to the sustainability principles of ICMM. We're also moving to certify all of our operations with a Copper Mark, a relatively new industry framework developed by the International Copper Association to ensure responsible production consistent with UN's sustainability development goals. Today, we lead the industry with six of our operations now certified. In the second quarter, we submitted five additional operating sites to this initiative, and we've committed to validate all of our sites to this robust framework. Responsible production is critical in building and maintaining trust, which we've earned over the years through long-standing partnerships with communities as we delivered a product copper value by society produced and safe, environmentally sound, innovative manner. Slide 5 talks about electrification, which is key to copper. Majority of copper goes into generating and transmitting electricity, and copper is critical in every aspect of achieving low-carbon goals for the global economy. This ranges from electric vehicles and supported infrastructure to clean energy from wind and solar copper is just simply essential to a green economy. This transition is now just beginning to unfold. It will add significantly to future demand for copper. And as the global leading copper producer Freeport is solidly positioned to benefit from this higher future demand. In addition, now companies around the world are responding to COVID with aggressive fiscal and monetary policies. This alone is creating important near-term copper demand beyond China. China's consumption remains strong, there's a mixed economic signals, but even with that demand for copper in China is strong and now it's higher consumption is being generated from economic recovery in developed countries around the world. And that's even in the face of an important sector of copper demand automobiles, which is being constrained by this chip problem. So this increasingly important incremental demand outside China, the long-term growth from global \u2013 from growth in emerging markets just as very positive for our outlook. Copper demand is also expanding from technology advances and communications, artificial intelligence applications, expanding connectivity through global infrastructure initiatives and efforts to improve health through using copper to fight viruses and other infections. Slide 6 talks about this growing demand, the global challenges and maintaining much less growing supply makes the outlook for copper compelling. I would say compelling is an understated word and really positive and enthusiastic about it. This recent pullback and copper pricing that we've seen, is not altered in any way our conviction of the favorable long-term outlook for copper. This is a decision we made years ago, which underscores our strategy of Freeport to focus on copper, because of its favorable fundamentals, the nature of our assets, and our team. There are always actions that influence sentiment and short-term pricing at any point in time. But beyond that indisputable facts support a positive fundamental outlook for copper. Demand growth is inevitable, maintaining supply or growing supplies challenged, our prices will be required to support major new investments in copper, rising demand scarcity of supplies point to large impending structural deficit supporting much higher future copper prices. Our company has high quality assets, industry-leading experience, highly motivated team will allow us to benefit from these fundamentals. Portfolio of assets in copper business is rare, and not unique in our industry would be difficult not impossible to replicate these assets. With strong growing production, embedded Brownfield, low-risk growth from our large portfolio of undeveloped resources, our assets are extremely valuable in today's world and will come more valuable as these market develops market depth in some emerging the future. Slide 7 highlights our growing margins and cash flows. We've had meaningful volume growth in recent quarters that you've all seen this growth will continue. By the year 2021 copper value \u2013 copper volumes are projected to increase 20%, gold volumes 55% over 2020. Then looking forward to 2022, let's see a further growth of 15% to 20% over 2021 levels. The capital and execution risk to achieve these higher volumes are largely behind us. Our volumes will with low incremental costs. We had expand in margins, the prices ranging for $4 to $5 per pound for copper. We would generate annual EBITDA for 2022 and 2023 of $12 billion to $17 billion of copper with capital expenditures in the range of $2.5 billion a year. Looking back, there was always an overhang for Freeport related to execution risk with this underground development, Political risks in Indonesia, debt levels, you look back over the past three years, we have met and mitigated all these major risks that were overhanging our company. And it's been a really exciting gratifying time for our company. Slide 8 highlights great progress we're making with Grasberg underground ramp-up. I've just met with Mark Johnson and his team in Indonesia and really congratulated him on the fabulous work they doing even in the face of COVID. In the second quarter, we achieved just under 80% of our target annualized run rates for metal sales, we will \u2013 we're on track to reach full rates for metal production by the end of the year and our team in Indonesia has just done a fabulous job in the face of dealing with pandemic in a challenging physical environment. We executed well designed operating protocols. We're dealing with this new upturn in cases in Indonesia in recent weeks. We're helping to support the government in our local community. We've implemented travel other restrictions to mitigate the spread. We're encouraged by the increasing availability of vaccines at our job site in general in Indonesia. Number of our workers to significant number have already seen vaccines and received vaccines. We have a goal providing vaccines to all of our workforce in the second half of the year and we're supporting nearby communities and their efforts to respond to COVID. We have a real strong support from the government of Indonesia, a real positive partnership with PT-FI state-owned shareholders on that shareholder mine they were all working together and are aligned. I've been working in path for 30 years, over 30 years, and I'm personally proud and gratified by our team's accomplishments. Since we began investing in the underground over 20 years ago the transition from the open pit that began 18 months ago and dealing with COVID is just remarkable what we've been able to do. Planning investing in this transition began in the 1990s, now experiencing the success especially for all of us in Freeport. We now look forward to continuing long-term success and Grasberg by building values in this world-class historic mining district with low-cost, high-volume and sustainable production. Slide 9 shows the multiple options for Brownfield low-risk growth across our global portfolio, increasingly encouraged by the opportunities in the U.S. where we have favorable community support across the board with where we operate, favorable tax situation, and a long history of working in a responsible way. We're expanding our mine production in Lone Star, Bagdad, other sites and we have exciting new opportunities from technology involving leach recovery from our historical operations. The Lone Star mine, our newest operation situated adjacent to our long-standing operations in Southeast Arizona. There we have strong community support and this new mines performing above design capacity. We're evaluating expansions of Lone Star's oxide ores. We're actually making a lot of money in what normally would be stripping operations. We're conducting long range planning for the development of a potentially world-class sulfide resource that lies beneath this oxide cover in our historical mining area. We have an opportunity and a strong likelihood of moving forward with constructing a new concentrating the double production in our Bagdad mine in Northwest Arizona. What we expect to finish this project next year. Emerging leaching technology, which I am pumped about provides substantial opportunities for added growth across our portfolio global resources. We're evaluating attractive expansion operation expansion, opportunity that El Abra mine in Chile, where we're partnered with CODELCO. This project would require significant capital investment along lead time, but it's attract large, major future expansion of El Abra is likely, but not now. We're deferring investment decision on this project until we have more clarity about the mining policy issues currently under consideration by the Government in Chile. We're also evaluating development of an underground deposit called Kucing Liar in the Grasberg district, operated by PT-FI. This copper gold resources involves the large block cave mine using the substantial infrastructure that we already have in place. We have expertise, long track record, Mark Johnson and his team has come up with revised development plans that make the project less capital intensive, economics better it's a large operation it'd be a block cave with about 90,000 tons per day. So that's real big, 6 billion plus tons of copper resource, 6 million ounces of gold. And it fits right in with our plans. We have additional opportunities to invest in projects to support our copper, our carbon reduction, other sustainability goals, including investing to develop clean, renewable energy for our operations and communities. We're advancing plans for an exciting ESG type project to recover metals from the recycling of electronic devices at our Atlantic Copper processing facilities in Spain. Bottom line, we're going to be disciplined and devoting capital to new investments. We're going to be focused on value-added projects supported by long live reserves. We have a long track record of success in developing projects. We have established license to operate and positive relationship and support from communities where we have the opportunities to invest. Slide 10 goes back to Lone Star shows we're meeting, exceeding expectation. Original plan was 75,000 tons a day, 200 million pounds of copper, we now exceeded this, reaching the targeted rate of 95,000 tons a day on a sustained basis we have take outs capacity to do this yield 285 million pounds of copper. Looking at a further increment that would involve a relatively small investment in tankhouses, mining equipment, we use 300 or more pounds of copper, 80% more than our original design. The product here [ph] though is longer term; we have a major opportunity for Lone Star become a cornerstone asset for our company. Potential resource is 10 times more than our current reserve. As we mined these oxide ores, we're gaining access to this undermine potentially massive sulfide resource, long-term keystone asset for our company. Slide 11 talks about this reference I made earlier to leaching technology, gaining additional copper from material that's already mine. We're progressing this. We have lots of opportunity to apply. It's an exciting potentially have a new opportunity with low incremental cost and low-carbon footprint. We're engaged in multiple studies using a range of different technologies internally and externally to capture this value from existing stockpiles. Our estimate now is for 38 billion pounds of copper in these stockpiles. This is a material that's already been in mines. And if we can recover just 10% to 20% as material it would be like having a major new mine with variable capital and operating costs. A significant portion of this is in our flagship Morenci mine, largest mine in North America, where we are now applying artificial intelligence data analytics to help us understand what's going on with these leaching performance opportunities. Our team historically was instrumental in unlocking substantial values years ago with the venue SX/EW technology. We're now focused on taking this leaching technology to the next level by using modern approaches to it. We've established a cross functional team of technical experts, metallurgist, mine planners, data scientists, geologists, business analysts, all working together to take full advantage of this really exciting opportunity. Slide 12, we have strong operating franchises in the U.S., South America and Indonesia gained the trust and respect of our partners, our customers, suppliers, financial markets, and more importantly, the workers, communities and host governments where we operate. We have significant large scale project development, operating expertise. Team Freeport has all the capabilities to undertake new projects and responsible, efficient manner. I'm going to close on Slide 13 by recognizing people of Freeport. All around the globe their commitment, dedication, resilience, positive outlook, cooperative spirit is just gratifying. Our team is passionate about the role we're going to play achieving a better and more sustainable future for everyone. Team Freeport has the capabilities and drive to continue to meet, exceed our own high level of expectations and those of our stakeholders. We're living in a great, a time of great challenge and exceptional opportunity for our business, that our team, we're meeting the challenges, embracing the opportunities, our futures by with reported charging ahead responsibly, reliably and relentlessly. Kathleen, I'll turn the call back over to you to talk about our financial results. Kathleen, I want to put an explanation point on your \u2013 the comments you made about cost management. They were going focused on inflation around the world and the impact on mining companies and as Kathleen said we've had higher energy costs, our grinding material costs. But Josh Olmstead and our America's team has just done a great job in helping offset that Mike Kendrick in running our molybdenum business, which is a primary production business and a byproduct business. And with higher molybdenum prices is offsetting some of these cost increases, we've got a high gold price would help us Danny Hughes is leading our supply chain group. So a combination of all these things is helping us as a company to really mitigate much of these increases in cost, working with logistics. So, I just wanted to make a note of that because I think it's important giving \u2013 given all of our concerns about, where inflation is leading us. So, let's do turn over to questions. Thank you. We're just under 80% right now, in terms of metal production targets. That's well ahead of schedule. We'll be at 100% by the end of this year. Thank you, Emily. Dave, good to hear your voice, let me just say, the higher capital spending is a positive. We've come out of a period of time with capital constraints. Now, we're spending capital, not huge incremental amounts some of its timing, but to create new values. And the Deep MLZ is a huge success story, because we've successfully met, manage the size of necessity issues that we encountered earlier. So in Mark's point, the key to our future success is these mine rates, we need to build a mine rates up. And we're successfully doing that. And we're dealing with this constraint at the mill by building SAG3 and making other investments. But the key to our future success was meeting our mine rate targets. And that's been a key for 15, 20 years. And for us to be able to achieve that is just something that we all feel so good about, and congratulating our team for doing that over the years. Thanks, David. Chris, let me say, this is the complicated business, I mean, we get to these numbers, and we look and see how that they look. But underneath that, they're always unexpected things that jump up, and in terms of, there's new challenge in measuring grade, these column heights in the underground development a large and so being able, we had higher grades, first quarter, slightly lower grades a second, that's just going to be a feature of what we have to deal with. So, there are just a lot of moving parts. Our team around the world keeps finding ways to incrementally improve things, those will unfold into our numbers over time, and there'll be a lot of moving parts. Shipping, for those of you who follows for a long period of time knows that, that's always a timing issue, that Grasberg afford there's a very shallow point of, a shallow sea there. We have a relatively complicated historical loading operation there. We have to lighter concentrates out to ships and in weather, shipping schedules, logistic issues will always have a timing impact. I just come back again. The real key to us is mine rates, mining rates incrementally improve things and that's just an ongoing process that we think. We early of action to I mean, this is just an example. It wasn't major, but it has an impact. We have concentrated pipelines to go from the highlands down to the port, with a schedule plan, maintenance of some things happening, we had to advance this plan, that plan maintenance. So nothing unusual. This is typical of our operations there, since then, started ramping up the Grasberg in the 1990s. And so it'll be part of the things we'll have to deal with in the future. It just not the focus of our success, focus for success with this mine rate, ramp-up. So Alex, and thanks for the question. It's, I want to make clear if there's not one technology, in play here, there's a series of efforts by different parties to develop different technologies. We have our own R&D work going on. And we're looking across the board and how this might apply to us. I think we are specially situated to take advantage of it because we have these large number and size of pass reaching operation, some of which are now totally inactive, that we can look to apply these to, so we have a special opportunity in industry. Others have some, but we have a special opportunity to look at this in two ways. One of it is to use the leaching technology and by the way, we're supplementing that with this artificial intelligence, data analytics opportunity to measure the impact of all this, but to apply this to inactive and existing leaching, leach pads, that we have a large abundance for us. So that's one thing. And then aspirationally it might provide a way to recover material from mining operations that would otherwise have to be recovered through mill investments. And it could be looking ahead an opportunity to minimize capital by recovering low grade sulfide deposits that would otherwise have to be mined and milled. So it's early stages, we don't have complete answers. I just want to share with you how exciting it is. It's an opportunity for us, opportunity for others the industry. This is not a shill all tight game changer for the fundamentals of copper supply [ph]. Yes, I got Cory Stevens is leading this had a session with this new team that's been formed. It's a large, Freeport is a large number of people recall him and his guys are adding to this, and I just walked away from this is a new opportunity. You've heard me talk about years, for years about the outlook for the copper market being so positive. The assets that we have, the undeveloped reserves, the undeveloped resources we have. This is beyond that. This is not even it's not reserves, of course, it's not in our resources. So this is a brand new opportunity to be significant for Freeport, and nobody's better situated than us to take advantage of it. Me too early to say that Alex, way too early. This is not like building a concentrator to one time deal. It's an ongoing deal, we'll continue to add it, as Kathleen said, we've been limited to what we could do with Cerro Verde the world's \u2013 with the world's largest concentrating milling operations are and because of our focus on mine rate ramp-up. At Grasberg, we haven't yet brought all those new tools and skills and opportunities, technology, the PT-FI and we'll be doing that in the future. So this is not a one-time deal, but an ongoing part of our business going forward. And our team is really bought into it. And the costs of the smelter are tax deductible to PT-FI. No, I'm talking about the operating costs and so forth. Appreciation. This is all of the PT-FI though. You nailed it, Marcos [ph], in your analysis. I'm just pointing out that you've got the relief from the 5% export duty. You've got an operations where the depreciation and operating costs are tax deductible in the consolidated Indonesian tax return for PT-FI, which is substantial Indonesian taxpayers. The government gets almost 50% of the economics at PT-FI through taxes and royalties. Now, they have an equity ownership of 50%. So, 70% or more of the economics of Indonesia go to the government. FCX retains the interest is essentially all the interest we had going into these negotiations, which were years. I didn't think we could do. But what a fabulous outcome for all parties we had in 2018. Excellent point. 40% of today's copper supply comes from Chile and Peru, 40%. And now we have both countries going through the political process that looking to get more for the governments away from the miners. We don't know how all this will turn out and it's going to take time to know that. Just certified the new President in Peru, Chile's got a long-term process looking at their constitution. We've already said, that the impact in Chile is causing us to delay a decision on a world-class expansion opportunity, we have in El Abra. Other miners are also going to be affected by this. We really don't know what the outcome is. Bottom line, this is going to be supportive of future prices. Well, you look back over our shoulder, there have been other Presidents in Peru overtime that have gone into office with similar types of comments, and when they get into office and reality of the importance of the mining industry to support their economies, become self evident. We don't know now. We're working with the rest of the industry in Peru to present a case by the importance of copper mining to that country. But we will have to work our way through this. It is an uncertainty. We don't have a significant growth opportunity in Peru, but we have a very substantial operation in Cerro Verde that significant in terms of our current and future levels of copper production. And so it wouldn't be helpful, are instructed to try to play the outcome for all this. We do have a strong stabilization agreement, which is relatively new replaced an older one, and it's stronger. But as we've always done will work with the industry will try to work cooperatively with the government communities to contribute to Indonesia's efforts to relieve poverty, and that I mean, Peru's efforts, really poverty in that country. It's \u2013 it is a concerning of the level of Colorado River, which is one of the major sources of water for operations. But this is not a new problem. We've been doing with this consistently over the years. And we have taken steps, with communities with Native American groups, with a farming community to deal with it. So, we don't see \u2013 we see this is an ongoing process that we will have to devote resources and management to we don't see any kind of crisis emerging. But we're going to work cooperatively with everybody to try to conserve water when we do a great job right now with our conservation, reuse of water, and let it's going to be an ongoing management deal. All of that's built into our current cost structure and we won't anticipate major changes in that looking forward. Yes. We're achieving where we hope to be no question about that. We have to deal with some of these general factors, but just achieving the volumes having the gold credit, and high grades of copper, just allow us to do it, Mark, do you want to comment on this? Our Molybdenum business, it's a great business and leverage to prices and we're able to flex. Mike you want to make a comment on that? All right. Well, thanks, everyone. It's exciting times the best is yet to come. So hang on. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, and good morning, and welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan second quarter conference call. FCX released results earlier this morning, and a copy of today's press release and slides are available on our website at fcx.com. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call, and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today.  Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. I'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings. On the call with me today Richard Adkerson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Johnson, our Chief Operating Officer for Indonesia; Josh Olmsted, our Chief Operating Officer for the Americas; Mike Kendrick, who leads our molybdenum business; Rick Coleman, who leads our construction and growth projects; and Steve Higgins, our Chief Administrative Officer. I'll start by briefly summarizing our financial results, and then we'll turn the call over to Richard who'll review our outlook and the slide presentation materials that have been provided to you. As usual after our remarks we'll open up the call for questions. Today, FCX reported second quarter 2021 net income attributable to common stock of $1.08 billion, or $0.73 per share. That included net charges totaling $56 million or $0.04 per share, detailed on page Roman numeral seven of our press release. Adjusted net income attributable to common stock totaled $1.14 billion or $0.77 per share. Our adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2021 totaled $2.7 billion. And you can find a reconciliation of our EBITDA calculations on Page 35 of our slide deck materials. We had a strong second quarter, our copper sales of 929 million pounds, and gold sales of 305,000 ounces were significantly above the year ago quarter. But our sales were approximately 5% lower for copper and 8% lower for gold relative to our recent estimates, primarily reflecting the timing of shipments from Indonesia. Our annual guidance is consistent with our prior estimates. Our results in the second quarter benefited from strong pricing. Our second quarter average realized copper price of $4.34 a pound was 70% higher than a year ago quarterly average. Our net unit cash costs of $1.48 per pound of copper on average in the second quarter, with slightly above our estimate going into the quarter of $1.42 per pound, but that primarily related to nonrecurring charges associated with a new four-year labor agreement at Cerro Verde. Operating cash flow generation was extremely strong, totaling $2.4 billion during the quarter. That included $0.5 billion of working capital sources. And our operating cash flows significantly exceeded our capital expenditures of $433 million during the quarter. Our consolidated debt totaled $9.7 billion at the end of June, and our consolidated cash and cash equivalents totaled $6.3 billion at the end of June. Net debt was $3.4 billion at the end of the quarter and we achieved our targeted net debt level several months ahead of our schedule. I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard and we'll be reviewing the slide materials that have been provided. Go ahead, Richard. Okay, great. Thank you, Richard. And I'm going to start on Slide 15. And just make some brief comments on our operating manner \u2013 matters and go through our financials and then we'll open it up for questions. Richard talked about the great progress we're making at Lone Star. We're very focused now on sustaining the rates to keep our tankhouse full way, which has a capacity of 285 million pounds per year of copper, and looking at potential increments beyond that with relatively small and attractive investments. Richard also mentioned our plans at Bagdad, we're advancing studies to double the capacity there, and hope to be in a position to qualify a project and commence a project there next year. At Morenci, we've started to increase our mining rates, which had been curtailed in the last 12 months. We averaged about 725,000 tons per day of mine material on the second quarter, and are ramping up to reach 800,000 tons per day, by the end of this year, going to 900,000 tons a day in 2023. We've also advanced from 2022 to restart of some of Morenci milling capacity that was also idled last year to reduce costs. Now with the improvement in copper prices, these actions result in more profitable production. We're also very encouraged by the opportunity to add low cost production at Morenci through our Leach technology initiatives. In South America, the teams are continuing to work to restore production to pre-pandemic levels. We continue to target a full restoration at Cerro Verde in 2022. And we've been running at about 95% of the mill capacity in recent months. You've seen in our press release that the Cerro Verde team reached a new four-year labor agreement with a significant percentage of the workforce during the second quarter. That was in advance of our labor agreement exploration which is coming up at the end of August of this year. We're very pleased with the win-win outcome of the agreement and now working to conclude a mutually satisfactory agreement with the balance of employees. At El Abra in Chile, we're well on our way to restoring production levels that were curtailed last year. We're increasing the stalking rate of material on the leach pads and moving forward to add a new leach pad to accommodate the higher rates. This is capital that was always part of our plan, but was deferred last year as part of the capital conservation plans that we rolled out in April of last year. This allows El Abra to increase production on a sustained basis to about 200 million pounds to 250 million pounds per annum for the next several years. As we assess opportunities for a major expansion there. As Richard talked about Grasberg, we're continuing to deliver results and generating strong cash flows. As you recall, we started the second quarter was significantly more concentrate inventory than we normally carry. With a strong production volumes and some maintenance downtime at our port, weather issues at quarter end, sales were below our earlier estimates in the quarter. This is a really a short -term timing issue and we expect to be able to work inventory levels down in the second half of this year. We successfully commissioned at Grasberg the second crusher at our Grasberg Block Cave during the quarter, and that'll provide sufficient capacity for a ramp-up to 130,000 tons per day you've seen the performance and the records achieved from the Grasberg Block Cave during the quarter. We're also moving to advance the installation of our third SAG mill there, that's been part of our plan to support the higher rates of throughput. We've also identified an opportunity to invest in a new mill circuit that will allow us to increase copper and gold production in Indonesia through the achievement of higher mill recoveries when the initial phases of this project and the economics are highly attractive. Our global team also remains focused on cost management and efficiency projects to extend equipment lives improve energy efficiency, and maintenance practices with the use of technology. We have experienced some degree of costs increases this year principally from energy price increases and to a lesser extent the impact on consumables of steel price increases, increased freight costs and sulfuric acid costs. We've had partially offsetting these items we've had, the benefits of a weaker exchange rate in South America versus the U.S. dollar. The increases in costs have been offset by significant increase in molybdenum prices in recent months. And those who provided a very nice hedge to certain of these cost inflation items. We talk on slide, we've seen in the release plans for to meet our commitments in Indonesia for the new smelter. On Slide 16, we provide an update on our plans to meet the commitments that we agreed to with the Indonesian government in 2018 to construct 2 million tons per year of in country processing facility of copper concentrate. We have been advancing the discussions with our Japanese partners to expand the existing smelter at PT Smelting that would fulfill a portion of the obligation. And there are several financial and operating benefits of expanding this facility, which has been expanded very efficiently in the past. After considering various alternatives for the balance of the commitment, we've concluded that the best long-term option is to continue with our plans to construct a new Greenfield Smelter in East Java near the existing facilities at PT Smelting. We recently entered into an EPC contract with Chiyoda to construct a 1.7 million ton facility there. And we're now focused on completing the project as efficiently and as timely as possible. We show in the graph on Slide 16 on the right, the estimated timing of expenditures over roughly a three-year period, FCX is responsible for 49% of these expenditures. We recently completed a new $1 billion bank credit facility for PT-FI to advance these projects and are planning additional debt financing, which can be obtained at attractive rates to fund these activities. As indicated the long-term cost of the financing expected for the smelter, would be offset by a phase out of the 5% export duty. And we show a graph on the bottom of Slide 16, which shows you that the economic impact is not material as the cost of the smelter, would be essentially offset in lower duties, which we're currently paying. Slide 17, provides a three-year outlook for volumes. These are consistent with our previous guidance. We're continuing to pursue additional incremental near-term growth opportunities and conducting our longer range development planning. Moving to Slide 18, we show the significance of cash flow generation using these volumes and cost estimates and the prices ranging from $4 to $5 copper and holding, holding gold and molybdenum flat at $1,800 per ounce of gold and $16 per pound of molybdenum. But you see here on these graphs we would generate EBITDA in the range of over $12.5 billion per annum for 2022 and 2023 on average at $4 copper to $17 billion per annum at $5 copper, and at its operating cash flows net of taxes and interest would be $9 billion to $12 billion using these price assumptions. Is demonstrated in the second quarter we're generating very significant free cash flow and this trend is expected to continue with cash flows significantly above our capital spending, On Slide 19, we include our projected capital of $2.2 billion this year and $2.5 billion in 2022. As you'll note, we shifted about $100 million in expenditures from 2021 to 2022, which is timing related. And we've advanced some capital from future years into 2022 to reflect the timing of additional leach pad construction at Lone Star and the addition of some highly attractive growth spending in Indonesia related to mill recoveries. We've entered a period of outstanding free cash flow generation that growing volumes, strong markets and low capital requirements you'll see on Slide 20, and this is backward looking, but over the last 12 months, we've reduced our net debt by $5 billion, and that included $2 billion in the second quarter alone. You'll see our credit metrics are strong, and less than 0.5 times EBITDA on a trailing 12 month basis, and we're projecting our credit metrics continue to be strong and improving. As Richard mentioned, we achieved our targeted net debt level several months ahead of our schedule. With our long lived asset base and growing production profile and strong markets will have the ability to continue to strengthen our balance sheet, provide increasing cash returns to shareholders, and build additional values in our asset base. The Slide on 21, just reiterates our financial policy, our performance base payout policy, which was established by our board earlier this year, providing that up to 50% of free cash flow would be used for shareholder returns with the balance available for growth and further balance sheet improvements. And with the recent achievement of our net debt target, we expect our board will consider additional payouts to shareholders with our 2021 results. We're looking forward to reporting on our continued progress and continuing to build additional values as we go forward. And now, operator, we'd like to open the call up for questions. Thanks, Emily. We've just reached the debt \u2013 net debt target at the end of June and so going forward, we would have up to 50% of the cash flows available as we generate them to consider additional payouts to shareholders. Our board will be reviewing this and we do expect that we will be following the policy that will be paying out up to 50% of the excess cash flow. We have not made any conclusions on whether it will be additional dividend payouts or share buybacks. And that'll be something that will be considered at the time, but the commitment is there to pay strong cash returns to shareholders with our free cash flow. And we expect over the next several months to continue to generate free cash flow. And that'll continue into next year and beyond. 78% was the average. And that's the average for the fourth quarter Emily, so we'll \u2013 we expect to hit the run rates in the fourth quarter. On the capital, we shifted a $100 million of capital from 2021 to 2022. And that really was a timing matter we haven't been spending as quickly as what was originally budget and budgeted. So, we've just \u2013 $100 million is related to the timing. We've also brought forward some capital that was in our plans in the future, dealing with constructing new leach pads at Lone Star. And then we also \u2013 the only new thing that we've added in 2022 is this project that we talked about with respect to increasing mill recoveries at Grasberg and that I'll be spent over a multi-year period. It's roughly $400 million in total, but we've got $100 million scheduled in 2022. Ultimately, that will add volumes. We expect, on the order of 50 million pounds of copper and 50,000 ounces of gold and it's a very attractive and short payout project. So that's a positive and that'll be used as one of the projects, just one of many, hopefully that will be used with our other 50% of cash flows. There really weren't \u2013 on the second question there really weren't any material changes with respect to the Deep MLZ and Grasberg, Block Cave. We update the plans every quarter. And there were really only minor changes between the two and really that the long-term plan for Grasberg and Deep MLZ is consistent with the previous forecasts and Mark, I don't know if you want to add anything there. But it's \u2013 we certainly very much in line with our previous forecasts. Yes, I think it's the ladder Chris. The Grasberg mill project wouldn't come in terms of the recoveries until 2024. And it's, within the rounding, but I do believe we have some upside. As we look forward, I do believe we have some upside on a consolidated basis from these initiatives. That potentially could come in to 2022 and 2023. No, not really, we had some maintenance that we were doing on the ship loaders, which impacted us earlier in the quarter. And then we got hit by weather at the end of the quarter. So that's, that was really, what was it wasn't really COVID related. On Slide 11, the 38 billion pounds that are identified here. That represents material that's already been mined, that is not in our reserves, not in any of our production plans. And so just recovering, a small percentage of that ends up being potentially over time, a fairly large number. But Josh, you want to make some comments on your perspective? That is embedded. We've continued that project. We internalized it. We were doing some external work and we to cut back on capital and operating we externalized \u2013 internalized it and that agile work way and using artificial intelligence is embedded in now in everything that we do. So that is in our plans, I'd say the one area where it's not is at Cerro Verde, because we have not been able to get the mill, we're running roughly 95% of the pre-pandemic levels. We had plans prior to that to move well above 400,000 tons a day. And so I think with the pandemic passing, at some point, we will be able to go back to those initiatives at Cerro Verde and those are not in our plans. But in the year end they are. That's correct. Yes. The debt service would affect our dividend to the extent of 49% of the debt service. But that's all said with a duty phase out. So really, the dividends to FCX are not expected to be impacted. Thanks, Carlos. Our U.S. assets more valuable to your second point, we're not planning to go outside of our geographic footprint. We have opportunities in the U.S. and elsewhere. Well, with Lone Star where we're working this incrementally. We've already been running this higher than the design rate, and we've got plans and studies looking at is there a further increment and those will be sorted out in the next several months. With respect to Bagdad, that is a major project and we're advancing our engineer \u2013 our studies, feasibility studies, we're looking at all facets of water and tailings. And as I said, I'm hopeful that we will be in a position to be able to qualify that project next year. We don't have the final capital expenditure estimates we've been working to try to find mill setups that would be lower capital intensity than a traditional mill, but that work is still underway. No. We do have some higher costs baked into our numbers with respect to the items we talked about earlier, principally energy and \u2013 more than offsetting the impact for these higher gold and molybdenum prices, but these are order of magnitude rounded numbers it should be slightly above these numbers, but we just continued with the order of magnitude that we previously presented. But we are including some cost inflation in our revised forecast. There is contingency in our estimate. It is not a fixed price contract for all the reasons that you just mentioned. We want to be able to help manage the costs and didn't want to have a lot of risks baked into the capital that may or may not occur. So, we felt this was the right structure, there's risk sharing within the contract. The government understands the situation in terms of COVID, we were delayed over the last 12, 15 months associated with the project. And the current situation is something we're also monitoring very closely. But we're keeping the government informed regularly about the timeline. And our commitment is to \u2013 with Chiyoda is to get this done as timely as possible, but recognizing their certain things that will be outside of our control, like the current COVID situation. Well, the scope is different. We had previously we were thinking of having two lines at the smelter for 2 million tons total and we reduced it to 1.7 tons, because of the expansion opportunity at PT Smelting. So the scope is a little different. And yes, there have been some changing cost factors you've seen all the \u2013 what those are in terms of where construction costs are currently. But we've done a good bit of value engineering over this period with Chiyoda, but all parties are committed to having an open book and making this the smelter as successful as possible and bringing it online as cost efficiently as possible. And so we were in the range of $3 billion, $2.5 billion, $3 billion before, but there's been some pluses and minuses. And we're slightly above that now. Yes. We worked with the government during the quarter, and this third party that the government engaged and we engaged to review our performance against the plan and the schedule and what was related to the pandemic. And they looks like the fine will be in the $16 million range, which we've fully accrued in the quarter we had previously accrued $13 million. And so it looks like that is behind us. We also with this provided a new schedule to the government of what the progress is expected to be. And so that is what will be measured against in the future. So, we're not expecting this to be an ongoing matter and it's \u2013 we're pleased with the resolution of it. On the latter part of that we are looking at, we've been operating primary mines are below their capacity. We are looking at potential options to increase production from the Climax mine. In terms of prices, we don't predict prices, but the market is Mike can tell you is been very tight. And we're seeing that that continue even during the summer months. And I don't know Mike you want to add?"

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nKathleen Quirk: Thank you, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan conference call. We released our results this morning and a copy of today's press release and slides are available on our website at fcx.com. Our call today is being broadcast live on the Internet and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our annual report on our Form 10-K. On the call with me today is Richard Adkerson, our Chairman and CEO. We\u2019ve got Mark Johnson, who leads our Indonesian operations. Josh Olmsted, who leads our Americas operations. Mike Kendrick, who leads our Molybdenum business. Steve Higgins, who leads our commercial activities and is our Chief Administrative Officer as well. And Rick Coleman, who leads our project development activities. And I'll start with briefly summarizing our financial results. We will work through our slides and some prepared remarks and then we will take your questions. Today, we reported first quarter 2021 net income attributable to common stock of $718 million and was $0.48 per share and adjusted net income of $756 million, or $0.51 per share after adjusting for net charges totaling $38 million, or $0.03 per share, and a detail of those net non-recurring charges are in the press release on Roman numeral 6. We reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or adjusted EBITDA during the quarter of $2.04 billion and we have got a reconciliation of our EBITDA calculations on Page 36 of our slide deck. In the first quarter of 2021, we had copper sales of $825 million pounds, which approximated our estimate. Our gold production in the first quarter of 2021 was in line with our estimate in January. However, we had a deferral of certain shipments in Indonesia to the second quarter and that resulted in a timing variance for our gold sales. In the first quarter, we benefited from improved pricing. Our first quarter average realized copper price was $3.94 per pound, substantially above the year ago quarter and our gold price of $17.13 per ounce was also above the year ago realized price. We continue to focus on maintaining low-cost position. Our consolidated average June net cost for our copper mines averaged 139 per pound of copper in the first quarter. We generated strong operating cash flows totaling $1.1 billion and that was net of $300 million of working capital uses. And the cash flow has exceeded capital spending, which totaled $370 million during the quarter. As you've seen our Board in February, adapted a new financial policy aligned with our strategic objectives of maintaining strong balance sheet, increasing cash returns to shareholders and advancing opportunities for future growth. We ended the quarter in a strong financial position with $4.6 billion of consolidated cash, $9.8 billion of debt and our net debt - our debt net of cash was $5.2 billion at the end of March. Richard, I'd like to turn the call over to you and we'll start reviewing the slide materials that are on our website.\nRichard Adkerson: Thanks, Kathleen. I couldn't be more pleased to be able to review with you our first quarter performance and particularly exciting progress we've achieved over the past year where we all faced such uncertainties. It's a special active invigorating time here at Freeport. Our teams are working safely. We remain diligent with COVID as we have successfully executed our operations plans and we're now working on projects for future growth. Our Grasberg underground ramp up is proceeding on schedule. That's key for our strategy. Production in the United States is increasing with our newly commissioned Lone Star mine, the first quarter start - restart of our Chino mine in New Mexico and from increased mine rates where we at Morenci, our flagship mine in the U.S., the largest in North America where we could curtail production a year ago to conserve cash. In South America, we're working to restore production levels to pre-pandemic levels and we'll achieve that over the next 12 months. The Cerro Verde team in Peru and our El Abra team in Chile are doing outstanding work in navigating these issues. We are focusing on sustainability initiatives as all businesses are. This has always been key to Freeport in managing our operations. We are moving to certify each of our operations with a new Copper Mark. This Copper Mark is an industry framework that was recently developed by the International Copper Association to ensure responsible production consistent with UN Sustainable Development Goals. Today, we leave the industry with six of our operations now certified and we're working to get all certified. Going to the slides, I have just a few slides to review with you. On Slide 3, our annual sustainability report has been published and is now available on our website. This is the 20th year we've reported on sustainability. We're working to make it better. I encourage all of you - each of you to read it. We're proud of our good work on sustainability and remain committed to continuous improvement. Past years, we released this report with our annual shareholders at our Annual Shareholders Meeting. We moved it up. We've added new resources to our Freeport team working on sustainability issues. And I congratulate this team for their efforts to make this report available now earlier, so that we can facilitate our expanding engagements with the broad set of constituencies that are now focused on our sustainability performance and initiatives. Last year, we published our initial report on climate. Our 2021 report is forthcoming. We\u2019ve recently published our annual report to shareholders with what I think is a great thing charging ahead responsibly, reliably, and relentlessly. This theme portrays where we are currently positioned at Freeport as a leading and growing global copper producer. We are determined to succeed and operate responsibly and the Freeport tradition will be relentless in the execution of our strategy. Slide 4. First quarter production was in line with our targets. We increased our 2021 sales guidance to 3.85 billion pounds of copper and our 2022 volumes to 4.4 billion pounds. The Grasberg ramp up that I referenced earlier continues to progress in a simply outstanding fashion. We've now achieved 75% of our annualized targeted long-run metal production run rate. We're on track to be at 90% by the third quarter and full rates by year-end. After all these years of hard work, reporting this progress is simply a highlight of my career. The credit though goes to our team on the ground in Indonesia supported by our global team of technical experts. This is a historical major accomplishment as we've converted, as we are in finalizing the conversion of the Grasberg open pit to this massive underground operations. Americas businesses are going well. We are achieving production and cost targets and now we're accurately focusing and working on future growth opportunities, generating strong cash flows, improving our balance sheet. Over the past 12 months, net debt was reduced by over $3 billion to $5.2 billion by the end of this first quarter. But during this period, copper price averaged $3.13. It's now over $4.25. Many are predicting higher prices near-term. Our near-term outlook of copper and gold sales volumes is substantially higher.  Our recent performance this large reduction in debt with lower commodity prices, lower production volumes demonstrates the current strength of our company in generating cash flows. Our strong performance and the positive outlook for our business and the commodities has enabled our board to adopt a new financial policy which will provide increasing cash returns to shareholders while providing flexibility for growth and building a very strong balance sheet. We've also added two new directors David Abney, the retired chairman CEO of UPS with his massive global supply chain operations and Bob Dudley the retired CEO of BP a long time leader in the global extractive industry have joined our board. Each of these men have strong knowledge and experience in global markets and with issues we face in managing our business. Bob and David had many opportunities to join other boards. Their decisions to join our boards is personally gratifying and appreciated. They're really enthusiastic about working with their fellow directors at Freeport and our management team and creating value responsibly for all stakeholders. Moving to Slide 5. Countries around the world responding to COVID with aggressive fiscal and monetary policies. Now this is an important element of near-term demand for copper extending beyond China. China has been the driver of copper demand growth over the past two decades. Now the source of new demand is expanding. In addition to continuing strong copper consumption in China, higher copper consumption in developed countries with COVID recovery initiatives and the increasingly important demand in emerging markets driven by global growth copper now has major new sources of demand from global investments in carbon reduction, infrastructure and expanded technology 5G, Artificial Intelligence and data analytics broadly all require more copper. Importantly copper is essential to the transition to a global cleaner energy future. Roughly 70% of copper is used to deliver electricity. As clean energy initiatives are implemented copper intensity in the economy expands in a major way. The outlook for copper has never been better. Slide 6. Significant demand growth is inevitable. Supply to meet this growth is severely challenged. It's going to require meaningfully higher prices to support mine investment. The combination of rising demand, scarcity of new supplies, point to large impending structural deficits supporting much higher copper prices than previously anticipated. I'm sure you've noted this in recent forecasts by a widening group of industry analysts. Freeport is notably well positioned to benefit from these fundamentals. A leading responsible large-scale producer of copper with near-term and longer-term growth embedded in our portfolio. The scarcity value of a portfolio like ours is unique. It's extremely valuable now and it's going to be even more valuable as large market deficits emerge. Slide 7 highlights our near-term growth. For 2021 copper volumes are anticipated to be 20% higher and gold volumes 50% higher than in 2020, 55% higher than in 2020. Volumes are expected to grow further in 2020 in the 15% to 20% range for both copper and gold. The capital to achieve these near-term higher volumes and the execution risk are largely behind us. Higher volumes with low incremental costs yield expanded margins at prices ranging from $4 to $5 for copper we would generate annual EBITDA for 2022 and 2023 of over $12 billion to the range of $17 billion per annum. That's big numbers. Page 8 describes this new financial policy our board adopted earlier this year. It's designed first to support a strong balance sheet, increase returns to shareholders and provide funds for investments for the future. The current market for copper and its favorable outlook are providing substantial cash flows to meet these objectives as I just outlined. Our board approved a base dividend of $0.30 per annum per share. The first quarter dividend will be paid in May as we resume dividends. After reaching a target net debt in the $3 billion to $4 billion range which at today's prices will do by the end of this year our board's policy establishes a performance-based payout framework for additional cash return to shareholders through dividends and potentially stock buybacks. Returns to shareholders will be determined by allocating available cash flow of up to 50% to shareholder returns and the balance available for future growth and potentially further debt reduction below our target at $3 billion to $4 billion. Our board will assess the additional payout at least annually. With a current level of copper prices and the outlook for copper and gold prices the numbers nor above point to a large cash returns to shareholders with substantial financial resources available for future growth investments. Slide 9 describes some of these growth investments. We have multiple options across our portfolio. We resumed our work that we suspended a year ago because of COVID to evaluate and the timing and the initiation of these opportunities. In the U.S. we're looking at expansions at Lone Star and bagged in and also evaluating opportunities to increase production from [leach] recovery technologies that's really exciting. The Lone Star mine is our newest mine. It's adjacent to our existing operations in southeast Arizona where the companies operate as operations go back to the 1800s. There we have strong community support. We have great relationships with the native American groups. We're evaluating expansions of Lone Star oxides ore which we're now producing and which are growing in terms of the availability of ores but importantly we're also conducting these longer range planning for the development of what looks to be a potentially world-class sulfide resource right in the midst of this historical mining area. At Baghdad in Northwest Arizona we have an opportunity to construct a new concentrator to double production. We have a very long reserve life there. Also there we have strong community support. I keep emphasizing this because that's a challenge for new supply development around the world. We're focused on technology to reduce capital intensity in these projects. [Leach] technology initiatives provide substantial opportunities in this regard to add value all across the portfolio. We're continuing to evaluate an attractive potentially significant expansion of our El Abra mine in Chile, where we're partners with Codelco. This project would require larger investment longer lead times than our U.S. project. Resource is attractive and very large and this signifies that a major future expansion of El Abra is likely. We're evaluating the development of a new deposit an undeveloped deposit at PT-FI in Papuan Indonesia it's called Kucing Liar. This copper gold project involves a large block cave mine using the substantial infrastructure already in place for Grasberg. It would benefit from our expertise and long track record of success in block gating. We're also and this is a lot of fun evaluating a series of interesting investments in projects that support our carbon reduction and other sustainability goals. This involves ideas of developing a new energy generation as clean renewable for our operations in nearby communities and we're advancing plans for exciting projects at Atlanta Cop and Spain to recover valuable metals through recycling electronic devices which again is good from a sustainability standpoint. Now we have these opportunities we're going to be disciplined by making new investments by being selective and measured and deploying capital, focused on value-added investments and do this because we have such long-lived reserves, established license to operate and we're going to work with communities effective by new investments. Slide 10 points to this reserve position. Our reserve life is over 30 years. Now that's proved in probable economically recoverable reserves. In addition we have identified over 100 billion pounds of copper from mineral resources beyond reserves. All part of our existing operations we're going to be working to incorporate these into future reserve editions and mine plans. It is becoming increasingly more challenging and costly for our industry to develop supplies to meet the dramatically increasing demand for copper and our team literally loves where our Freeport is situated in this environment. Slide 11 we have strong operating franchises in the U.S., South America and Indonesia. In all these localities we've earned the trust and respect of our partners, our customers, suppliers, financial markets, and most importantly our workers communities in the countries where we operate. We have significant development large-scale operating expertise development and large-scale operating expertise. We have all the capabilities now to undertake new projects anywhere in the world regardless or the situation in a responsible and efficient manner. I want to close by recognizing the people of Freeport around the globe, their commitment, dedication, remarkable achievements over the past year of COVID is really special. In the context of all the challenges our team has faced over the years and we've overcome I'm just immensely proud of this team. Building on these accomplishments with an increasingly bright future Freeport is charging ahead responsibly, reliably, and relentlessly. Kathleen's going to review the financial results with you.\nKathleen Quirk: Thank you Richard and I will just make some brief comments on our financial and operating matters and then we can take your questions. Starting on Slide 14 we provide some additional details on our operating activities. You can see in the U.S. the Lone Star mine is operating well. We see opportunities to continue to increase our stacking rates there and fill up the tank house which has a capacity in the 285 million pound per annum range. With continued success and increasing the mining and stacking rates we will have an opportunity for relatively low incremental investments, increased production from the Lone Star oxides well above the original design. We restarted Chino in the first quarter at a 50% rate and as we gain the efficiencies we are targeting there likely have opportunities to ramp up further. At Morenci we're increasing mining rates by about 10%. This was previously planned for 2022 but we are accelerating this which will give us additional production in 2022 compared with the earlier plan and set us up for growing production over time. In South America the team was able to achieve stronger rates compared with our plan. Because of the operating restrictions in Peru we felt it was prudent to maintain our plan this year at a milling rate of 360,000 tons per day and we expect to ramp that up over the next 12 months to the 400,000 a day level as COVID restrictions are lifted. At El Abra we're making great progress increasing our operating rates to provide additional copper in 2022. As Richard mentioned at Grasberg we made excellent progress in the first quarter continuing to execute the ramp up plan to retreat our targeted metal run rates by the end of the year. We ended the first quarter with more inventory than originally expected and these sales will be recorded in the second quarter. You will note from our detailed schedules and the reference material that we made some small changes in the Grasberg block cave and Deep MLZ mine sequencing. The net effect of these were not material to our metal production and the outlook is similar to the prior plans. We're very encouraged with the scale of the ramp up going on both at Grasberg block cave and Deep MLZ. We will be adding a second crusher at Grasberg block cave this quarter which will set us up to continue to increase rates there. On the next slide we provide an update on our plans to develop new smelter capacity in Indonesia to meet our commitments to the government. We're proceeding with our Japanese partners at PT smelting to expand the existing smelter. This can be done on a relatively low-cost basis and would reduce the required capacity for the new smelter to 1.7 million tons of concentrate per annum. The cost for PT smelting is roughly 250 million and PT-FI would fund these costs through a bank financing which is currently in progress. As you've read we have been engaging in discussions with third party for the balance of the requirement whereby this party would build a new smelter under a structure similar to what we developed for the PT smelting existing smelter in the 1990s. To date the parties have had extensive negotiations but we have not yet reached acceptable commercial terms. In the interim we're continuing our planning on the greenfield project in East Java. As we show on this chart on the right you'll see that the long-term cost, the economics for the financing of the smelter which we would plan to finance with debt would be offset by a phase out of the 5% export duty we're currently paying. So the economic impact for PT-FI is not material. On slide \u2013 on the next slide, Slide 16 where we provide our three-year outlook for copper volumes, gold volumes, and molybdenum volumes. We are increasing our copper sales volumes in 2021 to 3.85 billion pounds from the prior estimate of just over 3.8 billion pounds and we've increased our 2022 guidance by 100 million pounds to 4.4 billion pounds of copper and that's reflective of incremental increases in the U.S. The rest of the sales estimates are largely unchanged. As Richard mentioned we're continuing to assess additional incremental near-term growth opportunities while we conduct our longer range development planning. We provided on Slide 17 an overview of our estimated unit net cash cost for the year. You will note that we have updated our estimate to average 133 per pound of copper in net unit cash costs compared with the prior estimate of 125 per pound. A large portion of this increase is associated with higher royalties, duties and profit sharing related to the change in price assumptions from $3.50 per pound of copper to $4 per pound. We've also increased our cost estimates to reflect higher energy costs principally oil related which our forecast is now higher by about 25%. Our team continues to do a great job in managing cost efficiently. We have seen some increases but they have not been significant. Our team continues to look for creative ways to maintain our low cost position. On Slide 18 we show the significance of cash flow generation using our volume and cost estimates and we provided sensitivities ranging from $4 per pound copper to $5 and we hold gold flat at 17.50 per ounce and molybdenum at $11 per pound. The growth in volumes at low incremental cost results in very significant EBITDA generation. You can see here ranging from over 12.5 billion per annum on average for 2022 and 2023 at $4 copper to 17 billion per annum at $5 copper. Operating cash flows under these price scenarios would range from nearly $9 billion to $12 billion and these cash flows are significantly above our planned capital spending providing substantial free cash flows as we go forward. On Slide 19, we show our capital project forecast and we show projected capital of $2.3 billion in 2021 that includes potential spending on the Indonesian smelter which again would be debt finance but these, the 2021 guidance numbers are very similar to what we had in our previous reports. Our 2022 capital of $2.2 billion on a consolidated basis is about $200 million higher than our previous forecast and that incorporates an acceleration of mining investments to bring volumes forward and provide capacity assurance for our plans. We've entered, we are in a strong financial position an event a period of exceptional free cash flow generation. Slide 20 kind of shows you that the exceptional cash flow generation that we have in the business. You can see on the slide where in a six month period of time our cash balance has increased by over $2 billion. Our long-lived asset base, our growing production profile, strong markets provide the ability to continue to strengthen our balance sheet, provide cash returns to shareholders and build additional values in our asset base. Our financial policy that Richard talked about earlier is designed to tick all of these boxes and we look forward to executing on these plans. And in closing I just say the echo what Richard said it's an exciting time at Freeport. We've got the right assets at the right time and we're staying focused on continuing our momentum and now operator we would like to open a call for questions.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Emily Chieng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nEmily Chieng: Good morning, Richard and Kathleen. Thanks for the update here today. Just a question around the capital allocation policy and I appreciate that you updated this a couple of months ago. But certainly sounds like there's a significant amount of cash returns potential upcoming if we were to assume current copper prices. But maybe on the other side of that, could you discuss how you're thinking about when the right time to sanction growth would be? And any color you can provide on sort of long-term or sustainable copper prices that you would need to see or need to base case in your assumptions for this? And then you mentioned being disciplined and selective, but as you look over the next couple of years, at what point would you start considering not pulling the trigger on growth?\nRichard Adkerson: So Emily, we are - we have suspended all of our studies on growth projects a year ago. And now, we've resumed those analysis with the purpose of understanding the pros and cons of each of the projects and developing an evaluation of them. That basic work of evaluation, we expect to continue at least through the end of this year. And by the end of the year, we hope to be able to have a clearer path forward. So it will be some time before there is any commitment to actually initiate significant capital spending. And then in the meantime, we pointed to all the volume growth that's coming about from Grasberg, the resumption of operations from COVID, et cetera. So we're going to have increasing volumes with strong prices and high cash flows with limited amount of capital being spent because we just won't be ready, as you say, to sanction projects. We don't have any particular target at copper price. We've always looked at a scenario of different prices that of how a new project would fit into our portfolio. We want to take advantage of these resources that we have and yet have risk managements by how they fit into all of our existing portfolios. So we don't look at it so much on an individual project by project basis, but how does it fit in with our projects. Freeport really benefits from the fact that we operate all the projects we have interest in. So that allows us to approach these on a \u2013 from a consistent corporate strategic basis as opposed to an individual project by project basis. Certainly, at these price levels, our projects are economic. And now you know the prospects are for prices to go much higher. So I anticipate that over time, we will be spending money on capital. That's just not going to happen in the near-term and that's going to be a feature of the entire industry because even when we decide to spend the timeframe for developing a project is multiple years, minimum six to eight years. So all of that's going to be, as you well know, Emily, because you write about it all the time, that's going to be very supportive of copper prices. You can't turn on the valve quickly to add new mine supply. And when you can't do that and volume and demand rises that translates into higher prices. \nEmily Chieng: Got it. That's very helpful color. And one quick one if I could squeeze it in. just an operational update at the Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ. Looks like sales volumes maybe moved out a quarter a little bit. But anything you can provide on sort of the sustainability of the copper grades we're are seeing, any ramp profile comments that can pace the drilling, belling there, please? Thank you.\nKathleen Quirk: We got Mark Johnson on. Mark, you want to just give an update on. \nMark Johnson: Yes, we're generally on plan. Grades are tracking well from the model to what we see at the mill. In fact, we're fortunate that the mills actually seen a little bit more grades and the mine has recorded as pending. Drawbell opening, it's probably shown in the slides that we did make some adjustments in Deep MLZ. We slowed down the cave advance in some of our diorite rock types, which are the more challenging rock and accelerate the cave advance and some of the scarring going off to the west in PB2. In GBC, we've added \u2013 accelerated our drawbell opening. And over the five years, it's relatively the same.\nEmily Chieng: Great. That's helpful. Thank you.\nRichard Adkerson: Yes. And the fact we referenced delay in shipments that had nothing to do with operations. The inventory was there on site. There were loading, shipping some administrative issues with the government, and so all that inventory was produced on site now will be sold. And as inventory built, we were able to advance some maintenance activities from the second quarter to the first quarter, all of which is really supportive of meeting our plans going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris LaFemina with Jefferies.\nChris LaFemina: Hey, thanks for taking my question. Good morning.\nRichard Adkerson: Good morning.\nChris LaFemina: Just questions about this, Richard, how are you? The question is about the performance in South America. It was good to see that you appear to be operating well there despite the escalation of COVID, but we have some political risk that is potentially escalating there as well, especially in Peru with the upcoming presidential run-off. So the first question is related to the contracts and licenses that you have in Peru. Is it similar to what you had in Indonesia, where you have a stability agreement with international arbitration provisions should something go wrong in terms of government trying to significantly increase taxes or try to nationalize the mine? Is that you have the same sort of protection there?\nRichard Adkerson: Yes, we \u2013 yes, the answer to that is an absolute yes. And we - stability agreements has been a feature of the operations in Cerro Verde since way before Freeport. But we were able to get a new stability agreement as we expanded the business. And you know, there is always a correlation between the aspirations of government and workers for more funds as copper prices rise. But the copper is so critical to Peru in terms of a country that still faces challenges of poverty and so forth. So we just step back and watch political environments. We know we have to work with whatever governments wherever in the world that a country selects, but we do have strong rights to do that. And unlike some operations in Peru, we have positive relationships with the local community because of social investments we've made in water and wastewater projects. So our team there is just, I mean, I can't tell you what a great job they go. A year ago, we were really worried about Peru. Our workers lived in the city of Arequipa. It was real issue with community spread, but we've been put to work the community, developed temporary living and we got our rates up to near our original run rate targets and we can expand further as we go forward. The team there has just done a remarkably good job...\nChris LaFemina: So very good to hear. Thank you for that. And then\u2026\nKathleen Quirk: In terms of stability agreement, we do our taxes are fixed in that agreement, and they are actually higher than the current statutory rate in Peru. So we've paid harder to get the stability and we also pay a lot with the communities and big employer. We have a profit sharing mechanism there. And that's partly why you saw the cost increases that we do is the mine becomes more profitable with higher prices. There's a large profit share and that goes to employees, partially to employees and partially to the country. So it's a good model to share economics both to the local communities and country and workers and to the investors.\nChris LaFemina: Great. Thanks and with respect to potential expansion at a El Abra we're hearing from other Chilean miners about challenges getting permits. It seems like in some cases, permitting is nearly impossible, which I suppose for the copper market is pretty bullish if companies can bring capacity online in Chile, but I'm just wondering, in terms of El Abra what sort of permitting hurdles you might have to actually spend that asset. Thank you?\nKathleen Quirk: We will have an environmental impact statement that will file in connection with the project. So that is a very comprehensive permitting process. We've gone through it before and you have to do a lot of baseline work, etc. So there is a lot of work you have to do before you actually submit it. But that project partially is, the permitting is partially why Richard saying it's six to eight years out.\nChris LaFemina: Okay. Thanks.\nRichard Adkerson: And the best environment, Chris, it's going to take a long time to get that permit. Now, we don't have some of the costs of where this mines located. And the fact that it's been a long running existing operation is near Codelco mine. It doesn't have some of the permitting issues that others have. A major mill expansion would require a desalinization plant and the cost of transmitting that water up to high altitude where we operate but it's in a setting where we don't face some of the challenges others face. But best case it takes a long time and it's a big project.\nChris LaFemina: Great, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Hacking with Citi. \nRichard Adkerson: Good morning Alex.\nAlex Hacking: Hey Richard, how are you? Good morning. Just following up on Chris's question on Peru. I'm not sure how much you can answer here but has there been any engagement yet between the mining industry and the candidates particularly the candidate that's leading in the polls? And then secondly, regarding your production footprint with Chino back and Cerro Verde heading back to full rates, does that put Freeport's production footprint back at normalize pre-COVID levels or is there a potential future upside at these prices? Thanks.\nKathleen Quirk: I'll take the second one first. Just in terms of the ramp back up we've made the decision to start ramping El Abra back up. That's in progress. We expect to get back to pre-COVID levels there in 2022. That's reflected in our guidance. Same with Cerro Verde. In the U.S. we had cut back the mining rates significantly. We're starting to ramp those back up. We have some opportunities, still have some opportunities at the Morenci that aren't baked into our forecast yet. And then we have opportunities at Chino, because our plan right now is running at Chino 50%. In addition to that, as we mentioned we have some incremental opportunities potentially at Lone Star. So I would say in the U.S. we do have some opportunities that aren't in our near term plans. That will be -- we'll be assessing as well as some of the leach technology applications that Richard referred to earlier. So we do have some near term opportunities not in our plans but a \u2013\nRichard Adkerson: Hey Kathleen let's let Josh make a brief comment about that. Josh Olmstead was named this past year to be our Chief Operating Officer, Americas. He's been number two guy for many years. He's a young guy but he's got a long career in Freeport is just doing an outstanding job and bringing energy and leadership to our group. So Josh make a couple of comments.\nJosh Olmsted : Thanks Richard. As Kathleen was stating we have some near-term opportunities with Morenci, Lone Star incremental things. The most exciting piece I think is the work that we're doing on the leach technology that both Richard and Kathleen touched on. If we can prove out some of the concepts that we've identified and began working on it could have a significant impact on our ability to take advantage of long-term stockpiles that we have out there that contain copper today that we haven't been able to extract and so this leach technology really could be meaningful as we look for opportunities to get some incremental, low-cost incremental copper as we move forward and so our plans are working on that this year with the goal of having very similar to Richard's comments about the bigger scale projects having much more clarity by the end of the year on what that looks like and what the potential value is for us but we're super excited about what we're seeing so far. \nRichard Adkerson: So restarts technology reaching all those point to growing volumes from our traditional operations Chris. Alex right we're at Alex now. so Alex on Peru man how complicated politics everywhere in the world and in Peru as they were approaching this runoff you had a half dozen more candidates each having 10% plus or minus support in the polls. So it was very complicated. Freeport stays out of politics. As I said we don't, we just run our business, support communities, be prepared to work with whoever emerges in the political process. The mining industry in Peru is there is an active mining association that's led by Peruvians and they engage with candidates to understand and interact and communicate with them on policies affecting mining and I'm sure they'll be working with both of these candidates as we go forward and you will notice the candidate who earlier was being very aggressive and talking about mining is now making comments about the importance of mining to Peru. So all of that will come to play and we'll just have to see what happens. \nAlex Hacking: Thank you very much. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners with Bank of America.\nTimna Tannersa: Hey good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask you a little bit, hey there, I want to ask a little bit more about costs. Obviously you went through in nice detail about what caused the incremental cost in the quarter and in the guidance but obviously costs are rising inflation is a big topic I mean do you think that this encapsulates the future costs that you could bear fully or are you seeing further pressure and can you detail where that could come from and a little bit of what you've been seeing in more detail? \nRichard Adkerson: So the first point I want to make is a point Kathleen referenced earlier. Some important elements are of our cost are correlated to copper prices. They're correlated I mean things like royalties, profit sharing plans, labor cost in general there is correlation. Then there is other input costs that are correlated. Energy costs which is an important element our cost and with energy costs have risen in recent months. Copper prices have risen even more thankfully but energy costs are are built into that and then certain other costs are seeing some inflation. So far energy costs are the ones that outside of the profit sharing loyalty costs are the ones that have the biggest impact and as time goes by and copper prices rise we'll have to deal with inflation but we have such strong margins, we have a great supply group team that works with our suppliers to offset costs wherever we can. We're working really aggressively to do that. So Tim I think I mean I know you realize this because you're right about it but inflation is good for copper. I mean inflation is good for copper with what the world's doing today with all this spending on COVID recovery with spending around the world that's being driven to the deal with economic inequalities. That's pushing money to people who consume and create economic velocity which creates demand for copper. So in the broader sense all these forces will work to the benefit of our company.\nKathleen Quirk: Yes. What's been interesting is you look at today four and a quarter copper last time copper was four and a quarter, oil wasn't at 60. It might have been [$110] a barrel. So we are benefiting from the lower energy prices even though they have come up some the historical correlations just aren't, as correlated as they once were. And we go through a review each quarter on where we are with our supply chain and revise our forecasts every quarter to reflect current pricing and that sort of thing. So that's baked into these plans. And as Richard said whether we'll have additional cost pressures from tightening freight markets or other supplies we'll have to see where that goes. But right now the forecast that we developed is based on what our pricing contracts are currently.\nTimna Tanners: The high quality problem, but if we're assuming a bit higher copper price for example, we should also be incorporated sounds like some assumption of inflation as well?\nRichard Adkerson: Well as I said, the answer is yes. There's correlations, I mean, royalties rise, profit sharing rise and then you make your judgment about energy, steel costs and so forth. But and I know a broken record Tim, that I know you understand. But bottom line is margin rise. For many businesses these inflationary movements deteriorate margins. Historically our margins have stayed very strong as copper prices rise and other costs rise. \nTimna Tanners: Now, for sure, that's clear. Thank you.\nRichard Adkerson: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Murphy with Barclays.\nMatthew Murphy: Hi. I have a question on the Indonesia smelter and wondering if you can help me understand the risks around the pace of the project. So there was the disclosure in your 10-K about the sign and there is been some comments in the press and just wondering what you're expecting? Is it possible through this discussion and looking at the options that you could see more fines or you could see more frustration from Indonesian government or do you think it's going the other way, and it'll get resolved. \nRichard Adkerson: I'm going to let Kathleen talk about this. She is working actively with the parties there and negotiating the terms. We are going to cooperate with the government. We made a commitment in December 18 to build a smelter and I'm very clear that we recognize that commitment and we are prepared to honor it. There are different views within the government of Indonesia. When you reference the government it can be interpreted as being one group. There are different views within the government itself about whether it's despite this development [indiscernible] or go forward with the project at Gresik that we initially started and so we are working closely with our partner and shareholder mine [indiscernible] and with the Ministry of state owned enterprises, with the Ministry of Energy and Mines defined what is best, what decision the government off we made and we're prepared to go forward provided we have if we go in the direction that where we have reasonable terms and reasonable regulatory environment. So Kathleen why don't you talk about this and mine ministry wants to push us I believe we will resolve this situation and that everything's going to be okay. Kathleen would you give some detail.\nKathleen Quirk: Okay. Under the regulations the government grants annual export licenses and then there is a six month check to evaluate your progress against the smelter development schedule that they have and they have approved. As a result of COVID as we said during 2020 we notified the government that our schedule was impacted by the pandemic and they will force majeure conditions that prevented us from you from achieving schedule. And under regulations, there is a potential for fines if you don't achieve the schedule. And that's what the government did. They levied this fine and we have gone in and explained to them the reasons why the project was delayed and that this was force majeure, which is allowed under the regulations to waive any penalty. So we're in those discussions with the government. They're asking for some additional support for opposition and details. I mean it's obvious that COVID effected schedules for projects all around the world but they're asking for some more details. We think it will get resolved in a mutually satisfactory way. But as Richard said we're also very focused on meeting our commitment to the government ultimately. We notified them that we had a 12 month away in reaching the, because of COVID reaching a deadline of December of 23 to construct the new smelter, and now we expect that that wouldn't be completed until 2024. This option that Richards referring to [indiscernible] potentially could get us back on schedule. And we just need to make sure that it fits with from a commercial standpoint and overall business risk standpoint. But we're working closely with the government. I can say that our interests, having our partner in [indiscernible] our interests are very much aligned and we're all on the same page in terms of what we need to do and we're just working our way through the government's regulations to resolve this issue. And I'm confident we will.\nMatthew Murphy: Thanks Kathleen. So the outcome of the discussion with the government would that be the completion of sort of a new smelter progress schedule? \nKathleen Quirk: Yes. You're right. That's part of what we're discussing as a new schedule for the project and that's tied in with our discussions with them on this administrative fine. \nMatthew Murphy: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Carlos de Alba with Morgan Stanley.\nCarlos de Alba: Good morning Richard and Kathleen good morning. Just following up on this smelter would you please expand a little bit more on the status of the negotiation within commercial parties maybe for a third party to do the investment in the major smelter? Are those still ongoing or have they stopped and we should now come back and think more about PT-FI doing this method on its own? And then on CapEx and it's not a big increase CapEx outlook for 2022 increase about 220 million related to other projects. Is there anything in concrete that you highlight or it's just based on the series of projects that that you elaborated on earlier in the call? \nKathleen Quirk: Yes. Well on the --\nCarlos de Alba: Let me say the last question. It's good news Carlos. Higher copper prices gives you an incentive to spend money to increase values and so these are items that were largely in our long term plans that we're advancing to create value right Kathleen.\nKathleen Quirk: Yes. That's exactly right. We brought forward some capital. We've also increased production. So that's what that was is basically mining equipment investments. The first part of it in terms of the negotiations and we don't publicly comment on details of the negotiations while they're still in progress. But we had all set a target of trying to get the commercial agreement with a third party done by the end of March and so there were extensive negotiations that went back and forth during the first quarter. By the end of March we had not reached an acceptable agreement and we've been moving in parallel this other projects. At some point we've got to make a decision. We haven't finalized that decision yet but we are moving the greenfield our own project forward so that we can meet our obligations to the governments and not rely solely on a third party. So at this point we are still having some discussions with the third party but we're moving the other one in parallel as well. So as soon as we get a final decision and believe me we all want that as soon as possible we will convey that to you.\nCarlos de Alba: That's clear and I appreciate the caller. Thank you very much Richard and Kathleen. \nSpeaker: Yes Carlos it's and when we talk there we say I was listening to Kathleen some of the weirdest decisions by the government. The we in Indonesia is the PT-FI which is a partnership between mine [indiscernible] and FCX. FCX operates but we in Indonesia is that partnership along with the ministry of state-owned enterprises. It's a different world from those of you who followed us for all the years we were dealing with the government when FCX had to take the lead and really me personally was there on the ground on these negotiations. Now we're there very much as a team as Kathleen says it's aligned and it's a much better environment than we had historically.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Orest Wowkodaw with Scotiabank. \nOrest Wowkodaw: Hi good morning. Just again a follow-up on the smelter. At some point I assume you're going to have to make a decision in terms of whether to build your own or whether to go with a third party. Is there at this point is there a drop dead date in terms of which direction that goes? I mean certainly you can't drag this on forever?\nRichard Adkerson: No it's a government. I mean it's really, the government's going to make that decision. We're prepared if we could get, if the government supports it and we could get a reasonable deal with constraint sale terms and a regulatory environment dealing with our IUPK obligations, PT-FI is prepared to deal with we debate. If that doesn't happen we're prepared to go forward with the other project and we're working on that. We're not sitting here not doing anything. We're prepared to go forward and I just think it's important to keep in mind that while this is a big project and it's a management issue it's not a huge financial issues FCX. I mean we were paying a 5% export duty that would be relieved with the smelter. The financial implications are not that significant and more than 70% of the financial implications go to the government through taxes and equity share ownership. So --\nKathleen Quirk: But Orest we do want to make a decision sooner. There is not some kind of drop dead date but we want to make this decision very soon.\nOrest Wowkodaw: Yes. Okay. Thank you. And just I was going to say it's a follow-up. Go ahead Richard.\nRichard Adkerson: No I'm just saying it's not like we can say we're going to do this, we're going to, it's got to be a joint decision between the government and PT-FI. \nOrest Wowkodaw: I see, okay. Is it fair to assume I mean given that benchmark or spot TC for copper are so depressed right now that in order for a third party to agree to build the smelter that it is affair to assume that they'd be looking for some kind of stability in the TCs perhaps that are at higher levels? \nKathleen Quirk: Yes.\nRichard Adkerson: Yes.\nOrest Wowkodaw: Okay. \nRichard Adkerson: Yes.\nOrest Wowkodaw: Okay and just a point of clarification did I hear earlier you state that you hope to be in a position to provide the market with some guidance on some of the brownfield growth opportunities in the U.S. by the end of the year? Was that correct?\nRichard Adkerson: That's our hope. That's our aspiration. I mean as you know we're very transparent company and our hope is that we get some clarity by the end of the year. Josh mentioned it. Kathleen mentioned it and as we do we're going to keep all of you informed.\nOrest Wowkodaw: Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Your next question caption the line of John Tumazos, Very Independent Research.\nRichard Adkerson: Hey John.\nJohn Tumazos: Thank you very much. Good morning. Thank you for taking my call and congrats on all the money that's raining on you. Just following up on Emily's first question for the Baghdad mill project and the El Abra mill project and the Kucing Liar underground project which we know you're going to meticulously engineer and study as you plan and permit and build and finance. Is it safe to say each of those are likely to come on 2025 or later?\nRichard Adkerson: Yes.\nJohn Tumazos: Is it --\nKathleen Quirk: Yes. [Baghdad] could come on quicker than the other two. The long lead times for investments for KL and Kucing Liar we are that's in our long-term plans. We're just optimizing it now so that in that capital will be spent over a long period of time and then El Abra just from a sequencing standpoint would come behind Baghdad from time period that it could come online. So you're talking about if you started everything right now you're talking about seven years out with all the permitting process seven- eight years maybe all the permitting process but Baghdad could be done probably on your 2025 type timeline if we depend on when we start.\nJohn Tumazos: If I could ask one more I recall Kucing Liar results that were very good in the 90s how recently has that been drilled and updated. So you have access and you've updated those studies and have more information. \nRichard Adkerson: Yes. We have also John you'll probably remember that Kucing Liar has pyrite content and so Mark talk about how we've been working and this has been a continual work project. it is independent of Grasberg black cave Deep MLZ and our other operations but Mark maybe comment on how we've updated our analysis of KL?\nMark Johnson: Yes. I mean in the last three years or so it was a significant change wasn't so much new drilling. We did do some drilling over the last couple years and we revisited some of the metallurgical work. The big change there was and as Richard alluded to the original KL mine plan was more focused on higher copper equivalent grade but it also had much higher pyrite and required a significant change to our processing. The new mine plan focuses on some slightly lower copper equivalent portion of the resource that has now become the reserve and we've, and this part of the ore body essentially we leave the mill as it is the pyrite problem is largely diminished and almost eliminated. So the overall capital as far as processing, power requirements, environmental management have dropped significantly in addition this new portion of the new mine plan the areas that we mined the gold recoveries go up substantially. We in our initial reserves several years ago gold recoveries were below 50% the new plan has gold recoveries over 60 and we think there's upside there. So it's a much less capital intensive, a much more robust plan, a lot less environmental management costs that go with this new KL plan. The one thing as Richard mentioned that it's independent but in some ways it does tie in. We share parts of the GBC ore flow system. KL ramps up and in coordination with the GBC plan we used some of the same conveyor and then the big part was is that the mill is relatively unchanged with this new plan. \nRichard Adkerson: Thanks Mark.\nMark Johnson: And so John, yes thanks Mark. So John this is not a competing project to our Americas growth plan. I mean it's in our long-term plan as Kathleen said. It fits in with everything we're doing out there and then the trade-offs of where we invest in the Americas is one where we will be looking at the pros and cons of each project. in the U.S. we have no royalties because we own the land and fee we have no taxes because of our tax loss carry forward for a very long period of time and tax rates in the U.S. are very low. So I mean, all of this this is an after tax, after royalty economic analysis, and we're going to decide where can we add value most economically for our shareholders.\nJohn Tumazos: I was just so happy to see it raining money and good opportunities on you. \nKathleen Quirk: Thanks John.\nJohn Tumazos: Thank you.\nRichard Adkerson: Long winding road but it's great.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas with VRP.\nRichard Adkerson: Yes, good morning. \nMichael Dudas: Good morning, Richard and Kathy. I need to follow up on your thoughts on investment for Freeport. Certainly looking at after tax returns, copper price, etc. taxes how much more will ESG be involved in some of the analysis that not only you but the industry is going to have to work on to get, you thinking of adding significant hurdles generally, some obviously, you have to have a social license to operate by and we understand that. But is it because of the more important that's going to be helpful is that going to add hurdles to some of this long term investment that the industry is going to require to meet the demand needs going forward? \nRichard Adkerson: It's not only go it is today I mean it is today. And I mean, ESG matters are not something that's common across all projects. They're all site specific related. I made a point, I think you probably picked up on it and talking about our growth projects in Arizona being supported by communities and by native American groups. That's because we've been there for so long and we have devoted attention and resources to those communities and to providing opportunities beyond just our separate operations. Elsewhere in Arizona even which has a favorable state view for mining development there are huge barriers from an ESG standpoint to developments and you just look at Rosemont and resolution and other projects. So you have to go and look at each particular project each the way companies have provided but it's an enormous barrier and it's going to grow. I mean the number of groups that are involved in ESG attention you see it with institutional investors [indiscernible] were with but consumer groups are very focused. Automobile manufacturers are focused about where their minerals coming from, where's their copper coming from. That's why this copper mark thing that I referenced is so important. So it's going to be, it's an enormous issue right now and it's going to be a major impact on, it's going to be supply development. So --\nKathleen Quirk: Yes. And it's always been part of our project evaluation. It's even more so today but it's always been part of our evaluation is using less energy, diversifying our energy sources to looking at renewables. Water is a big issue that we manage. We found a great solution in Cerro Verde in Peru when we did that project where we built a wastewater treatment plant to get water. So we didn't compete with other uses of water in the country and actually helped the community. So we're always looking as part of our projects, how does this project help the community and ESG has always been part of it as Richard said it's just growing much larger. And I guess this, but copper is really a great story. We don't have the scope three emissions that other companies have to deal with. Copper is actually, what copper is used for is actually used for decarbonisation but the scope one and two areas is something that we work hard on every day and it's all part of our project development plans and capital investment plans. \nMichael Dudas: Yes. Appreciate those thoughtful answers. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andreas Bokkenheuser with UBS.\nAndreas Bokkenheuser: Thank you very much. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick operational question a two part one actually. Obviously we saw production a bit higher in Q1 versus sales. Can you just comment a little bit further about the restocking? I think you were saying also that there might be some gold sales at Glasberg that are going to get delayed into sales Q2. So what kind of drove that?\nRichard Adkerson: Okay. So let me address that we don't sell copper and gold in Grasberg. We sell copper concentrate. It's got copper and gold in it. We get paid for the the individual components at LME prices but as I mentioned earlier what happened at Grasberg is we met our production targets, we transported this copper concentrate to the port site to be ready to ship, some shipments got delayed for various reasons and so the production's done and we recognize sales when the concentrate's loaded on ships. So literally all we have is some of those sales are going to be in the second quarter [indiscernible] first quarter and it's just that simple and throughout our operations we have timing issues like that. For those of you who follow the Grasberg we have weather conditions at port. It's a shallow water sea and so weather conditions can delay shipments but all this will ends up being strictly a timing whether it's at the last of the first quarter or the early part of the second quarter it's irrelevant.\nAndreas Bokkenheuser: Okay.\nKathleen Quirk: Yes. Generally our production equals our sales and we did have some both in the U.S. and in Indonesia we did have some changes between production and sales but that's like Richard said just timing.\nRichard Adkerson: As you can imagine we can sell everything we produce. That's not an issue.\nAndreas Bokkenheuser: Absolutely. That's very clear and a follow-up question you've obviously been mentioning that you expect the output of the Peru, and sort of early to kind of return to normal next year are there any other mines in your global portfolios that are right now kind of feeling the pressure of any COVID restrictions or anything of that nature where you expect there could be a bit of a volume ramp up going into uh next year? \nRichard Adkerson: Well, we mentioned we should we restart we'd actually suspended operations at the Chino mine in New Mexico relatively small mine but we resuming operations there. We reduced mine rate stripping rates at Morenci to conserve cost and that'll take some time to restore and production will build up from there but it's nothing of real significance. The amazing thing is the guys Mark and his team at Grasberg have just done remarkable with meeting our targets there in the face of a very challenging COVID location and we've done remarkable job in managing all that and continue to.\nKathleen Quirk: Yes. I'd say logistically in South America is where we have the biggest constraints currently but we're still dealing with it all over in terms of protocols, etc. So we're not letting up the guard and we're continuing to be very careful about how we operate make sure people are safe but in terms of the logistical side of things it's mainly impacted South America.\nAndreas Bokkenheuser: Okay.\nRichard Adkerson: Sorry. Internal medical director. We work with international SOS for years and they've been fabulous in helping us build testing facilities and facilities for dealing with infected people. We're able to treat them get them back to work and that's an ongoing process.\nAndreas Bokkenheuser: Okay. That's clear. So for South America the expected plan is the ramp up happens in the second half and then you're kind of back at full run rate in early 2022. Is that the right way of thinking about it?\nKathleen Quirk: Well, in fact and Peru specifically our plan is to run at this reduced rate all year long and we'll assess that as we go but right now the going in assumption is that we'll be in the situation for the balance of 2021 and then go back to the plan in 2022. That's the assumption. In Chile it's a smaller operation but we are beginning to increase our mining and stacking rates there and the metal impact will happen in 2022 but we're starting that now. so but our plan at Cerro Verde which is our largest operation in South America is to be at this low, slightly lower rate in the balance of the year. The team did a great job and was able to surpass expectations in the first quarter but it's not something that we feel is prudent to assume because the restrictions are still very significant. \nAndreas Bokkenheuser: Okay. That's very clear. Thank you very much. \nRichard Adkerson: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lucas Pipes with B. Riley Securities.\nLucas Pipes: Morning Richard. Kathleen thanks very much for taking my question as well. Most of my questions have been asked and answered but I wanted to circle back Richard to some of the earlier comments you made regarding this being one of the best copper markets outlooks you've seen and in light of that when we think about the framework for retaining capital versus returning capital to what extent could this be subject to review? We spend a lot of time on this call talking about organic growth for example. so could there be an incentive to toggle this ratio more towards the growth side and then along the same vein M&A -- have your views on that evolved and if so what geography could make sense? Could you be looking at producing miners or would you look pre-production would appreciate any updated thought from that as well. Thank you very much.\nRichard Adkerson: That's a very good multi-layered question. Let me see if I can answer it precisely. I've been around a long time and I see there's three kind of eras of copper demand. Pre-early 2000s it was all driven by develop countries GDP. Copper's most correlated commodity to GDP and it would rise and fall based on business cycles. China emerged and now for almost two decades has dominated new demand growth. It's all come from China when you look at it. The rest of the world's kind of been flat. The new era today which is so exciting is China's rate of growth which people have been pointing to for some time inevitably is falling has to fall. COVID kind of complicated all that up but its absolute demand for copper volumes is so strong because this economy has grown and that's going to continue with even as it pivots its economy to consumers and exports it's the absolute amount of copper that it grows even though the rate of growth will drop absolute amount be strong. Now the reason I'm so excited about now is now you've got it's COVID recovered in the developed world but also all this movement around the world you see it clearly here in the United States to push money to a broader set of people to enhance consumption. All this move towards incoming inequality which everybody recognized we got to do and that's going to create new copper demand and then my long-term story's always been in the undeveloped world, global growth all the vast numbers of people around the world that are living in substandard conditions have aspirations of having better conditions that requires more energy, more transportation, communication, more copper. So that's why I say the demand side to me is in a new era and it's really positive and the supply side I don't know how it's going to keep up with it. I literally don't. Here we have all of these projects at Freeport the price of copper could double overnight. Some people talk about it doubling anyway but overnight and we couldn't add new production of significance for a number of years. So it's going to be really interesting to see prices I just unless there's some global calamity prices it just seems to me clearly have to rise substantially. Substitution has to occur. Scrap has to grow but how to meet that demand and that's why I'm so thrilled about where we are after all this time working to put this company together. John Tamazo's referenced it I mean we have been through so much but I recall Kathleen and I developed a strategy in 2003-2004 when I became CEO of focusing on copper and now it's so great here all these years later to see it coming to fruition.\nLucas Pipes: Very helpful so.\nKathleen Quirk: And in terms of the M&A question we're really focused on our existing assets. We've got development options within the portfolio. We always monitor what's available externally and compare that against what we have.\nRichard Adkerson: Let me add just a personal observation on that. Our company made a mistake, misstep other mining companies made missteps when they forced M&A for strategic reasons. You just look over and over again. South side came to us as an opportunity. It wasn't a strategic plan to do it. We had talked with them about buying us. So where we are now is we have no strategy of engaging in M&A markets but we will be positioned now for the first time in a long-long time to -- if an opportunity come to us comes to us to take advantage of us. Our strategy is straightforward; execute, invest in a disciplined way in our resources that provide growth, that create value. If something comes to us we're going to be in a position to consider it but that's not our strategic objective. You mentioned startup operations and those come to us all the time but we have trouble. It's been a big barrier to make the economics of those work because to get into it you've got to pay the value that's been created already. When we have all these other resources in our portfolio where there is no value being given to them in our share price. So we see that's been a real barrier of making even what might be at some level interesting projects work economically for our company and we've had a long saying in Freeport big minds get bigger and smaller minds get smaller. So that's also a tough issue.\nLucas Pipes: Richard, Kathleen thank you very much for the color and continued best of luck.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jatinder Goel with Exane BNP Paribas.\nJatinder Goel: Good morning and good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. Just one on smelter. To get a bit more clarity is it only one party that you are engaging with on potentially outsourcing the smelter or are there multi-parties? The reason for asking you might have seen a news release or a media article last week that Indonesia has signed MoU with ENFI and that's in West Papua where people were said to have committed to 800,000 tons of raw material as well which doesn't seem to align with the full scale of smelters. So not sure if you're looking at just one smelter one party or are there multiple elements to it. Thank you.\nKathleen Quirk: Yes. The discussions today has been most extensive with the project at [indiscernible] The project that you're referring to is in Papua potential project and we are familiar with the developer there and have indicated that if there is excess capacity we may be able to supply but our options right now are focused on the base supply, are focused on either this [indiscernible] option or our project at Gresik.\nRichard Adkerson: In response to your comment we've made no commitment for supply on the Papua project. For years we would have liked to have seen a smelter developed in Papua because we, it would be desirable to help the local community there but the infrastructure cost, the absence of infrastructure, the timing investment that would be required for infrastructure have made it impracticable in the past.\nJatinder Goel: That's very clear. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our final question will occur from the line of Brian MacArthur with Raymond James.\nBrian MacArthur: Good morning. Hi how are you today?\nRichard Adkerson: Hi Brian.\nBrian MacArthur: I'd like to go back and talk a little bit about KL because finally after years it's getting closer but it does sound like the project as per John's comment has changed. So I just want to try and understand a little bit because when you look at the grade of this it's point the reserve grades whatever 0.9 copper and 0.9 grams per tonne gold. So it's a little more gold than some of the others. So in this new plan I guess my first question is you talked about certain areas of the ore body. Is there an area that's higher grade which you start which helps the economics and my second question it sounds like the new plan obviously saves CapEx which is good, technically probably is easier which is good but then you talk about lower copper equivalency. So I'm trying to figure out just how much lower that copper equivalency is and secondary that obviously that depends on price assumptions too. So I'm trying to [indiscernible] pretty good.\nKathleen Quirk: Yes. We will let Mark talk about it but there is a section of the mine that and we did the same thing with the Glasberg block cave development. We modified it over time to focus on the lowest pyrite sections and what Mark will tell you is that with KL we redesigned the mine plan to reduce the capital intensity because in order to get the pyrite there is more capital in the mill, more environmental management required and the recovery starts going down. You mentioned the 0.9 but it has a very low recovery in some of the ore. So what we have developed here is a more optimal plan that reduces upfront CapEx and modestly changes the total ore but from a metal standpoint you're actually ending up with similar metal because you've got higher recoveries. So Mark you want to add \u2013\nRichard Adkerson: Just we will turn to Mark but it's not that complicated. It's we've designed a new mine plan to avoid and minimize the pyrite section. So and by doing that we reduced mill investments plus there was going to have to be a pipeline you've been out there you -- a pipeline from the mill down the lowlands of storage for pyrite and low and so Mark it's more of a engineering design determination which gets all these economic benefits than anything else. Mark?\nMark Johnson: Yes. And I think the major advance was understanding where the not necessarily the highest grade but where the highest value after capital investment was in the ore body and if not for having a debt our contract with the government goes up to 2041 if not for that the material that we've deferred would also be in reserves. So what we've done in this new plan is brought forward. There is about half of the old reserve that overlaps with the old reserve and then there's another half where we've deferred a part of the lower value ore and been able to substitute it with higher value ore. This ore that we're now mining would be sediment hosted very similar to what we've milled for years in the DOZ, Deep MLZ, the old reserve was very much centered on this fault that the highest grades but as Richard and Kathleen mentioned some of the bigger challenges were a new mill, we had to grind it much finer. That came with additional power requirements and then we had to manage the pyrite which for us is to segregate it from the [MOD ADA] and store it separately. So by recognizing all the costs that are associated with some of the higher copper equivalent grade that's a combination of the copper and gold value and substitute it with looking more on a value rather than purely on copper equivalency, we came up with a much more optimal sequencing of the mine with the opportunity to go after this other material at a later date if we had the opportunity to mine beyond 2041.\nKathleen Quirk: And it's more reduced risk, more robust plan and we're doing some things right now to continue to try to enhance those gold recoveries.\nBrian MacArthur: And can you with this new plan and I forget what the original rate you figured KL was going to go through it can you actually offset the higher mining rate because I think you still have mill capacity at 240,000 tons too right? Does that offset it in or is it still sort of the same rate there?\nMark Johnson: It's very similar mining rates that we had before the tonnage is similar. It's a little bit less because we start a little bit later but this does fill the 240,000 tons of mill capacity that we'll have with the SAG-3 and so there is a obviously a district-wide plan that we sequence all of the ore bodies to best fill that mill in an optimal fashion. This would peak at 90,000 tons a day just marginally above what we're planning to do with the Deep MLZ and it ramps up as GBC would start to drop off and so it's a balancing of the highest value material getting the first opportunity for mill space.\nBrian MacArthur: Great. Thank you very much. That's very helpful and it certainly sounds like it's a much more profit risk adjusted capital intensity project than maybe it was thought of 15 years ago when we first looked at this I guess.\nRichard Adkerson: Yes, that's correct. Exactly right.\nBrian MacArthur: Thank you very much.\nKathleen Quirk: Thanks Brian.\nOperator: Now I'll turn the call over to management for any closing remarks.\nRichard Adkerson: 240,000 tons a day from the underground operation. I'll just leave it with that. Thank you so much for being on our call and we look forward to continuing to report our progress as we go forward in this year and following years. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kathleen Quirk",
            "content": "Thank you, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan conference call. We released our results this morning and a copy of today's press release and slides are available on our website at fcx.com. Our call today is being broadcast live on the Internet and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our annual report on our Form 10-K. On the call with me today is Richard Adkerson, our Chairman and CEO. We've got Mark Johnson, who leads our Indonesian operations. Josh Olmsted, who leads our Americas operations. Mike Kendrick, who leads our Molybdenum business. Steve Higgins, who leads our commercial activities and is our Chief Administrative Officer as well. And Rick Coleman, who leads our project development activities. And I'll start with briefly summarizing our financial results. We will work through our slides and some prepared remarks and then we will take your questions. Today, we reported first quarter 2021 net income attributable to common stock of $718 million and was $0.48 per share and adjusted net income of $756 million, or $0.51 per share after adjusting for net charges totaling $38 million, or $0.03 per share, and a detail of those net non-recurring charges are in the press release on Roman numeral 6. We reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or adjusted EBITDA during the quarter of $2.04 billion and we have got a reconciliation of our EBITDA calculations on Page 36 of our slide deck. In the first quarter of 2021, we had copper sales of $825 million pounds, which approximated our estimate. Our gold production in the first quarter of 2021 was in line with our estimate in January. However, we had a deferral of certain shipments in Indonesia to the second quarter and that resulted in a timing variance for our gold sales. In the first quarter, we benefited from improved pricing. Our first quarter average realized copper price was $3.94 per pound, substantially above the year ago quarter and our gold price of $17.13 per ounce was also above the year ago realized price. We continue to focus on maintaining low-cost position. Our consolidated average June net cost for our copper mines averaged 139 per pound of copper in the first quarter. We generated strong operating cash flows totaling $1.1 billion and that was net of $300 million of working capital uses. And the cash flow has exceeded capital spending, which totaled $370 million during the quarter. As you've seen our Board in February, adapted a new financial policy aligned with our strategic objectives of maintaining strong balance sheet, increasing cash returns to shareholders and advancing opportunities for future growth. We ended the quarter in a strong financial position with $4.6 billion of consolidated cash, $9.8 billion of debt and our net debt - our debt net of cash was $5.2 billion at the end of March. Richard, I'd like to turn the call over to you and we'll start reviewing the slide materials that are on our website. Thank you Richard and I will just make some brief comments on our financial and operating matters and then we can take your questions. Starting on Slide 14 we provide some additional details on our operating activities. You can see in the U.S. the Lone Star mine is operating well. We see opportunities to continue to increase our stacking rates there and fill up the tank house which has a capacity in the 285 million pound per annum range. With continued success and increasing the mining and stacking rates we will have an opportunity for relatively low incremental investments, increased production from the Lone Star oxides well above the original design. We restarted Chino in the first quarter at a 50% rate and as we gain the efficiencies we are targeting there likely have opportunities to ramp up further. At Morenci we're increasing mining rates by about 10%. This was previously planned for 2022 but we are accelerating this which will give us additional production in 2022 compared with the earlier plan and set us up for growing production over time. In South America the team was able to achieve stronger rates compared with our plan. Because of the operating restrictions in Peru we felt it was prudent to maintain our plan this year at a milling rate of 360,000 tons per day and we expect to ramp that up over the next 12 months to the 400,000 a day level as COVID restrictions are lifted. At El Abra we're making great progress increasing our operating rates to provide additional copper in 2022. As Richard mentioned at Grasberg we made excellent progress in the first quarter continuing to execute the ramp up plan to retreat our targeted metal run rates by the end of the year. We ended the first quarter with more inventory than originally expected and these sales will be recorded in the second quarter. You will note from our detailed schedules and the reference material that we made some small changes in the Grasberg block cave and Deep MLZ mine sequencing. The net effect of these were not material to our metal production and the outlook is similar to the prior plans. We're very encouraged with the scale of the ramp up going on both at Grasberg block cave and Deep MLZ. We will be adding a second crusher at Grasberg block cave this quarter which will set us up to continue to increase rates there. On the next slide we provide an update on our plans to develop new smelter capacity in Indonesia to meet our commitments to the government. We're proceeding with our Japanese partners at PT smelting to expand the existing smelter. This can be done on a relatively low-cost basis and would reduce the required capacity for the new smelter to 1.7 million tons of concentrate per annum. The cost for PT smelting is roughly 250 million and PT-FI would fund these costs through a bank financing which is currently in progress. As you've read we have been engaging in discussions with third party for the balance of the requirement whereby this party would build a new smelter under a structure similar to what we developed for the PT smelting existing smelter in the 1990s. To date the parties have had extensive negotiations but we have not yet reached acceptable commercial terms. In the interim we're continuing our planning on the greenfield project in East Java. As we show on this chart on the right you'll see that the long-term cost, the economics for the financing of the smelter which we would plan to finance with debt would be offset by a phase out of the 5% export duty we're currently paying. So the economic impact for PT-FI is not material. On slide \u2013 on the next slide, Slide 16 where we provide our three-year outlook for copper volumes, gold volumes, and molybdenum volumes. We are increasing our copper sales volumes in 2021 to 3.85 billion pounds from the prior estimate of just over 3.8 billion pounds and we've increased our 2022 guidance by 100 million pounds to 4.4 billion pounds of copper and that's reflective of incremental increases in the U.S. The rest of the sales estimates are largely unchanged. As Richard mentioned we're continuing to assess additional incremental near-term growth opportunities while we conduct our longer range development planning. We provided on Slide 17 an overview of our estimated unit net cash cost for the year. You will note that we have updated our estimate to average 133 per pound of copper in net unit cash costs compared with the prior estimate of 125 per pound. A large portion of this increase is associated with higher royalties, duties and profit sharing related to the change in price assumptions from $3.50 per pound of copper to $4 per pound. We've also increased our cost estimates to reflect higher energy costs principally oil related which our forecast is now higher by about 25%. Our team continues to do a great job in managing cost efficiently. We have seen some increases but they have not been significant. Our team continues to look for creative ways to maintain our low cost position. On Slide 18 we show the significance of cash flow generation using our volume and cost estimates and we provided sensitivities ranging from $4 per pound copper to $5 and we hold gold flat at 17.50 per ounce and molybdenum at $11 per pound. The growth in volumes at low incremental cost results in very significant EBITDA generation. You can see here ranging from over 12.5 billion per annum on average for 2022 and 2023 at $4 copper to 17 billion per annum at $5 copper. Operating cash flows under these price scenarios would range from nearly $9 billion to $12 billion and these cash flows are significantly above our planned capital spending providing substantial free cash flows as we go forward. On Slide 19, we show our capital project forecast and we show projected capital of $2.3 billion in 2021 that includes potential spending on the Indonesian smelter which again would be debt finance but these, the 2021 guidance numbers are very similar to what we had in our previous reports. Our 2022 capital of $2.2 billion on a consolidated basis is about $200 million higher than our previous forecast and that incorporates an acceleration of mining investments to bring volumes forward and provide capacity assurance for our plans. We've entered, we are in a strong financial position an event a period of exceptional free cash flow generation. Slide 20 kind of shows you that the exceptional cash flow generation that we have in the business. You can see on the slide where in a six month period of time our cash balance has increased by over $2 billion. Our long-lived asset base, our growing production profile, strong markets provide the ability to continue to strengthen our balance sheet, provide cash returns to shareholders and build additional values in our asset base. Our financial policy that Richard talked about earlier is designed to tick all of these boxes and we look forward to executing on these plans. And in closing I just say the echo what Richard said it's an exciting time at Freeport. We've got the right assets at the right time and we're staying focused on continuing our momentum and now operator we would like to open a call for questions. We got Mark Johnson on. Mark, you want to just give an update on. In terms of stability agreement, we do our taxes are fixed in that agreement, and they are actually higher than the current statutory rate in Peru. So we've paid harder to get the stability and we also pay a lot with the communities and big employer. We have a profit sharing mechanism there. And that's partly why you saw the cost increases that we do is the mine becomes more profitable with higher prices. There's a large profit share and that goes to employees, partially to employees and partially to the country. So it's a good model to share economics both to the local communities and country and workers and to the investors. We will have an environmental impact statement that will file in connection with the project. So that is a very comprehensive permitting process. We've gone through it before and you have to do a lot of baseline work, etc. So there is a lot of work you have to do before you actually submit it. But that project partially is, the permitting is partially why Richard saying it's six to eight years out. I'll take the second one first. Just in terms of the ramp back up we've made the decision to start ramping El Abra back up. That's in progress. We expect to get back to pre-COVID levels there in 2022. That's reflected in our guidance. Same with Cerro Verde. In the U.S. we had cut back the mining rates significantly. We're starting to ramp those back up. We have some opportunities, still have some opportunities at the Morenci that aren't baked into our forecast yet. And then we have opportunities at Chino, because our plan right now is running at Chino 50%. In addition to that, as we mentioned we have some incremental opportunities potentially at Lone Star. So I would say in the U.S. we do have some opportunities that aren't in our near term plans. That will be -- we'll be assessing as well as some of the leach technology applications that Richard referred to earlier. So we do have some near term opportunities not in our plans but a \u2013 Yes. What's been interesting is you look at today four and a quarter copper last time copper was four and a quarter, oil wasn't at 60. It might have been [$110] a barrel. So we are benefiting from the lower energy prices even though they have come up some the historical correlations just aren't, as correlated as they once were. And we go through a review each quarter on where we are with our supply chain and revise our forecasts every quarter to reflect current pricing and that sort of thing. So that's baked into these plans. And as Richard said whether we'll have additional cost pressures from tightening freight markets or other supplies we'll have to see where that goes. But right now the forecast that we developed is based on what our pricing contracts are currently. Okay. Under the regulations the government grants annual export licenses and then there is a six month check to evaluate your progress against the smelter development schedule that they have and they have approved. As a result of COVID as we said during 2020 we notified the government that our schedule was impacted by the pandemic and they will force majeure conditions that prevented us from you from achieving schedule. And under regulations, there is a potential for fines if you don't achieve the schedule. And that's what the government did. They levied this fine and we have gone in and explained to them the reasons why the project was delayed and that this was force majeure, which is allowed under the regulations to waive any penalty. So we're in those discussions with the government. They're asking for some additional support for opposition and details. I mean it's obvious that COVID effected schedules for projects all around the world but they're asking for some more details. We think it will get resolved in a mutually satisfactory way. But as Richard said we're also very focused on meeting our commitment to the government ultimately. We notified them that we had a 12 month away in reaching the, because of COVID reaching a deadline of December of 23 to construct the new smelter, and now we expect that that wouldn't be completed until 2024. This option that Richards referring to [indiscernible] potentially could get us back on schedule. And we just need to make sure that it fits with from a commercial standpoint and overall business risk standpoint. But we're working closely with the government. I can say that our interests, having our partner in [indiscernible] our interests are very much aligned and we're all on the same page in terms of what we need to do and we're just working our way through the government's regulations to resolve this issue. And I'm confident we will. Yes. You're right. That's part of what we're discussing as a new schedule for the project and that's tied in with our discussions with them on this administrative fine. Yes. Well on the -- Yes. That's exactly right. We brought forward some capital. We've also increased production. So that's what that was is basically mining equipment investments. The first part of it in terms of the negotiations and we don't publicly comment on details of the negotiations while they're still in progress. But we had all set a target of trying to get the commercial agreement with a third party done by the end of March and so there were extensive negotiations that went back and forth during the first quarter. By the end of March we had not reached an acceptable agreement and we've been moving in parallel this other projects. At some point we've got to make a decision. We haven't finalized that decision yet but we are moving the greenfield our own project forward so that we can meet our obligations to the governments and not rely solely on a third party. So at this point we are still having some discussions with the third party but we're moving the other one in parallel as well. So as soon as we get a final decision and believe me we all want that as soon as possible we will convey that to you. But Orest we do want to make a decision sooner. There is not some kind of drop dead date but we want to make this decision very soon. Yes. Yes. [Baghdad] could come on quicker than the other two. The long lead times for investments for KL and Kucing Liar we are that's in our long-term plans. We're just optimizing it now so that in that capital will be spent over a long period of time and then El Abra just from a sequencing standpoint would come behind Baghdad from time period that it could come online. So you're talking about if you started everything right now you're talking about seven years out with all the permitting process seven- eight years maybe all the permitting process but Baghdad could be done probably on your 2025 type timeline if we depend on when we start. Thanks John. Yes. And it's always been part of our project evaluation. It's even more so today but it's always been part of our evaluation is using less energy, diversifying our energy sources to looking at renewables. Water is a big issue that we manage. We found a great solution in Cerro Verde in Peru when we did that project where we built a wastewater treatment plant to get water. So we didn't compete with other uses of water in the country and actually helped the community. So we're always looking as part of our projects, how does this project help the community and ESG has always been part of it as Richard said it's just growing much larger. And I guess this, but copper is really a great story. We don't have the scope three emissions that other companies have to deal with. Copper is actually, what copper is used for is actually used for decarbonisation but the scope one and two areas is something that we work hard on every day and it's all part of our project development plans and capital investment plans. Yes. Generally our production equals our sales and we did have some both in the U.S. and in Indonesia we did have some changes between production and sales but that's like Richard said just timing. Yes. I'd say logistically in South America is where we have the biggest constraints currently but we're still dealing with it all over in terms of protocols, etc. So we're not letting up the guard and we're continuing to be very careful about how we operate make sure people are safe but in terms of the logistical side of things it's mainly impacted South America. Well, in fact and Peru specifically our plan is to run at this reduced rate all year long and we'll assess that as we go but right now the going in assumption is that we'll be in the situation for the balance of 2021 and then go back to the plan in 2022. That's the assumption. In Chile it's a smaller operation but we are beginning to increase our mining and stacking rates there and the metal impact will happen in 2022 but we're starting that now. so but our plan at Cerro Verde which is our largest operation in South America is to be at this low, slightly lower rate in the balance of the year. The team did a great job and was able to surpass expectations in the first quarter but it's not something that we feel is prudent to assume because the restrictions are still very significant. And in terms of the M&A question we're really focused on our existing assets. We've got development options within the portfolio. We always monitor what's available externally and compare that against what we have. Yes. The discussions today has been most extensive with the project at [indiscernible] The project that you're referring to is in Papua potential project and we are familiar with the developer there and have indicated that if there is excess capacity we may be able to supply but our options right now are focused on the base supply, are focused on either this [indiscernible] option or our project at Gresik. Yes. We will let Mark talk about it but there is a section of the mine that and we did the same thing with the Glasberg block cave development. We modified it over time to focus on the lowest pyrite sections and what Mark will tell you is that with KL we redesigned the mine plan to reduce the capital intensity because in order to get the pyrite there is more capital in the mill, more environmental management required and the recovery starts going down. You mentioned the 0.9 but it has a very low recovery in some of the ore. So what we have developed here is a more optimal plan that reduces upfront CapEx and modestly changes the total ore but from a metal standpoint you're actually ending up with similar metal because you've got higher recoveries. So Mark you want to add \u2013 And it's more reduced risk, more robust plan and we're doing some things right now to continue to try to enhance those gold recoveries. Thanks Brian."

            "content": "Thanks Richard. As Kathleen was stating we have some near-term opportunities with Morenci, Lone Star incremental things. The most exciting piece I think is the work that we're doing on the leach technology that both Richard and Kathleen touched on. If we can prove out some of the concepts that we've identified and began working on it could have a significant impact on our ability to take advantage of long-term stockpiles that we have out there that contain copper today that we haven't been able to extract and so this leach technology really could be meaningful as we look for opportunities to get some incremental, low-cost incremental copper as we move forward and so our plans are working on that this year with the goal of having very similar to Richard's comments about the bigger scale projects having much more clarity by the end of the year on what that looks like and what the potential value is for us but we're super excited about what we're seeing so far."

            "name": "Richard Adkerson",
            "content": "Thanks, Kathleen. I couldn't be more pleased to be able to review with you our first quarter performance and particularly exciting progress we've achieved over the past year where we all faced such uncertainties. It's a special active invigorating time here at Freeport. Our teams are working safely. We remain diligent with COVID as we have successfully executed our operations plans and we're now working on projects for future growth. Our Grasberg underground ramp up is proceeding on schedule. That's key for our strategy. Production in the United States is increasing with our newly commissioned Lone Star mine, the first quarter start - restart of our Chino mine in New Mexico and from increased mine rates where we at Morenci, our flagship mine in the U.S., the largest in North America where we could curtail production a year ago to conserve cash. In South America, we're working to restore production levels to pre-pandemic levels and we'll achieve that over the next 12 months. The Cerro Verde team in Peru and our El Abra team in Chile are doing outstanding work in navigating these issues. We are focusing on sustainability initiatives as all businesses are. This has always been key to Freeport in managing our operations. We are moving to certify each of our operations with a new Copper Mark. This Copper Mark is an industry framework that was recently developed by the International Copper Association to ensure responsible production consistent with UN Sustainable Development Goals. Today, we leave the industry with six of our operations now certified and we're working to get all certified. Going to the slides, I have just a few slides to review with you. On Slide 3, our annual sustainability report has been published and is now available on our website. This is the 20th year we've reported on sustainability. We're working to make it better. I encourage all of you - each of you to read it. We're proud of our good work on sustainability and remain committed to continuous improvement. Past years, we released this report with our annual shareholders at our Annual Shareholders Meeting. We moved it up. We've added new resources to our Freeport team working on sustainability issues. And I congratulate this team for their efforts to make this report available now earlier, so that we can facilitate our expanding engagements with the broad set of constituencies that are now focused on our sustainability performance and initiatives. Last year, we published our initial report on climate. Our 2021 report is forthcoming. We've recently published our annual report to shareholders with what I think is a great thing charging ahead responsibly, reliably, and relentlessly. This theme portrays where we are currently positioned at Freeport as a leading and growing global copper producer. We are determined to succeed and operate responsibly and the Freeport tradition will be relentless in the execution of our strategy. Slide 4. First quarter production was in line with our targets. We increased our 2021 sales guidance to 3.85 billion pounds of copper and our 2022 volumes to 4.4 billion pounds. The Grasberg ramp up that I referenced earlier continues to progress in a simply outstanding fashion. We've now achieved 75% of our annualized targeted long-run metal production run rate. We're on track to be at 90% by the third quarter and full rates by year-end. After all these years of hard work, reporting this progress is simply a highlight of my career. The credit though goes to our team on the ground in Indonesia supported by our global team of technical experts. This is a historical major accomplishment as we've converted, as we are in finalizing the conversion of the Grasberg open pit to this massive underground operations. Americas businesses are going well. We are achieving production and cost targets and now we're accurately focusing and working on future growth opportunities, generating strong cash flows, improving our balance sheet. Over the past 12 months, net debt was reduced by over $3 billion to $5.2 billion by the end of this first quarter. But during this period, copper price averaged $3.13. It's now over $4.25. Many are predicting higher prices near-term. Our near-term outlook of copper and gold sales volumes is substantially higher.  Our recent performance this large reduction in debt with lower commodity prices, lower production volumes demonstrates the current strength of our company in generating cash flows. Our strong performance and the positive outlook for our business and the commodities has enabled our board to adopt a new financial policy which will provide increasing cash returns to shareholders while providing flexibility for growth and building a very strong balance sheet. We've also added two new directors David Abney, the retired chairman CEO of UPS with his massive global supply chain operations and Bob Dudley the retired CEO of BP a long time leader in the global extractive industry have joined our board. Each of these men have strong knowledge and experience in global markets and with issues we face in managing our business. Bob and David had many opportunities to join other boards. Their decisions to join our boards is personally gratifying and appreciated. They're really enthusiastic about working with their fellow directors at Freeport and our management team and creating value responsibly for all stakeholders. Moving to Slide 5. Countries around the world responding to COVID with aggressive fiscal and monetary policies. Now this is an important element of near-term demand for copper extending beyond China. China has been the driver of copper demand growth over the past two decades. Now the source of new demand is expanding. In addition to continuing strong copper consumption in China, higher copper consumption in developed countries with COVID recovery initiatives and the increasingly important demand in emerging markets driven by global growth copper now has major new sources of demand from global investments in carbon reduction, infrastructure and expanded technology 5G, Artificial Intelligence and data analytics broadly all require more copper. Importantly copper is essential to the transition to a global cleaner energy future. Roughly 70% of copper is used to deliver electricity. As clean energy initiatives are implemented copper intensity in the economy expands in a major way. The outlook for copper has never been better. Slide 6. Significant demand growth is inevitable. Supply to meet this growth is severely challenged. It's going to require meaningfully higher prices to support mine investment. The combination of rising demand, scarcity of new supplies, point to large impending structural deficits supporting much higher copper prices than previously anticipated. I'm sure you've noted this in recent forecasts by a widening group of industry analysts. Freeport is notably well positioned to benefit from these fundamentals. A leading responsible large-scale producer of copper with near-term and longer-term growth embedded in our portfolio. The scarcity value of a portfolio like ours is unique. It's extremely valuable now and it's going to be even more valuable as large market deficits emerge. Slide 7 highlights our near-term growth. For 2021 copper volumes are anticipated to be 20% higher and gold volumes 50% higher than in 2020, 55% higher than in 2020. Volumes are expected to grow further in 2020 in the 15% to 20% range for both copper and gold. The capital to achieve these near-term higher volumes and the execution risk are largely behind us. Higher volumes with low incremental costs yield expanded margins at prices ranging from $4 to $5 for copper we would generate annual EBITDA for 2022 and 2023 of over $12 billion to the range of $17 billion per annum. That's big numbers. Page 8 describes this new financial policy our board adopted earlier this year. It's designed first to support a strong balance sheet, increase returns to shareholders and provide funds for investments for the future. The current market for copper and its favorable outlook are providing substantial cash flows to meet these objectives as I just outlined. Our board approved a base dividend of $0.30 per annum per share. The first quarter dividend will be paid in May as we resume dividends. After reaching a target net debt in the $3 billion to $4 billion range which at today's prices will do by the end of this year our board's policy establishes a performance-based payout framework for additional cash return to shareholders through dividends and potentially stock buybacks. Returns to shareholders will be determined by allocating available cash flow of up to 50% to shareholder returns and the balance available for future growth and potentially further debt reduction below our target at $3 billion to $4 billion. Our board will assess the additional payout at least annually. With a current level of copper prices and the outlook for copper and gold prices the numbers nor above point to a large cash returns to shareholders with substantial financial resources available for future growth investments. Slide 9 describes some of these growth investments. We have multiple options across our portfolio. We resumed our work that we suspended a year ago because of COVID to evaluate and the timing and the initiation of these opportunities. In the U.S. we're looking at expansions at Lone Star and bagged in and also evaluating opportunities to increase production from [leach] recovery technologies that's really exciting. The Lone Star mine is our newest mine. It's adjacent to our existing operations in southeast Arizona where the companies operate as operations go back to the 1800s. There we have strong community support. We have great relationships with the native American groups. We're evaluating expansions of Lone Star oxides ore which we're now producing and which are growing in terms of the availability of ores but importantly we're also conducting these longer range planning for the development of what looks to be a potentially world-class sulfide resource right in the midst of this historical mining area. At Baghdad in Northwest Arizona we have an opportunity to construct a new concentrator to double production. We have a very long reserve life there. Also there we have strong community support. I keep emphasizing this because that's a challenge for new supply development around the world. We're focused on technology to reduce capital intensity in these projects. [Leach] technology initiatives provide substantial opportunities in this regard to add value all across the portfolio. We're continuing to evaluate an attractive potentially significant expansion of our El Abra mine in Chile, where we're partners with Codelco. This project would require larger investment longer lead times than our U.S. project. Resource is attractive and very large and this signifies that a major future expansion of El Abra is likely. We're evaluating the development of a new deposit an undeveloped deposit at PT-FI in Papuan Indonesia it's called Kucing Liar. This copper gold project involves a large block cave mine using the substantial infrastructure already in place for Grasberg. It would benefit from our expertise and long track record of success in block gating. We're also and this is a lot of fun evaluating a series of interesting investments in projects that support our carbon reduction and other sustainability goals. This involves ideas of developing a new energy generation as clean renewable for our operations in nearby communities and we're advancing plans for exciting projects at Atlanta Cop and Spain to recover valuable metals through recycling electronic devices which again is good from a sustainability standpoint. Now we have these opportunities we're going to be disciplined by making new investments by being selective and measured and deploying capital, focused on value-added investments and do this because we have such long-lived reserves, established license to operate and we're going to work with communities effective by new investments. Slide 10 points to this reserve position. Our reserve life is over 30 years. Now that's proved in probable economically recoverable reserves. In addition we have identified over 100 billion pounds of copper from mineral resources beyond reserves. All part of our existing operations we're going to be working to incorporate these into future reserve editions and mine plans. It is becoming increasingly more challenging and costly for our industry to develop supplies to meet the dramatically increasing demand for copper and our team literally loves where our Freeport is situated in this environment. Slide 11 we have strong operating franchises in the U.S., South America and Indonesia. In all these localities we've earned the trust and respect of our partners, our customers, suppliers, financial markets, and most importantly our workers communities in the countries where we operate. We have significant development large-scale operating expertise development and large-scale operating expertise. We have all the capabilities now to undertake new projects anywhere in the world regardless or the situation in a responsible and efficient manner. I want to close by recognizing the people of Freeport around the globe, their commitment, dedication, remarkable achievements over the past year of COVID is really special. In the context of all the challenges our team has faced over the years and we've overcome I'm just immensely proud of this team. Building on these accomplishments with an increasingly bright future Freeport is charging ahead responsibly, reliably, and relentlessly. Kathleen's going to review the financial results with you. So Emily, we are - we have suspended all of our studies on growth projects a year ago. And now, we've resumed those analysis with the purpose of understanding the pros and cons of each of the projects and developing an evaluation of them. That basic work of evaluation, we expect to continue at least through the end of this year. And by the end of the year, we hope to be able to have a clearer path forward. So it will be some time before there is any commitment to actually initiate significant capital spending. And then in the meantime, we pointed to all the volume growth that's coming about from Grasberg, the resumption of operations from COVID, et cetera. So we're going to have increasing volumes with strong prices and high cash flows with limited amount of capital being spent because we just won't be ready, as you say, to sanction projects. We don't have any particular target at copper price. We've always looked at a scenario of different prices that of how a new project would fit into our portfolio. We want to take advantage of these resources that we have and yet have risk managements by how they fit into all of our existing portfolios. So we don't look at it so much on an individual project by project basis, but how does it fit in with our projects. Freeport really benefits from the fact that we operate all the projects we have interest in. So that allows us to approach these on a \u2013 from a consistent corporate strategic basis as opposed to an individual project by project basis. Certainly, at these price levels, our projects are economic. And now you know the prospects are for prices to go much higher. So I anticipate that over time, we will be spending money on capital. That's just not going to happen in the near-term and that's going to be a feature of the entire industry because even when we decide to spend the timeframe for developing a project is multiple years, minimum six to eight years. So all of that's going to be, as you well know, Emily, because you write about it all the time, that's going to be very supportive of copper prices. You can't turn on the valve quickly to add new mine supply. And when you can't do that and volume and demand rises that translates into higher prices. Yes. And the fact we referenced delay in shipments that had nothing to do with operations. The inventory was there on site. There were loading, shipping some administrative issues with the government, and so all that inventory was produced on site now will be sold. And as inventory built, we were able to advance some maintenance activities from the second quarter to the first quarter, all of which is really supportive of meeting our plans going forward. Good morning. Yes, we \u2013 yes, the answer to that is an absolute yes. And we - stability agreements has been a feature of the operations in Cerro Verde since way before Freeport. But we were able to get a new stability agreement as we expanded the business. And you know, there is always a correlation between the aspirations of government and workers for more funds as copper prices rise. But the copper is so critical to Peru in terms of a country that still faces challenges of poverty and so forth. So we just step back and watch political environments. We know we have to work with whatever governments wherever in the world that a country selects, but we do have strong rights to do that. And unlike some operations in Peru, we have positive relationships with the local community because of social investments we've made in water and wastewater projects. So our team there is just, I mean, I can't tell you what a great job they go. A year ago, we were really worried about Peru. Our workers lived in the city of Arequipa. It was real issue with community spread, but we've been put to work the community, developed temporary living and we got our rates up to near our original run rate targets and we can expand further as we go forward. The team there has just done a remarkably good job... And the best environment, Chris, it's going to take a long time to get that permit. Now, we don't have some of the costs of where this mines located. And the fact that it's been a long running existing operation is near Codelco mine. It doesn't have some of the permitting issues that others have. A major mill expansion would require a desalinization plant and the cost of transmitting that water up to high altitude where we operate but it's in a setting where we don't face some of the challenges others face. But best case it takes a long time and it's a big project. Good morning Alex. Hey Kathleen let's let Josh make a brief comment about that. Josh Olmstead was named this past year to be our Chief Operating Officer, Americas. He's been number two guy for many years. He's a young guy but he's got a long career in Freeport is just doing an outstanding job and bringing energy and leadership to our group. So Josh make a couple of comments. So restarts technology reaching all those point to growing volumes from our traditional operations Chris. Alex right we're at Alex now. so Alex on Peru man how complicated politics everywhere in the world and in Peru as they were approaching this runoff you had a half dozen more candidates each having 10% plus or minus support in the polls. So it was very complicated. Freeport stays out of politics. As I said we don't, we just run our business, support communities, be prepared to work with whoever emerges in the political process. The mining industry in Peru is there is an active mining association that's led by Peruvians and they engage with candidates to understand and interact and communicate with them on policies affecting mining and I'm sure they'll be working with both of these candidates as we go forward and you will notice the candidate who earlier was being very aggressive and talking about mining is now making comments about the importance of mining to Peru. So all of that will come to play and we'll just have to see what happens. So the first point I want to make is a point Kathleen referenced earlier. Some important elements are of our cost are correlated to copper prices. They're correlated I mean things like royalties, profit sharing plans, labor cost in general there is correlation. Then there is other input costs that are correlated. Energy costs which is an important element our cost and with energy costs have risen in recent months. Copper prices have risen even more thankfully but energy costs are are built into that and then certain other costs are seeing some inflation. So far energy costs are the ones that outside of the profit sharing loyalty costs are the ones that have the biggest impact and as time goes by and copper prices rise we'll have to deal with inflation but we have such strong margins, we have a great supply group team that works with our suppliers to offset costs wherever we can. We're working really aggressively to do that. So Tim I think I mean I know you realize this because you're right about it but inflation is good for copper. I mean inflation is good for copper with what the world's doing today with all this spending on COVID recovery with spending around the world that's being driven to the deal with economic inequalities. That's pushing money to people who consume and create economic velocity which creates demand for copper. So in the broader sense all these forces will work to the benefit of our company. Well as I said, the answer is yes. There's correlations, I mean, royalties rise, profit sharing rise and then you make your judgment about energy, steel costs and so forth. But and I know a broken record Tim, that I know you understand. But bottom line is margin rise. For many businesses these inflationary movements deteriorate margins. Historically our margins have stayed very strong as copper prices rise and other costs rise. Thank you. I'm going to let Kathleen talk about this. She is working actively with the parties there and negotiating the terms. We are going to cooperate with the government. We made a commitment in December 18 to build a smelter and I'm very clear that we recognize that commitment and we are prepared to honor it. There are different views within the government of Indonesia. When you reference the government it can be interpreted as being one group. There are different views within the government itself about whether it's despite this development [indiscernible] or go forward with the project at Gresik that we initially started and so we are working closely with our partner and shareholder mine [indiscernible] and with the Ministry of state owned enterprises, with the Ministry of Energy and Mines defined what is best, what decision the government off we made and we're prepared to go forward provided we have if we go in the direction that where we have reasonable terms and reasonable regulatory environment. So Kathleen why don't you talk about this and mine ministry wants to push us I believe we will resolve this situation and that everything's going to be okay. Kathleen would you give some detail. No it's a government. I mean it's really, the government's going to make that decision. We're prepared if we could get, if the government supports it and we could get a reasonable deal with constraint sale terms and a regulatory environment dealing with our IUPK obligations, PT-FI is prepared to deal with we debate. If that doesn't happen we're prepared to go forward with the other project and we're working on that. We're not sitting here not doing anything. We're prepared to go forward and I just think it's important to keep in mind that while this is a big project and it's a management issue it's not a huge financial issues FCX. I mean we were paying a 5% export duty that would be relieved with the smelter. The financial implications are not that significant and more than 70% of the financial implications go to the government through taxes and equity share ownership. So -- No I'm just saying it's not like we can say we're going to do this, we're going to, it's got to be a joint decision between the government and PT-FI. Yes. Yes. That's our hope. That's our aspiration. I mean as you know we're very transparent company and our hope is that we get some clarity by the end of the year. Josh mentioned it. Kathleen mentioned it and as we do we're going to keep all of you informed. Hey John. Yes. Yes. We have also John you'll probably remember that Kucing Liar has pyrite content and so Mark talk about how we've been working and this has been a continual work project. it is independent of Grasberg black cave Deep MLZ and our other operations but Mark maybe comment on how we've updated our analysis of KL? Thanks Mark. Long winding road but it's great. Yes, good morning. It's not only go it is today I mean it is today. And I mean, ESG matters are not something that's common across all projects. They're all site specific related. I made a point, I think you probably picked up on it and talking about our growth projects in Arizona being supported by communities and by native American groups. That's because we've been there for so long and we have devoted attention and resources to those communities and to providing opportunities beyond just our separate operations. Elsewhere in Arizona even which has a favorable state view for mining development there are huge barriers from an ESG standpoint to developments and you just look at Rosemont and resolution and other projects. So you have to go and look at each particular project each the way companies have provided but it's an enormous barrier and it's going to grow. I mean the number of groups that are involved in ESG attention you see it with institutional investors [indiscernible] were with but consumer groups are very focused. Automobile manufacturers are focused about where their minerals coming from, where's their copper coming from. That's why this copper mark thing that I referenced is so important. So it's going to be, it's an enormous issue right now and it's going to be a major impact on, it's going to be supply development. So -- Okay. So let me address that we don't sell copper and gold in Grasberg. We sell copper concentrate. It's got copper and gold in it. We get paid for the the individual components at LME prices but as I mentioned earlier what happened at Grasberg is we met our production targets, we transported this copper concentrate to the port site to be ready to ship, some shipments got delayed for various reasons and so the production's done and we recognize sales when the concentrate's loaded on ships. So literally all we have is some of those sales are going to be in the second quarter [indiscernible] first quarter and it's just that simple and throughout our operations we have timing issues like that. For those of you who follow the Grasberg we have weather conditions at port. It's a shallow water sea and so weather conditions can delay shipments but all this will ends up being strictly a timing whether it's at the last of the first quarter or the early part of the second quarter it's irrelevant. As you can imagine we can sell everything we produce. That's not an issue. Well, we mentioned we should we restart we'd actually suspended operations at the Chino mine in New Mexico relatively small mine but we resuming operations there. We reduced mine rate stripping rates at Morenci to conserve cost and that'll take some time to restore and production will build up from there but it's nothing of real significance. The amazing thing is the guys Mark and his team at Grasberg have just done remarkable with meeting our targets there in the face of a very challenging COVID location and we've done remarkable job in managing all that and continue to. Sorry. Internal medical director. We work with international SOS for years and they've been fabulous in helping us build testing facilities and facilities for dealing with infected people. We're able to treat them get them back to work and that's an ongoing process. Thank you. That's a very good multi-layered question. Let me see if I can answer it precisely. I've been around a long time and I see there's three kind of eras of copper demand. Pre-early 2000s it was all driven by develop countries GDP. Copper's most correlated commodity to GDP and it would rise and fall based on business cycles. China emerged and now for almost two decades has dominated new demand growth. It's all come from China when you look at it. The rest of the world's kind of been flat. The new era today which is so exciting is China's rate of growth which people have been pointing to for some time inevitably is falling has to fall. COVID kind of complicated all that up but its absolute demand for copper volumes is so strong because this economy has grown and that's going to continue with even as it pivots its economy to consumers and exports it's the absolute amount of copper that it grows even though the rate of growth will drop absolute amount be strong. Now the reason I'm so excited about now is now you've got it's COVID recovered in the developed world but also all this movement around the world you see it clearly here in the United States to push money to a broader set of people to enhance consumption. All this move towards incoming inequality which everybody recognized we got to do and that's going to create new copper demand and then my long-term story's always been in the undeveloped world, global growth all the vast numbers of people around the world that are living in substandard conditions have aspirations of having better conditions that requires more energy, more transportation, communication, more copper. So that's why I say the demand side to me is in a new era and it's really positive and the supply side I don't know how it's going to keep up with it. I literally don't. Here we have all of these projects at Freeport the price of copper could double overnight. Some people talk about it doubling anyway but overnight and we couldn't add new production of significance for a number of years. So it's going to be really interesting to see prices I just unless there's some global calamity prices it just seems to me clearly have to rise substantially. Substitution has to occur. Scrap has to grow but how to meet that demand and that's why I'm so thrilled about where we are after all this time working to put this company together. John Tamazo's referenced it I mean we have been through so much but I recall Kathleen and I developed a strategy in 2003-2004 when I became CEO of focusing on copper and now it's so great here all these years later to see it coming to fruition. Let me add just a personal observation on that. Our company made a mistake, misstep other mining companies made missteps when they forced M&A for strategic reasons. You just look over and over again. South side came to us as an opportunity. It wasn't a strategic plan to do it. We had talked with them about buying us. So where we are now is we have no strategy of engaging in M&A markets but we will be positioned now for the first time in a long-long time to -- if an opportunity come to us comes to us to take advantage of us. Our strategy is straightforward; execute, invest in a disciplined way in our resources that provide growth, that create value. If something comes to us we're going to be in a position to consider it but that's not our strategic objective. You mentioned startup operations and those come to us all the time but we have trouble. It's been a big barrier to make the economics of those work because to get into it you've got to pay the value that's been created already. When we have all these other resources in our portfolio where there is no value being given to them in our share price. So we see that's been a real barrier of making even what might be at some level interesting projects work economically for our company and we've had a long saying in Freeport big minds get bigger and smaller minds get smaller. So that's also a tough issue. In response to your comment we've made no commitment for supply on the Papua project. For years we would have liked to have seen a smelter developed in Papua because we, it would be desirable to help the local community there but the infrastructure cost, the absence of infrastructure, the timing investment that would be required for infrastructure have made it impracticable in the past. Hi Brian. Just we will turn to Mark but it's not that complicated. It's we've designed a new mine plan to avoid and minimize the pyrite section. So and by doing that we reduced mill investments plus there was going to have to be a pipeline you've been out there you -- a pipeline from the mill down the lowlands of storage for pyrite and low and so Mark it's more of a engineering design determination which gets all these economic benefits than anything else. Mark? Yes, that's correct. Exactly right. 240,000 tons a day from the underground operation. I'll just leave it with that. Thank you so much for being on our call and we look forward to continuing to report our progress as we go forward in this year and following years. Thank you."

            "name": "Mark Johnson",
            "content": "Yes, we're generally on plan. Grades are tracking well from the model to what we see at the mill. In fact, we're fortunate that the mills actually seen a little bit more grades and the mine has recorded as pending. Drawbell opening, it's probably shown in the slides that we did make some adjustments in Deep MLZ. We slowed down the cave advance in some of our diorite rock types, which are the more challenging rock and accelerate the cave advance and some of the scarring going off to the west in PB2. In GBC, we've added \u2013 accelerated our drawbell opening. And over the five years, it's relatively the same. Yes. I mean in the last three years or so it was a significant change wasn't so much new drilling. We did do some drilling over the last couple years and we revisited some of the metallurgical work. The big change there was and as Richard alluded to the original KL mine plan was more focused on higher copper equivalent grade but it also had much higher pyrite and required a significant change to our processing. The new mine plan focuses on some slightly lower copper equivalent portion of the resource that has now become the reserve and we've, and this part of the ore body essentially we leave the mill as it is the pyrite problem is largely diminished and almost eliminated. So the overall capital as far as processing, power requirements, environmental management have dropped significantly in addition this new portion of the new mine plan the areas that we mined the gold recoveries go up substantially. We in our initial reserves several years ago gold recoveries were below 50% the new plan has gold recoveries over 60 and we think there's upside there. So it's a much less capital intensive, a much more robust plan, a lot less environmental management costs that go with this new KL plan. The one thing as Richard mentioned that it's independent but in some ways it does tie in. We share parts of the GBC ore flow system. KL ramps up and in coordination with the GBC plan we used some of the same conveyor and then the big part was is that the mill is relatively unchanged with this new plan. And so John, yes thanks Mark. So John this is not a competing project to our Americas growth plan. I mean it's in our long-term plan as Kathleen said. It fits in with everything we're doing out there and then the trade-offs of where we invest in the Americas is one where we will be looking at the pros and cons of each project. in the U.S. we have no royalties because we own the land and fee we have no taxes because of our tax loss carry forward for a very long period of time and tax rates in the U.S. are very low. So I mean, all of this this is an after tax, after royalty economic analysis, and we're going to decide where can we add value most economically for our shareholders. Yes. And I think the major advance was understanding where the not necessarily the highest grade but where the highest value after capital investment was in the ore body and if not for having a debt our contract with the government goes up to 2041 if not for that the material that we've deferred would also be in reserves. So what we've done in this new plan is brought forward. There is about half of the old reserve that overlaps with the old reserve and then there's another half where we've deferred a part of the lower value ore and been able to substitute it with higher value ore. This ore that we're now mining would be sediment hosted very similar to what we've milled for years in the DOZ, Deep MLZ, the old reserve was very much centered on this fault that the highest grades but as Richard and Kathleen mentioned some of the bigger challenges were a new mill, we had to grind it much finer. That came with additional power requirements and then we had to manage the pyrite which for us is to segregate it from the [MOD ADA] and store it separately. So by recognizing all the costs that are associated with some of the higher copper equivalent grade that's a combination of the copper and gold value and substitute it with looking more on a value rather than purely on copper equivalency, we came up with a much more optimal sequencing of the mine with the opportunity to go after this other material at a later date if we had the opportunity to mine beyond 2041. It's very similar mining rates that we had before the tonnage is similar. It's a little bit less because we start a little bit later but this does fill the 240,000 tons of mill capacity that we'll have with the SAG-3 and so there is a obviously a district-wide plan that we sequence all of the ore bodies to best fill that mill in an optimal fashion. This would peak at 90,000 tons a day just marginally above what we're planning to do with the Deep MLZ and it ramps up as GBC would start to drop off and so it's a balancing of the highest value material getting the first opportunity for mill space."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, President. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.\nKathleen Quirk: Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan conference call, and happy 2023 to everyone. Earlier this morning, we reported fourth quarter 2022 operating and financial results, and a copy of our press release and slides are available on our website at fcx.com. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today\u2019s call, and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we\u2019d like to remind everyone that today\u2019s press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. Like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings. On the call today with me are Richard Adkerson, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Maree Robertson, our CFO; Mark Johnson, our Chief Operating Officer of Indonesia; Josh Olmsted, who is our Chief Operating Officer for the Americas; Mike Kendrick, who leads our molybdenum business; Cory Stevens, who heads our Engineering and Construction and overall Global Technical Services Group; Rick Coleman, who is actively involved in all of our construction projects; as well as Steve Higgins, our Chief Administrative Officer. So, we have a full complement of management team here today. And we\u2019ll start -- Richard will make some opening remarks, and then he\u2019ll turn it back to me and we\u2019ll cover the slide materials, and then we\u2019ll open up the call for your questions. Turn it to you, Richard.\nRichard Adkerson: Yes. Thanks, Kathleen. Thank you all for joining us today. As Kathleen said, after my overview remarks, which will be brief, she will review our results for the quarter. It was a strong fourth quarter. The numbers speak for themselves. It reflects the performance of our global team, and I much appreciate everybody\u2019s hard work. I read one of you said this morning in a report, mining is a tough business, and it certainly is. Nobody knows that, I think, better than me. But what we\u2019ve done and is reflected in our results for 2022 and particularly the fourth quarter, is remarkable. Most of you, who know our business and maybe all of you do, recognize the need to look at Freeport into two major segments. Our operations in Indonesia by PT Freeport Indonesia is characterized by very large volumes, very low cost because of the grades and the gold content, largest gold mine in the world is a byproduct. As you\u2019ll see in the fourth quarter, it operated as the world\u2019s second largest copper mine with a net unit cost of $0.06 a pound. Our business in Americas is quite different. We have among the largest mines in the world, the mines have low grades, there\u2019s much more material to be processed, to be mined and processed to recover the copper, and it\u2019s an operation that gets challenged by low copper prices and factors like inflation. But when you look at the results and what our team has done this year, it\u2019s been very positive. It\u2019s also characterized by having some large future brownfield expansion opportunities, which is particularly meaningful given the situation of the copper in the world. Indonesia, it was just rock-solid performance. We\u2019ve been operating underground there for 40-plus years now. We\u2019ve been investing in the current underground operations that we have been ramping up over the past three years to become the largest underground mining operations in the world for the past 25 years. It just reflects the long-term nature of our business. The last three years have really been notable. We completed mining the Grasberg open pit, which had been the bulk of our operations since the discovery of the ore body in the late 1980s. We completed mining that pit at the end of 2019. Then early in 2020, we faced COVID. And for years, this transition was viewed as a risk overlying Freeport\u2019s business. And it\u2019s just a major accomplishment that we\u2019ve reached our targeted mining and metal production targets that is what\u2019s arguably the most complicated mine in the world. And it\u2019s all results of the hard work and accomplishments of our team there, very proud of them. The Americas business has done very well in meeting the challenges that we\u2019ve had there, dealing with inflation, dealing with a period of low copper prices, we have issues that are challenged in terms of getting workers for our operations in the Americas. Our operation in Peru was facing a severe challenge with COVID that they manage very well. The political situation in Peru right now is very complicated. There are protests throughout the country. Our team is doing very well. We are continuing to manage housing, feeding our people and continuing our operations. We are slowing down a bit to make sure we have supplies for the long run, but we have support by our workforce and fundamental support for our business by the local community there because we\u2019ve established such a great relationship with them. So we are -- as we look out now trying to predict short-term copper prices is very difficult. We actually don\u2019t even try to do it ourselves. We deal with short-term negative movements when they occur by having a strong balance sheet and a conservative financial policy. It\u2019s actually good to see right now that market sentiment going into 2024 is much improved over the end of -- going into the fourth quarter. But we are on the outlook for the well-known risks that the world faces today, and we\u2019re prepared to deal with it. We are a long-term business. And we -- everything we do is focused, not on the short run other than to protect ourselves by having a strong balance sheet, managing our business in the right way, but our success is going to be measured over the long run. And copper\u2019s long-run outlook is increasingly positive based on fundamentals of demand and supply. We committed to copper 20 years ago when we were a single asset company, the rationale for acquiring Phelps Dodge more than 15 years ago is being reinforced today by the combination of this really special mine we have in Indonesia and the global operations and growing operations that we have in the Americas. It was the right decision 20 years ago to focus on copper and is the right decision now. Kathleen?\nKathleen Quirk: Thanks, Richard. We\u2019ll start on Slide 3, which summarizes our performance for the full year 2022. And just a couple of notes on the fourth quarter from our press release. We finished the year with a strong fourth quarter. Copper and gold sales exceeded our October guidance. And our consolidated unit net cash costs of $1.53 per pound in the quarter were better than our estimates going into the quarter. With average copper realizations in the fourth quarter of $3.77 per pound, we generated strong margins with fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA at approximately $2.25 billion. Looking at the year, we are proud of the performance of our team stayed focused on effective execution and on driving results in a volatile macroeconomic environment. After successfully growing our volumes in 2021 by 19% for copper and 59% for gold compared with 2020, we achieved another year of growth in 2022, with 11% higher copper sales volumes and a 34% increase in gold volumes. Our team in Indonesia has successfully and materially grown production levels in a sustaining large-scale, low-cost production at the world\u2019s largest underground mining complex. In the Americas, our teams in Peru and Chile proved resilient in restoring production during 2022 that had been impacted by the pandemic. And our teams in the U.S. maintain production at 2021 levels despite ongoing labor shortages and we also made significant advances on new technologies to enhance value. For the year, we generated $9.5 billion in adjusted EBITDA, and that was a year of dramatic swings in commodity prices and cost drivers. Our operating cash flows for the year, which were net of $1.5 billion in working capital requirements was in excess of our capital investments in our operations, and we nearly tripled our cash return to shareholders, pursuant to our performance-based payout policy. We ended the year with net debt, excluding the debt associated with our smelter of $1.3 billion, and that\u2019s substantially below the level of mid-2021 when we initiated our performance-based payout policy. On Slide 4, you\u2019ll see we\u2019ve listed notable accomplishments during the year. In addition to driving value in our operating and financial areas of achievement, we\u2019re very proud of our work with third parties to validate all of our operations under the Copper Mark standards, the measurable progress we\u2019re making on our climate initiatives and the expanded disclosures we\u2019ve developed to enhance transparency and accountability. We\u2019ll talk about markets next, and we\u2019ve got a slide on Page 5. We experienced significant volatility as many of you have seen during 2022, with copper prices trading from a high of $4.87 per pound earlier in the year, falling to $3.18 per pound midyear and partially recovering to $3.80 per pound by year-end. Prices continued to move higher in early 2023 to a level currently approximating $4.25 per pound as several of the macroeconomic clouds began to lift. We discussed on prior calls that the dramatic moves in 2022 have been largely -- been based on sentiment rather than fundamentals. The facts are that the physical markets for copper have remained tight even during a period of weaker economic data coming out of China, and that\u2019s evidenced by the low levels of available copper inventories throughout the year. At the same time, copper\u2019s importance in the economy continues to grow as a result of the intensity of use in clean energy applications and the global acceleration of electrification. We believe we\u2019re still in the early innings of a broad-based secular driver of long-term demand. The ability of the industry to meet this multiyear period of growing demand continues to be challenged, leading to large market deficits in the future. You read about these challenges every day, and it\u2019s getting harder, not easier, higher long-term prices are needed to incentivize new supplies. We\u2019ve lived through the ups and downs in the copper market. We\u2019ve effectively managed our operations and balance sheet during periods of volatility, and we\u2019re prepared for this, but we believe the long-term fundamentals point to a real step change in how copper is valued in the economy. Turning to our reserve position on Slide 6. We benefit from a geographically diverse high-quality portfolio of copper mines with significant exposure to gold and molybdenum. Our strategy, as Richard discussed, is centered around being foremost in copper. And we benefit from a portfolio of assets with characteristics that are very difficult to replicate. We show our reserve position at the end of 2022 with over 100 billion pounds of proved and probable reserves. We have an average reserve life of over 25 years. We added twice the amount of reserves we produced in 2022, principally at our U.S. mines in the Morenci and Safford Lone Star districts where we\u2019re focused on future growth. In addition to proved and probable reserves, we have enormous mineral resources of 235 billion pounds of copper. Over half of this is located in the U.S. where we have established operations, a great track record and a valuable franchise. We\u2019ll continue to work as we go forward to convert these resources into viable mine plans and future production. It\u2019s an extraordinarily valuable resource position in a world that\u2019s going to need more copper in the future. We wanted to focus a little bit on molybdenum on this call. And on Slide 7, we\u2019ve got some information about our molybdenum business. We\u2019re a leader in that industry. We\u2019re the world\u2019s largest producer by a significant margin. And with the price move over the last couple of months of over 50% in molybdenum, we thought you\u2019d be interested in learning more about our business. We produced 85 million pounds of molybdenum in 2022, and that\u2019s comprised about 60% from copper mines as a byproduct and the balance from two primary molybdenum mines that we operate in Colorado. And these are the only primary molybdenum mines that are currently operated in the United States. We also operate downstream processing facilities to produce products that are used in a broad range of metallurgical specialty steel and chemical applications. The price moved from $18 per pound at the start of the fourth quarter to over $30 per pound currently has been driven by some of the same supply issues that have impacted copper. And in addition, demand drivers continue to be supported from the oil and gas, aerospace and power generation sectors. So, we note on this slide, the impact of a $5 change in molybdenum prices, it\u2019s material at $400 million in annual EBITDA and $375 million in cash flow. And the recent move of over $10 per pound, if sustained at a higher price, adds additional leverage to our results. Looking at our operating stats for 2022 on Slide 8, you\u2019ll see our sales for the year were about 35% from the U.S., 28% from South America and 37% from Indonesia. In the U.S., our sales were similar to 2021 levels, and we grew sales volumes by 10% in South America and by 20% in Indonesia. In the U.S., we\u2019re continuing our focus on productivity, given the current limitations on adding to our workforce, we\u2019re taking advantage of technology advancements and opportunities to expand production from leaching at low incremental cost, and we\u2019re planning our next phase of growth, as we\u2019ll talk about in a few minutes. As discussed, the biggest resource position and source of long-term growth we have is a real opportunity in the United States. In South America, both Cerro Verde and El Abra grew production in 2022 in a complex social and political environment. After successfully recovering from the pandemic-related interruptions in 2022, our team in Peru is now dealing with challenges associated with civil unrest that you\u2019ve all read about. We\u2019re prioritizing the safety and security of our workforce. We\u2019re navigating disruptions to transportation routes and supply chains. To date, the impacts have not been significant but the situation is dynamic day by day, and we\u2019re watching it very carefully. The bottom of the chart shows the 2022 cost performance. As we\u2019ve talked about on prior calls, we experienced significant inflation pressures across the business during 2022, particularly for energy and other commodity-related consumables, and in the second half of the year, started to see inflation from a rising cost of materials, supplies and services. The situation started to improve in 2022 with a number of the commodity-related consumables, but we\u2019re still dealing with costs in excess of historical levels. If you look at the average cost for the year at Grasberg of $0.09 per pound is remarkable, particularly in the context of this cost environment. Richard talked about the significant success story of the Grasberg transition, and we\u2019ve got some details on Slide 9, significant success for not only Freeport but also something for the global mining industry to be proud of in the country of Indonesia. We started planning for this transition over 25 years ago, and the team has just done an outstanding job. We benefit from the fact that several from the team who were involved in the planning of this project, including Mark Johnson, who\u2019s on this call, stayed with it over this period. And over the years, we\u2019ve added great talent to our team with experts from around the world. The success of this project, the mutual respect built over the years between Freeport, the government of Indonesia and local communities has established a really strong foundation for the future. We\u2019ve got the opportunity with this resource to plan a new phase of development longer term and are continuing to discuss with the government the opportunity to extend our long-term partnership beyond 2041. If you go to Slide 10, we\u2019ve got an update on our smelter project. And this is our key feature of our commitment to the Indonesian government, was to expand domestic copper smelting and refining capacity in Indonesia. We\u2019re making really good progress on constructing the new smelter in Eastern Java, it\u2019s near our existing smelter, PT smelting at Gresik. You can see from the pictures that construction is advancing. We\u2019ve got thousands of workers now on site. We\u2019re working very closely with our EPC contractor to try as much as possible to make up delays that were caused by the pandemic. We reached a milestone of over 50% completion recently and we are expecting to begin commissioning the smelter during 2024. As you recall, the capital investments for this project are being funded from a successful bond offering that PT-FI completed during 2022. And so, we have the funding between the bond offering and a revolver at PT-FI to fund this project. Moving to our growth outlook. This is exciting opportunities for the company, and we continue to plan our next phase of growth. We\u2019ve got benefit from having multiple organic projects to develop within the portfolio over time. We operate all the mines we have interest in. We\u2019re able to share experiences, new technologies, operating synergies and best practices across the portfolio as we develop projects, and we can direct capital across the portfolio to the highest value opportunities. Our proven technical capacity capabilities and management is a notable strength. And importantly, we\u2019ve earned a track record and a reputation for operating sustainably and responsibly. The world, we believe, is going to need all of our projects and more. The project with the shortest lead time is our Americas leach initiative. We\u2019ve talked a lot about it in recent calls. The economics are compelling, low capital intensity, low incremental operating costs and a low carbon footprint. The new data analytics capabilities, we are continuing, to be applied to prioritize our work streams on the highest value. We\u2019re continuing our work to apply covers to the leach stockpiles because of the benefits that you get from heat retention in enhancing recoveries, and we\u2019ve identified new areas that were not pursued historically. We\u2019re also continuing to test various additives that can further enhance recoveries. This is a really significant opportunity for us. We\u2019re continuing to target a run rate of 200 million pounds per annum by the end of this year and success of this level -- at this level would provide opportunities to scale larger. We\u2019re in a great position to lead this innovation with our long history in leaching and large inventory to work with. At our Bagdad mine in Northwest Arizona, we\u2019re progressing a feasibility study to double production at that site. We expect to complete the feasibility this year, and we\u2019ll be in a position to assess options on how we time the future development. We started advanced planning to commence construction of a new tailings site that would support the existing operation, but would also provide flexibility for the expanded production. And as a brownfield expansion, this project could be developed more quickly than a greenfield development. Our Lone Star opportunity is really something special. We\u2019ve been successful in increasing production levels substantially above the original project. And we\u2019re really in the early stages in the development of this mine, as we mine the oxide ores more quickly, we\u2019re opening up the opportunity for a major sulfide development long term. The resource is massive. You\u2019ve seen the numbers, 50 billion pounds of potential resource here. We\u2019re doing a lot of drilling. And importantly, it\u2019s located in an established mining district in the U.S. In Chile, we\u2019ve defined the opportunity for a major expansion at our El Abra mine. As we continue to monitor regulatory and fiscal matters in Chile, we\u2019re planning a project to invest in infrastructure, water infrastructure to provide flexibility to extend existing operations and optionality to support a new concentrator. We\u2019re also planning at El Abra to test new leaching technologies in the near term, to evaluate the potential for expanded leach production and possibly competing technologies to a concentrator. We\u2019re continuing our development of the Kucing Liar deposit in Indonesia. We\u2019re really gaining a lot of efficiencies from the work we did at Grasberg Block Cave. And similar to that development, this is a long-term project. We expect to have initial production from Kucing Liar deposit towards the end of this decade. Moving to Slide 12. We provide a three-year outlook for our sales volumes. And as we talked about, we achieved two years of growth in copper sales. And currently, our forecast reflects sales in the \u201823 to \u201825 period that are similar to 2022 levels. Our mine production is actually going to be higher than our sales by about 100 million pounds in 2023 and 2024. And that is a result of our domestic processing arrangements in Indonesia where the point of sale has changed from selling concentrate to selling cathodes. And so, a portion of our production will be inventoried until it\u2019s processed and sold through our smelters. Previously, this inventory would have been held by third-party smelters. We\u2019ve got small revisions otherwise to 2023 guidance that reflects assumption of a continuation of tight labor markets in the U.S. That\u2019s impacted our ability to increase mining rates. And success also in our leach recovery initiative could provide some upside in the U.S. as we look over the next three-year period. In the reference materials on Slide 30, we provide information on our 2023 sales by quarter. The reason for the drop in the first quarter reflects the impact of the tolling arrangement in Indonesia. But, you can see the balance of the year is fairly stable at over 1 billion pounds of copper sales per quarter. Moving to the cost outlook for 2023, we\u2019re providing guidance of average cost of $1.60 per pound for the year. That compares with $1.50 per pound in 2022. We show a comparison to the two years, and you\u2019ll see the site production cost line item is about 4.5% higher than the 2022 average. And that\u2019s a result of assumptions that we\u2019ve made in our forecast for higher average electricity and coal costs compared with the 2022 average and also higher power requirements, principally in Indonesia, and the impact of higher cost of equipment components, supply costs and labor cost increases. The other line items are offsetting. You\u2019ll note a decline in royalties and duties. That really is reflective of a recent reduction in our export duty in Indonesia as a result of the smelter progress. I\u2019ll also note that this assumes a molybdenum price of $20 per pound in 2023. The current price is $30 a pound and each $2 per pound change in molybdenum is $0.02 a pound. So, if current prices hold, would have roughly $0.10 a pound less cash -- unit net cash costs and this reflects. In recent months, inflationary pressures have been less severe than we experienced during 2022. We\u2019re encouraged by that. And we\u2019re going to continue to focus on managing costs that we can control. We\u2019re continuing to pursue technology-driven enhancements to mitigate the impacts, particularly in the U.S. Getting to our cash flows, significant leverage to copper prices. We\u2019ve got on Slide 14, we show modeled results for EBITDA and cash flow at various copper prices ranging from $3.50 per pound to $5 per pound copper. These are modeled results and we use the average of 24 and 25 with current volume and cost estimates and holding gold flat at $1,900 per ounce and molybdenum flat at $20 per pound. And you\u2019ll see here that annual EBITDA would range from nearly $9 billion per annum at $3.50 copper, to $15 billion per annum at $5 copper. And our operating cash flows would range over these prices from $6 billion at $350 copper to $11 billion at $5 copper. And we show sensitivities to various commodities on the right and input costs. With our long-life reserves and large-scale production, we\u2019re well positioned from future -- to benefit from future metals intensive growth trends with prospects for increasing cash returns under our performance-based payout framework. Our capital expenditure plans are summarized on Slide 15. The capital expenditures totaled $2.7 billion, excluding the smelter in 2022. We\u2019ll note that this was lower than the $3.3 billion estimate we provided going into 2022, and that reflects lead times and our focus during the year to prioritize critical projects. The current forecast for 2023 totals $3.4 billion, and that\u2019s a slight change from our previous estimate of $3.3 billion for 2023. And capital expenditures for 2024 are currently forecast to approximate $3 billion as spending on the Grasberg projects reach completion. We always are very careful in managing our capital cost to maintain flexibility in response to market condition, while ensuring that our investments are sufficient to support a reliable long-term production profile. Returning to the financial policy that we began to implement in the second half of 2021, it\u2019s really centered on three priorities. The cornerstone of the financial policy is maintaining a strong balance sheet and liquidity. And that provides significant flexibility for the future. We\u2019ve been executing on this performance-based payout. It provides for 50% of our free cash flow to be allocated to shareholder returns in the form of dividends and share purchases and the balance available to invest in our projects. Since commencing the performance-based payout policy in the second half of 2021, we\u2019ve returned about 60% of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share purchases. And at the same time, we also further strengthened our balance sheet, providing capacity for funding new projects over time. We did not purchase shares in the second half of 2022 because of the significant change in market conditions and the resulting impact on cash flows in the second half of the year. The improved market conditions will drive increased free cash flow, which will boost shareholder returns, and our future discretionary share purchases will be dependent on our cash flow and overall market conditions. We believe the three priorities of balance sheet strength, allocating cash flows to a mix of shareholder returns, and organic growth will enhance long-term value of our business. In closing, I just want to reiterate our view about the positioning for the Company, a bright long-term future supported by our attractive portfolio of assets, supported by the fundamentals of the copper business and the positive outlook for the markets we serve. Our team is energized. We\u2019re motivated to continue building long-term value in our business and on executing our plans responsibly, safely and efficiently. And I want to thank you for your attention, and operator, we\u2019ll now open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Emily Chieng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nEmily Chieng: Good morning, Richard and Kathleen. And thank you for taking my questions. I would like to sort of ask around Freeport\u2019s growth appetite. And as you think about the copper price environment and how the market is trending, has anything in your mind changed around how you view Freeport\u2019s need to pursue or accelerate growth plans? There\u2019s clearly been a lot that has changed in the broader macro environment as well. And I wouldn\u2019t mind hearing about how maybe some of the leaching opportunity can play into that and what the potential annual run rate basis could look like when fully developed? Thank you.\nRichard Adkerson: Thanks, Emily. With leaching, we\u2019re not constraining ourselves to conserve capital or anything else. We\u2019re -- we believe this is such a great opportunity for us that we are pursuing it as aggressively as we can, and we are pursuing it on a number of different fronts, some using outside vendors, some doing things on our own, some in joint ventures with companies. It\u2019s just such a great opportunity to add production at low capital cost and with low carbon. So, it\u2019s not something we\u2019re constraining. The other projects that we have, and Kathleen reviewed them, we have a series of major capital projects that are multiyear large capital requirements. And for those, we are working hard to prepare ourselves for them and doing work so that we can go forward. But we are going to wait until the uncertainties that we\u2019ve been facing recently are -- become clearer. As I said, the current sentiment is much stronger than it was three months ago, but there\u2019s still a lot of overhang in the market, as you can see in the market today. So, we are waiting to see that our project in Chile is dependent on the direction the country goes in with this current consideration of its laws and its constitution. So, that is really going to be on hold until that becomes clear. So, we\u2019re not preparing any major change in the first part of 2023 versus what we did in 2022.\nKathleen Quirk: Emily, on the leaching run rate, the 200 million pound target that we\u2019ve laid out, those -- we believe that that can be attained just from these operational changes that we\u2019re making. The heat retention, leaching in places that we weren\u2019t leaching previously, directing the solutions to places where we can enhance recoveries really from data analytics that we\u2019re getting that are helping us -- helping guide our operations every day. Those things we think we can get just operationally. The -- on top of that, this research and development that\u2019s going on with respect to additives, that could scale it larger. So, this 200 million pounds that we\u2019re talking about, we think that is really just bringing more of a light on our leach stockpiles and moving aggressively to -- over the last several years, the focus on the industry has been more on concentrating. And now we\u2019re putting focus back on these leach initiatives, and we\u2019ve identified some things. I wouldn\u2019t say low-hanging fruit, but it\u2019s achievable things that we\u2019re doing, and we\u2019re already starting to see results.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Orest Wowkodaw with Scotiabank.\nOrest Wowkodaw: Just given the uncertainty out there with respect to both Chinese and ex China markets, can you give us an updated outlook on what you\u2019re seeing from your customers? Like are you seeing any indications of slowing demand?\nKathleen Quirk: Richard, do you want me to take that? Orest, we\u2019re not -- I mean, there\u2019s pockets -- of course, in the residential markets there\u2019s pockets of weakness, but there are -- we\u2019re just continuing to see strong physical demand, we\u2019re selling everything that we can produce. And there\u2019s no ability for us to, at this point, produce more that customers are looking for. So, on balance, I\u2019d say the physical market continues to be healthy, and we have -- most of our insights come from within the U.S. because we\u2019re a very significant part of the U.S. marketplace. And -- so generally, the market is continuing to be strong, and we\u2019re selling everything that we can produce. And if we could produce more, our customers would want it.\nRichard Adkerson: Even looking back to 2022, you\u2019ll recall, I mentioned I think on more than one conference call that there was a disconnect between even then the physical world we were dealing with, with our customers and what the market was doing. So, it has been striking as to the strength of demand that we\u2019ve had, we had no problem selling our production. We\u2019ve actually -- there was a shortage of wire rod in the United States that was -- where we couldn\u2019t meet everything that was being produced. And then, with our copper concentrate customers, including China, people were buying all that we produced and actually wanting more. So, market sentiment is better now. And but our customers continue to be very positive.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Chris LaFemina with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nChris LaFemina: You have $1.3 billion of net debt as of the end of 2022. Your net debt target range is $3 billion to $4 billion. So, I guess, the first question is, is that the range that we should think about, or are you comfortable maintaining net debt below that range? In other words, if you really want to get to $3 billion to $4 billion, how do you get that from here, generating positive cash flow? You can step up the buybacks, maybe accelerate returns. But do we get to a $3 billion to $4 billion range this year, or is that not going to happen?\nRichard Adkerson: Well...\nKathleen Quirk: The $1.3 billion -- go ahead.\nRichard Adkerson: No, I was just going to say, Chris, and Kathleen can talk about the details. When we announced the financial policy, as I looked out and I said, the likelihood is, cash is going to come in faster than we can spend it just because of the nature of our capital projects are long term. It takes a lot of time. This has happened before at Freeport. Two previous occasions in our history, we got down to zero net debt. This is setting aside the smelter because that\u2019s financed on its own. But, what this does is by having that cushion between where our debt is and our debt target is, it will allow us to readily be able to finance future construction projects. But it\u2019s just the way the cash flows in versus -- we don\u2019t feel any compulsion to spend money to get the debt up to that target.\nChris LaFemina: Okay. So, should we think of it more as a net debt target of below $4 billion rather than $3 billion to $4 billion?\nRichard Adkerson: Well, I think...\nKathleen Quirk: $3 billion to $4 billion is the limit. Yes, $3 billion to $4 billion is what we -- yes.\nChris LaFemina: Got it. Okay. Good. And then sorry, second question on Grasberg. You -- it looks like you\u2019ve increased your gold production guidance for 2024, \u201825 and \u201826, but copper volumes are pretty much the same. So, is there something -- what\u2019s happening there to result in an increase and what you expect to get out of that mine in terms of gold over those three years?\nRichard Adkerson: Well, while the numbers look simple, the mine planning is complicated. And we report the results of our mine planning quarterly. And what you\u2019re seeing there is some revisions in mine planning to optimize resource recovery. It wasn\u2019t any target. It\u2019s just the way that -- the way that the mineralization of these ore bodies fall out as we change future mine plans. And...\nKathleen Quirk: Yes, there was some changes between Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ. And additionally, we\u2019ve been getting higher gold recoveries than we had previously forecasted. And that\u2019s helping us as well. So, those are the main differences.\nRichard Adkerson: And it\u2019s not a targeting it -- it\u2019s not a targeting exercise, Chris. I mean, we didn\u2019t do something to try to get more gold. It was just -- if we look at the orebody, we maximize the value. It\u2019s a dynamic process and report to you the results of that process, and that\u2019s what it is.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Lawson Winder with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\nLawson Winder: Good morning, Richard. Good morning, Kathleen. Very nice to hear from you both, and thank you for your time and the update today. I wanted to hopefully ask you two questions. Just one on the C1 cash cost guidance for 2023. To what extent might some of these higher costs year-over-year continue into 2024? Like what is the percentage of those that are more structural as opposed to potentially more cyclical?\nKathleen Quirk: I think you can look at -- I think you can look at the makeup of our costs. On that slide, we provide a makeup. And labor cost is something that\u2019s kind of stays with you. Materials and supplies, a component of that is commodity driven and a component of its services driven. The energy, I think, is more variable and things like sulfuric acid is more variable. So, you can look at that pie chart and get a feel for which ones have the ability to change, and we provide some sensitivities on things like currencies and diesel costs.\nRichard Adkerson: Okay. And one thing that\u2019s -- one thing that\u2019s a real benefit of Freeport that we say a lot. I\u2019m not sure if this is recognized as much as it ought to be. But, we operate every mine that we have an interest in. We have joint venture partners. But unlike other operations where those joint ventures are run as a standalone business, we operate globally through our operatorship rights. And that makes us really important customers of our suppliers. We\u2019re generally one of the very largest customers of people who provide our major supplies. And so, as those suppliers globally have been working to pass along their input cost, our global supply team working with our operations have been affected in mitigating certain of those costs. We\u2019ve had some impact. But again, it\u2019s a real dynamic situation and -- you saw we came in below our quarter-ago estimate. Some costs are moderating, some are carrying over, but it\u2019s just an ongoing thing. And we give you the best outlook we have, and then we work hard to try to operate with as low a cost as we can.\nLawson Winder: And then, I wanted to follow up on your comments around El Abra and the plans to advance water infrastructure. Are you considering desalination capacity? Is that what you\u2019re referring to there? And then...\nKathleen Quirk: Yes.\nRichard Adkerson: Yes. That\u2019s really the only alternative.\nLawson Winder: Okay. And then what would the time line be on that?\nRichard Adkerson: Well, we\u2019re working on it right now, and we\u2019re structuring, so that we have the alternative of going forward with our current operations and maximizing those or undertaking a large-scale investment and new concentrator there. So, we\u2019re approaching it to give ourselves the alternatives of going in either of those directions. But we wanted to get started with that because it was going to be required one way or the other.\nKathleen Quirk: Yes. And so, we\u2019ve got to go through a permitting process on that as well. So, it\u2019s unlikely we\u2019ll have any material spending on it until a few years out.\nRichard Adkerson: It takes time to do it. But as I said, we -- in the past, we\u2019ve been delaying that so -- we made the decision on the concentrator expansion. And in recent months, we\u2019ve decided we need to go ahead with the permitting for the water, desal plant, so that -- because we\u2019re going to need it one way or the other.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please go ahead.\nJohn Tumazos: Good morning. Congratulations on all the progress in the tough business. Thinking of the Slide 11 with the five projects, I realize it takes a lot of engineering resources for each of these projects. Is five sort of the maximum number or do you have time for a little more? You\u2019re engineering El Abra, but the constitution and taxes and all that stuff is up in the year. So, that\u2019s a big investment in time. You don\u2019t have the Sierrita mill, Chino mill or an additional Morenci mill projects there. I know you can\u2019t do anything -- everything. But a $30-plus moly's Sierrita new mill must be very attractive, you\u2019re budgeting 20 and maybe lower for the long term at 15 for your reserves. Is there too much Indonesia in your CapEx and not enough Americas since you\u2019re the biggest U.S. copper producer? And with politics, the U.S. looks better every day. I know that\u2019s a lot of thoughts, but how you fix the projects?\nRichard Adkerson: Well, no. And you know it\u2019s a good new story to have this large pipeline of future projects, and I personally believe the world is going to need that copper. Going to your last question first, there is no relationship between Kucing Liar and projects in the U.S. It doesn\u2019t bump out projects. It doesn\u2019t prioritize anything. It\u2019s something that fits right in. It will be financed by PT-FI out of cash flows from PT-FI. And it will support our volumes there through our current operating rights to 2041. We\u2019re talking with the government about extending those. There\u2019s opportunities for Kucing Liar beyond that. And we believe, although we haven\u2019t been engaged in drilling exercises in the Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ and who knows what else is down there because we really haven\u2019t fully drilled to explore future opportunities. Now, John, you know the thing about Grasberg, ever since we discovered it, it keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger. But that\u2019s on its own, there is no effect on what we\u2019re doing at Kucing Liar with what we do in the United States. So, we have the financial resources to do -- in the Americas, the United States and South America. So, the ones we\u2019ve listed are the ones we believe are the largest, most significant executable projects initially. The Bagdad expansion is a straightforward doubling of mill capacity, and we\u2019ve dealt with water issues and so forth and...\nKathleen Quirk: That will add moly as well, John -- Bagdad.\nJohn Tumazos: It has moly, Bagdad. And the biggest problem, quite frankly, at Bagdad is getting workers. It\u2019s just a challenge getting mine workers in today\u2019s world who live in these remote communities where our mines are. But that\u2019s a very executable project, it\u2019s not that complicated. But -- and as we deal with the workers\u2019 situation in housing, as markets clear up, that\u2019s one that would be ready to go. As I said, El Abra is depending on the direction of the government there. Lone Star, which really looks like it can be another base level high-profile operation for Freeport in the future, we\u2019re going to maximize it through the oxide, ore and continue to understand how we attack the big sulfide resource that we\u2019ve identified in. Then beyond that, you mentioned Morenci, Sierrita, and there\u2019s other older mines that we have. Chino has a growth opportunity. All those are in stages of evaluation and understanding what we have. Obviously, when you sit down on top and look at this organization, you want to be focused. You don\u2019t want to just have a scattergun approach. But all of those things provide us growth opportunities from inside our company, which makes it very unlikely that we\u2019ll be acquiring smaller operations to pursue externally. You can just see what\u2019s going in the world when you have to pay a big price, you get a resource and then you put the capital on top of it. And that ends up with a very large investment to try to recover. It\u2019s much better because we get no value today from these future resources that we have within our own portfolio. And with success in developing those, all of the incremental value goes to our shareholders and not somebody else\u2019s shareholders.\nKathleen Quirk: John, on your question about -- sorry, Richard.\nRichard Adkerson: Go ahead. No, go ahead.\nKathleen Quirk: I was just going to say your question about the molybdenum situation. We do have excess milling capacity at our Climax mine. And we\u2019ve been operating at below capacity in recent years because of market conditions, but we have started to do a stripping campaign there that will allow us to expand production from Climax. Over time, it doesn\u2019t require a new concentrator or anything like that. So that\u2019s our first one -- and the incremental costs are attractive. So, we are doing that. And as Richard said, we\u2019ve got -- we got a lot of projects in the background. But these are the ones that are strategic and that we\u2019re focused on. The leach technology is a near-term project. And Bagdad long term -- I mean, medium term and the Lone Star major expansion longer term. El Abra, we believe, will get done. It\u2019s a project that it\u2019s attractive and it will get done. It\u2019s a question of when. So, we don\u2019t have a good view yet on when that will go forward. But this investment in some infrastructure and water is going to give us some optionality to support an expansion. So, we\u2019ve got all our people focused on these things and we have an enormous resource base like we were saying in the U.S. where we already have established operations and community support. So, we\u2019re in a really good position as we look forward as to what this world is going to need in terms of new copper supply. None of this can go quickly as you well know.\nJohn Tumazos: If I could follow with one more. A few years ago, Freeport bought a drinking water system and a sewage system for Arequipa, the third largest city as you were tripling the El Abra mill and mine -- excuse me, the Cerro Verde mill and mine. And I think you might have some rail -- short-line rails, so that you don\u2019t have as many trucks on the road. Could you just confirm that your tons per day are 350,000 to 400,000 tons a day and no mishaps at Cerro Verde? I think, there\u2019s a lot of confusion in the press about conditions...\nKathleen Quirk: Yes. So, in the last several days, we\u2019ve been operating -- we\u2019ve been operating at around that 350,000 level. Prior to that, we were closer to 400,000. We\u2019ve really been operating at 10%, 15% lower just to deal with supplies. And so, we\u2019re watching that every day. And I\u2019ll let Richard comment on the community situation. But in terms of operations, we\u2019re continuing to operate, but we have limited our mill throughput just to deal with the limitations and the concerns about key supplies.\nRichard Adkerson: Yes. And I\u2019m glad you asked the question because I wanted to elaborate on what I said about Peru in my opening comments. I think all of you know that the Cerro Verde milling complex is the largest in the industry, 400,000-plus per day capacity. The tailings dam will be one of the largest earthen dams ever constructed in the history of mankind, if not the largest. And what John is referring to is a number of years ago, we did as a community project invested in a freshwater system for Arequipa, the second largest city in Peru. And then, as we were developing the expansion of the concentrator and tailings dam, we shifted away from building a new dam on the river that runs just outside of the sea of Arequipa. We come in and we built a wastewater collection and treatment system. And with doing that, we got water for our concentrator and we markedly improved the ecology of the river, and that has been very positively received by downstream farmers and community itself. And that\u2019s really helped foster our positive relationship there. And our team there does overall good. Now, having said that, the situation in Peru is very complicated and nobody at this point can predict how it\u2019s going to unfold. The motions are very high. The government is reluctant to use extreme steps to deal with roadblocks and disruptions and this thing in the day-to-day evolution. And so we are faced with the problems that caused us to cut back on our production rates to conserve line and other inputs so that we could continue to operate. We have the ability to house workers on a temporary basis on site. Most of our workers live in the region of the city of Arequipa, and sometimes those roads have been blocked. So, we\u2019re prepared for it. Our team does a great job in managing things like this over time like COVID and -- but I just wanted to make the point that these concerns that people are raising are directed towards the issues with the government and not directed against us at Cerro Verde and our operations. And so far, we\u2019ve been able to continue to operate.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nMichael Dudas: I was intrigued by your comment about labor and availability and such. I guess, you\u2019re talking a bit more like in the U.S. But -- how much is that situation limiting -- limited your volume plans for 2023 is probably a small percentage. But is it more secular pressure of getting the qualified productive miners and operators for all your mines? Is that also going to be a limiting factor on how the industry reacts to try to move forward with the market signaling in the future, they\u2019re going to need more supply?\nKathleen Quirk: Yes. Well, during COVID, we did have some impacts on our mining rates, and also suspended some milling operations at Morenci. And I\u2019m speaking about the U.S. right now. And we started ramping back up in the U.S. during 2021, and that continued into 2022. And we have a situation where we currently have about something on the order of 1,300 job openings. And we\u2019ve got typically 10,000 to 12,000 employees in the U.S. And so -- and we\u2019ve seen a lot of turnover as well. And it\u2019s just been a very competitive marketplace for labor, as you\u2019ve read about it, in the U.S. And we don\u2019t have that situation in Indonesia or in South America, but we do have competition in the U.S. with other sectors, and that\u2019s continued into 2023 and what\u2019s caused us to change our outlook somewhat. We could have in 2022, produced more, if we were fully staffed. And I believe that is the case again this year. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re making some progress on hires and we are conducting training and some of these workers that we\u2019re hiring now are new to the industry, and so we do have to go through training, and the experience level is not what it was five years ago. So, we\u2019re going through that process. I think it does have some implications to -- the ability to develop a mine in the U.S. is just the labor force. But we\u2019ll see what happens. You\u2019re starting to see some changes in payrolls and that sort of thing, and we\u2019ll see how this unfolds. But it is a factor in our U.S. mining output.\nRichard Adkerson: Yes. So, it\u2019s broader than mining. I mean, when I talk with people to business council, business around the table, it\u2019s a common theme you hear across many industries. And when all the COVID relief funds went out, that was a factor. I mean, face it, our work is hard work. And it\u2019s harder to drive a big haul truck than it is to drive an Amazon or UPS or FedEx truck. So, we compete with those. We pay our people strong living wages. We\u2019re giving people substantial increases this year. We invest in recreational facilities, try to deal with housing. It\u2019s an issue in Colorado with our molybdenum mines. You can imagine what it\u2019s like there. So, it\u2019s a big issue for us. And as a result, our mine rates aren't meeting what we would like for them to meet, and that affects not only current but future production, and it\u2019s a strategic challenge for us. But, it\u2019s not just us and it\u2019s not just the mining industry, but the mining industry because the nature of the work presents special problems.\nKathleen Quirk: This leaching initiative that we\u2019re pursuing is not labor-intensive, because it\u2019s already -- the material has already been mined. So, that\u2019s a real opportunity for us to execute on.\nRichard Adkerson: And if we -- what it opens up to us is unbelievable. I mean, we have -- Morenci the largest leaching operation in the world. It has been for years. And by enhancing the existing leaching operations using all these tools, data analytics and heat covers and supplements, it\u2019s really amazing. But then it opens up historical leach stacks and potentially places like Lone Star using leaching to replace or minimize concentrator investments. So, it\u2019s really exciting. It\u2019s beyond just this 200 pounds that we\u2019re targeting now. But with success, it\u2019s a great opportunity for us. And it\u2019s not a fracking deal like it was in oil and gas industry. It\u2019s not going to turn the dynamics of the supply situation upside down. But for a company like Freeport with the leaching operations that we have and the application with success to historical leach sites and future mine development, it\u2019s something that\u2019s really exciting. And the great thing about it is to see the excitement of our own guys and own team that\u2019s working on it. It\u2019s really gratifying.\nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of Bendik Folden Nyttingnes with Clarksons Securities. Please go ahead.\nBendik Folden Nyttingnes: With the revision in the mining [ore billing] (ph) in Chile at least sort of moving in the right direction, it would be interesting to get some color on what you\u2019d realistically like to see to be comfortable with moving forward with El Abra expansion?\nRichard Adkerson: Yes. I had the chance for the first time to meet the President of Chile when I was at APAC in Bangkok, and we had a very long conversation in advance of his presentation and it was really positive. And he explained to me what he\u2019s facing, which I can appreciate, Kathleen met with him earlier. And so, like what\u2019s going on in a lot of different countries around the world, particularly when commodity prices go up, people see the opportunity to take financial benefits through royalties and taxes and use them to meet social needs. And it\u2019s just always a balancing situation. At one point, Chile built its whole economy on copper and was very successful. When I was talking with people in Indonesia, the Congo and other places, I would always point to Chile as an example of a country that to be successful by encouraging mining. Chile for a number of reasons, labor and now government situation is losing -- has lost and is losing competitive advantage that it once had. So, these government officials run on a platform of enhancing social programs and then they end up facing the reality of they go too far with that, what that does to their country in terms of its currency, in terms of its economic viability and investment and so forth. President of Chile understands that, and you can see that there has been a more positive tone of dealing with these issues. We\u2019re not a real leader in Chile, although we are in the global copper business. So, we participate with the government, with other companies there and the conversations that are going on and share our experiences that we\u2019ve had in working globally on these kinds of issues. So, the current direction is clearly more positive than it was a year ago. The President is facing a low level of popularity now. And so, it\u2019s a question of facing reality for political leaders. And we certainly lived our -- based our share of those things. And as a mining company, you work hard to gain the trust of the politicians. If you do things the right way, you\u2019re sensitive to their issues. You don\u2019t try to take advantage every time you have a chance to take advantage. We\u2019ve actually walked away from projects, because governments -- we didn\u2019t believe the deal the government was offering us was sustainable long-term deals. And that\u2019s proved out to be the case. So it\u2019s a complicated deal, big part of a business for the leader of a company. And you\u2019ve got to -- as I said, listen, be responsible, and work to find middle ground so that it\u2019s a win-win deal and you\u2019re not taking advantage of anyone and you\u2019re representing your stakeholders. You\u2019re not letting somebody take advantage of you. And that\u2019s what Chile is going through. I believe that the reasonable compromise will be reached because it\u2019s in everybody\u2019s interest for that to happen.\nKathleen Quirk: We\u2019ll also be looking at the -- how the constitutional process advances this year. And it appears the financial package is moving forward and they\u2019re reaching some determination, looks as if that\u2019s progressing. But we also want to look at how this constitutional process unfolds as well. And in the meantime, we\u2019re maintaining our options by planning to move forward with the water infrastructure investments.\nRichard Adkerson: And you know, I can\u2019t let this call go by without telling you how personally pleased I am with our much improved relationship with the government in Indonesia, where we had a multiyear discussions, negotiations over our mining rights in our contract and so forth. It\u2019s just been remarkable what\u2019s happened in the last six months, I made three trips there. We had -- the President had an incredibly positive visit to our job site at the end of August, early September. He asked me to accompany his investment minister and Kathleen was there, too. We did a university road trip and then -- but the two of us went back for the B20 part of G20 and got to see the President and others and it\u2019s just the -- and then APAC and Bangkok. It\u2019s just a great feeling to feel that we\u2019re all altogether now working to -- for the benefit of all the stakeholders and having the success we\u2019re having on the ground at PT-FI. All right\u2026\nOperator: With that, I will turn the call over to management for any closing remarks.\nRichard Adkerson: All right. I was starting that. Thank you everybody for participating today. And you know we\u2019re always available for follow-up calls. You can call David initially and he can make arrangements to talk with Kathleen or me or whoever we need to bring into conversation. Thank you for your participation. It\u2019s great to have a quarter like this, and we\u2019re really excited about our future.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kathleen Quirk",
            "content": "Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan conference call, and happy 2023 to everyone. Earlier this morning, we reported fourth quarter 2022 operating and financial results, and a copy of our press release and slides are available on our website at fcx.com. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call, and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. Like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings. On the call today with me are Richard Adkerson, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Maree Robertson, our CFO; Mark Johnson, our Chief Operating Officer of Indonesia; Josh Olmsted, who is our Chief Operating Officer for the Americas; Mike Kendrick, who leads our molybdenum business; Cory Stevens, who heads our Engineering and Construction and overall Global Technical Services Group; Rick Coleman, who is actively involved in all of our construction projects; as well as Steve Higgins, our Chief Administrative Officer. So, we have a full complement of management team here today. And we'll start -- Richard will make some opening remarks, and then he'll turn it back to me and we'll cover the slide materials, and then we'll open up the call for your questions. Turn it to you, Richard. Thanks, Richard. We'll start on Slide 3, which summarizes our performance for the full year 2022. And just a couple of notes on the fourth quarter from our press release. We finished the year with a strong fourth quarter. Copper and gold sales exceeded our October guidance. And our consolidated unit net cash costs of $1.53 per pound in the quarter were better than our estimates going into the quarter. With average copper realizations in the fourth quarter of $3.77 per pound, we generated strong margins with fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA at approximately $2.25 billion. Looking at the year, we are proud of the performance of our team stayed focused on effective execution and on driving results in a volatile macroeconomic environment. After successfully growing our volumes in 2021 by 19% for copper and 59% for gold compared with 2020, we achieved another year of growth in 2022, with 11% higher copper sales volumes and a 34% increase in gold volumes. Our team in Indonesia has successfully and materially grown production levels in a sustaining large-scale, low-cost production at the world's largest underground mining complex. In the Americas, our teams in Peru and Chile proved resilient in restoring production during 2022 that had been impacted by the pandemic. And our teams in the U.S. maintain production at 2021 levels despite ongoing labor shortages and we also made significant advances on new technologies to enhance value. For the year, we generated $9.5 billion in adjusted EBITDA, and that was a year of dramatic swings in commodity prices and cost drivers. Our operating cash flows for the year, which were net of $1.5 billion in working capital requirements was in excess of our capital investments in our operations, and we nearly tripled our cash return to shareholders, pursuant to our performance-based payout policy. We ended the year with net debt, excluding the debt associated with our smelter of $1.3 billion, and that's substantially below the level of mid-2021 when we initiated our performance-based payout policy. On Slide 4, you'll see we've listed notable accomplishments during the year. In addition to driving value in our operating and financial areas of achievement, we're very proud of our work with third parties to validate all of our operations under the Copper Mark standards, the measurable progress we're making on our climate initiatives and the expanded disclosures we've developed to enhance transparency and accountability. We'll talk about markets next, and we've got a slide on Page 5. We experienced significant volatility as many of you have seen during 2022, with copper prices trading from a high of $4.87 per pound earlier in the year, falling to $3.18 per pound midyear and partially recovering to $3.80 per pound by year-end. Prices continued to move higher in early 2023 to a level currently approximating $4.25 per pound as several of the macroeconomic clouds began to lift. We discussed on prior calls that the dramatic moves in 2022 have been largely -- been based on sentiment rather than fundamentals. The facts are that the physical markets for copper have remained tight even during a period of weaker economic data coming out of China, and that's evidenced by the low levels of available copper inventories throughout the year. At the same time, copper's importance in the economy continues to grow as a result of the intensity of use in clean energy applications and the global acceleration of electrification. We believe we're still in the early innings of a broad-based secular driver of long-term demand. The ability of the industry to meet this multiyear period of growing demand continues to be challenged, leading to large market deficits in the future. You read about these challenges every day, and it's getting harder, not easier, higher long-term prices are needed to incentivize new supplies. We've lived through the ups and downs in the copper market. We've effectively managed our operations and balance sheet during periods of volatility, and we're prepared for this, but we believe the long-term fundamentals point to a real step change in how copper is valued in the economy. Turning to our reserve position on Slide 6. We benefit from a geographically diverse high-quality portfolio of copper mines with significant exposure to gold and molybdenum. Our strategy, as Richard discussed, is centered around being foremost in copper. And we benefit from a portfolio of assets with characteristics that are very difficult to replicate. We show our reserve position at the end of 2022 with over 100 billion pounds of proved and probable reserves. We have an average reserve life of over 25 years. We added twice the amount of reserves we produced in 2022, principally at our U.S. mines in the Morenci and Safford Lone Star districts where we're focused on future growth. In addition to proved and probable reserves, we have enormous mineral resources of 235 billion pounds of copper. Over half of this is located in the U.S. where we have established operations, a great track record and a valuable franchise. We'll continue to work as we go forward to convert these resources into viable mine plans and future production. It's an extraordinarily valuable resource position in a world that's going to need more copper in the future. We wanted to focus a little bit on molybdenum on this call. And on Slide 7, we've got some information about our molybdenum business. We're a leader in that industry. We're the world's largest producer by a significant margin. And with the price move over the last couple of months of over 50% in molybdenum, we thought you'd be interested in learning more about our business. We produced 85 million pounds of molybdenum in 2022, and that's comprised about 60% from copper mines as a byproduct and the balance from two primary molybdenum mines that we operate in Colorado. And these are the only primary molybdenum mines that are currently operated in the United States. We also operate downstream processing facilities to produce products that are used in a broad range of metallurgical specialty steel and chemical applications. The price moved from $18 per pound at the start of the fourth quarter to over $30 per pound currently has been driven by some of the same supply issues that have impacted copper. And in addition, demand drivers continue to be supported from the oil and gas, aerospace and power generation sectors. So, we note on this slide, the impact of a $5 change in molybdenum prices, it's material at $400 million in annual EBITDA and $375 million in cash flow. And the recent move of over $10 per pound, if sustained at a higher price, adds additional leverage to our results. Looking at our operating stats for 2022 on Slide 8, you'll see our sales for the year were about 35% from the U.S., 28% from South America and 37% from Indonesia. In the U.S., our sales were similar to 2021 levels, and we grew sales volumes by 10% in South America and by 20% in Indonesia. In the U.S., we're continuing our focus on productivity, given the current limitations on adding to our workforce, we're taking advantage of technology advancements and opportunities to expand production from leaching at low incremental cost, and we're planning our next phase of growth, as we'll talk about in a few minutes. As discussed, the biggest resource position and source of long-term growth we have is a real opportunity in the United States. In South America, both Cerro Verde and El Abra grew production in 2022 in a complex social and political environment. After successfully recovering from the pandemic-related interruptions in 2022, our team in Peru is now dealing with challenges associated with civil unrest that you've all read about. We're prioritizing the safety and security of our workforce. We're navigating disruptions to transportation routes and supply chains. To date, the impacts have not been significant but the situation is dynamic day by day, and we're watching it very carefully. The bottom of the chart shows the 2022 cost performance. As we've talked about on prior calls, we experienced significant inflation pressures across the business during 2022, particularly for energy and other commodity-related consumables, and in the second half of the year, started to see inflation from a rising cost of materials, supplies and services. The situation started to improve in 2022 with a number of the commodity-related consumables, but we're still dealing with costs in excess of historical levels. If you look at the average cost for the year at Grasberg of $0.09 per pound is remarkable, particularly in the context of this cost environment. Richard talked about the significant success story of the Grasberg transition, and we've got some details on Slide 9, significant success for not only Freeport but also something for the global mining industry to be proud of in the country of Indonesia. We started planning for this transition over 25 years ago, and the team has just done an outstanding job. We benefit from the fact that several from the team who were involved in the planning of this project, including Mark Johnson, who's on this call, stayed with it over this period. And over the years, we've added great talent to our team with experts from around the world. The success of this project, the mutual respect built over the years between Freeport, the government of Indonesia and local communities has established a really strong foundation for the future. We've got the opportunity with this resource to plan a new phase of development longer term and are continuing to discuss with the government the opportunity to extend our long-term partnership beyond 2041. If you go to Slide 10, we've got an update on our smelter project. And this is our key feature of our commitment to the Indonesian government, was to expand domestic copper smelting and refining capacity in Indonesia. We're making really good progress on constructing the new smelter in Eastern Java, it's near our existing smelter, PT smelting at Gresik. You can see from the pictures that construction is advancing. We've got thousands of workers now on site. We're working very closely with our EPC contractor to try as much as possible to make up delays that were caused by the pandemic. We reached a milestone of over 50% completion recently and we are expecting to begin commissioning the smelter during 2024. As you recall, the capital investments for this project are being funded from a successful bond offering that PT-FI completed during 2022. And so, we have the funding between the bond offering and a revolver at PT-FI to fund this project. Moving to our growth outlook. This is exciting opportunities for the company, and we continue to plan our next phase of growth. We've got benefit from having multiple organic projects to develop within the portfolio over time. We operate all the mines we have interest in. We're able to share experiences, new technologies, operating synergies and best practices across the portfolio as we develop projects, and we can direct capital across the portfolio to the highest value opportunities. Our proven technical capacity capabilities and management is a notable strength. And importantly, we've earned a track record and a reputation for operating sustainably and responsibly. The world, we believe, is going to need all of our projects and more. The project with the shortest lead time is our Americas leach initiative. We've talked a lot about it in recent calls. The economics are compelling, low capital intensity, low incremental operating costs and a low carbon footprint. The new data analytics capabilities, we are continuing, to be applied to prioritize our work streams on the highest value. We're continuing our work to apply covers to the leach stockpiles because of the benefits that you get from heat retention in enhancing recoveries, and we've identified new areas that were not pursued historically. We're also continuing to test various additives that can further enhance recoveries. This is a really significant opportunity for us. We're continuing to target a run rate of 200 million pounds per annum by the end of this year and success of this level -- at this level would provide opportunities to scale larger. We're in a great position to lead this innovation with our long history in leaching and large inventory to work with. At our Bagdad mine in Northwest Arizona, we're progressing a feasibility study to double production at that site. We expect to complete the feasibility this year, and we'll be in a position to assess options on how we time the future development. We started advanced planning to commence construction of a new tailings site that would support the existing operation, but would also provide flexibility for the expanded production. And as a brownfield expansion, this project could be developed more quickly than a greenfield development. Our Lone Star opportunity is really something special. We've been successful in increasing production levels substantially above the original project. And we're really in the early stages in the development of this mine, as we mine the oxide ores more quickly, we're opening up the opportunity for a major sulfide development long term. The resource is massive. You've seen the numbers, 50 billion pounds of potential resource here. We're doing a lot of drilling. And importantly, it's located in an established mining district in the U.S. In Chile, we've defined the opportunity for a major expansion at our El Abra mine. As we continue to monitor regulatory and fiscal matters in Chile, we're planning a project to invest in infrastructure, water infrastructure to provide flexibility to extend existing operations and optionality to support a new concentrator. We're also planning at El Abra to test new leaching technologies in the near term, to evaluate the potential for expanded leach production and possibly competing technologies to a concentrator. We're continuing our development of the Kucing Liar deposit in Indonesia. We're really gaining a lot of efficiencies from the work we did at Grasberg Block Cave. And similar to that development, this is a long-term project. We expect to have initial production from Kucing Liar deposit towards the end of this decade. Moving to Slide 12. We provide a three-year outlook for our sales volumes. And as we talked about, we achieved two years of growth in copper sales. And currently, our forecast reflects sales in the \u201823 to \u201825 period that are similar to 2022 levels. Our mine production is actually going to be higher than our sales by about 100 million pounds in 2023 and 2024. And that is a result of our domestic processing arrangements in Indonesia where the point of sale has changed from selling concentrate to selling cathodes. And so, a portion of our production will be inventoried until it's processed and sold through our smelters. Previously, this inventory would have been held by third-party smelters. We've got small revisions otherwise to 2023 guidance that reflects assumption of a continuation of tight labor markets in the U.S. That's impacted our ability to increase mining rates. And success also in our leach recovery initiative could provide some upside in the U.S. as we look over the next three-year period. In the reference materials on Slide 30, we provide information on our 2023 sales by quarter. The reason for the drop in the first quarter reflects the impact of the tolling arrangement in Indonesia. But, you can see the balance of the year is fairly stable at over 1 billion pounds of copper sales per quarter. Moving to the cost outlook for 2023, we're providing guidance of average cost of $1.60 per pound for the year. That compares with $1.50 per pound in 2022. We show a comparison to the two years, and you'll see the site production cost line item is about 4.5% higher than the 2022 average. And that's a result of assumptions that we've made in our forecast for higher average electricity and coal costs compared with the 2022 average and also higher power requirements, principally in Indonesia, and the impact of higher cost of equipment components, supply costs and labor cost increases. The other line items are offsetting. You'll note a decline in royalties and duties. That really is reflective of a recent reduction in our export duty in Indonesia as a result of the smelter progress. I'll also note that this assumes a molybdenum price of $20 per pound in 2023. The current price is $30 a pound and each $2 per pound change in molybdenum is $0.02 a pound. So, if current prices hold, would have roughly $0.10 a pound less cash -- unit net cash costs and this reflects. In recent months, inflationary pressures have been less severe than we experienced during 2022. We're encouraged by that. And we're going to continue to focus on managing costs that we can control. We're continuing to pursue technology-driven enhancements to mitigate the impacts, particularly in the U.S. Getting to our cash flows, significant leverage to copper prices. We've got on Slide 14, we show modeled results for EBITDA and cash flow at various copper prices ranging from $3.50 per pound to $5 per pound copper. These are modeled results and we use the average of 24 and 25 with current volume and cost estimates and holding gold flat at $1,900 per ounce and molybdenum flat at $20 per pound. And you'll see here that annual EBITDA would range from nearly $9 billion per annum at $3.50 copper, to $15 billion per annum at $5 copper. And our operating cash flows would range over these prices from $6 billion at $350 copper to $11 billion at $5 copper. And we show sensitivities to various commodities on the right and input costs. With our long-life reserves and large-scale production, we're well positioned from future -- to benefit from future metals intensive growth trends with prospects for increasing cash returns under our performance-based payout framework. Our capital expenditure plans are summarized on Slide 15. The capital expenditures totaled $2.7 billion, excluding the smelter in 2022. We'll note that this was lower than the $3.3 billion estimate we provided going into 2022, and that reflects lead times and our focus during the year to prioritize critical projects. The current forecast for 2023 totals $3.4 billion, and that's a slight change from our previous estimate of $3.3 billion for 2023. And capital expenditures for 2024 are currently forecast to approximate $3 billion as spending on the Grasberg projects reach completion. We always are very careful in managing our capital cost to maintain flexibility in response to market condition, while ensuring that our investments are sufficient to support a reliable long-term production profile. Returning to the financial policy that we began to implement in the second half of 2021, it's really centered on three priorities. The cornerstone of the financial policy is maintaining a strong balance sheet and liquidity. And that provides significant flexibility for the future. We've been executing on this performance-based payout. It provides for 50% of our free cash flow to be allocated to shareholder returns in the form of dividends and share purchases and the balance available to invest in our projects. Since commencing the performance-based payout policy in the second half of 2021, we've returned about 60% of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share purchases. And at the same time, we also further strengthened our balance sheet, providing capacity for funding new projects over time. We did not purchase shares in the second half of 2022 because of the significant change in market conditions and the resulting impact on cash flows in the second half of the year. The improved market conditions will drive increased free cash flow, which will boost shareholder returns, and our future discretionary share purchases will be dependent on our cash flow and overall market conditions. We believe the three priorities of balance sheet strength, allocating cash flows to a mix of shareholder returns, and organic growth will enhance long-term value of our business. In closing, I just want to reiterate our view about the positioning for the Company, a bright long-term future supported by our attractive portfolio of assets, supported by the fundamentals of the copper business and the positive outlook for the markets we serve. Our team is energized. We're motivated to continue building long-term value in our business and on executing our plans responsibly, safely and efficiently. And I want to thank you for your attention, and operator, we'll now open the call for questions. Emily, on the leaching run rate, the 200 million pound target that we've laid out, those -- we believe that that can be attained just from these operational changes that we're making. The heat retention, leaching in places that we weren't leaching previously, directing the solutions to places where we can enhance recoveries really from data analytics that we're getting that are helping us -- helping guide our operations every day. Those things we think we can get just operationally. The -- on top of that, this research and development that's going on with respect to additives, that could scale it larger. So, this 200 million pounds that we're talking about, we think that is really just bringing more of a light on our leach stockpiles and moving aggressively to -- over the last several years, the focus on the industry has been more on concentrating. And now we're putting focus back on these leach initiatives, and we've identified some things. I wouldn't say low-hanging fruit, but it's achievable things that we're doing, and we're already starting to see results. Richard, do you want me to take that? Orest, we're not -- I mean, there's pockets -- of course, in the residential markets there's pockets of weakness, but there are -- we're just continuing to see strong physical demand, we're selling everything that we can produce. And there's no ability for us to, at this point, produce more that customers are looking for. So, on balance, I'd say the physical market continues to be healthy, and we have -- most of our insights come from within the U.S. because we're a very significant part of the U.S. marketplace. And -- so generally, the market is continuing to be strong, and we're selling everything that we can produce. And if we could produce more, our customers would want it. The $1.3 billion -- go ahead. $3 billion to $4 billion is the limit. Yes, $3 billion to $4 billion is what we -- yes. Yes, there was some changes between Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ. And additionally, we've been getting higher gold recoveries than we had previously forecasted. And that's helping us as well. So, those are the main differences. I think you can look at -- I think you can look at the makeup of our costs. On that slide, we provide a makeup. And labor cost is something that's kind of stays with you. Materials and supplies, a component of that is commodity driven and a component of its services driven. The energy, I think, is more variable and things like sulfuric acid is more variable. So, you can look at that pie chart and get a feel for which ones have the ability to change, and we provide some sensitivities on things like currencies and diesel costs. Yes. Yes. And so, we've got to go through a permitting process on that as well. So, it's unlikely we'll have any material spending on it until a few years out. That will add moly as well, John -- Bagdad. John, on your question about -- sorry, Richard. I was just going to say your question about the molybdenum situation. We do have excess milling capacity at our Climax mine. And we've been operating at below capacity in recent years because of market conditions, but we have started to do a stripping campaign there that will allow us to expand production from Climax. Over time, it doesn't require a new concentrator or anything like that. So that's our first one -- and the incremental costs are attractive. So, we are doing that. And as Richard said, we've got -- we got a lot of projects in the background. But these are the ones that are strategic and that we're focused on. The leach technology is a near-term project. And Bagdad long term -- I mean, medium term and the Lone Star major expansion longer term. El Abra, we believe, will get done. It's a project that it's attractive and it will get done. It's a question of when. So, we don't have a good view yet on when that will go forward. But this investment in some infrastructure and water is going to give us some optionality to support an expansion. So, we've got all our people focused on these things and we have an enormous resource base like we were saying in the U.S. where we already have established operations and community support. So, we're in a really good position as we look forward as to what this world is going to need in terms of new copper supply. None of this can go quickly as you well know. Yes. So, in the last several days, we've been operating -- we've been operating at around that 350,000 level. Prior to that, we were closer to 400,000. We've really been operating at 10%, 15% lower just to deal with supplies. And so, we're watching that every day. And I'll let Richard comment on the community situation. But in terms of operations, we're continuing to operate, but we have limited our mill throughput just to deal with the limitations and the concerns about key supplies. Yes. Well, during COVID, we did have some impacts on our mining rates, and also suspended some milling operations at Morenci. And I'm speaking about the U.S. right now. And we started ramping back up in the U.S. during 2021, and that continued into 2022. And we have a situation where we currently have about something on the order of 1,300 job openings. And we've got typically 10,000 to 12,000 employees in the U.S. And so -- and we've seen a lot of turnover as well. And it's just been a very competitive marketplace for labor, as you've read about it, in the U.S. And we don't have that situation in Indonesia or in South America, but we do have competition in the U.S. with other sectors, and that's continued into 2023 and what's caused us to change our outlook somewhat. We could have in 2022, produced more, if we were fully staffed. And I believe that is the case again this year. And that's why we're making some progress on hires and we are conducting training and some of these workers that we're hiring now are new to the industry, and so we do have to go through training, and the experience level is not what it was five years ago. So, we're going through that process. I think it does have some implications to -- the ability to develop a mine in the U.S. is just the labor force. But we'll see what happens. You're starting to see some changes in payrolls and that sort of thing, and we'll see how this unfolds. But it is a factor in our U.S. mining output. This leaching initiative that we're pursuing is not labor-intensive, because it's already -- the material has already been mined. So, that's a real opportunity for us to execute on. We'll also be looking at the -- how the constitutional process advances this year. And it appears the financial package is moving forward and they're reaching some determination, looks as if that's progressing. But we also want to look at how this constitutional process unfolds as well. And in the meantime, we're maintaining our options by planning to move forward with the water infrastructure investments."

            "name": "Richard Adkerson",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Kathleen. Thank you all for joining us today. As Kathleen said, after my overview remarks, which will be brief, she will review our results for the quarter. It was a strong fourth quarter. The numbers speak for themselves. It reflects the performance of our global team, and I much appreciate everybody's hard work. I read one of you said this morning in a report, mining is a tough business, and it certainly is. Nobody knows that, I think, better than me. But what we've done and is reflected in our results for 2022 and particularly the fourth quarter, is remarkable. Most of you, who know our business and maybe all of you do, recognize the need to look at Freeport into two major segments. Our operations in Indonesia by PT Freeport Indonesia is characterized by very large volumes, very low cost because of the grades and the gold content, largest gold mine in the world is a byproduct. As you'll see in the fourth quarter, it operated as the world's second largest copper mine with a net unit cost of $0.06 a pound. Our business in Americas is quite different. We have among the largest mines in the world, the mines have low grades, there's much more material to be processed, to be mined and processed to recover the copper, and it's an operation that gets challenged by low copper prices and factors like inflation. But when you look at the results and what our team has done this year, it's been very positive. It's also characterized by having some large future brownfield expansion opportunities, which is particularly meaningful given the situation of the copper in the world. Indonesia, it was just rock-solid performance. We've been operating underground there for 40-plus years now. We've been investing in the current underground operations that we have been ramping up over the past three years to become the largest underground mining operations in the world for the past 25 years. It just reflects the long-term nature of our business. The last three years have really been notable. We completed mining the Grasberg open pit, which had been the bulk of our operations since the discovery of the ore body in the late 1980s. We completed mining that pit at the end of 2019. Then early in 2020, we faced COVID. And for years, this transition was viewed as a risk overlying Freeport's business. And it's just a major accomplishment that we've reached our targeted mining and metal production targets that is what's arguably the most complicated mine in the world. And it's all results of the hard work and accomplishments of our team there, very proud of them. The Americas business has done very well in meeting the challenges that we've had there, dealing with inflation, dealing with a period of low copper prices, we have issues that are challenged in terms of getting workers for our operations in the Americas. Our operation in Peru was facing a severe challenge with COVID that they manage very well. The political situation in Peru right now is very complicated. There are protests throughout the country. Our team is doing very well. We are continuing to manage housing, feeding our people and continuing our operations. We are slowing down a bit to make sure we have supplies for the long run, but we have support by our workforce and fundamental support for our business by the local community there because we've established such a great relationship with them. So we are -- as we look out now trying to predict short-term copper prices is very difficult. We actually don't even try to do it ourselves. We deal with short-term negative movements when they occur by having a strong balance sheet and a conservative financial policy. It's actually good to see right now that market sentiment going into 2024 is much improved over the end of -- going into the fourth quarter. But we are on the outlook for the well-known risks that the world faces today, and we're prepared to deal with it. We are a long-term business. And we -- everything we do is focused, not on the short run other than to protect ourselves by having a strong balance sheet, managing our business in the right way, but our success is going to be measured over the long run. And copper's long-run outlook is increasingly positive based on fundamentals of demand and supply. We committed to copper 20 years ago when we were a single asset company, the rationale for acquiring Phelps Dodge more than 15 years ago is being reinforced today by the combination of this really special mine we have in Indonesia and the global operations and growing operations that we have in the Americas. It was the right decision 20 years ago to focus on copper and is the right decision now. Kathleen? Thanks, Emily. With leaching, we're not constraining ourselves to conserve capital or anything else. We're -- we believe this is such a great opportunity for us that we are pursuing it as aggressively as we can, and we are pursuing it on a number of different fronts, some using outside vendors, some doing things on our own, some in joint ventures with companies. It's just such a great opportunity to add production at low capital cost and with low carbon. So, it's not something we're constraining. The other projects that we have, and Kathleen reviewed them, we have a series of major capital projects that are multiyear large capital requirements. And for those, we are working hard to prepare ourselves for them and doing work so that we can go forward. But we are going to wait until the uncertainties that we've been facing recently are -- become clearer. As I said, the current sentiment is much stronger than it was three months ago, but there's still a lot of overhang in the market, as you can see in the market today. So, we are waiting to see that our project in Chile is dependent on the direction the country goes in with this current consideration of its laws and its constitution. So, that is really going to be on hold until that becomes clear. So, we're not preparing any major change in the first part of 2023 versus what we did in 2022. Even looking back to 2022, you'll recall, I mentioned I think on more than one conference call that there was a disconnect between even then the physical world we were dealing with, with our customers and what the market was doing. So, it has been striking as to the strength of demand that we've had, we had no problem selling our production. We've actually -- there was a shortage of wire rod in the United States that was -- where we couldn't meet everything that was being produced. And then, with our copper concentrate customers, including China, people were buying all that we produced and actually wanting more. So, market sentiment is better now. And but our customers continue to be very positive. Well... No, I was just going to say, Chris, and Kathleen can talk about the details. When we announced the financial policy, as I looked out and I said, the likelihood is, cash is going to come in faster than we can spend it just because of the nature of our capital projects are long term. It takes a lot of time. This has happened before at Freeport. Two previous occasions in our history, we got down to zero net debt. This is setting aside the smelter because that's financed on its own. But, what this does is by having that cushion between where our debt is and our debt target is, it will allow us to readily be able to finance future construction projects. But it's just the way the cash flows in versus -- we don't feel any compulsion to spend money to get the debt up to that target. Well, I think... Well, while the numbers look simple, the mine planning is complicated. And we report the results of our mine planning quarterly. And what you're seeing there is some revisions in mine planning to optimize resource recovery. It wasn't any target. It's just the way that -- the way that the mineralization of these ore bodies fall out as we change future mine plans. And... And it's not a targeting it -- it's not a targeting exercise, Chris. I mean, we didn't do something to try to get more gold. It was just -- if we look at the orebody, we maximize the value. It's a dynamic process and report to you the results of that process, and that's what it is. Okay. And one thing that's -- one thing that's a real benefit of Freeport that we say a lot. I'm not sure if this is recognized as much as it ought to be. But, we operate every mine that we have an interest in. We have joint venture partners. But unlike other operations where those joint ventures are run as a standalone business, we operate globally through our operatorship rights. And that makes us really important customers of our suppliers. We're generally one of the very largest customers of people who provide our major supplies. And so, as those suppliers globally have been working to pass along their input cost, our global supply team working with our operations have been affected in mitigating certain of those costs. We've had some impact. But again, it's a real dynamic situation and -- you saw we came in below our quarter-ago estimate. Some costs are moderating, some are carrying over, but it's just an ongoing thing. And we give you the best outlook we have, and then we work hard to try to operate with as low a cost as we can. Yes. That's really the only alternative. Well, we're working on it right now, and we're structuring, so that we have the alternative of going forward with our current operations and maximizing those or undertaking a large-scale investment and new concentrator there. So, we're approaching it to give ourselves the alternatives of going in either of those directions. But we wanted to get started with that because it was going to be required one way or the other. It takes time to do it. But as I said, we -- in the past, we've been delaying that so -- we made the decision on the concentrator expansion. And in recent months, we've decided we need to go ahead with the permitting for the water, desal plant, so that -- because we're going to need it one way or the other. Well, no. And you know it's a good new story to have this large pipeline of future projects, and I personally believe the world is going to need that copper. Going to your last question first, there is no relationship between Kucing Liar and projects in the U.S. It doesn't bump out projects. It doesn't prioritize anything. It's something that fits right in. It will be financed by PT-FI out of cash flows from PT-FI. And it will support our volumes there through our current operating rights to 2041. We're talking with the government about extending those. There's opportunities for Kucing Liar beyond that. And we believe, although we haven't been engaged in drilling exercises in the Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ and who knows what else is down there because we really haven't fully drilled to explore future opportunities. Now, John, you know the thing about Grasberg, ever since we discovered it, it keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger. But that's on its own, there is no effect on what we're doing at Kucing Liar with what we do in the United States. So, we have the financial resources to do -- in the Americas, the United States and South America. So, the ones we've listed are the ones we believe are the largest, most significant executable projects initially. The Bagdad expansion is a straightforward doubling of mill capacity, and we've dealt with water issues and so forth and... Go ahead. No, go ahead. Yes. And I'm glad you asked the question because I wanted to elaborate on what I said about Peru in my opening comments. I think all of you know that the Cerro Verde milling complex is the largest in the industry, 400,000-plus per day capacity. The tailings dam will be one of the largest earthen dams ever constructed in the history of mankind, if not the largest. And what John is referring to is a number of years ago, we did as a community project invested in a freshwater system for Arequipa, the second largest city in Peru. And then, as we were developing the expansion of the concentrator and tailings dam, we shifted away from building a new dam on the river that runs just outside of the sea of Arequipa. We come in and we built a wastewater collection and treatment system. And with doing that, we got water for our concentrator and we markedly improved the ecology of the river, and that has been very positively received by downstream farmers and community itself. And that's really helped foster our positive relationship there. And our team there does overall good. Now, having said that, the situation in Peru is very complicated and nobody at this point can predict how it's going to unfold. The motions are very high. The government is reluctant to use extreme steps to deal with roadblocks and disruptions and this thing in the day-to-day evolution. And so we are faced with the problems that caused us to cut back on our production rates to conserve line and other inputs so that we could continue to operate. We have the ability to house workers on a temporary basis on site. Most of our workers live in the region of the city of Arequipa, and sometimes those roads have been blocked. So, we're prepared for it. Our team does a great job in managing things like this over time like COVID and -- but I just wanted to make the point that these concerns that people are raising are directed towards the issues with the government and not directed against us at Cerro Verde and our operations. And so far, we've been able to continue to operate. Yes. So, it's broader than mining. I mean, when I talk with people to business council, business around the table, it's a common theme you hear across many industries. And when all the COVID relief funds went out, that was a factor. I mean, face it, our work is hard work. And it's harder to drive a big haul truck than it is to drive an Amazon or UPS or FedEx truck. So, we compete with those. We pay our people strong living wages. We're giving people substantial increases this year. We invest in recreational facilities, try to deal with housing. It's an issue in Colorado with our molybdenum mines. You can imagine what it's like there. So, it's a big issue for us. And as a result, our mine rates aren't meeting what we would like for them to meet, and that affects not only current but future production, and it's a strategic challenge for us. But, it's not just us and it's not just the mining industry, but the mining industry because the nature of the work presents special problems. And if we -- what it opens up to us is unbelievable. I mean, we have -- Morenci the largest leaching operation in the world. It has been for years. And by enhancing the existing leaching operations using all these tools, data analytics and heat covers and supplements, it's really amazing. But then it opens up historical leach stacks and potentially places like Lone Star using leaching to replace or minimize concentrator investments. So, it's really exciting. It's beyond just this 200 pounds that we're targeting now. But with success, it's a great opportunity for us. And it's not a fracking deal like it was in oil and gas industry. It's not going to turn the dynamics of the supply situation upside down. But for a company like Freeport with the leaching operations that we have and the application with success to historical leach sites and future mine development, it's something that's really exciting. And the great thing about it is to see the excitement of our own guys and own team that's working on it. It's really gratifying. Yes. I had the chance for the first time to meet the President of Chile when I was at APAC in Bangkok, and we had a very long conversation in advance of his presentation and it was really positive. And he explained to me what he's facing, which I can appreciate, Kathleen met with him earlier. And so, like what's going on in a lot of different countries around the world, particularly when commodity prices go up, people see the opportunity to take financial benefits through royalties and taxes and use them to meet social needs. And it's just always a balancing situation. At one point, Chile built its whole economy on copper and was very successful. When I was talking with people in Indonesia, the Congo and other places, I would always point to Chile as an example of a country that to be successful by encouraging mining. Chile for a number of reasons, labor and now government situation is losing -- has lost and is losing competitive advantage that it once had. So, these government officials run on a platform of enhancing social programs and then they end up facing the reality of they go too far with that, what that does to their country in terms of its currency, in terms of its economic viability and investment and so forth. President of Chile understands that, and you can see that there has been a more positive tone of dealing with these issues. We're not a real leader in Chile, although we are in the global copper business. So, we participate with the government, with other companies there and the conversations that are going on and share our experiences that we've had in working globally on these kinds of issues. So, the current direction is clearly more positive than it was a year ago. The President is facing a low level of popularity now. And so, it's a question of facing reality for political leaders. And we certainly lived our -- based our share of those things. And as a mining company, you work hard to gain the trust of the politicians. If you do things the right way, you're sensitive to their issues. You don't try to take advantage every time you have a chance to take advantage. We've actually walked away from projects, because governments -- we didn't believe the deal the government was offering us was sustainable long-term deals. And that's proved out to be the case. So it's a complicated deal, big part of a business for the leader of a company. And you've got to -- as I said, listen, be responsible, and work to find middle ground so that it's a win-win deal and you're not taking advantage of anyone and you're representing your stakeholders. You're not letting somebody take advantage of you. And that's what Chile is going through. I believe that the reasonable compromise will be reached because it's in everybody's interest for that to happen. And you know, I can't let this call go by without telling you how personally pleased I am with our much improved relationship with the government in Indonesia, where we had a multiyear discussions, negotiations over our mining rights in our contract and so forth. It's just been remarkable what's happened in the last six months, I made three trips there. We had -- the President had an incredibly positive visit to our job site at the end of August, early September. He asked me to accompany his investment minister and Kathleen was there, too. We did a university road trip and then -- but the two of us went back for the B20 part of G20 and got to see the President and others and it's just the -- and then APAC and Bangkok. It's just a great feeling to feel that we're all altogether now working to -- for the benefit of all the stakeholders and having the success we're having on the ground at PT-FI. All right... All right. I was starting that. Thank you everybody for participating today. And you know we're always available for follow-up calls. You can call David initially and he can make arrangements to talk with Kathleen or me or whoever we need to bring into conversation. Thank you for your participation. It's great to have a quarter like this, and we're really excited about our future."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, President. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.\nKathleen Quirk: Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan conference call. Earlier this morning, we reported third quarter 2022 operating and financial results, and a copy of today\u2019s press release and slides are available on our website at fcx.com. Our call today is being broadcast live on the Internet and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has also been invited to listen to today\u2019s call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that today\u2019s press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. I\u2019d like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. On the call today with me are Richard Adkerson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Maree Robertson, our CFO, is on the line; Josh Olmsted, who heads our Americas operations is on the line; Mark Johnson, who heads our Indonesian business is on the line; Rick Coleman is on the line, who have helped us with the projects and construction; Cory Stevens is on the line, who is spearheading our engineering and technical services groups, including the leaching initiatives; and Mike Kendrick is on who runs our molybdenum business; we also have Steve Higgins, our Chief Administrative Officer. Richard is going to make a few opening remarks and then we will turn to our presentation, slide materials and go through that and then open up the call for questions. And so now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Richard for his opening comments.\nRichard Adkerson: Thank you, Kathleen and we really appreciate each of you joining our call today. I am just going to make brief comments about how our company is positioned in the current market and for what we believe will be a very bright future for the copper business as we go forward. As we talked about on our last call, it remains a world of two cities. The macroeconomic sentiment continues to be weak and you all see that in your everyday lives. On the other hand, the fundamental physical copper market is strikingly tight globally right now. The macroeconomic situation is driven by the strength of the U.S. dollar, the Fed and central banks tightening, concerns about China dealing with COVID in this property section and then the serious problems in Europe coming out of the Ukraine situation and how that\u2019s affecting energy prices and economic outlook. All those things are realities we have to face up with, but we continue to work to position our company to deal with these situations. We now have a very strong financial situation that allows us to do that effectively and we are increasingly confident about the outlook and position of the copper markets and where Freeport is positioned to take advantage of that and our confidence continues to grow. Global copper inventories remain at historical levels. You see production reports from producers across the globe reporting challenges in meeting their production targets and the industry is facing increasingly challenges in developing new supplies. In the current environment, stretch supply chains, production shortfalls are becoming commonplace and cost curves are rising. We, at Freeport, are realistic about the potential for weaker global GDP. We prepared our business and taken steps and have plans for other steps to take, depending on the near-term steps as what occurs. We have an old saying around Freeport. We don\u2019t ring our hands we roll up our sleeves. The positive thing is that new sources of copper demand are emerging now and there is widespread recognition that copper demand will be significantly benefited by the ongoing global electrification around the world, investments to reduce carbon, they are beginning to accelerate and this is going to occur more rapidly in the future and it\u2019s going to be a big impact on copper demand. To meet that demand, the energy transition will require a massive amount of copper and other steps to deal with it. Higher prices will be required to bring on new supplies, much higher prices than we have now, simply because the current price is not sufficient to incent new supply development on the scale that will be required to meet this increasing demand. I am real proud of our Freeport\u2019s global team. We are focused on executing our plans effectively and focused on managing what we can control and not getting distracted by things we cannot control. I want to particularly highlight our Grasberg team for the great results they achieved this quarter and the ongoing success our team is achieving in ramping up the large-scale, low-cost underground operations in Indonesia. Just 3 years ago, we were completing mining the open pit and what this team has achieved despite the challenges of COVID is truly remarkable. I was pleased to visit our site in Papua during this past quarter and had the pleasure, along with our team, of showcasing what we have accomplished during a visit by Indonesia\u2019s President, Joko Widodo. He was the first President of Indonesia to visit our job site since Suharto did in the early \u201870s when production there commenced. And it was truly a pleasure to be able to show him what we have accomplished what we are accomplishing in the underground and to point out our workforce there, where 98% of our employees are Papuans \u2013 are Indonesians and over 40% of Papuans. It\u2019s really noteworthy that he was there. And he expressed a lot of positive comments about it. For me, it was something that was really special since I have been going there for over three decades and to be able to review it with him. As a follow-up, he asked me to accompany his Minister of Investment on a roadshow type tour of 6 universities, 7 universities in Indonesia and they estimate there was 10,000 students and faculty at these sessions as well as it was streamlined to many more. That was a special time for me and for our company and it just illustrates the much improved partnership we have now with the government of Indonesia and the President and his Ministers. I just want to close by saying just to reemphasize how I believe we are well positioned at Freeport to be a global leader in the copper business. We have long life reserves, large scale global operations, established track record of managing responsibly the development and operation of among the largest mines in the world. We have got a great team that\u2019s been experienced and stuck together through all the things we faced. And so I am just very pleased about that. We are going to take steps to create value for this company over time. You will hear today about the exciting work we are doing with leaching technology that can add values in a low-cost carbon-friendly way. We have got large scale brownfield development projects ahead of us and we are going to use technology, continue to use technology to help us operate efficiently and create value. So with that, I am going to turn the call over to Kathleen, who will review the quarter and our outlook. And then I look forward to your questions.\nKathleen Quirk: Thank you, Richard and we will start on Slide 3 with a summary of the quarter\u2019s highlights. As you have seen, we achieved strong production and sales performance in the quarter. And as Richard mentioned, we are continuing our focus on effective execution of our plans in a challenging environment. Sales volumes for copper were 3% higher than last year\u2019s third quarter and 4% higher than our guidance going into the quarter. Our gold sales were above the year ago quarter by 19% and 20% above our July guidance and that reflects very strong performance at Grasberg during the quarter. From a cash cost standpoint, our consolidated average unit net cash cost were $1.75 in the quarter, they averaged $1.75 and that was about 5% above our estimates going into the quarter. As Richard referenced, cost pressures continue to be a significant issue for our operations and really across the global mining industry. In the current market, many of our input costs are above historical correlations to the copper price. We can\u2019t predict how long this dislocation will occur, but based on history, we typically see a high correlation of many of our input costs with the price of copper. As Richard mentioned, we are going to continue to focus in those areas of cost and efficiencies that we can control to help mitigate these cost increases. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $1.5 billion. This was net of $228 million reduction associated with copper sales that were provisionally priced at the end of June at $3.75 per pound, which remains subject to final settlement. The decline in copper prices during the quarter resulted in this negative adjustment. We have got a reconciliation of the EBITDA calculations on Page 31 of the slide deck. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $375 million. That excludes $0.02 in non-recurring gains that are detailed on Roman numeral Page 7 of our earnings release, so $375 million or $0.26 per share in the third quarter of adjusted net income. Operating cash flows of roughly $800 million in the quarter approximated our capital expenditures. Our capital spending during the quarter included $400 million for major projects, principally associated with our Grasberg underground projects and $200 million to advance construction on the Indonesian smelter. During the quarter, we continued opportunistic purchases of our public debt securities in open market. So far, in 2022, we have purchased approximately $1.1 billion of our notes at a discount to par, including $400 million in principal amount in the third quarter. The market conditions in recent months have provided a great opportunity for us to reduce our absolute debt levels at attractive prices and these purchases generate approximately $50 million per annum and interest cost savings. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet. We have got a large cash balance and significant liquidity. We ended the quarter with $1.3 billion in net debt, excluding the $800 million in net debt associated with the Indonesian smelter. That\u2019s well below our targeted net debt range of $3 billion to $4 billion. The authorization under our share purchase program remains at $3.2 billion. Since reaching our net debt target in the range of $3 billion to $4 billion in the middle of last year, we have used over 50% of our free cash flow for shareholder returns. That totaled $2.7 billion in share purchases and dividends over that period. We did not purchase shares since mid-July and that reflects our priorities on our balance sheet and our policy of using excess cash flows for shareholder returns and the timing of our future purchases will be dependent on our cash flows and overall market conditions. I want to point out that we recently published our updated Annual Climate Report that\u2019s available on our website. The report includes an update on our progress to improve our energy efficiency and integrate lower carbon alternatives into our operations and we are making great strides in that area. As Richard talked about and we talked about on our July call, we commented on the magnitude of the sharp decline in copper prices that we experienced in recent months. We benefit from having the balance sheet, the asset quality and experience to successfully manage the volume in uncertain market environment. And despite the recent weakness, we remain confident in our strategy centered on being foremost in copper. We are positive about the strong future fundamentals for copper and the strength of our assets and team to increase value for stakeholders. I will move to Slide 4, which is a graph of the year-to-date copper prices. We discussed on our last earnings call that the price move appeared to be anticipatory and financially driven by global macroeconomic conditions. This backdrop continues to be challenged by rising interest rates to tame inflation, concerns about Chinese economic growth and pressures in Europe associated with energy and geopolitical turmoil. We also indicated on our last call that markets remain strong, physical markets remain strong for copper. Our customers are reporting solid orders. Physical market was tight as evidenced by low levels of inventories. The situation is much the same today. Copper demand remains healthy. The industry continues to struggle to meet production targets and inventories remain low by historical levels. And as we look forward, we see copper demand that will benefit from the substantial requirements for metals required for electrification and the energy transition. This new demand is emerging and is driven by secular trends rather than economic cycles. The industry does not have a current pipeline to meet this demand and the recent weakness in copper prices will only make this development more difficult. Richard talked about we are realistic about the current macro conditions creating uncertainties, but we do have strong conviction about the long-term fundamentals for the copper markets and we expect to start seeing as we go through this period of increased demand from decarbonization, large gas supply-demand gaps emerging in the copper market. On Slide 5, we will turn to operations and you will see we present here a summary of our sales by region for the third quarter. And I\u2019ll just go through around the globe how our teams are doing. Starting with the U.S., our teams are focused on meeting our production targets safely and efficiently in overcoming challenges with limitations on available labor. We are ramping up the Safford mine, we are ramping up mining rates in the U.S. and we are aggressively pursuing leach production and continuing to study the possible expansion of the Bagdad mine in Northwest Arizona. Moving to South America. Our team at Cerro Verde in Peru continues to execute very effectively and produced at an average of over 400,000 tons of ore per day through the concentrator during the quarter. We faced some challenges during the quarter with byproduct molybdenum productions, and that impacted net unit cash cost. The team is doing great work to overcome this challenge as we look forward into the fourth quarter and beyond. And we\u2019re particularly proud of the exceptional work Cerro Verde does in the community, and that provides a sustainable model for the operations. At El Abra, we\u2019re continuing to optimize the existing operation, while we consider the larger expansion options in the future. Richard talked about Grasberg. We benefited from continued outstanding execution of the plans that allowed us to exceed our third quarter sales guidance with strong production results in the quarter, higher than forecast grades and an exceptional loading and shipping performance. The team loaded and shipped all of its third quarter production and available concentrate inventories during the period. We\u2019re also continuing to advance several projects at the site related to our mill work to add a new mill circuit, working on power infrastructure, we\u2019re continuing to advance the development of Kucing Liar and we\u2019re progressing with construction of the new smelter in Eastern Java, with a targeted completion of that project in 2024. We show unit costs at the bottom of the slide on a consolidated basis. As I mentioned, the costs in the third quarter were about 5% above our guidance. That mainly, on a consolidated basis, was associated with higher maintenance and the increased cost of supplies. Breaking it down by region, the U.S. was challenged with higher maintenance, supplies and labor. In South America, the variance to our expectations related to lower molybdenum by-product credits, and Grasberg was in line with our prior estimate, but they were offsetting variances, higher maintenance costs and supply costs were offset by stronger gold byproduct credits in the quarter. We have adjusted our annual cost guidance for 2022 to average $1.55 per pound. That compares with the previous estimate of $1.50 per pound and we\u2019ve got a reconciliation provided in the reference materials on Slide 22. On Slide 6, we wanted to highlight the progress at Grasberg that Richard referred to. Since reaching the targeted run rate in the second half of last year, the team at Grasberg has just done a great job demonstrating sustained large-scale production for several quarters now. We benefit from our industry-leading expertise in block caving and we\u2019re effectively managing the largest underground mining complex in the world. This is a major accomplishment, not only for our company, but in the history of the global mining industry. The resource at this site where we\u2019ve been operating for over 5 decades is significant. And with the success of this project, we\u2019re engaged in discussions regarding an extension of our operating rights beyond our current 2041 time frame. Richard talked about earlier we have got some pictures from the visit on the slide. We were honored in late August to host Indonesia\u2019s President at the Grasberg site. He toured the site extensively. He visited the former surface mine, had an in-depth tour of the underground and actively engaged with our team. He expressed great pride over what has been achieved technically and for the people of Papua in the country. It was really a happy time, special time for our entire team who\u2019s worked so hard over the years to make this project such a success. Another exciting area that we wanted to talk more about today on Slide 7 is our reach innovation initiatives. This is really focused in the Americas and our drive \u2013 we\u2019re capturing higher recoveries from leach stockpiles is gaining a lot of momentum. The economics of this opportunity are extremely attractive, very low capital intensity, low incremental operating costs, low carbon footprint, the lowest cost copper units in our Americas portfolio and the carbon intensity is low because the mining costs have already been incurred. And so essentially, we\u2019re doing here is extracting more copper from what historically would be considered waste. We are using new data analytics capabilities, and those are providing valuable information to guide us and prioritize our work on the highest value. We\u2019re continuing efforts to retain heat in the stockpile. We are moving forward to apply covers to our leach stockpiles because the retention of heat within the stockpiles is proving to enhance recoveries. We\u2019re also applying solutions to new areas that were not pursued historically. And we continue to test various additives that can further enhance recoveries. The progress to-date and early results are leading us to a target run rate of 200 million pounds by the end of next year, and that is at the top end of what we were prior thinking was 100 million to 200 million pounds. Success at this level would give us a road map to scale larger, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on. And we\u2019re really taking advantage of the long history we have in leaching significant stockpile material, the availability of new technologies that weren\u2019t available in the past and we\u2019re in a really strong position to lead the innovation in this area. We are managing this project and this initiative as we would a major project. And when we think about it, it\u2019s similar to a \u2013 has a similar production to what we would look at, at a project within the U.S. to add concentrator, but we don\u2019t have the capital associated with it and the operating costs are very low. So we\u2019re allocating a meaningful amount of significant expertise and technical resources and are aggressively pursuing this opportunity. I am going to move to Slide 8, which provides a 3-year outlook for our sales volumes. As you\u2019ll see, the 2022 volumes are very similar for copper, 4.2 billion pounds of copper for 2022. Gold sales are about 5% higher than our prior estimate for the year and that reflects the [indiscernible]. The sales mix for 2022 is roughly 35% coming from the U.S., 28% from South America and 37% from Grasberg. You\u2019ll note that our 2023 copper sales guidance have been adjusted. They are lower by about 150 million pounds from our prior estimate. That\u2019s roughly 3%. About half of this is a timing matter and does not represent a production shortfall. And this goes to a change in the commercial agreement of our arrangement with PT Smelting, the existing smelter in Indonesia, which we own a 40% interest in currently. That commercial arrangement is converting in 2023 from a purchase and sale agreement to a tolling agreement. And so PT-FI\u2019s production a portion will be deferred in inventory until final sale, but it does not represent a production shortfall. And in fact, PT-FI\u2019s production is going very well in line with expectations. The balance of this change is associated with updated mine plans in the Americas, and that includes the impact of anticipated lower grades than we were previously forecasting for 2023 at Cerro Verde. The rest of the guidance is pretty similar to what we were guiding to last quarter. And we are going to move to cash flows on Slide 9, and you\u2019ve seen these charts before. As a leading producer of copper, our earnings and cash flows have significant leverage to the price of copper. And we show modeled results for our EBITDA and cash flow at various prices and with the current cost structure of the business, which, as we\u2019ve talked about, has increased in recent quarters. We have shown a broad range of prices ranging from $3 per pound to $5 per pound. Just to recall \u2013 remind everyone in the first half of this year, prices averaged nearly $4.50 a pound, and we\u2019re approaching $5 a pound earlier in the year. We don\u2019t believe the current copper price is sustainable long-term given the cost structure of the industry, the need for new supply development in the future.  Modeled results using the average of \u201823 and \u201824 with the current volume and cost estimates, holding gold flat at $1,700 per ounce and molybdenum flat at $18 per pound, our annual EBITDA would range from roughly $6 billion per year at $3 copper to over $14 billion per year at $5 copper. And our operating cash flows net of all of our taxes would range from $4 billion per year, $3 copper, to $11 billion at $5 copper. So a lot of leverage to the price of copper. We show sensitivities to the various commodities on the right. As Richard talked about, we\u2019re prepared to manage in a low-price environment, while retaining optionality for what we believe will be a much more positive situation as we go forward. And we\u2019ve got this long-lived asset base that will prove to be valuable given the compelling fundamental outlook. Looking at our capital expenditures on Slide 10. You can see that we\u2019ve reduced the 2022 capital forecast by $400 million, drawn from $3.1 billion in our prior forecast to the $2.7 billion in the current forecast. About half of that has shifted into 2023. As we\u2019ve talked about all year, we\u2019ve been spending capital at a slower pace than our original plans. This has something to do with just the supply chain and labor and other things that have deferred the projects. But we\u2019re continuing to prioritize the critical projects. We\u2019re going to continue to evaluate opportunities as we look at our capital spending plans in the context of the market environment to defer spending where and when it makes sense. We have a lot of flexibility with our plans, and we benefit from the fact that the major investments required for the Grasberg transition are largely behind us. These amounts exclude capital for the Indonesian smelter project. That project is being funded with cash from a bond offering that we raised earlier in the year. There is some details on this project and its progress in the reference materials on Slides 27 and 28. Construction is moving forward. We\u2019re working to complete the project as early as we can. We currently expect it to complete it in 2024. And to date, we\u2019ve invested about $800 million in this project. We will talk for a minute about the financial policy and our strong balance sheet. Going to the balance sheet, it\u2019s really the cornerstone of our financial policy. The steps we\u2019ve taken in the past placed us in an exceptionally strong position, particularly in the context of the current market weakness. We don\u2019t have a need to raise new capital for the foreseeable future. And essentially, all of our debt is fixed rate. We continued, as I mentioned, our opportunistic purchases of debt during the quarter and have repurchased over $1 billion in senior notes at attractive prices. The slide here shows our net debt at $2.1 billion at the end of the third quarter. That includes $800 million for the smelter. So when we look at our net debt compared to our target, it\u2019s $1.3 billion, which is below our net debt target of $3 billion to $4 billion. And so that gives us some cushion. We\u2019ve also got a very much cash balance of $8.6 billion, and that continues to provide significant liquidity for us. As you\u2019ll see here, we have a very attractive debt maturity profile. We\u2019ve got easily manageable maturities. We\u2019ve taken steps to improve financial flexibility. We did some transactions to increase PT-FI\u2019s revolver. We did the same thing at Cerro Verde. And just this week, we completed the extension of our corporate revolver, which was previously planned to mature in \u201824. We\u2019ve extended that to 2027. In closing, we\u2019re showing a scorecard on Slide 12 of the shareholder returns, which has been substantial since reaching our net debt targets last year. Just as a reminder, the financial policy provides for the distribution of 50% of our free cash flow and shareholder returns with a net debt target in the range of $3 billion to $4 billion, excluding the smelter debt. We pay a base dividend and a variable dividend totaling $0.60 per share, and $0.30 per share of that is variable. We\u2019ve used $1.8 billion of our $5 billion in share purchase authorization. Our variable dividend is continuing through 2022, and our Board will have the opportunity to review future dividends depending on performance. As I mentioned, we\u2019ve returned $2.7 billion to shareholders. This represents over 50% of our free cash flow over this period, and we\u2019re well below our net debt targets. As I mentioned, we did not purchase shares since July \u201822, and that reflects just the priorities on the balance sheet, the impact of the sharp decline in copper prices on our cash flows. We\u2019re going to continue to prioritize our balance sheet. We believe that maintaining the balance sheet strength in various market conditions is really important in our ability as we look forward to drive long-term returns for our shareholders. We\u2019re focused on long-term value, focused on execution, doing this responsibly, safely, efficiently. In the near-term, with respect to growth projects, we\u2019re going to continue to define our future options, but expect to defer new major investment decisions in the current market environment. We\u2019re convinced the world is going to need our projects in the future, and prices will need to move higher to incentivize the new project development. Richard talked about the pipeline of options we have. We\u2019ve got a lot of flexibility in terms of the timing of development of these options, particularly the expansive options we have for development of new supply in the U.S. In closing, we\u2019re optimistic about the value of our assets, the strength of our team, the fundamentals of the copper business and the future prospects for the markets we serve. I will stop there and we will \u2013 operator, we will open up the call for questions. Thanks, everyone, for your attention, and we look forward to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Emily Chieng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nEmily Chieng: Good morning, Richard and Kathleen. And thanks for taking the time this morning. My question is just around the leaching technology. And understandably, it\u2019s a low CapEx opportunity there to continue to bring production growth. So I wanted to understand the guidance that you have of 200 million pounds per annum by year-end 2023. That\u2019s the run rate that you\u2019ve targeted. Could you perhaps share what volumes you are seeing from leaching activities today? And how should we be thinking about ramp profile to get there? Thank you.\nKathleen Quirk: Thanks, Emily. We have experienced some positive, and that\u2019s what\u2019s given us more confidence to get to this run rate. We have experienced some improved recoveries, particularly at Morenci, where that\u2019s been the start of this focus was at Morenci. That has offset the improvements that we\u2019ve had in leach production during 2022, has offset some shortfalls we had in 2022 associated with lower placements as we struggle through labor situation with mining rates. But in terms of the actual benefits to date, we are starting to see those. So you\u2019re talking about, by the end of next year, getting to 50 million pounds per quarter on a run rate basis. We\u2019re already probably third of the way there in terms of what we\u2019re seeing now. But what we\u2019ve got to do is not only see the improvements in recovery, but get the material placed. And that\u2019s been the challenge in 2022 is getting additional material placed to meet our base production. But the leach initiative has helped us offset some of these shortfalls in other areas.\nEmily Chieng: Great. Thanks, Kathleen. If I could squeeze one more just on the Bagdad expansion. It sounds like that\u2019s been at least pushed into 2024?\nKathleen Quirk: Well, we\u2019re completing the feasibility study. We expect to complete the feasibility study in the first half of next year. And so we will have the opportunity at that point to look at the situation, look at the availability of labor, look at the inflationary environment that we\u2019re in, in terms of executing a project in the environment and look at the overall market conditions. So what we\u2019re doing now is really getting to a point where we can make a decision and have the project feasibility ready to go so that we will have optionality of when to start it. But I think it\u2019s fair to say if we wouldn\u2019t pull the trigger today to start. We need to see some improvements in just the overall availability of labor, need to see some improvements in just the tightness that\u2019s going on in supply chains and the tough execution environment for construction projects and just the overall copper market. But these are options that we have. And so we don\u2019t have any kind of time line to start it. We want to start it when it makes sense when the market needs it, and so we have that flexibility within the portfolio to do that. But we\u2019re continuing the feasibility study so that we can be in that position next year.\nEmily Chieng: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Chris LaFemina with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nChris LaFemina: Hi, thanks, operator. Hi, Kathleen. Hi, Richard. Thank you for taking my question. So my question relates to some of the operational and financial flexibility that you have. So if you think back to early 2016, you had $20 billion of debt, very little cash out to issue equity, sold assets, not in a great position at that time to weather the storm of difficult markets. Whereas today, you have low net debt, you have high cash, your net debt is well below your target range and you have multiple levers that you can pull in the event that macro conditions reconvert this. So obviously, the first lever, which looks like you\u2019re pulling already, is kind of suspending the buyback until things improve. But you still have a couple of billion dollars of kind of leeway on the balance sheet before you get into your net debt target range. Let\u2019s assume that commodity markets get worse, and we\u2019re kind of stress testing the business and you\u2019re burning cash for the next kind of 12 months based on your current operational and spending plans. When you get into that targeted net debt range, what are the levers that you can pull next? Are there kind of CapEx reductions that you can make? Are there mines that you\u2019ll take offline? I mean, the cost inflation is kind of prominent in the industry, and copper price isn\u2019t really doing much. So eventually, I would assume that some of these mines become loss-making. So what are the levers that you can pull over time in the event that market conditions weaken further? And again, you probably have 12 months of leeway before you need to consider that. But where do you look next to kind of protect the balance sheet in the business?\nKathleen Quirk: Richard, I\u2019ll take that. And you can add to it. Or you\u2019d like to go first?\nRichard Adkerson: No. No, Kathleen, go ahead.\nKathleen Quirk: Yes. Chris, historically, what we\u2019ve done, and we\u2019ve got a really, really experienced team at this. Historically, what we\u2019ve done is look at each mine individually and looked at opportunities to reduce cost, to keep mine\u2019s cash flow positive during weak environments. And what\u2019s different right now, and I don\u2019t \u2013 if we do get into a recession, I think that we\u2019re going to start to see some of these historical correlations come more in line. But right now, we\u2019ve got the copper prices that have declined significantly, but input costs have not at this point. I think that if we do get into a really tough situation, our cost situation may get some risk. But in any case, what we do is we go through each mine, look at the operating plans, determine how we can optimize those operating plans. What it tends to mean is that we tend to look at where can we cut back on the mining rate to get to a better cash flow situation. We did that in 2020. We\u2019ve certainly done it \u201808, \u201809. We did it in \u201815, \u201816. We\u2019ve done it multiple times. So we do \u2013 if we get into the situation, where it is \u2013 we\u2019ve got big surpluses building in copper, the world doesn\u2019t need our copper, we certainly have the playbook on how to address that. The difference now is that the world does seem to need our copper. So the inventories are very tight. We\u2019ve been recovering from the 2020 downturn where we took down a lot of production, took down a lot of mining rates and we\u2019re ramping back up. And it takes a long time to get that flywheel going. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be very rash to cut mine rates and do what we need to do, unless it\u2019s a very difficult situation. Now what\u2019s different now than it was in 2020 is Grasberg is doing so well. And the match of having our Grasberg mine it really does provide very strong results, one of the lowest cost mines in the world. And so that \u2013 having that line up and running and doing so well is a benefit. We\u2019ve also got a very different balance sheet than we\u2019ve had historically. But we\u2019re going to be smart about how we look at this. We\u2019re not going to produce at a loss. If the world needs our copper, it needs to be \u2013 we need to have a margin. So we\u2019re going to do what we need to do, the levers that we have to pull are the same levers that we\u2019ve had in the past, big reductions in CapEx probably the first thing. And then we will start looking mine by mine on how to change the operating plans. But the difference, again, I just want to emphasize, you look at the forecast for this decarbonization and the world appears to need more copper rather than less and that copper demand is not [indiscernible] to these economic movements. So we are agile, we are nimble, we will do what we have to do, but I think it is different now than it has been in the past.\nRichard Adkerson: Thanks. No question about that. I mean, 2016 was a crisis for our company. We\u2019re not anywhere near crisis now. And since then, we\u2019ve had 2 major accomplishments that\u2019s de-risked our business significantly. One was the 2018 agreement that we reached with the government to stabilize the situation we had in years about the structure of our taxes, royalties and operating rights. And now we\u2019ve had 4 years of operating under that and it\u2019s going very well as you can see by presence visit, etcetera. And then as Kathleen mentioned, de-risking Grasberg by ramping up the underground and being so effective in sustaining the rates there. We\u2019re going to be able to do that by continuing to operate effectively. We\u2019ve got this Kucing Liar ore body that we\u2019re developing that\u2019s an add-on to give us stability. And so we\u2019re back to the strategy that we\u2019ve always had, Grasberg generates cash in any environment, it can fund our G&A and then we challenge each of our other mines to manage their business to be at least breakeven on a cash basis.\nChris LaFemina: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Alex Hacking with Citi. Please go ahead.\nAlex Hacking: Yes. Thanks, Richard and Kathleen. Just a quick clarification on the leaching. If you are successful in getting to that 200 million pound rate by the end of next year, should we be then thinking about that adding on to the existing 4.2 billion pound guidance for 2024? Thank you.\nKathleen Quirk: Yes.\nRichard Adkerson: We will give you \u2013 definitely. I mean, the possibilities here are really exciting. And we don\u2019t want to get way out ahead of ourselves because it\u2019s still in the development mode. But with a sizable leaching operations we have already in place throughout our company, the ability to use this technology to add volumes is really exciting and could be meaningful. And then beyond that, we have historical lead stacks and conceivably using this technology to replace concentrated investments with some of our sulfide ore bodies. So it\u2019s really something. We\u2019re not \u2013 we\u2019re using a number of different approaches, some proprietary, some in partnership with others, and we will give you a report every quarter on how we\u2019re progressing with it and how we see it affecting our future.\nAlex Hacking: Okay, thanks.\nKathleen Quirk: Yes, we\u2019ve got about third of that included in our numbers, Alex. And so there is certainly upside. And our team, we want to get to this initial target, but our team believes that with success there, we can scale it further. So for us, this is \u2013 in the near-term, this is an area with low-cost units to our Americas business and particularly in the U.S.\nAlex Hacking: Okay, thanks. That\u2019s clear. But one-third of it is already in the guidance. And then just on the cost side, I mean, your tone sounds like you\u2019re not really seeing any cost alleviation yet. We have seen FX sort of moving in the right direction for you. Maybe headline energy prices come off a little bit, freight come off a little bit. How are you thinking about the cost environment as you head into 2023? Thank you very much.\nKathleen Quirk: Well, we were encouraged in the third quarter our costs were pretty close in line with what we had forecast going into the quarter and sequentially down [ph] for the quarter. With the exception of coal, we have had very, very high oil prices in Indonesia, which continue to remain at way above historical levels. So some of the headline, commodity prices have come down, and we\u2019re encouraged by that. An area that we are seeing increases has come through is more non-commodity \u2013 non-direct commodity, more indirect, where we are seeing the parts and equipment and other supplies that we purchased come in at higher cost with recession potential, that will give us some leverage to push back on some of these things. So, the headline numbers, we have seen some relief in. But there are some other underlying areas where we are continuing to see price increases being passed through to us that we are continuing to manage as best we can. You are right about the currencies. That benefits us in South America, Indonesia. And going into the quarter in terms of our guidance, you can see Cerro Verde wasn\u2019t that much different than our guidance. The main thing at Cerro Verde was the Mali issue that we had.  But in the U.S., we don\u2019t get the benefit of the currencies. So, as we look into 2023, at least right now for our forecast purposes, we are projecting what it is now. So, hopefully, if the markets are to turn weaker, we will have some better ability to cost down. But right now, for forecasting purposes, we have essentially included what we \u2013 what the current market environment is.\nAlex Hacking: Okay, thank you. Best of luck.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Matthew Murphy with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Murphy: Hi. I am wondering if you have any thoughts you can offer on what might lay ahead on the legislative agenda in the U.S. for the mining sector. There has been lots of talk on critical minerals and just a few mummers on permitting changes or debate around the Mining Act. So, I am just wondering if there is any sort of big opportunities or threats out there in what may lay ahead.\nRichard Adkerson: Well, I mean it\u2019s going to continue to be a matter of discussion. But the practicality is affecting our business are that \u2013 just a couple of facts, I think most of you know this. But we own virtually all of the lands and see where we have mining operations. So, we don\u2019t really pay royalties in the U.S. There were some impacts of inflation reduction acts in terms of alternative minimum tax, and we are still sorting through those. But there is a favorable Federal tax rate. We have net operating loss carry-forwards from our oil and gas deal. We have \u2013 in our case, we have great relationships with the states which have the principal regulatory authority over our mining business and expansions, great community support, where we operate, including the native American groups who want us to invest in hiring their people and working together. So, there will be a lot of lip service doing this. We are not counting on any big government-based type incentives for us in the future. We hope people get more reasonable in progressing permitting processes by investing and having resources available to deal with things effectively. But we continue to deal with the fact that politics are shorter run than our business is. And we just have to see.\nMatthew Murphy: Okay. Thanks Richard.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Orest Wowkodaw with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nOrest Wowkodaw: Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. Obviously, we are hearing a lot out there about slowing demand, particularly in regions like Europe. Are you seeing any evidence of that from your customers? Like are any customers scaling back orders at all?\nRichard Adkerson: No. In fact in Europe, you saw some of the recent articles on premiums that are being suggested at very high levels. The inventories are low, there is the production out of Russia is a complicating issue. It\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s something that the margin \u2013 Freeport produces more copper than Russia does. But that\u2019s a factor. But backwardation is strong. It\u2019s just striking to see that the price of copper dropped $0.70 from a quarter a year ago and yet the day-to-day business that we have is one where customers are really fighting to get product. We had something \u2013 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever happened as Kathleen or Mark Johnson is on the call, but we actually emptied all of our concentrate barns at Grasberg. I mean, they were empty. Generally, we have operational issues with the shallow seas there getting production out. So, it\u2019s just striking how negative the financial markets are about this industry and yet the fiscal market is so tight. It\u2019s something that we haven\u2019t seen. Now the reality is, and Kathleen mentioned that, is this historical correlation between our input costs and copper prices is disrupted right now. I think it will come back into a more traditional relationship in the future, but it\u2019s not now. But \u2013 we just don\u2019t see any \u2013 we certainly have no problem selling copper. In fact, we have problems meeting demand for \u2013 sometimes it\u2019s the rod market in the U.S. is disrupted. And so there is a shortage of copper rod in the U.S., but it\u2019s a real striking correlation right now.\nOrest Wowkodaw: That\u2019s great to hear. Thank you, Richard.\nRichard Adkerson: Yes. I just \u2013 I don\u2019t have any basis for predicting what\u2019s going to happen in the near-term. But if this market turns, it\u2019s going to turn, it\u2019s going to turn with a vengeance. I am not predicting that, I am just saying if.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nCarlos De Alba: Yes. Good morning. Hi Rich. Hi Kathleen. Thank you for taking my question. I would like to, if you could possibly discuss \u2013 thanks Rick. What is the outlook for cash taxes in the quarter? It seems that, that was still an important drag of cash. You gave the guidance for the fourth quarter for the income tax rate, but any comments on the cash front would be really useful. And \u2013 yes.\nRichard Adkerson: Well, let\u2019s just go ahead and answer that. We have the issue. Taxes we pay are based on our foreign operations, and particularly like in Indonesia, taxes we pay in any given year is based on the taxes we paid in the preceding year. So, when you have a situation like we have had this year where the preceding year was a lot stronger financially, we are paying higher cash taxes this year. Next year, it could well reverse. But our tax situation is stabilized. We are watching carefully what\u2019s going on in Chile, but that\u2019s more of an impact on our future development plans. But we have stabilized taxes in Indonesia and no question about the continuation of that. And just in doing financial analysis, you got to take into account this timing difference when taxes are incurred and when they are actually paid. And if you want details on that, call David Joint, and he can help you walk through those.\nCarlos De Alba: Perfect. Thanks. And if I may squeeze just one more. In terms of the negotiations that you have started with the Indonesian Government to potentially extend the current agreement beyond 2041, I still \u2013 I presume we are still early on. But any color that you can provide there, how those are going? And when would be the earliest that you could get a resolution on that?\nRichard Adkerson: So, we have had early discussions. And my sense is there is a recognition that it\u2019s in all parties mutual interest to find a resolution for this. It would make no sense for any stakeholder for us to run this operation with a drop dead date of 2041. There is resources already identified beyond that. And for a number of years, because of all the protracted discussions we had about our contract of work in [indiscernible]. We really haven\u2019t done delineation drilling to really understand what happens to these ore bodies at depth. And so the discussions are early on. There are some complications that we and the government will have to deal with, with the existing regulations and so forth. So, it\u2019s not something we can say that there is anything other than early conversations. But I have been pleased with the tone of those conversations. And now we are starting the hard work of saying, how do you get this done in a mutually acceptable way.\nKathleen Quirk: Carl, I think one of the things that\u2019s a real positive, and we talked about the 2018 agreement earlier, but the fact now that the government through MIND ID owns 51% of PT-FI has increased the knowledge of this ore body and the recognition that it takes a very long time to identify and develop new sources of production. And so there is better recognition that we need to know sooner \u2013 earlier than 5 years before the expiration to be able to maximize the values. And so I think that\u2019s a real positive that recognition that the long-term nature of this business and how it will benefit from having additional exploration, development over the next 10 years instead of wait until the end until it\u2019s too late. So, that\u2019s a real positive of the 2018 agreement and alignment that we have with the government.\nCarlos De Alba: Alright. Great. Thank you very much Kathleen and Richard.\nRichard Adkerson: Yes. That\u2019s a good point.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nMichael Dudas: Hi Kathleen and Richard.\nKathleen Quirk: Hi Michael.\nMichael Dudas: Yes. Good morning. So, looking back towards, say, maybe pre-pandemic levels, and if you are analyzing you are doing a feasibility say, like you are doing for Bagdad or any other type of project, what do you estimate the increase in absolute dollar capital cost would be for a certain run in the mill or whatever type of project you have? And what do you think those operating costs would fall through higher? And the other aspect is, as you analyze risk rate adjusted return or return expectations, have you changed them given where interest rate levels are and some of the political aspects most \u2013 whether it\u2019s U.S. or in South America?\nRichard Adkerson: Michael, these projects are so different. You can\u2019t set them in, and I know a lot of people who follow the industry at a high level are always trying to come up with some things like incentive prices and other things that fit. But every one of these projects are just so different. And there are different factors. We will factor in the \u2013 as we conduct this feasibility study at Bagdad and begin \u2013 and the continued discussions with our Board, we will factor in whatever the current price outlook is for capital and operating costs, even though we don\u2019t focus in on a particular copper price, but what does scenario copper prices look like and how does it fit into our overall portfolio. One thing that\u2019s come out of this \u2013 Kathleen made references to it a couple of times. But one thing that\u2019s come out of the pandemic is labor issues. And that\u2019s \u2013 as I talk with people, the business roundtable, business counsel, it cuts across industries, but it certainly affects our industry. And Bagdad is a very remote location. And we have got to make some investments to attract people to come in and develop a sustainable labor force there. But it\u2019s true in our other operations, not so much overseas. But in the U.S., it\u2019s a real issue, and that\u2019s a factor to consider in terms of committing capital. And we have got a whole long future of potential capital projects in the U.S. And there are a lot of, in our view, advantages for Freeport in having that. There is \u2013 I mentioned the royalty situation, the great community support we have, the support from the travel groups in the long history that we have worked, invested so hard to have those positive relationships. And so we just have to pull them in. I guess my point is it\u2019s not something you can really generalize about, but you have to dig into each of these projects and thoroughly understand how costs, other factors figure into it. So, we got Bagdad. We have got this Lone Star project, it lies ahead in our future. That\u2019s great. El Abra is going to be a great project eventually. So, I wish I could give you some simplified answers for that. But\u2026\nKathleen Quirk: But there is clearly a mismatch, Michael, between current cost of a capital project and where the current copper price is. And that\u2019s what\u2019s guiding some of our thinking around timing of Bagdad is it\u2019s not something we have to do now. Let\u2019s wait to see how some of this unfolds and not try to force a project in the kind of environment we are in, where the availability of people and equipment is tight. So, this is really a project of bringing copper forward. If we don\u2019t produce it now, we will produce it later. But we wanted the capital part of this project is important because you don\u2019t want to be building a project in an inflationary environment when you wait to use it, it could be a different story. We can\u2019t \u2013 as Richard was saying, we can\u2019t predict exact timing, but we know we can be more efficient about doing a project in a different environment than where we sit today in the U.S.\nMichael Dudas: You just certainly highlighted the fact that the hurdle for the industry is much higher and certainly it\u2019s going to exacerbate whatever supply/demand gap you anticipate going forward because of what you just enumerated. So, I appreciate those thoughts. Thank you.\nRichard Adkerson: Well, that is a real point. I mean this industry faced supply challenges before this current inflationary environment we have, those had to do \u2013 when I look back on the almost 20 years now I have been CEO, you have geology factors where today\u2019s opportunities for supply expansion just are much less attractive than they were 20 years ago. And then you got the geopolitical factors that crop up in different places around the world. And the fact that so many new deposits are underground, etcetera, etcetera, but now this current situation we are going through right now with the uncertainties about the relationship between input costs and prices, about the availability of material, supply and supply chain issues, about labor issues, particularly in the U.S., all those things are just adding to the supply barriers for the industry. And yet, we have this new era of demand that\u2019s coming to play. And absent some just global calamity on whatever basis it is. I am just so increasingly confident about what the outlook for the commodity is going to be and just how strongly our company is positioned to benefit from that outlook. And that\u2019s what we want to preserve. That\u2019s why we are going to be conservative about spending capital, about financial policy, because if anything this company has seen the damage that can be occurred if you don\u2019t approach it in a commodity environment like we have or an industry like we have on a conservative solid way. And so that\u2019s what you hear over and over as we talk about how we are dealing with the current environment and positioning ourselves for a positive future.\nMichael Dudas: Thank you, Richard. Thank you, Kathleen.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Martin Malloy with Johnson Rice. Please go ahead.\nMartin Malloy: Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Assuming that the current copper pricing environment and financing environment continues here, from an industry standpoint, when do you think it will start to impact in terms of the deferment of projects, etcetera, the industry supply?\nRichard Adkerson: Well, the current environment is adding to it. But clearly, the uncertainties that emerged over this past year plus time in Latin America, 40% of the world\u2019s copper comes from Chile and Peru. And with what went on in their most recent presidential elections, the uncertainties that came out from that and things continue to change in Peru, the government has been in turmoil. I mean the number of ministers that have gone through this administration is just striking. And then Chile had the situation where there was a negative vote on the proposed constitutional amendment, which changed the targets there. And you can see what\u2019s happening to Greenfield projects being delayed in the United States, even though there seems to be lip service saying that the world needs copper, but that\u2019s not changing so much for Greenfield projects here in Africa, South Africa [ph]. So, I mean it\u2019s just a world of where all of this is happening. We do have an industry where there is two or three projects that have been in the works for many years now, they are going to come on stream shortly. But when you get past those, you just see everything is dried up and you don\u2019t see companies talking about having \u2013 you will hear more about like you are hearing from Freeport. We are being conservative about Bagdad. We will be conservative about Sierrita, about El Abra, conservative about our opportunities in Lone Star. And the surpluses that were predicted 2 years or 3 years ago are being downgraded as companies downgrade their current production estimates. So, it\u2019s going to happen quickly in the next 3 years and could be shorter.\nMartin Malloy: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of\u2026\nRichard Adkerson: I just see some real similarities to what we have seen in the crude oil business for years of underinvestment, and then all of a sudden, something happens and now the world had a crisis for \u2013 in the oil industry.\nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of Brian MacArthur with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nBrian MacArthur: Hi. Good morning.\nRichard Adkerson: Good morning Brian.\nBrian MacArthur: Good morning. Most of my question has been answered. But can I just ask, El Abra had a very good quarter, 60 million pounds, that\u2019s probably the best in like years. Is that sustainable now, or was something different happening this quarter there?\nKathleen Quirk: No. I mean we have been flagging that we cut El Abra\u2019s stacking rate during 2020 and have been ramping back up to get an increase. And so we have been flagging the \u2013 and we are moving to a new leach pad there. So, that\u2019s in line with what we have been guiding to.\nBrian MacArthur: So, we are back. We are now on that new steady run rate of 240 million pounds, 250 million pounds a year?\nKathleen Quirk: Right.\nRichard Adkerson: Yes. You touched on an important point. And we certainly saw this with crisis steps we took years ago in 2016, and this sort of ties into the question about what are you going to do with some of these lower-grade deposits if you make decisions about mine rates, they have long-term consequences. It takes a while if you cut back stacking rates on some of these mines and that\u2019s not a production impact just for this year, but extends for years in the future. So, as we take steps to build it back up, then that\u2019s going to be incremental over a period of time. And so I just keep harping the people who try \u2013 talking about our business, it\u2019s a long, long-term business. And that just comes to play in almost everything we do.\nBrian MacArthur: Great. Thank you. Now I know it was coming back up. It just was just sort of a pretty big jump all of a sudden. So, I just was curious whether everything has been done there to go to that new rate. So, thank you very much.\nKathleen Quirk: Yes.\nEnd of Q&A:\nRichard Adkerson: Okay. Thanks Brian. Thanks everybody. We really appreciate you being on the call and encourage you to follow-up if you have further questions. And we look forward to reporting on our company and our industry in the future. So, thanks for joining us.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kathleen Quirk",
            "content": "Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan conference call. Earlier this morning, we reported third quarter 2022 operating and financial results, and a copy of today's press release and slides are available on our website at fcx.com. Our call today is being broadcast live on the Internet and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has also been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, I'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. I'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. On the call today with me are Richard Adkerson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Maree Robertson, our CFO, is on the line; Josh Olmsted, who heads our Americas operations is on the line; Mark Johnson, who heads our Indonesian business is on the line; Rick Coleman is on the line, who have helped us with the projects and construction; Cory Stevens is on the line, who is spearheading our engineering and technical services groups, including the leaching initiatives; and Mike Kendrick is on who runs our molybdenum business; we also have Steve Higgins, our Chief Administrative Officer. Richard is going to make a few opening remarks and then we will turn to our presentation, slide materials and go through that and then open up the call for questions. And so now I'd like to turn the call over to Richard for his opening comments. Thank you, Richard and we will start on Slide 3 with a summary of the quarter's highlights. As you have seen, we achieved strong production and sales performance in the quarter. And as Richard mentioned, we are continuing our focus on effective execution of our plans in a challenging environment. Sales volumes for copper were 3% higher than last year's third quarter and 4% higher than our guidance going into the quarter. Our gold sales were above the year ago quarter by 19% and 20% above our July guidance and that reflects very strong performance at Grasberg during the quarter. From a cash cost standpoint, our consolidated average unit net cash cost were $1.75 in the quarter, they averaged $1.75 and that was about 5% above our estimates going into the quarter. As Richard referenced, cost pressures continue to be a significant issue for our operations and really across the global mining industry. In the current market, many of our input costs are above historical correlations to the copper price. We can't predict how long this dislocation will occur, but based on history, we typically see a high correlation of many of our input costs with the price of copper. As Richard mentioned, we are going to continue to focus in those areas of cost and efficiencies that we can control to help mitigate these cost increases. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $1.5 billion. This was net of $228 million reduction associated with copper sales that were provisionally priced at the end of June at $3.75 per pound, which remains subject to final settlement. The decline in copper prices during the quarter resulted in this negative adjustment. We have got a reconciliation of the EBITDA calculations on Page 31 of the slide deck. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $375 million. That excludes $0.02 in non-recurring gains that are detailed on Roman numeral Page 7 of our earnings release, so $375 million or $0.26 per share in the third quarter of adjusted net income. Operating cash flows of roughly $800 million in the quarter approximated our capital expenditures. Our capital spending during the quarter included $400 million for major projects, principally associated with our Grasberg underground projects and $200 million to advance construction on the Indonesian smelter. During the quarter, we continued opportunistic purchases of our public debt securities in open market. So far, in 2022, we have purchased approximately $1.1 billion of our notes at a discount to par, including $400 million in principal amount in the third quarter. The market conditions in recent months have provided a great opportunity for us to reduce our absolute debt levels at attractive prices and these purchases generate approximately $50 million per annum and interest cost savings. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet. We have got a large cash balance and significant liquidity. We ended the quarter with $1.3 billion in net debt, excluding the $800 million in net debt associated with the Indonesian smelter. That's well below our targeted net debt range of $3 billion to $4 billion. The authorization under our share purchase program remains at $3.2 billion. Since reaching our net debt target in the range of $3 billion to $4 billion in the middle of last year, we have used over 50% of our free cash flow for shareholder returns. That totaled $2.7 billion in share purchases and dividends over that period. We did not purchase shares since mid-July and that reflects our priorities on our balance sheet and our policy of using excess cash flows for shareholder returns and the timing of our future purchases will be dependent on our cash flows and overall market conditions. I want to point out that we recently published our updated Annual Climate Report that's available on our website. The report includes an update on our progress to improve our energy efficiency and integrate lower carbon alternatives into our operations and we are making great strides in that area. As Richard talked about and we talked about on our July call, we commented on the magnitude of the sharp decline in copper prices that we experienced in recent months. We benefit from having the balance sheet, the asset quality and experience to successfully manage the volume in uncertain market environment. And despite the recent weakness, we remain confident in our strategy centered on being foremost in copper. We are positive about the strong future fundamentals for copper and the strength of our assets and team to increase value for stakeholders. I will move to Slide 4, which is a graph of the year-to-date copper prices. We discussed on our last earnings call that the price move appeared to be anticipatory and financially driven by global macroeconomic conditions. This backdrop continues to be challenged by rising interest rates to tame inflation, concerns about Chinese economic growth and pressures in Europe associated with energy and geopolitical turmoil. We also indicated on our last call that markets remain strong, physical markets remain strong for copper. Our customers are reporting solid orders. Physical market was tight as evidenced by low levels of inventories. The situation is much the same today. Copper demand remains healthy. The industry continues to struggle to meet production targets and inventories remain low by historical levels. And as we look forward, we see copper demand that will benefit from the substantial requirements for metals required for electrification and the energy transition. This new demand is emerging and is driven by secular trends rather than economic cycles. The industry does not have a current pipeline to meet this demand and the recent weakness in copper prices will only make this development more difficult. Richard talked about we are realistic about the current macro conditions creating uncertainties, but we do have strong conviction about the long-term fundamentals for the copper markets and we expect to start seeing as we go through this period of increased demand from decarbonization, large gas supply-demand gaps emerging in the copper market. On Slide 5, we will turn to operations and you will see we present here a summary of our sales by region for the third quarter. And I'll just go through around the globe how our teams are doing. Starting with the U.S., our teams are focused on meeting our production targets safely and efficiently in overcoming challenges with limitations on available labor. We are ramping up the Safford mine, we are ramping up mining rates in the U.S. and we are aggressively pursuing leach production and continuing to study the possible expansion of the Bagdad mine in Northwest Arizona. Moving to South America. Our team at Cerro Verde in Peru continues to execute very effectively and produced at an average of over 400,000 tons of ore per day through the concentrator during the quarter. We faced some challenges during the quarter with byproduct molybdenum productions, and that impacted net unit cash cost. The team is doing great work to overcome this challenge as we look forward into the fourth quarter and beyond. And we're particularly proud of the exceptional work Cerro Verde does in the community, and that provides a sustainable model for the operations. At El Abra, we're continuing to optimize the existing operation, while we consider the larger expansion options in the future. Richard talked about Grasberg. We benefited from continued outstanding execution of the plans that allowed us to exceed our third quarter sales guidance with strong production results in the quarter, higher than forecast grades and an exceptional loading and shipping performance. The team loaded and shipped all of its third quarter production and available concentrate inventories during the period. We're also continuing to advance several projects at the site related to our mill work to add a new mill circuit, working on power infrastructure, we're continuing to advance the development of Kucing Liar and we're progressing with construction of the new smelter in Eastern Java, with a targeted completion of that project in 2024. We show unit costs at the bottom of the slide on a consolidated basis. As I mentioned, the costs in the third quarter were about 5% above our guidance. That mainly, on a consolidated basis, was associated with higher maintenance and the increased cost of supplies. Breaking it down by region, the U.S. was challenged with higher maintenance, supplies and labor. In South America, the variance to our expectations related to lower molybdenum by-product credits, and Grasberg was in line with our prior estimate, but they were offsetting variances, higher maintenance costs and supply costs were offset by stronger gold byproduct credits in the quarter. We have adjusted our annual cost guidance for 2022 to average $1.55 per pound. That compares with the previous estimate of $1.50 per pound and we've got a reconciliation provided in the reference materials on Slide 22. On Slide 6, we wanted to highlight the progress at Grasberg that Richard referred to. Since reaching the targeted run rate in the second half of last year, the team at Grasberg has just done a great job demonstrating sustained large-scale production for several quarters now. We benefit from our industry-leading expertise in block caving and we're effectively managing the largest underground mining complex in the world. This is a major accomplishment, not only for our company, but in the history of the global mining industry. The resource at this site where we've been operating for over 5 decades is significant. And with the success of this project, we're engaged in discussions regarding an extension of our operating rights beyond our current 2041 time frame. Richard talked about earlier we have got some pictures from the visit on the slide. We were honored in late August to host Indonesia's President at the Grasberg site. He toured the site extensively. He visited the former surface mine, had an in-depth tour of the underground and actively engaged with our team. He expressed great pride over what has been achieved technically and for the people of Papua in the country. It was really a happy time, special time for our entire team who's worked so hard over the years to make this project such a success. Another exciting area that we wanted to talk more about today on Slide 7 is our reach innovation initiatives. This is really focused in the Americas and our drive \u2013 we're capturing higher recoveries from leach stockpiles is gaining a lot of momentum. The economics of this opportunity are extremely attractive, very low capital intensity, low incremental operating costs, low carbon footprint, the lowest cost copper units in our Americas portfolio and the carbon intensity is low because the mining costs have already been incurred. And so essentially, we're doing here is extracting more copper from what historically would be considered waste. We are using new data analytics capabilities, and those are providing valuable information to guide us and prioritize our work on the highest value. We're continuing efforts to retain heat in the stockpile. We are moving forward to apply covers to our leach stockpiles because the retention of heat within the stockpiles is proving to enhance recoveries. We're also applying solutions to new areas that were not pursued historically. And we continue to test various additives that can further enhance recoveries. The progress to-date and early results are leading us to a target run rate of 200 million pounds by the end of next year, and that is at the top end of what we were prior thinking was 100 million to 200 million pounds. Success at this level would give us a road map to scale larger, and that's what we're focused on. And we're really taking advantage of the long history we have in leaching significant stockpile material, the availability of new technologies that weren't available in the past and we're in a really strong position to lead the innovation in this area. We are managing this project and this initiative as we would a major project. And when we think about it, it's similar to a \u2013 has a similar production to what we would look at, at a project within the U.S. to add concentrator, but we don't have the capital associated with it and the operating costs are very low. So we're allocating a meaningful amount of significant expertise and technical resources and are aggressively pursuing this opportunity. I am going to move to Slide 8, which provides a 3-year outlook for our sales volumes. As you'll see, the 2022 volumes are very similar for copper, 4.2 billion pounds of copper for 2022. Gold sales are about 5% higher than our prior estimate for the year and that reflects the [indiscernible]. The sales mix for 2022 is roughly 35% coming from the U.S., 28% from South America and 37% from Grasberg. You'll note that our 2023 copper sales guidance have been adjusted. They are lower by about 150 million pounds from our prior estimate. That's roughly 3%. About half of this is a timing matter and does not represent a production shortfall. And this goes to a change in the commercial agreement of our arrangement with PT Smelting, the existing smelter in Indonesia, which we own a 40% interest in currently. That commercial arrangement is converting in 2023 from a purchase and sale agreement to a tolling agreement. And so PT-FI's production a portion will be deferred in inventory until final sale, but it does not represent a production shortfall. And in fact, PT-FI's production is going very well in line with expectations. The balance of this change is associated with updated mine plans in the Americas, and that includes the impact of anticipated lower grades than we were previously forecasting for 2023 at Cerro Verde. The rest of the guidance is pretty similar to what we were guiding to last quarter. And we are going to move to cash flows on Slide 9, and you've seen these charts before. As a leading producer of copper, our earnings and cash flows have significant leverage to the price of copper. And we show modeled results for our EBITDA and cash flow at various prices and with the current cost structure of the business, which, as we've talked about, has increased in recent quarters. We have shown a broad range of prices ranging from $3 per pound to $5 per pound. Just to recall \u2013 remind everyone in the first half of this year, prices averaged nearly $4.50 a pound, and we're approaching $5 a pound earlier in the year. We don't believe the current copper price is sustainable long-term given the cost structure of the industry, the need for new supply development in the future.  Modeled results using the average of \u201823 and \u201824 with the current volume and cost estimates, holding gold flat at $1,700 per ounce and molybdenum flat at $18 per pound, our annual EBITDA would range from roughly $6 billion per year at $3 copper to over $14 billion per year at $5 copper. And our operating cash flows net of all of our taxes would range from $4 billion per year, $3 copper, to $11 billion at $5 copper. So a lot of leverage to the price of copper. We show sensitivities to the various commodities on the right. As Richard talked about, we're prepared to manage in a low-price environment, while retaining optionality for what we believe will be a much more positive situation as we go forward. And we've got this long-lived asset base that will prove to be valuable given the compelling fundamental outlook. Looking at our capital expenditures on Slide 10. You can see that we've reduced the 2022 capital forecast by $400 million, drawn from $3.1 billion in our prior forecast to the $2.7 billion in the current forecast. About half of that has shifted into 2023. As we've talked about all year, we've been spending capital at a slower pace than our original plans. This has something to do with just the supply chain and labor and other things that have deferred the projects. But we're continuing to prioritize the critical projects. We're going to continue to evaluate opportunities as we look at our capital spending plans in the context of the market environment to defer spending where and when it makes sense. We have a lot of flexibility with our plans, and we benefit from the fact that the major investments required for the Grasberg transition are largely behind us. These amounts exclude capital for the Indonesian smelter project. That project is being funded with cash from a bond offering that we raised earlier in the year. There is some details on this project and its progress in the reference materials on Slides 27 and 28. Construction is moving forward. We're working to complete the project as early as we can. We currently expect it to complete it in 2024. And to date, we've invested about $800 million in this project. We will talk for a minute about the financial policy and our strong balance sheet. Going to the balance sheet, it's really the cornerstone of our financial policy. The steps we've taken in the past placed us in an exceptionally strong position, particularly in the context of the current market weakness. We don't have a need to raise new capital for the foreseeable future. And essentially, all of our debt is fixed rate. We continued, as I mentioned, our opportunistic purchases of debt during the quarter and have repurchased over $1 billion in senior notes at attractive prices. The slide here shows our net debt at $2.1 billion at the end of the third quarter. That includes $800 million for the smelter. So when we look at our net debt compared to our target, it's $1.3 billion, which is below our net debt target of $3 billion to $4 billion. And so that gives us some cushion. We've also got a very much cash balance of $8.6 billion, and that continues to provide significant liquidity for us. As you'll see here, we have a very attractive debt maturity profile. We've got easily manageable maturities. We've taken steps to improve financial flexibility. We did some transactions to increase PT-FI's revolver. We did the same thing at Cerro Verde. And just this week, we completed the extension of our corporate revolver, which was previously planned to mature in \u201824. We've extended that to 2027. In closing, we're showing a scorecard on Slide 12 of the shareholder returns, which has been substantial since reaching our net debt targets last year. Just as a reminder, the financial policy provides for the distribution of 50% of our free cash flow and shareholder returns with a net debt target in the range of $3 billion to $4 billion, excluding the smelter debt. We pay a base dividend and a variable dividend totaling $0.60 per share, and $0.30 per share of that is variable. We've used $1.8 billion of our $5 billion in share purchase authorization. Our variable dividend is continuing through 2022, and our Board will have the opportunity to review future dividends depending on performance. As I mentioned, we've returned $2.7 billion to shareholders. This represents over 50% of our free cash flow over this period, and we're well below our net debt targets. As I mentioned, we did not purchase shares since July \u201822, and that reflects just the priorities on the balance sheet, the impact of the sharp decline in copper prices on our cash flows. We're going to continue to prioritize our balance sheet. We believe that maintaining the balance sheet strength in various market conditions is really important in our ability as we look forward to drive long-term returns for our shareholders. We're focused on long-term value, focused on execution, doing this responsibly, safely, efficiently. In the near-term, with respect to growth projects, we're going to continue to define our future options, but expect to defer new major investment decisions in the current market environment. We're convinced the world is going to need our projects in the future, and prices will need to move higher to incentivize the new project development. Richard talked about the pipeline of options we have. We've got a lot of flexibility in terms of the timing of development of these options, particularly the expansive options we have for development of new supply in the U.S. In closing, we're optimistic about the value of our assets, the strength of our team, the fundamentals of the copper business and the future prospects for the markets we serve. I will stop there and we will \u2013 operator, we will open up the call for questions. Thanks, everyone, for your attention, and we look forward to your questions. Thanks, Emily. We have experienced some positive, and that's what's given us more confidence to get to this run rate. We have experienced some improved recoveries, particularly at Morenci, where that's been the start of this focus was at Morenci. That has offset the improvements that we've had in leach production during 2022, has offset some shortfalls we had in 2022 associated with lower placements as we struggle through labor situation with mining rates. But in terms of the actual benefits to date, we are starting to see those. So you're talking about, by the end of next year, getting to 50 million pounds per quarter on a run rate basis. We're already probably third of the way there in terms of what we're seeing now. But what we've got to do is not only see the improvements in recovery, but get the material placed. And that's been the challenge in 2022 is getting additional material placed to meet our base production. But the leach initiative has helped us offset some of these shortfalls in other areas. Well, we're completing the feasibility study. We expect to complete the feasibility study in the first half of next year. And so we will have the opportunity at that point to look at the situation, look at the availability of labor, look at the inflationary environment that we're in, in terms of executing a project in the environment and look at the overall market conditions. So what we're doing now is really getting to a point where we can make a decision and have the project feasibility ready to go so that we will have optionality of when to start it. But I think it's fair to say if we wouldn't pull the trigger today to start. We need to see some improvements in just the overall availability of labor, need to see some improvements in just the tightness that's going on in supply chains and the tough execution environment for construction projects and just the overall copper market. But these are options that we have. And so we don't have any kind of time line to start it. We want to start it when it makes sense when the market needs it, and so we have that flexibility within the portfolio to do that. But we're continuing the feasibility study so that we can be in that position next year. Richard, I'll take that. And you can add to it. Or you'd like to go first? Yes. Chris, historically, what we've done, and we've got a really, really experienced team at this. Historically, what we've done is look at each mine individually and looked at opportunities to reduce cost, to keep mine's cash flow positive during weak environments. And what's different right now, and I don't \u2013 if we do get into a recession, I think that we're going to start to see some of these historical correlations come more in line. But right now, we've got the copper prices that have declined significantly, but input costs have not at this point. I think that if we do get into a really tough situation, our cost situation may get some risk. But in any case, what we do is we go through each mine, look at the operating plans, determine how we can optimize those operating plans. What it tends to mean is that we tend to look at where can we cut back on the mining rate to get to a better cash flow situation. We did that in 2020. We've certainly done it \u201808, \u201809. We did it in \u201815, \u201816. We've done it multiple times. So we do \u2013 if we get into the situation, where it is \u2013 we've got big surpluses building in copper, the world doesn't need our copper, we certainly have the playbook on how to address that. The difference now is that the world does seem to need our copper. So the inventories are very tight. We've been recovering from the 2020 downturn where we took down a lot of production, took down a lot of mining rates and we're ramping back up. And it takes a long time to get that flywheel going. So I don't think we're going to be very rash to cut mine rates and do what we need to do, unless it's a very difficult situation. Now what's different now than it was in 2020 is Grasberg is doing so well. And the match of having our Grasberg mine it really does provide very strong results, one of the lowest cost mines in the world. And so that \u2013 having that line up and running and doing so well is a benefit. We've also got a very different balance sheet than we've had historically. But we're going to be smart about how we look at this. We're not going to produce at a loss. If the world needs our copper, it needs to be \u2013 we need to have a margin. So we're going to do what we need to do, the levers that we have to pull are the same levers that we've had in the past, big reductions in CapEx probably the first thing. And then we will start looking mine by mine on how to change the operating plans. But the difference, again, I just want to emphasize, you look at the forecast for this decarbonization and the world appears to need more copper rather than less and that copper demand is not [indiscernible] to these economic movements. So we are agile, we are nimble, we will do what we have to do, but I think it is different now than it has been in the past. Yes. Yes, we've got about third of that included in our numbers, Alex. And so there is certainly upside. And our team, we want to get to this initial target, but our team believes that with success there, we can scale it further. So for us, this is \u2013 in the near-term, this is an area with low-cost units to our Americas business and particularly in the U.S. Well, we were encouraged in the third quarter our costs were pretty close in line with what we had forecast going into the quarter and sequentially down [ph] for the quarter. With the exception of coal, we have had very, very high oil prices in Indonesia, which continue to remain at way above historical levels. So some of the headline, commodity prices have come down, and we're encouraged by that. An area that we are seeing increases has come through is more non-commodity \u2013 non-direct commodity, more indirect, where we are seeing the parts and equipment and other supplies that we purchased come in at higher cost with recession potential, that will give us some leverage to push back on some of these things. So, the headline numbers, we have seen some relief in. But there are some other underlying areas where we are continuing to see price increases being passed through to us that we are continuing to manage as best we can. You are right about the currencies. That benefits us in South America, Indonesia. And going into the quarter in terms of our guidance, you can see Cerro Verde wasn't that much different than our guidance. The main thing at Cerro Verde was the Mali issue that we had.  But in the U.S., we don't get the benefit of the currencies. So, as we look into 2023, at least right now for our forecast purposes, we are projecting what it is now. So, hopefully, if the markets are to turn weaker, we will have some better ability to cost down. But right now, for forecasting purposes, we have essentially included what we \u2013 what the current market environment is. Carl, I think one of the things that's a real positive, and we talked about the 2018 agreement earlier, but the fact now that the government through MIND ID owns 51% of PT-FI has increased the knowledge of this ore body and the recognition that it takes a very long time to identify and develop new sources of production. And so there is better recognition that we need to know sooner \u2013 earlier than 5 years before the expiration to be able to maximize the values. And so I think that's a real positive that recognition that the long-term nature of this business and how it will benefit from having additional exploration, development over the next 10 years instead of wait until the end until it's too late. So, that's a real positive of the 2018 agreement and alignment that we have with the government. Hi Michael. But there is clearly a mismatch, Michael, between current cost of a capital project and where the current copper price is. And that's what's guiding some of our thinking around timing of Bagdad is it's not something we have to do now. Let's wait to see how some of this unfolds and not try to force a project in the kind of environment we are in, where the availability of people and equipment is tight. So, this is really a project of bringing copper forward. If we don't produce it now, we will produce it later. But we wanted the capital part of this project is important because you don't want to be building a project in an inflationary environment when you wait to use it, it could be a different story. We can't \u2013 as Richard was saying, we can't predict exact timing, but we know we can be more efficient about doing a project in a different environment than where we sit today in the U.S. No. I mean we have been flagging that we cut El Abra's stacking rate during 2020 and have been ramping back up to get an increase. And so we have been flagging the \u2013 and we are moving to a new leach pad there. So, that's in line with what we have been guiding to. Right. Yes."

            "content": "Thank you, Kathleen and we really appreciate each of you joining our call today. I am just going to make brief comments about how our company is positioned in the current market and for what we believe will be a very bright future for the copper business as we go forward. As we talked about on our last call, it remains a world of two cities. The macroeconomic sentiment continues to be weak and you all see that in your everyday lives. On the other hand, the fundamental physical copper market is strikingly tight globally right now. The macroeconomic situation is driven by the strength of the U.S. dollar, the Fed and central banks tightening, concerns about China dealing with COVID in this property section and then the serious problems in Europe coming out of the Ukraine situation and how that's affecting energy prices and economic outlook. All those things are realities we have to face up with, but we continue to work to position our company to deal with these situations. We now have a very strong financial situation that allows us to do that effectively and we are increasingly confident about the outlook and position of the copper markets and where Freeport is positioned to take advantage of that and our confidence continues to grow. Global copper inventories remain at historical levels. You see production reports from producers across the globe reporting challenges in meeting their production targets and the industry is facing increasingly challenges in developing new supplies. In the current environment, stretch supply chains, production shortfalls are becoming commonplace and cost curves are rising. We, at Freeport, are realistic about the potential for weaker global GDP. We prepared our business and taken steps and have plans for other steps to take, depending on the near-term steps as what occurs. We have an old saying around Freeport. We don't ring our hands we roll up our sleeves. The positive thing is that new sources of copper demand are emerging now and there is widespread recognition that copper demand will be significantly benefited by the ongoing global electrification around the world, investments to reduce carbon, they are beginning to accelerate and this is going to occur more rapidly in the future and it's going to be a big impact on copper demand. To meet that demand, the energy transition will require a massive amount of copper and other steps to deal with it. Higher prices will be required to bring on new supplies, much higher prices than we have now, simply because the current price is not sufficient to incent new supply development on the scale that will be required to meet this increasing demand. I am real proud of our Freeport's global team. We are focused on executing our plans effectively and focused on managing what we can control and not getting distracted by things we cannot control. I want to particularly highlight our Grasberg team for the great results they achieved this quarter and the ongoing success our team is achieving in ramping up the large-scale, low-cost underground operations in Indonesia. Just 3 years ago, we were completing mining the open pit and what this team has achieved despite the challenges of COVID is truly remarkable. I was pleased to visit our site in Papua during this past quarter and had the pleasure, along with our team, of showcasing what we have accomplished during a visit by Indonesia's President, Joko Widodo. He was the first President of Indonesia to visit our job site since Suharto did in the early \u201870s when production there commenced. And it was truly a pleasure to be able to show him what we have accomplished what we are accomplishing in the underground and to point out our workforce there, where 98% of our employees are Papuans \u2013 are Indonesians and over 40% of Papuans. It's really noteworthy that he was there. And he expressed a lot of positive comments about it. For me, it was something that was really special since I have been going there for over three decades and to be able to review it with him. As a follow-up, he asked me to accompany his Minister of Investment on a roadshow type tour of 6 universities, 7 universities in Indonesia and they estimate there was 10,000 students and faculty at these sessions as well as it was streamlined to many more. That was a special time for me and for our company and it just illustrates the much improved partnership we have now with the government of Indonesia and the President and his Ministers. I just want to close by saying just to reemphasize how I believe we are well positioned at Freeport to be a global leader in the copper business. We have long life reserves, large scale global operations, established track record of managing responsibly the development and operation of among the largest mines in the world. We have got a great team that's been experienced and stuck together through all the things we faced. And so I am just very pleased about that. We are going to take steps to create value for this company over time. You will hear today about the exciting work we are doing with leaching technology that can add values in a low-cost carbon-friendly way. We have got large scale brownfield development projects ahead of us and we are going to use technology, continue to use technology to help us operate efficiently and create value. So with that, I am going to turn the call over to Kathleen, who will review the quarter and our outlook. And then I look forward to your questions. No. No, Kathleen, go ahead. Thanks. No question about that. I mean, 2016 was a crisis for our company. We're not anywhere near crisis now. And since then, we've had 2 major accomplishments that's de-risked our business significantly. One was the 2018 agreement that we reached with the government to stabilize the situation we had in years about the structure of our taxes, royalties and operating rights. And now we've had 4 years of operating under that and it's going very well as you can see by presence visit, etcetera. And then as Kathleen mentioned, de-risking Grasberg by ramping up the underground and being so effective in sustaining the rates there. We're going to be able to do that by continuing to operate effectively. We've got this Kucing Liar ore body that we're developing that's an add-on to give us stability. And so we're back to the strategy that we've always had, Grasberg generates cash in any environment, it can fund our G&A and then we challenge each of our other mines to manage their business to be at least breakeven on a cash basis. We will give you \u2013 definitely. I mean, the possibilities here are really exciting. And we don't want to get way out ahead of ourselves because it's still in the development mode. But with a sizable leaching operations we have already in place throughout our company, the ability to use this technology to add volumes is really exciting and could be meaningful. And then beyond that, we have historical lead stacks and conceivably using this technology to replace concentrated investments with some of our sulfide ore bodies. So it's really something. We're not \u2013 we're using a number of different approaches, some proprietary, some in partnership with others, and we will give you a report every quarter on how we're progressing with it and how we see it affecting our future. Well, I mean it's going to continue to be a matter of discussion. But the practicality is affecting our business are that \u2013 just a couple of facts, I think most of you know this. But we own virtually all of the lands and see where we have mining operations. So, we don't really pay royalties in the U.S. There were some impacts of inflation reduction acts in terms of alternative minimum tax, and we are still sorting through those. But there is a favorable Federal tax rate. We have net operating loss carry-forwards from our oil and gas deal. We have \u2013 in our case, we have great relationships with the states which have the principal regulatory authority over our mining business and expansions, great community support, where we operate, including the native American groups who want us to invest in hiring their people and working together. So, there will be a lot of lip service doing this. We are not counting on any big government-based type incentives for us in the future. We hope people get more reasonable in progressing permitting processes by investing and having resources available to deal with things effectively. But we continue to deal with the fact that politics are shorter run than our business is. And we just have to see. No. In fact in Europe, you saw some of the recent articles on premiums that are being suggested at very high levels. The inventories are low, there is the production out of Russia is a complicating issue. It's not \u2013 it's something that the margin \u2013 Freeport produces more copper than Russia does. But that's a factor. But backwardation is strong. It's just striking to see that the price of copper dropped $0.70 from a quarter a year ago and yet the day-to-day business that we have is one where customers are really fighting to get product. We had something \u2013 I don't think it's ever happened as Kathleen or Mark Johnson is on the call, but we actually emptied all of our concentrate barns at Grasberg. I mean, they were empty. Generally, we have operational issues with the shallow seas there getting production out. So, it's just striking how negative the financial markets are about this industry and yet the fiscal market is so tight. It's something that we haven't seen. Now the reality is, and Kathleen mentioned that, is this historical correlation between our input costs and copper prices is disrupted right now. I think it will come back into a more traditional relationship in the future, but it's not now. But \u2013 we just don't see any \u2013 we certainly have no problem selling copper. In fact, we have problems meeting demand for \u2013 sometimes it's the rod market in the U.S. is disrupted. And so there is a shortage of copper rod in the U.S., but it's a real striking correlation right now. Yes. I just \u2013 I don't have any basis for predicting what's going to happen in the near-term. But if this market turns, it's going to turn, it's going to turn with a vengeance. I am not predicting that, I am just saying if. Well, let's just go ahead and answer that. We have the issue. Taxes we pay are based on our foreign operations, and particularly like in Indonesia, taxes we pay in any given year is based on the taxes we paid in the preceding year. So, when you have a situation like we have had this year where the preceding year was a lot stronger financially, we are paying higher cash taxes this year. Next year, it could well reverse. But our tax situation is stabilized. We are watching carefully what's going on in Chile, but that's more of an impact on our future development plans. But we have stabilized taxes in Indonesia and no question about the continuation of that. And just in doing financial analysis, you got to take into account this timing difference when taxes are incurred and when they are actually paid. And if you want details on that, call David Joint, and he can help you walk through those. So, we have had early discussions. And my sense is there is a recognition that it's in all parties mutual interest to find a resolution for this. It would make no sense for any stakeholder for us to run this operation with a drop dead date of 2041. There is resources already identified beyond that. And for a number of years, because of all the protracted discussions we had about our contract of work in [indiscernible]. We really haven't done delineation drilling to really understand what happens to these ore bodies at depth. And so the discussions are early on. There are some complications that we and the government will have to deal with, with the existing regulations and so forth. So, it's not something we can say that there is anything other than early conversations. But I have been pleased with the tone of those conversations. And now we are starting the hard work of saying, how do you get this done in a mutually acceptable way. Yes. That's a good point. Michael, these projects are so different. You can't set them in, and I know a lot of people who follow the industry at a high level are always trying to come up with some things like incentive prices and other things that fit. But every one of these projects are just so different. And there are different factors. We will factor in the \u2013 as we conduct this feasibility study at Bagdad and begin \u2013 and the continued discussions with our Board, we will factor in whatever the current price outlook is for capital and operating costs, even though we don't focus in on a particular copper price, but what does scenario copper prices look like and how does it fit into our overall portfolio. One thing that's come out of this \u2013 Kathleen made references to it a couple of times. But one thing that's come out of the pandemic is labor issues. And that's \u2013 as I talk with people, the business roundtable, business counsel, it cuts across industries, but it certainly affects our industry. And Bagdad is a very remote location. And we have got to make some investments to attract people to come in and develop a sustainable labor force there. But it's true in our other operations, not so much overseas. But in the U.S., it's a real issue, and that's a factor to consider in terms of committing capital. And we have got a whole long future of potential capital projects in the U.S. And there are a lot of, in our view, advantages for Freeport in having that. There is \u2013 I mentioned the royalty situation, the great community support we have, the support from the travel groups in the long history that we have worked, invested so hard to have those positive relationships. And so we just have to pull them in. I guess my point is it's not something you can really generalize about, but you have to dig into each of these projects and thoroughly understand how costs, other factors figure into it. So, we got Bagdad. We have got this Lone Star project, it lies ahead in our future. That's great. El Abra is going to be a great project eventually. So, I wish I could give you some simplified answers for that. But... Well, that is a real point. I mean this industry faced supply challenges before this current inflationary environment we have, those had to do \u2013 when I look back on the almost 20 years now I have been CEO, you have geology factors where today's opportunities for supply expansion just are much less attractive than they were 20 years ago. And then you got the geopolitical factors that crop up in different places around the world. And the fact that so many new deposits are underground, etcetera, etcetera, but now this current situation we are going through right now with the uncertainties about the relationship between input costs and prices, about the availability of material, supply and supply chain issues, about labor issues, particularly in the U.S., all those things are just adding to the supply barriers for the industry. And yet, we have this new era of demand that's coming to play. And absent some just global calamity on whatever basis it is. I am just so increasingly confident about what the outlook for the commodity is going to be and just how strongly our company is positioned to benefit from that outlook. And that's what we want to preserve. That's why we are going to be conservative about spending capital, about financial policy, because if anything this company has seen the damage that can be occurred if you don't approach it in a commodity environment like we have or an industry like we have on a conservative solid way. And so that's what you hear over and over as we talk about how we are dealing with the current environment and positioning ourselves for a positive future. Well, the current environment is adding to it. But clearly, the uncertainties that emerged over this past year plus time in Latin America, 40% of the world's copper comes from Chile and Peru. And with what went on in their most recent presidential elections, the uncertainties that came out from that and things continue to change in Peru, the government has been in turmoil. I mean the number of ministers that have gone through this administration is just striking. And then Chile had the situation where there was a negative vote on the proposed constitutional amendment, which changed the targets there. And you can see what's happening to Greenfield projects being delayed in the United States, even though there seems to be lip service saying that the world needs copper, but that's not changing so much for Greenfield projects here in Africa, South Africa [ph]. So, I mean it's just a world of where all of this is happening. We do have an industry where there is two or three projects that have been in the works for many years now, they are going to come on stream shortly. But when you get past those, you just see everything is dried up and you don't see companies talking about having \u2013 you will hear more about like you are hearing from Freeport. We are being conservative about Bagdad. We will be conservative about Sierrita, about El Abra, conservative about our opportunities in Lone Star. And the surpluses that were predicted 2 years or 3 years ago are being downgraded as companies downgrade their current production estimates. So, it's going to happen quickly in the next 3 years and could be shorter. I just see some real similarities to what we have seen in the crude oil business for years of underinvestment, and then all of a sudden, something happens and now the world had a crisis for \u2013 in the oil industry. Good morning Brian. Yes. You touched on an important point. And we certainly saw this with crisis steps we took years ago in 2016, and this sort of ties into the question about what are you going to do with some of these lower-grade deposits if you make decisions about mine rates, they have long-term consequences. It takes a while if you cut back stacking rates on some of these mines and that's not a production impact just for this year, but extends for years in the future. So, as we take steps to build it back up, then that's going to be incremental over a period of time. And so I just keep harping the people who try \u2013 talking about our business, it's a long, long-term business. And that just comes to play in almost everything we do."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, President. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nKathleen Quirk: Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan second quarter conference call. Earlier this morning, FCX reported second quarter 2022 operating and financial results, and a copy of today's press release and slides are available on our website at fcx.com. Our call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website home page and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call, and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on this call include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. I'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings. On the call today with me are, Richard Adkerson, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Maree Robertson, our Chief Financial Officer; Mark Johnson, Chief Operating Officer of Indonesia; Josh Olmsted, Chief Operating Officer for the Americas; Mike Kendrick, who runs our molybdenum business; Cory Stevens, who leads our centralized technical services, engineering and construction; Rick Coleman, who's leading a number of our projects, including the smelter project in Indonesia; and Steve Higgins, our Chief Administrative Officer. Richard is going to make some opening comments to start us off, and then I'll come back and cover the materials in the slide presentation. So now I'll turn the call over to Richard for his comments.\nRichard Adkerson: Thank you, Kathleen. Good morning to everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'm going to open up with some brief remarks about where Freeport is as a company. The second quarter was truly a tale of 2 cities for Freeport. We had very strong operations, and then we've had to deal with this sudden and unexpected significant decline in copper prices. For our operations, we executed our plans. We met our production targets. We met our unit production cost target as well of $1.41. And that was really supported by the ongoing success we've had at Grasberg in the 20-year effort to convert the open pit mine to the industry's largest underground operations. Grasberg has now returned as the second largest copper mine in the world, the largest single gold mine in the world, is 38% of our consolidated copper sales at Freeport. Our second quarter unit cost at PT-FI were below 0. Our gold revenue is fully funded our total operating cost and the success in this operation is a highlight in the careers of all of us associated with PT-FI. Our operations in America performed well. We maintained our positive outlook. As Kathleen will illustrate, I just cannot be more pleased with our global team and the way we operate in the second quarter. We executed the financial policy we established early last year. At that time, we set a debt target of $3 billion to $4 billion and an allocation of available cash flows between dividends, share buybacks and investments. We ended the quarter with a comparative debt amount of $1 billion. There was $600 million of Indonesian debt to separately finance there. Our debt reduced to that level simply because we weren't able, for timing reasons, market reasons, to spend money on expansions in accordance with the allocation. We've paid our base dividend and our supplemental dividend. We purchased FCX shares in the open market since we began that program. We purchased 48 million shares. We retired $750 million of debt in the open market at a discount. Our Board has now approved an increase in our buyback program authorization to 5 billion shares. We have roughly 3 billion shares remaining. Our financial policy is solid, and our execution is strong. But that's only one city. But it's an important one. The other side of the coin is markets. It's just striking how quickly and dramatically markets changed in the second quarter. Prior to this call, I went back and read analyst comments going into the quarter, and the optimism was widespread. Copper prices approached $5. Many were expecting it to go higher. We used $4.50 in our outlook. And now we have prices just above $3.25. Market sentiment reversed so dramatically. I read with interest the recent Bank of America investor survey of institutional investors where they described it as a full panic mode, the lowest expectation in the history of the survey going back to 1995 by investors. The economic analysts are debating on how significant in deterioration of the downturn. At Freeport, we hope for the best, we prepare for the worst. Our management team has experienced and successfully managed past downturns, all of which have been followed by significant recoveries. This is not our first rodeo. We have our playbook. We've dealt with this before. But this time, importantly, we have a strong balance sheet, and that will enable us to manage whatever we face in this marketplace. Our strong financial -- we will work to protect our strong financial condition, protect our assets, our growth opportunities for the bright future that lies ahead for copper. There is a disconnect in today's physical market and the current copper price. Our world in producing and selling copper, for us, feels about the same it did when copper was at $4.50. Customers report strong business. Copper inventories are at historical lows. There has been, to date, no significant impact in physical demand. Today's market is tight. Our strategy of being the world's foremost copper company is intact, and that's based on the long-term fundamentals of the demand and supply for copper. But the reality of today's copper price stares us squarely in the face. It's a major impact on our revenues and our cash flows. The outlook is uncertain. Analysts are calling in a range from a near-term major recession to a longer-term stagflation. Some see a less significant downturn with a near-term recovery. If that happens, we'll watch out. We at Freeport do not know what's going to happen near term. As I said, we hope for the best, prepare for the worst. Whatever happens, the long-term outlook for copper is bright. FCX is well positioned to be a major beneficiary. This -- the world is becoming increasingly electrified with the demand for copper growing as the world acts to reduce carbon emissions with electric vehicles and alternative power generations. S&P Global's Dan Yergin, a highly respected authority for many years in the energy business, recently published a report according to a doubling of copper demand because of the energy transition by 2035, accompanied by huge deficits. I encourage you to read this report. With the established need for the copper to support the world's economy, the future global growth, we're in a new era of copper demand with the energy transitions. Supplies for new copper are challenged. There is no clear line of sight for mine development to meet future demand. The result is, there has to be more scrap recovery, has to be conservation of substitution, more mines and expansions, more mines to develop expansions. But all of this takes years to execute, as you can see from our company. The results will be higher copper prices. The current price for copper is unsustainable. Absent a global long-term economic collapse, that is simply inevitable. And now Kathleen, I'll let you review the quarter and present the information we have in our slides.\nKathleen Quirk: Okay. Great. Thank you, Richard, and I'll cover the presentation that's on our website, and then we'll come back and take your questions. Starting on Slide 3, we summarized the highlights of the second quarter. We achieved solid operating performance in the quarter and continued our momentum and executing our operating plans, growing our production year-over-year and managing costs in a challenging environment. Our sales volumes for copper were 17% higher than last year's second quarter and 5% above our recent guidance. We benefited from strong operating performance across the portfolio. Gold sales were 56% above the year ago quarter and 18% above our April guidance, reflecting the exceptional performance at Grasberg. Our consolidated average unit net cash cost for the quarter of $1.41 per pound were in line with our guidance. And notably, Grasberg's costs were a net credit of $0.02 per pound in the quarter, meaning that the gold revenues more than offset all of our cash production cost at the site. We're actively engaged in cost management and efficiencies across the portfolio to mitigate cost increases. We generated adjusted EBITDA of $2.3 billion in the quarter. This was net of a $355 million reduction associated with copper sales recorded in the first quarter, provisionally priced at the end of March at $4.71 per pound, which remains subject to final settlement. The decline in copper prices during the second quarter resulted in a negative adjustment for these provisionally priced sales. Our adjusted net income totaled $854 million in the second quarter, $0.58 per share. That excluded net charges detailed on Roman numeral Page 7 of our earnings release, totaling $0.01 per share. Operating cash flows of $1.6 billion in the quarter exceeded our capital expenditures of roughly $900 million. Capital spending during the quarter included $400 million of major projects, principally associated with the Grasberg underground and roughly $200 million to advance the construction of the Indonesian smelter. We took advantage of weakness in credit markets during the quarter and opportunistically repurchased debt in the open market. To date, we have purchased $754 million of FCX's notes in open market transactions at a cost of $718 million, including $582 million in principal amount in the second quarter. The current market situation provides a great opportunity for us to reduce absolute debt levels at attractive prices. We also continue to execute our share repurchase program since starting the program last November, we have purchased 48 million shares at a total cost of $1.8 billion, an average approximating $38 per share. Since the end of the first quarter, we purchased nearly 800 million in stock, including 110 million in July, which were executed at an average share price of $28 per share. Since reaching our net debt target in the middle of last year in the range of $3 billion to $4 billion, we have used approximately 50% of our free cash flow for shareholder returns. Today, we announced that our Board increased our share purchase authorization by $2 billion to refresh availability on the program to the $3 billion range. The timing of our future purchases will be dependent on our cash flows and general market conditions. We'll continue our priority of maintaining a strong balance sheet and use excess cash to return to shareholders. As Richard discussed, the magnitude of the decline in copper in recent weeks was sudden and unexpected. We have the balance sheet, asset quality and experience to successfully manage a volatile and uncertain market environment. Our net debt at the end of June was $1.6 billion. That included $600 million in net debt associated with the Indonesian smelter. Consolidated debt was $11.1 billion, and consolidated cash was $9.5 billion. We don't have requirements to raise capital in the current environment. We've been opportunistic and taking advantage of recent market weakness to repurchase our debt and equity securities. As we look forward, we will manage through the near term effectively and are positive about our strategy centered on being foremost in copper, the strength of our assets and our team focused on increasing value for all stakeholders. Moving to markets on Slide 4, we show a graph of year-to-date copper prices. The price 4 months ago hit a high of $4.87 per pound, with market analysts predicting multiyear periods of price increases based on fundamentals of rising demand required to support the energy transition, limited supplies and sizable deficits on the horizon. You've all read about the macro factors, which have manifested over the last several weeks, triggering recessionary concerns. In addition, concerns about the impact of COVID shutdowns in China and a strong U.S. dollar have weighed on copper, which is viewed as a close proxy for sentiment on the health of the global economy. The reality is that this has been a financially driven anticipatory move in copper prices. Physical markets remain healthy as evidenced by the global exchange inventories illustrated on this chart, which remain at historically low levels. Our customers report solid orders, and the industry continues to struggle to meet production targets. The current decline in price is below Wood Mackenzie's estimate of $4.25 per pound necessary to incentivize new supply under an accelerated energy transition. It will also provide less cash flow to the industry to develop new supplies, making the projected deficits in copper more significant in the future. The long-term secular demand trends for copper demand associated with electrification, decarbonization will be important demand drivers for copper. We see these trends being less economically sensitive than traditional uses of copper in the economy. We fully recognize the short-term uncertainties but have conviction about long-term fundamentals for the copper markets. Richard mentioned the S&P Global report. Many of you have seen it was published last week, prepared by analysts at S&P Global and led by Dan Yergin, a well-known energy industry expert, author and historian. The independent study, which is available on S&P Global's website, forecast above-trend copper demand through 2035 associated with electrification and the energy transition. The report projects long-term structural deficits in copper and highlights copper's prominent role in the global aspirations of a net zero economy. It confirms the work of other reputable analysts on the future of copper and will serve as an educational tool for governments and other policymakers on the importance of future new copper supply development. We recognize the short-term macro was a different picture. And as we move to Slide 6, Richard highlighted this, it summarizes our experience in managing challenging environments. For those of you who have followed our company and industry for a long time, you know that our team is proficient and successfully navigating challenging circumstances. This slide on Slide 6 summarizes our actions in prior periods when we took decisive steps to adjust our operating plans, reduce costs, defer spending, protect liquidity and preserve our asset values for improved market conditions. Notably, we operate all of our mines and manage major capital and operating decisions centrally. Each one of these periods had its own unique challenges, and our team proved its agility each time. We're prepared to respond to a weakening market environment, if necessary. We're in a much stronger position than in past downturns with a significantly improved balance sheet and our successful expansion of a low-cost production at Grasberg. Our team is resilient, experienced, professional and value-driven in our approach. We can't predict the extent or timeframe of the current situation. But as a responsible producer of scale and a strategy focused on copper with long life reserves, the prospects are bright for our portfolio to become more scarce and highly valued in the future. On Slide 7, we provide some additional details on our operating activities in the quarter. In the U.S., the Lone Star mine continues to perform above design capacity. We're expanding further to take us to 300 million pounds per annum by 2023 with an investment of approximately $250 million. As we accelerate the mining of oxide awards, this will expose a much larger sulfide opportunity at this site. We're also advancing and we're very excited about our leach recovery initiatives at Morenci; and across the Americas portfolio, using data analytics and new technologies to enhance our leach production. This is a significant value-enhancing opportunity for us, and we continue to gain momentum and expect to have success on this priority initiative. At our Bagdad mine in Northwest Arizona, we are advancing plans for the Bagdad 2X project to double production. Studies are advancing, and we're planning to advance early initiatives in parallel with the studies. We're focusing on developing this opportunity. It's a future growth option, but we'll be flexible on timing subject to market conditions. In South America, the teams have done exceptional work navigating the pandemic. We've had a great highlight a significant milestone for the Cerro Verde team during the quarter, setting a quarterly record for concentrating of averaging 427,000 tonnes of concentrating per day. At Cerro Verde, we also had some recent positive results on exploration, which has the potential to expand reserves and increase grades at this large-scale operation. At El Abra, we have increased stacking rates and commencing leaching on a new leach pad. We continue to evaluate alternatives for the long term at El Abra, including options for a new concentrator or an extension of existing operations, subject to ongoing monitoring of the investment climate in Chile. At Grasberg, we sustained our large-scale metal production after reaching our target metal run rate in the fourth quarter of last year. The cost position at Grasberg is exceptional. And the team there is doing outstanding work in managing and sustaining the largest and most profitable underground operation in the world. During the quarter, we again achieved higher gold recoveries compared with forecasts, which contributed to a favorable variance for the quarter. And we've now increased our outlook for full year gold production. At PT-FI, we are advancing mill projects to provide additional capacity in the second half of 2023. We're diversifying our power sources and advancing the long-term development for Kucing Liar. The construction of the new smelter in Indonesia is advancing. We reached an important construction milestone during the quarter, which will enable us to begin to reduce export duties later this year. Turning to Slide 8, we provide a 3-year outlook for our volumes, which are largely in line with our prior forecast. We've made small changes to our 2022 copper volumes totaling about 40 million pounds or about 1% and have increased our forecast for gold volumes in 2022 by about 5%. The execution of our long-term plans is on track after delivering 19% increase in copper sales in 2021. We are projecting growth in volumes in 2022 and further growth in 2023. For 2022, we estimate 36% of our sales volumes will come from the U.S., 27% from South America and 37% from Grasberg. Moving to our cost outlook on Slide 9. As I mentioned, we're actively engaged in cost management and efficiency initiatives to mitigate the impacts of the challenging cost environment. We've updated our plans to incorporate recent commodity pricing, exchange rates and our latest operating plans. We're now estimating unit net cash costs for the year approximating $1.50 per pound for 2022. That compares with our prior estimate of $1.44 per pound. As you'll see from the reconciliation on Slide 9, the majority of this increase reflects the decline in by-product credits associated with a reduction in assumed gold and molybdenum prices for the balance of the year. Our projected $0.03 per pound increase in site production and delivery costs reflects the assumption of higher energy prices in our second half -- in the second half compared with our prior forecast, higher consumable costs, together with the impact of a change in estimate for copper in the maturing leach pad at El Abra. And this was partly offset by the favorable impact we have on labor costs internationally associated with weakening exchange rates compared to the U.S. dollar. Historically, copper prices have been correlated with a number of our input costs. Should recessionary pressures continue, historical correlations would indicate that we may begin to see a reversal of some of the cost experiences we've seen over the last 2 years. Moving to Slide 10. As one of the world's leading copper producers, our earnings and cash flows have significant leverage to the price of copper, up and down. On Slide 10, we show modeled results for our EBITDA and cash flow at various prices and have shown a broad range of prices this quarter, given the volatility ranging from $3 per pound of copper to $5 per pound of copper, which is close to where the prices were earlier in the year. We've updated our gold and molybdenum prices to reflect current prices. As Richard talked about, the current price is not sustainable long term given the cost structure of the industry and the need for new supply development in the future. We show modeled results on this slide using the average of 2023 and 2024 with current volume and cost estimates and holding gold flat at $1,700 per ounce and molybdenum at $16 per pound. Our annual EBITDA under these scenarios would range from over $6 billion per annum at $3 copper to $15 billion per year at $5 copper, with operating cash flows ranging from $4.5 billion per year at $3 copper to over $11 billion per year at $5 of copper. We show sensitivities on the right to various commodities and input costs. We can't predict prices and are prepared to manage in a low price environment. The long-term fundamentals of our business indicate that low copper prices are not sustainable longer term, providing increased cash flow as market conditions improve. We show the consolidated capital expenditures on Slide 11. These are largely unchanged from our prior guidance. We've reduced the 2022 capital forecast by $100 million, which is a timing variance for 2023. And as you probably noted, we've been spending capital during 2022 at a slower pace than our original plans. And in the current weak environment, we'll review opportunities to defer spending as we've done in the past. We have flexibility with our plans and benefit from the fact that the major investments required for the Grasberg transition are largely behind us and will begin to decline as we go into 2023. On Slide 12, we show our future growth options embedded in our asset base. We have multiple options for brownfield low-risk growth across our portfolio. Recall, we have 191 billion pounds of copper mineral resources in our portfolio in addition to our proved and probable reserves of 107 billion pounds of copper. The leaching opportunity is a major value driver opportunity for us, and it's not included in our reserves and resources. Success in this area will enable us to create the equivalent of a new mine with extremely low capital intensity, low incremental operating costs and, importantly, a low carbon footprint. We're continuing to apply covers to our leach stockpiles as the retention of heat is proven to enhance recoveries. We're using data analytics and evaluating various additives that can further enhance recoveries. We're initially targeting the addition of 100 million to 200 million pounds of new copper per annum within a relatively short time frame and believe we can build on this target with initial success. We currently estimate 38 billion pounds of copper in our stockpiles, which has already been mined but not in our reserves or production plans. A significant portion of this opportunity is at our flagship Morenci mine, the largest mine in North America. A cross-functional team of technical experts, metallurgists, mine planners, data scientists, geologists and business analysts are working together to make -- take full advantage of this exciting opportunity. We review the ongoing oxide expansion at Lone Star, which is progressing on schedule. Longer term, we have the massive Lone Star sulfide opportunity, a 50 billion-pound copper resource in our established mining area in Eastern Arizona. This project is right in our wheelhouse and is a valuable development option for the future. In the medium term, we're planning to double the size of Bagdad. We have a very large reserve position at the site. We expect to complete the feasibility study for this project in the first half of next year and would be positioned to start construction activities as market conditions warrant. The El Abra project has a resource approaching 30 billion pounds of copper, and we've done a lot of work in identifying an operation that could produce over 700 million pounds of copper per year. In parallel with our evaluation of a major expansion, we're also considering investments in water, which would extend the life of the existing operation while maintaining the longer-term growth option. We continue to closely monitor developments in Chile and are deferring decisions for the time being. In Indonesia, Kucing Liar project is a natural extension of our operations there and will allow us to continue large-scale, low-cost mining there for decades to come. The learnings and shared infrastructure from our successful development of Grasberg underground and the Deep MLZ really enhanced the value of this project at Kucing Liar. We benefit from having a large pipeline of options and have flexibility on the timing of development of our projects, particularly the extensive options we have for development of new supply in the U.S., where we own most of our land and feed. We believe the world is going to need our projects in the future. We have a long track record of success in qualifying and developing projects in an efficient and responsible manner, enhanced by our industry-leading technical capabilities, established licenses to operate in our strong franchises in the areas of focus. I want to turn to our balance sheet on Slide 13, which our financial policy is centered around or center around a strong balance sheet. The actions we've taken in the past have placed us in an exceptionally strong position, particularly in the context of current market weakness. We don't have a need to raise new capital for the foreseeable future. During the quarter, we took a number of steps which further derisked our balance sheet. We raised long-term financing for the smelter. We repaid our term loans at PT-FI and Cerro Verde, and expanded our bank credit facilities for these subsidiaries, and we opportunistically purchased over 750 in senior notes at attractive prices. As we talked about, our net debt including $11 billion in total debt and $9.5 billion of cash. Net debt, excluding the smelter net debt was $1 billion and below our targeted net debt of $3 billion to $4 billion, providing cushion in a weak market environment. We have an attractive debt maturity profile, as you'll see, with easily manageable maturities. We can continue to be opportunistic on value opportunities to repurchase debt in the open market. Slide 14, in closing, we show a scorecard of our shareholder returns, which have increased with our strong financial performance in recent quarters. We were active in the market in the second quarter and into July and have allocated approximately 50% of excess cash flows to shareholder returns since the third quarter of last year. And that consisted of $1.8 billion in share repurchases and common stocks of over -- common stock dividends totaling over $650 million during this period. Our Board authorized a $2 billion increase in our share repurchase program to restore $3 billion in availability under the program. We'll continue to prioritize our balance sheet as the cornerstone of our financial policy, and that will allow us to operate well in varying market conditions and drive long-term returns for shareholders. The discretionary purchases of our shares will be dependent on market conditions and cash flow generation in the future, and our Board will continue to review our financial policy on a regular basis. In summary, we're all focused on long-term value and executing our plans responsibly, safely and efficiently. Despite the recent market conditions, we're optimistic about the value of our assets, the strength of our global team, the fundamentals of the copper business and the future prospects for the markets we serve. We appreciate your attention, and we look forward to your questions. Operator, we'll now open the call for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Emily Chieng with Goldman Sachs.\nEmily Chieng : Good morning, Richard and Kathleen, and thank you for the update this morning. My first question is just around the 3Q copper shipment guidance. It looks like that's a little bit lower on a sequential basis than 2Q before it moves back up again. But could you perhaps point to what region may be driving that? And is that timing of shipments or perhaps something to do with the mine plan for the third quarter?\nKathleen Quirk : Emily, it's primarily timing. We did sell more in the second quarter. We produced more, but we also had some timing variances in second quarter where we sold more in the U.S. than we expected. In Indonesia, we also brought down our concentrate inventory. So it's mainly a timing, we're at -- we're pretty much at run rates currently.\nRichard Adkerson : And anyway, we do have challenges with timing in Indonesia from time to time with the shallow water port that we have there. Rough seas can just delay loading and we, of course, record sales at the time of loading. And so that's just something we've had to deal with over the years.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Chris LaFemina with Jefferies.\nChris LaFemina : Hi, Richard and Kathleen. Thank you for taking my question. Kathleen, you mentioned historically, you mentioned your ability to kind of manage through the downturn, deferring spending as one option. Historically, Freeport in declining price environment has taking high-cost capacity offline. And like we had a lot of cost inflation in mining, the cost curve appears to be steepening pretty dramatically. I'm wondering how much further the price would have to fall before you would consider taking some capacity off-line. That's my first question.\nKathleen Quirk : I think, Chris, what we're really looking at is the physical markets. And right now, the physical markets are tight. As Richard talked about earlier, inventories are low. We certainly do not want to produce at a loss at any of our operations, and we prefer to keep our reserves in the ground for better markets in the future. But right now, the situation is so dynamic, it appears that physical markets continue to be robust. We're going to be watching it. And it will be a combination of factors, including what input costs do as well. But we go through mine by mine and look at overall production costs capital costs, the overall cash flows, and we'll make adjustments as needed and maybe first adjustments be to defer some capital projects which do have an impact on copper prices -- on copper volumes longer term, but we're going to be looking at all these things and closely monitoring the conditions. As I mentioned, we're we operate everything. So we control all these decisions, and we can look very quickly across the portfolio and where things stand. And so we're prepared to make adjustments. I don't want to give a projection as to what number, but we have reduced copper production in the past, particularly when demand has fallen.\nChris LaFemina : And you talked about the market being physically tight. You can see that in the inventory data. It's a little bit perplexing though, because the Chinese macro got so bad in the second quarter due to the lockdowns. And presumably, Chinese demand materially weakened. The underlying demand must have materially weakened there. There's been year-over-year in the second quarter fairly substantial supply growth on the 2 biggest mines in the world, including your own, had pretty big production growth year-over-year. A lot of companies are lowering their production guidance. But second quarter looks like a quarter where you had an increase in supply and potentially a collapse in Chinese demand, yet inventories didn't really change. So I'm just trying to reconcile what might have happened. Do you think the Chinese may be buying copper for strategic reserves? Or is there something else going on in the market that would explain why it's staying relatively tight despite the biggest end market potentially seemingly imploding in the last quarter?\nRichard Adkerson : Well, Chris, in preparing for this call, I have made a concerted effort with my contacts in the industry, who are very knowledgeable of the business on the ground in China. To answer your direct question there because that was perplexing out. I inquired broadly about where their inventories in China that were not visible, what was going on with Chinese commodity trading companies, and the word came back that inventories were not building, it wasn't unusual trading. You're right, a couple of our mine and the other big mines increased, but there was also fly disruptions in Latin America during the quarter. And it appears that, that, in effect, balanced some of the Chinese demand issues. But we don't see our customers in China -- and we have a diverse customer base in Asia. We, by design, don't sell all of our copper into China, but into Japan and South Korea and Taiwan, and we don't see any impact on demand. So I understand your question, and I just want to share with you what I've been able to find from it, but we're just not seeing it in our business.\nKathleen Quirk : Western world has been strong as well, Chris. So that's been different than in past years.\nRichard Adkerson : Right. Even in Europe, our business there is strong. And I know the uncertainty space in Europe over this energy situation, so I'm not diminishing any of that. It's just our business is strong, as many customers over there are avoiding Russian copper. And so it is unusual, as I talked about. It is a disconnect. It's a serious disconnect right now between the physical marketplace that we're seeing and what's going on with copper prices.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets.\nDavid Gagliano : Chris just hit the one I was really trying to -- I wanted to ask about, which is the cadence. I know if you look back historically, '08, '09, I believe if memory serves me correctly, copper prices went to like $1.50 when Freeport acted. And then 2015, 2016, again, off the top of my head, I think copper prices were kind of in the somewhere $2 to $2.50 range. So given the cost pressures that we've seen everywhere, is it reasonable is sort of a $2.50 to $3 per pound range a reasonable zone to start thinking about when we'll see more action at existing assets?\nRichard Adkerson : Well, in response to your question earlier and we had about that, I think everyone understands that we at Freeport have a broad range of operations with different cost structures. I mean that was really the whole basis for putting together Grasberg with the Phelps Dodge assets. It allows us to manage those assets more efficiently when you've got a asset like Grasberg to support it. When times get tough, historically, what we've done has been able to use Grasberg support all of our corporate G&A and our debt financing cost. And then we challenge each one of mines to operate as they minimum cash flow breakeven. And we review this mine by mine, and every mine makes that decision, our decisions to support achieving that objective. But then within the larger mines -- and I'll just use Morenci as an example, the largest mine in North America. They are individual mines, but what goes on in to reflect the current economics. It's a balancing act because decisions you make to do that have consequence -- manage all these operations ourselves, and we run our business in the Americas essentially as a single business unit. So we all get together, we find out what's working, what's not, what can be done, what -- and we balance the longer-term consequences with the need to meet current realities. And it is -- and as I said, we have the same basic team we've had that we've done this before. so we have a game plan for us doing it. And now our operators are ahead of us in occasions. Everybody knows what to do. Everybody is pitching in and acting as a team to deal with our corporate objectives. So it's not an easy question to say, is there a price where this happens with this mine, because it's an interactive process that cuts across all of our mines in the Americas. Of course, in Indonesia, we're going to produce as aggressively as we can safely and consistent with our long-term plans. And it's so great now to be ramped up to the extent we obviously got a couple of steps to do. But just 2 years ago, it was really scary when we were having volumes down there and the world was facing COVID. And we're so much better positioned now.\nKathleen Quirk : And David, you raised this in your comments, and we look at a lot of the publications that show where cost support is for copper. Those estimates are dated. There've been a lot of changes in input costs that the historical cost support for copper has been increased significantly. So $3.25 copper is not the same as it was 2 years ago. And so that's a factor as well. But reading tea leaves about how long this will last, we can move quickly. This has happened suddenly, and we're starting a process to look at what we can do, particularly on the capital spend. That's the quickest way to increase cash flow.\nDavid Gagliano : Okay. That's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up. Obviously, the authorization increased the buyback from $3 billion to $5 billion at a time when copper is dropping. If copper kind of holds where it is, we don't see a lot of free cash flow, which, by the way, is no different from a company that reported last night that also raised their buyback. My question is just really, can you just speak to the thought process and the approach to the buyback moving forward, considering everything else that's going on in the market right now. Is there any -- and also, is there any kind of duration to the $5 billion buyback timeline-wise?\nRichard Adkerson : So what we try to do at urging of a number of our shareholders last year was established a financial policy so that people knew what direction we were going in. And so we worked on it for months and finally came up with a policy that was announced about how we were allocating available cash flows, what was our debt targets, how are we allocating cash flows between shareholder returns and investments. There's always a challenge in the investment side of it because it takes so long to do it. So anyway, that's just part of the function. But we felt that -- and we discussed this with our Board, we felt that it was best to give the marketplace a direction since we've executed so much of our existing authorization, that we would have the availability to act for share buybacks when it was warranted by the marketplace. And I would be careful to say this because I'm not predicting anything. I mean clearly, my long career has taught me not to be confident in myself or others in predicting these short-term movements. But David, there is a scenario here with the market being so tight. And if things turn out not to be as dire as most expect now, there could be a dramatic recovery in copper prices, and that would translate to a recovery in Freeport's share price. And we want people to understand what we'd be prepared to do if the circumstances changed dramatically from where they are now or for most to predict. We're still going to run the business with the primary goal of protecting our assets and protecting our future because we believe the future -- we believe we're confident the future of this company is so bright Past actions by the company that they impair all at times. We're not going to do that this time. We're going to have discipline about it. But we wanted the market to know that we have this authorization available to us for us to execute when it makes sense.\nKathleen Quirk : Yes. I think another factor out there is, as you look at the copper price needed to support new mine development and compare that to where our share is trading and what's implied in our shares, it's attractive versus new supply development. And on the flip side, we are looking at this steering the situation in the face where new supply development is required. So there's some bunch of disconnects in the market right now. And we wanted to signal positive we're going to use excess cash flows to buy stock back. We've -- the lower copper prices gives us less cash flows to use, but we're going to continue to look at our plans and see how we might modify that with this disconnect in where our share price is trading and what's needed long term to develop new supplies.\nRichard Adkerson : I mean maybe it's trite because most management say this, but our management and our Board truly believes that the fundamental value of Freeport is substantially higher than the stocks trading now.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Lawson Winder with Bank of America Securities.\nLawson Winder : Hello, Richard and Kathleen. It is very nice to hear from you. As always I hope you both are well. I just wanted to kind of dig down on your comments regarding the increase in the cash cost guidance, Kathleen, you mentioned it was a majority of the forces driving that were actually just a reduction in the by-product price assumptions. I was getting to that too, though, I was getting to a very small majority, almost close to 50-50. We happen to have a specific number in terms of how that broke down between inflation and the change in the price assumption? And then maybe if you could just speak to some of the key, I guess, unexpected inflationary items that you saw in the quarter.\nKathleen Quirk : Yes. Sure. On Slide 9, we show a roll forward. And you can see there where we've gone from $1.44 to $1.50 in the by-product credit because we're using lower gold prices and moly from what we used in our prior forecast is down by $0.05. So we had a $0.06 increase and $0.05 of that is from reduced by-product credits. The site production, the top line number, the site production delivery being up $0.03. The major factors there that are impacting our cost guidance is energy we used -- just for reference in our last forecast, we used $3.50 per gallon for diesel prices just for one reference in our outlook, which was the price -- around the price at the time. The price in the fourth -- in the second quarter ended up being above $4 per gallon, and that's declined somewhat to $3.70. So we're using current or at least prices as of last week for oil prices or diesel prices roughly $3.70 a pound or a gallon in our outlook. Coal prices are also up from our prior forecast. Purchase power costs are up slightly. We had some offsets in currencies. The stronger dollar results in lower operating costs in our international locations. And so we've reflected that. We've had some contractual consumable price increases, which are rolling in, which we've brought into the forecast. We had also -- and this is more of an accounting deal, but we also had, as we are transitioning in a lab from a former leach pad to a new leach pad, we had some changes in estimates in our estimates of what copper is remaining in that leach pad. And so what that does is basically, if we reduce the amount of copper available in leach pad, it increases our costs for the remaining pound. So that is not a cash item. It's essentially we've already spent the cash. But it will roll through our unit net cash costs and that was a factor as well. So -- but the headlines, energy materials and supplies, this deal at El Abra, which is more noise offset by a stronger dollar. And profit sharing and other costs that are driven by copper prices. So net of all that, we were $0.03 on site production and delivery, and our export duties and royalties went down by $0.02. So the biggest factor you can look at this and say it's by-product credits, which we were using $1,950 for gold in the prior forecast and now we're using $1,700, $19 for moly in the prior forecast, which is what it was. And that price has declined to $16.\nRichard Adkerson : And growing volumes in Indonesia. I mean, with that cost structure, when it gets to be a greater proportion of consolidated numbers, that's a huge benefit.\nLawson Winder : Maybe as a follow-up, I find it remarkable that you did not mention labor among all of that. Are you just not seeing signs of any meaningful labor inflation? And I guess, you're obviously confident that you don't expect to see any going forward?\nKathleen Quirk : We had already updated in our second quarter -- in the second quarter and our first quarter results in April, we had already updated our labor costs for inflation. We've also -- in contract labor that we're using. Our labor costs actually in this forecast are a little lower because of this currency factor that I mentioned. And that doesn't affect our U.S. operations. But when you look at South America and where the Peruvian and Chilean currencies have moved relative to the dollar, that helps because our costs are in those countries for labor are principally denominated in the local currency.\nRichard Adkerson : I want to get a shout out to our supply chain team that's just done a remarkable job in working with our suppliers in a difficult environment, not only from a cost standpoint, but from a delivery standpoint. And they've just done a great job in working directly hand-in-hand with our operations to do what we can to offset these challenges that are broadly across all businesses.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley.\nCarlos De Alba : Yes, good morning, Richard and Kathleen. A couple of questions, if I may. First one, it seems that the leaching technology could be a very attractive return on investment for you. So I wonder if you can give maybe a little bit more color as to what is the current status there? What are some of the work that is still pending to do? And if you have any sense of potential timing for that investment to materialize? And then the other is, clearly a lot of volatility, as you mentioned, and copper prices have suffered. But since you are quite constructive on the market, this might be an opportunity. So this is maybe a sensitive topic, but what is the rationale of keeping Cerro Verde as a policy traded company? I mean wouldn't it potentially be that also a good investment for Freeport shareholders?\nKathleen Quirk : Carlos, regarding the first question related to your comments on leaching, it is our best project in the portfolio and is something that's a catalyst for us to really add value to our business. As you mentioned, low capital intensity, very low operating costs. And particularly in this current environment, we are highly motivated. We've got teams, we're running it like a project. We've got teams highly focused on this. It's our #1 priority. It's got an element of research and development associated with it. So it's not just execution. It's got some science associated with it. But we are advancing our understanding of the science. We -- our company and its predecessors have been really leaders in this area, and we've got a team of people who have a lot of experience in the science of this as well as some new approaches that are going to allow us to be successful here. Cory Stevens is on the line, who is leading this effort and with Josh and the whole Americas team. And Cory, I don't know if you want to make any comments in addition to what we said earlier. But Cory's phone rings quite a bit because this is -- we do see this as being a real value opportunity for us to create value for our business and shareholders. But Cory, is there anything you want to add that wasn't covered?\nCory Stevens: No. Thanks, Kathleen. Yes. So reaching really does offer a number of compelling advantages on a number of fronts. The analytics capabilities is really unlocking a more granular look at all the different aspects that we see in terms of recovery, and it's enabling us to decouple static recipes that we had in the past to more dynamic recipes that maximize value as we go forward. But that's just one bucket and it's very organic. We're -- at Morenci, there's a lot of a center of our attention right now. We're executing to the moderate volumes that we've put in to this year's forecast, building confidence into a sustainable -- what that looks like going forward and then have a number of activities going to add even more with a whole -- with a very large backlog of a number of alternatives that we're pursuing.\nKathleen Quirk : Thanks, Cory. And so it's data analytics, additives, which we're exploring as well as heat, which we're applying covers across all of our stockpiles. And we're well on our way to doing that. And as we retain heat in the stockpile, the data shows that recoveries are greater. So it's a multifaceted approach to it. We're focused initially at Morenci. Chino is the second largest one in the U.S., and we're moving with data analytics there. We're trying out some additives at Sierrita. We've got some third-party some third-party activity going on at our Bagdad mine in Arizona. So we're trying a bunch of alternatives to enhance our understanding and we're gaining confidence that we'll be able to have some. We set this target of 100 million to 200 million pounds over a 12- to 18-month time frame. And we're increasing our ability to -- our confidence in our ability to get to that. And once we get to that, that will open up some iterations that will allow us to expand it from there. But we've got to get the first success. And we've had some early successes. It's just we've got to get to scale on it. So stay tuned. For second question on Cerro Verde...\nRichard Adkerson : Well, let me just add. The real focus is what Kathleen and Cory talked about is taking advantage of our existing leach operations. But with success, the future beyond that is really exciting about what we might do in terms of mining sulfide ores and processing them with this technology or looking at historical lead stacks. It is really exciting. Our whole team is really pumped up about it, very good to see. Our project is called leach to the last drop.\nKathleen Quirk : And just to circle back on Cerro Verde, we monitor the share price there, the public share price there. The public float is a historical carry forward that has been in place for a very long time, but we do monitor the trading conditions, opportunities if they arise and being able to repurchase. It's a different scenario than in the U.S. where we can have active share purchase programs. But we are in tune with the market there and with certain of the investors. And we'll look at that on an opportunistic basis as we compare uses of cash flow with other priorities at the corporate level.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Michael Dudas with VRP.\nMichael Dudas : So Richard, we've had this dislocation over the last 6, 7 weeks, which has perplexed a lot of folks. And on top of the S&P report, the year-end report that came that you cited that was published a couple of weeks ago. Historically, these types of like corrections or uncertainty in the market, will it lead to exponential delays in decision-making and getting some of the supply to the marketplace? Is there going to be just -- or is this like, well, we know longer term conference would be great, so we're going to go through with these discussions. Obviously, you're looking at it in one very measured way. But historically, as the industry, we're going to see further pressure on inventories and deficits because this type of nervous is could lead to further delays in the needed investment for the product?\nRichard Adkerson : Unquestionably, I mean you just think about the impact on corporate strategy, the amount of financing that's available for smaller projects. All -- this is just another element of the series of barriers to supply development that the industry had already faced. And unquestionably, I mean it was pointed out earlier in the discussion that for a company like ours is we got this really great project in Chile that's being delayed by the politic -- political situation there and the uncertainties about taxation. When you balance that out with a company like ours and potentially being able to buy your stock back so cheaply, that's going to happen. That's going to have an impact. The investment in this industry is just so long term, so long term, even for a project as straightforward as doubling our concentrator at Bagdad. That's a multiyear effort to go through the permitting, the planning process, the procurement process. So it's the long-term nature of this business and a head spinning move in prices like this is going to have an impact on those investment decisions. I don't know of any company that's just going to close their eyes and say that the market is so good in the future, we're just going to ignore this. You can't ignore it. I mean it's been such a dramatic decline, and there's still such uncertainties as to what's going to happen, that all of that is going to delay production investments and there was such a limited number of investments available out there anyway, it's just building towards this coming huge deficit in the copper markets.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research.\nTimna Tanners : I guess I'm just trying to kind of square that what we've been discussing in terms of Freeport Slide 12 in terms of all those projects. What does it take that you need to see to -- from the Chilean politics to get more confident in El Abra? And what does it take in terms of copper prices just generally to proceed? Or are many of these still very attractive at recent prices?\nRichard Adkerson : So Timna, thanks for the question. It's -- in looking at our situation, there's a lot of balancing of competing economics for these projects that come into play. The uncertainty at El Abra where we have a 50%, 51% interest, and we operate with Codelco as our partner, just means that, that is a burden on that project, whereas investments in the U.S., where Kathleen mentioned we own substantially all of our landing fees. So there's no royalties where we have a favorable income tax situation that's partially due to the tax legislation that's in place now and partially due to net operating loss carryforward we have from the oil and gas investment. And all the issues around community support and what you have to provide in international operations affects that balance that we have. And Kucing Liar is different because it's just a clear-cut fit into our long-term plan for managing the available ore. Grasberg -- and by the way, I might mention, Emily, you had your report today a question about extending the 4041 deadline there. We're in early discussions. I think we have a pathway forward, but we have a proceed with that. And that is something that would benefit all stakeholders and also open that whole area for further exploration, which has been limited because of the 2041 deadline under our existing operating rights. So it's not an easy question to say, but it's a balancing off on all these things. And right now, the leach focus is not -- it's going to be affected by economics, timing of bag, that maybe the Lone Star project, the near-term expansions are going well and they have some more opportunities there. The sulfide is longer term and then El Abra is the 1 that's really challenged. Beyond that, we have further opportunities in the U.S. at Morenci and at our other mines. But -- what I really like about our company is we have this huge pipeline of projects. The nearest term will take time rather than leaching which will come quicker. But Beyond that, we have such great resources that are available to us beyond reserves. And over time, those will come into reserves. And so this company is sustainable for a very long period of time, without having to do anything else, without having to do anything else. But the decisions about timing and when to come and so forth, has a lot of moving parts, and that got -- it's just gotten more complicated by seeing this 30% drop in copper prices and not knowing what's going to happen in the next 2 to 3 years globally. So it had an impact on us, and it will have an impact on other companies.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Abhi Agarwal with Deutsche Bank.\nAbhinandan Agarwal : Good morning, Richard and Kathleen. I just had a question on inflation. So in terms of inflation, where do you see the biggest upside risk into the year-end and 2023? And you did talk about using spot gasoline prices and including labor in your forecast. But does the Q3 and the 2022 guide reflect the spot consumable prices you are seeing? That's my first question.\nKathleen Quirk : The first answer is yes to that. We're using spot prices for our energy inputs.\nRichard Adkerson: Yes. And that's just our philosophy and planning overall. We don't like -- we develop an outlook and a plan based on current prices, and then we look at a number of different scenarios for what might happen if that varies. But we don't go into any kind of economic analysis. Our sales are coming up with predictions on the future. Have heard long ago that's a dead man's game. And so we just use current prices and then look at scenarios of -- I'll say this, for those of you who followed the company a long time, you've heard me say about the correlation between our input costs and copper prices that's been there. And that's 1 of the rationales we've always used for not hedging. This current market has disrupted some of those longstanding traditional relationships. Energy is the most significant one, and that's changing. And every day, you see that changing. So we're just having to -- we have to approach this with prudence, with an overall goal of protecting this great set of assets we have and protecting the future that I think is going to be so great for our company. So we're going into that mode that we've followed before of really aggressively managing our business as the world around us changes.\nKathleen Quirk : And to your question about where we see the most risk or opportunity either way, I'd say energy is the 1 that's the most uncertain. As Richard talked about the correlation, what we're spending on energy, if we did historical correlations going back over a long period of time, our energy costs correlated to a $3.25 copper price, would be 40% lower or greater. And so -- but yet people are talking about potentially energy prices spiking again because of what's going on in the world. But if we really do get this recession really comes through, maybe it's a scenario where historical correlations start to fold in more than they are today. But our current plans are not based on historical correlations. They're based on the current market conditions.\nRichard Adkerson : With you, and this is obviously -- the biggest risk to our business right now is, is the future demand going to drop off a cliff because of a global recession. And that's what the market -- the market is pricing that in, in large part right now because that's what the expectation was. I mean, look at that Bank of America survey that they did, 80% of the people were projecting bad times. But we haven't had that yet. But that's the risk to our business. If the dire expectations about recession occur, demand will fall off. We can adjust to it. We're not going to put our company at risk. And that's why we're going to be very prudent about the way we manage capital, manage operations and manage our financial policy. I'm such a big believer in copper. I have this urge to be a lot more entrepreneur about it. But history has taught me we need to be really prudent to protect ourselves in case things happen that put us at risk, and we're not going to do that. I'm just not going to do it.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC.\nJohn Tumazos : We\u2019re in a such a strong position at Freeport and given the 2 big capital projects, the smelter and Kucing Liar basically nondiscretionary, but we really don't need to make too many changes lay off geologist paying CapEx around a lot and that there's less risk of a double mistake of making all these cuts and then the market recovering, panics, start and stop so fast, it's so hard for you to manage. Do you think it's very likely we're steady state at Freeport?\nRichard Adkerson : Well, let's see, you mentioned people. We made substantial cuts in personnel just over 2 years ago with the COVID issue. We did that. We always treat people fairly. It was mostly between incentivized retirements or incentivized terminations and so forth, and we were very attractive with doing that. By the way, we have carried over some really efficient benefits in our G&A cost. And what we learned during that period of time about not needing to travel as much and working efficiently with our people. I encourage all of you to go back and look at the history of Freeport's G&A and just see what progress we made with it. John, we're actively looking for technical people. I mean we're not talking about cutting back technical people at all because this opportunity with leaching with data analytics, which is used in leaching, but in the rest of our business. And my experience has shown you find good technical people, you can -- they'll create value for you. So steady state, maybe that's one way of saying it now that with Grasberg being where it is with its ramp-up, we're still working on a mill enhancement there, power issues. We're dealing with our power plant there. And we have some other investments made, but we're at our run rate. And clearly, the expansions are being affected by today's copper price. So yes, we're just focused on staying in a strong financial position, keeping all of our options open and being prepared to act when time makes sense.\nKathleen Quirk : We raised the capital we need for the smelter. That's an important part of our agreement with the Indonesian government. And we raised the capital we need, both in the bond and the bank markets earlier this year before things got deteriorated. And so we're in good shape. That's an execution project. The Kucing -- it's complicated execution project, but it's an execution project. The Kucing Liar project is investments over a long period of time. We can have some pluses and minuses as we look out in the plan to tweak it, but it's a long-term investment. The places where we do have opportunities to look at is, in the short term, some of the funding that we were planning in the Americas for various projects to build capacity, to build capacity assurance to sustain higher mining rates so that we could keep our production levels high. Those kinds of things as we've done in the past, we can look at if we need -- we will look at if we need to essentially cut spending. And the reductions in mining rates help current cash flow. It makes it harder in the future to get the flywheel going again as we're just now doing with the cutbacks we did in 2020. But as Richard said, it's something that our team has experience with. We do it in a disciplined way. I think the important thing for the market to understand is that as we do these kinds of things, they don't -- the switch doesn't get turned on quickly. So they have lasting effects. Not -- you don't lose value. It's not lost, but it's deferred for potentially an extended period of time. So we take all that into account when we make these decisions on modifying operating plans.\nRichard Adkerson : And the timing of that PT-FI $3 billion financing was very fortuitous. Now I was just looking at this this morning and what we issued it with and what today's interest rates are for those bonds that are trading. It was great that Kathleen and our team have done when they got it done.\nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of Jatinder Goel with Exane BNP Paribas.\nJatinder Goel : Just a question on inflation, but from a different perspective. A number of other companies in the sector are highlighting CapEx inflation being higher than OpEx inflation. Interestingly, encouragingly, your CapEx guidance is almost unchanged for this year and next year, barring some $100 million shift. What's driving that? Are you seeing any CapEx inflation? Or is there any deferral of activity keeping that absolute $3.1 billion average CapEx slide unchanged, but it's at the cost of some lower activity level?\nKathleen Quirk : Yes. I think it's a function of where we are in these projects. In Indonesia, a large portion of our capital budget was related to the underground the underground development. And so we were well advanced in this project. The last part of it really is this increase in our SAG milling circuit, which is coming on in Q3. So -- but if we're starting projects today or in the last 6 months, I think that's a fair assumption. And that also goes into the calculus of is this the environment that you want to undertake major new projects in because not only do you have the costs up, but the availability of labor, to someone's question earlier, is that the risks are higher. And so the current copper price doesn't appropriately reflect what is required to get new projects developed. And that's the thing Richard was talking about earlier, where we've got a big disconnect. But our capital projects that we're doing today have been in progress for a long time. So -- and we've got a core amount of sustaining projects, and we do have some higher equipment and parts and those kinds of things. Some of the parts have affected OpEx. But we're not -- given where we are in our capital cycle, we don't have the inflation that someone brand new starting a new project would have today.\nRichard Adkerson : Yes. It's the nature of what we're spending money on. And like Kathleen said, where we are in the cycle. And supply chain issues are still real too, and that would be a very daunting thing to think about as you were undertaking a $6 billion, $7 billion new project in this industry. Just coming back -- it just keep coming back that the supply chain -- I mean, the supply barriers to develop copper to meet this demand are really significant. You just -- you think about we've had high copper prices now for 20 years. And just look at what the industry has tried to spend and develop and what's been developed. And now you've got these new things that are coming in, you can't wipe away community environmental concerns just because the world needs copper. You have all the social issues that are competing for the populations in Latin America and problems -- we in the U.S. benefit because we have greenfield expansions, but you see the problems of trying to build -- I mean, brownfield expansions. You see the problems in trying to build a greenfield expansions here in the U.S., they're just daunting. I've just never seen anything like it and it's just so clear to me after looking at our commodities businesses and actual resource business is now for all these decades about where the copper business is and what the future lies ahead for us. And just why I'm so excited about what our companies will benefit from the assets, people experience, how we do things. So it's going to be a great future.\nJatinder Goel : Excellent. Just a quick follow-up. On the smelting CapEx, the only change has been in the precious metals, refinery side. Is all of the remaining CapEx on existing smelter expansion plus the new greenfield smelter all locked in, and there is no risk of escalation there, just to be sure?\nKathleen Quirk : No, it's not.\nRichard Adkerson : No.\nKathleen Quirk : Yes. We agreed with the EPC contractor to a target price, and we both share some risk in that. And we've got some contingencies, a good portion also when you think about the labor cost, local labor costs and where the dollar is. So that will help us if things stay with the way they are. But it's not a fixed price contract. It's got some risk sharing between the parties.\nOperator: I'll now turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks.\nRichard Adkerson: Let me just say, you all know how I feel on what's the basis for our company's strategy. So what -- if any of you -- and I'm asking this question broadly within the industry with all my contacts, but any of you on this call and follow our company so closely. If you have a different view about the fundamental outlook for the business, just call me directly. I'd be very interested in hearing it. One thing the reality is that I certainly recognize is that even with institutional investors, their views of the -- of their investments are much more short run than what Freeport's view is of how we have to invest for the future of this copper business. But I'm really interested in hearing contrary views, if any of you would like to share them with me. And with that, we thank you all, it\u2019s exciting and we look forward to reporting in the next quarter and seeing how this world unfolds. It's going to be very interesting. Thank you all.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kathleen Quirk",
            "content": "Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan second quarter conference call. Earlier this morning, FCX reported second quarter 2022 operating and financial results, and a copy of today's press release and slides are available on our website at fcx.com. Our call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website home page and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call, and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on this call include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. I'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings. On the call today with me are, Richard Adkerson, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Maree Robertson, our Chief Financial Officer; Mark Johnson, Chief Operating Officer of Indonesia; Josh Olmsted, Chief Operating Officer for the Americas; Mike Kendrick, who runs our molybdenum business; Cory Stevens, who leads our centralized technical services, engineering and construction; Rick Coleman, who's leading a number of our projects, including the smelter project in Indonesia; and Steve Higgins, our Chief Administrative Officer. Richard is going to make some opening comments to start us off, and then I'll come back and cover the materials in the slide presentation. So now I'll turn the call over to Richard for his comments. Okay. Great. Thank you, Richard, and I'll cover the presentation that's on our website, and then we'll come back and take your questions. Starting on Slide 3, we summarized the highlights of the second quarter. We achieved solid operating performance in the quarter and continued our momentum and executing our operating plans, growing our production year-over-year and managing costs in a challenging environment. Our sales volumes for copper were 17% higher than last year's second quarter and 5% above our recent guidance. We benefited from strong operating performance across the portfolio. Gold sales were 56% above the year ago quarter and 18% above our April guidance, reflecting the exceptional performance at Grasberg. Our consolidated average unit net cash cost for the quarter of $1.41 per pound were in line with our guidance. And notably, Grasberg's costs were a net credit of $0.02 per pound in the quarter, meaning that the gold revenues more than offset all of our cash production cost at the site. We're actively engaged in cost management and efficiencies across the portfolio to mitigate cost increases. We generated adjusted EBITDA of $2.3 billion in the quarter. This was net of a $355 million reduction associated with copper sales recorded in the first quarter, provisionally priced at the end of March at $4.71 per pound, which remains subject to final settlement. The decline in copper prices during the second quarter resulted in a negative adjustment for these provisionally priced sales. Our adjusted net income totaled $854 million in the second quarter, $0.58 per share. That excluded net charges detailed on Roman numeral Page 7 of our earnings release, totaling $0.01 per share. Operating cash flows of $1.6 billion in the quarter exceeded our capital expenditures of roughly $900 million. Capital spending during the quarter included $400 million of major projects, principally associated with the Grasberg underground and roughly $200 million to advance the construction of the Indonesian smelter. We took advantage of weakness in credit markets during the quarter and opportunistically repurchased debt in the open market. To date, we have purchased $754 million of FCX's notes in open market transactions at a cost of $718 million, including $582 million in principal amount in the second quarter. The current market situation provides a great opportunity for us to reduce absolute debt levels at attractive prices. We also continue to execute our share repurchase program since starting the program last November, we have purchased 48 million shares at a total cost of $1.8 billion, an average approximating $38 per share. Since the end of the first quarter, we purchased nearly 800 million in stock, including 110 million in July, which were executed at an average share price of $28 per share. Since reaching our net debt target in the middle of last year in the range of $3 billion to $4 billion, we have used approximately 50% of our free cash flow for shareholder returns. Today, we announced that our Board increased our share purchase authorization by $2 billion to refresh availability on the program to the $3 billion range. The timing of our future purchases will be dependent on our cash flows and general market conditions. We'll continue our priority of maintaining a strong balance sheet and use excess cash to return to shareholders. As Richard discussed, the magnitude of the decline in copper in recent weeks was sudden and unexpected. We have the balance sheet, asset quality and experience to successfully manage a volatile and uncertain market environment. Our net debt at the end of June was $1.6 billion. That included $600 million in net debt associated with the Indonesian smelter. Consolidated debt was $11.1 billion, and consolidated cash was $9.5 billion. We don't have requirements to raise capital in the current environment. We've been opportunistic and taking advantage of recent market weakness to repurchase our debt and equity securities. As we look forward, we will manage through the near term effectively and are positive about our strategy centered on being foremost in copper, the strength of our assets and our team focused on increasing value for all stakeholders. Moving to markets on Slide 4, we show a graph of year-to-date copper prices. The price 4 months ago hit a high of $4.87 per pound, with market analysts predicting multiyear periods of price increases based on fundamentals of rising demand required to support the energy transition, limited supplies and sizable deficits on the horizon. You've all read about the macro factors, which have manifested over the last several weeks, triggering recessionary concerns. In addition, concerns about the impact of COVID shutdowns in China and a strong U.S. dollar have weighed on copper, which is viewed as a close proxy for sentiment on the health of the global economy. The reality is that this has been a financially driven anticipatory move in copper prices. Physical markets remain healthy as evidenced by the global exchange inventories illustrated on this chart, which remain at historically low levels. Our customers report solid orders, and the industry continues to struggle to meet production targets. The current decline in price is below Wood Mackenzie's estimate of $4.25 per pound necessary to incentivize new supply under an accelerated energy transition. It will also provide less cash flow to the industry to develop new supplies, making the projected deficits in copper more significant in the future. The long-term secular demand trends for copper demand associated with electrification, decarbonization will be important demand drivers for copper. We see these trends being less economically sensitive than traditional uses of copper in the economy. We fully recognize the short-term uncertainties but have conviction about long-term fundamentals for the copper markets. Richard mentioned the S&P Global report. Many of you have seen it was published last week, prepared by analysts at S&P Global and led by Dan Yergin, a well-known energy industry expert, author and historian. The independent study, which is available on S&P Global's website, forecast above-trend copper demand through 2035 associated with electrification and the energy transition. The report projects long-term structural deficits in copper and highlights copper's prominent role in the global aspirations of a net zero economy. It confirms the work of other reputable analysts on the future of copper and will serve as an educational tool for governments and other policymakers on the importance of future new copper supply development. We recognize the short-term macro was a different picture. And as we move to Slide 6, Richard highlighted this, it summarizes our experience in managing challenging environments. For those of you who have followed our company and industry for a long time, you know that our team is proficient and successfully navigating challenging circumstances. This slide on Slide 6 summarizes our actions in prior periods when we took decisive steps to adjust our operating plans, reduce costs, defer spending, protect liquidity and preserve our asset values for improved market conditions. Notably, we operate all of our mines and manage major capital and operating decisions centrally. Each one of these periods had its own unique challenges, and our team proved its agility each time. We're prepared to respond to a weakening market environment, if necessary. We're in a much stronger position than in past downturns with a significantly improved balance sheet and our successful expansion of a low-cost production at Grasberg. Our team is resilient, experienced, professional and value-driven in our approach. We can't predict the extent or timeframe of the current situation. But as a responsible producer of scale and a strategy focused on copper with long life reserves, the prospects are bright for our portfolio to become more scarce and highly valued in the future. On Slide 7, we provide some additional details on our operating activities in the quarter. In the U.S., the Lone Star mine continues to perform above design capacity. We're expanding further to take us to 300 million pounds per annum by 2023 with an investment of approximately $250 million. As we accelerate the mining of oxide awards, this will expose a much larger sulfide opportunity at this site. We're also advancing and we're very excited about our leach recovery initiatives at Morenci; and across the Americas portfolio, using data analytics and new technologies to enhance our leach production. This is a significant value-enhancing opportunity for us, and we continue to gain momentum and expect to have success on this priority initiative. At our Bagdad mine in Northwest Arizona, we are advancing plans for the Bagdad 2X project to double production. Studies are advancing, and we're planning to advance early initiatives in parallel with the studies. We're focusing on developing this opportunity. It's a future growth option, but we'll be flexible on timing subject to market conditions. In South America, the teams have done exceptional work navigating the pandemic. We've had a great highlight a significant milestone for the Cerro Verde team during the quarter, setting a quarterly record for concentrating of averaging 427,000 tonnes of concentrating per day. At Cerro Verde, we also had some recent positive results on exploration, which has the potential to expand reserves and increase grades at this large-scale operation. At El Abra, we have increased stacking rates and commencing leaching on a new leach pad. We continue to evaluate alternatives for the long term at El Abra, including options for a new concentrator or an extension of existing operations, subject to ongoing monitoring of the investment climate in Chile. At Grasberg, we sustained our large-scale metal production after reaching our target metal run rate in the fourth quarter of last year. The cost position at Grasberg is exceptional. And the team there is doing outstanding work in managing and sustaining the largest and most profitable underground operation in the world. During the quarter, we again achieved higher gold recoveries compared with forecasts, which contributed to a favorable variance for the quarter. And we've now increased our outlook for full year gold production. At PT-FI, we are advancing mill projects to provide additional capacity in the second half of 2023. We're diversifying our power sources and advancing the long-term development for Kucing Liar. The construction of the new smelter in Indonesia is advancing. We reached an important construction milestone during the quarter, which will enable us to begin to reduce export duties later this year. Turning to Slide 8, we provide a 3-year outlook for our volumes, which are largely in line with our prior forecast. We've made small changes to our 2022 copper volumes totaling about 40 million pounds or about 1% and have increased our forecast for gold volumes in 2022 by about 5%. The execution of our long-term plans is on track after delivering 19% increase in copper sales in 2021. We are projecting growth in volumes in 2022 and further growth in 2023. For 2022, we estimate 36% of our sales volumes will come from the U.S., 27% from South America and 37% from Grasberg. Moving to our cost outlook on Slide 9. As I mentioned, we're actively engaged in cost management and efficiency initiatives to mitigate the impacts of the challenging cost environment. We've updated our plans to incorporate recent commodity pricing, exchange rates and our latest operating plans. We're now estimating unit net cash costs for the year approximating $1.50 per pound for 2022. That compares with our prior estimate of $1.44 per pound. As you'll see from the reconciliation on Slide 9, the majority of this increase reflects the decline in by-product credits associated with a reduction in assumed gold and molybdenum prices for the balance of the year. Our projected $0.03 per pound increase in site production and delivery costs reflects the assumption of higher energy prices in our second half -- in the second half compared with our prior forecast, higher consumable costs, together with the impact of a change in estimate for copper in the maturing leach pad at El Abra. And this was partly offset by the favorable impact we have on labor costs internationally associated with weakening exchange rates compared to the U.S. dollar. Historically, copper prices have been correlated with a number of our input costs. Should recessionary pressures continue, historical correlations would indicate that we may begin to see a reversal of some of the cost experiences we've seen over the last 2 years. Moving to Slide 10. As one of the world's leading copper producers, our earnings and cash flows have significant leverage to the price of copper, up and down. On Slide 10, we show modeled results for our EBITDA and cash flow at various prices and have shown a broad range of prices this quarter, given the volatility ranging from $3 per pound of copper to $5 per pound of copper, which is close to where the prices were earlier in the year. We've updated our gold and molybdenum prices to reflect current prices. As Richard talked about, the current price is not sustainable long term given the cost structure of the industry and the need for new supply development in the future. We show modeled results on this slide using the average of 2023 and 2024 with current volume and cost estimates and holding gold flat at $1,700 per ounce and molybdenum at $16 per pound. Our annual EBITDA under these scenarios would range from over $6 billion per annum at $3 copper to $15 billion per year at $5 copper, with operating cash flows ranging from $4.5 billion per year at $3 copper to over $11 billion per year at $5 of copper. We show sensitivities on the right to various commodities and input costs. We can't predict prices and are prepared to manage in a low price environment. The long-term fundamentals of our business indicate that low copper prices are not sustainable longer term, providing increased cash flow as market conditions improve. We show the consolidated capital expenditures on Slide 11. These are largely unchanged from our prior guidance. We've reduced the 2022 capital forecast by $100 million, which is a timing variance for 2023. And as you probably noted, we've been spending capital during 2022 at a slower pace than our original plans. And in the current weak environment, we'll review opportunities to defer spending as we've done in the past. We have flexibility with our plans and benefit from the fact that the major investments required for the Grasberg transition are largely behind us and will begin to decline as we go into 2023. On Slide 12, we show our future growth options embedded in our asset base. We have multiple options for brownfield low-risk growth across our portfolio. Recall, we have 191 billion pounds of copper mineral resources in our portfolio in addition to our proved and probable reserves of 107 billion pounds of copper. The leaching opportunity is a major value driver opportunity for us, and it's not included in our reserves and resources. Success in this area will enable us to create the equivalent of a new mine with extremely low capital intensity, low incremental operating costs and, importantly, a low carbon footprint. We're continuing to apply covers to our leach stockpiles as the retention of heat is proven to enhance recoveries. We're using data analytics and evaluating various additives that can further enhance recoveries. We're initially targeting the addition of 100 million to 200 million pounds of new copper per annum within a relatively short time frame and believe we can build on this target with initial success. We currently estimate 38 billion pounds of copper in our stockpiles, which has already been mined but not in our reserves or production plans. A significant portion of this opportunity is at our flagship Morenci mine, the largest mine in North America. A cross-functional team of technical experts, metallurgists, mine planners, data scientists, geologists and business analysts are working together to make -- take full advantage of this exciting opportunity. We review the ongoing oxide expansion at Lone Star, which is progressing on schedule. Longer term, we have the massive Lone Star sulfide opportunity, a 50 billion-pound copper resource in our established mining area in Eastern Arizona. This project is right in our wheelhouse and is a valuable development option for the future. In the medium term, we're planning to double the size of Bagdad. We have a very large reserve position at the site. We expect to complete the feasibility study for this project in the first half of next year and would be positioned to start construction activities as market conditions warrant. The El Abra project has a resource approaching 30 billion pounds of copper, and we've done a lot of work in identifying an operation that could produce over 700 million pounds of copper per year. In parallel with our evaluation of a major expansion, we're also considering investments in water, which would extend the life of the existing operation while maintaining the longer-term growth option. We continue to closely monitor developments in Chile and are deferring decisions for the time being. In Indonesia, Kucing Liar project is a natural extension of our operations there and will allow us to continue large-scale, low-cost mining there for decades to come. The learnings and shared infrastructure from our successful development of Grasberg underground and the Deep MLZ really enhanced the value of this project at Kucing Liar. We benefit from having a large pipeline of options and have flexibility on the timing of development of our projects, particularly the extensive options we have for development of new supply in the U.S., where we own most of our land and feed. We believe the world is going to need our projects in the future. We have a long track record of success in qualifying and developing projects in an efficient and responsible manner, enhanced by our industry-leading technical capabilities, established licenses to operate in our strong franchises in the areas of focus. I want to turn to our balance sheet on Slide 13, which our financial policy is centered around or center around a strong balance sheet. The actions we've taken in the past have placed us in an exceptionally strong position, particularly in the context of current market weakness. We don't have a need to raise new capital for the foreseeable future. During the quarter, we took a number of steps which further derisked our balance sheet. We raised long-term financing for the smelter. We repaid our term loans at PT-FI and Cerro Verde, and expanded our bank credit facilities for these subsidiaries, and we opportunistically purchased over 750 in senior notes at attractive prices. As we talked about, our net debt including $11 billion in total debt and $9.5 billion of cash. Net debt, excluding the smelter net debt was $1 billion and below our targeted net debt of $3 billion to $4 billion, providing cushion in a weak market environment. We have an attractive debt maturity profile, as you'll see, with easily manageable maturities. We can continue to be opportunistic on value opportunities to repurchase debt in the open market. Slide 14, in closing, we show a scorecard of our shareholder returns, which have increased with our strong financial performance in recent quarters. We were active in the market in the second quarter and into July and have allocated approximately 50% of excess cash flows to shareholder returns since the third quarter of last year. And that consisted of $1.8 billion in share repurchases and common stocks of over -- common stock dividends totaling over $650 million during this period. Our Board authorized a $2 billion increase in our share repurchase program to restore $3 billion in availability under the program. We'll continue to prioritize our balance sheet as the cornerstone of our financial policy, and that will allow us to operate well in varying market conditions and drive long-term returns for shareholders. The discretionary purchases of our shares will be dependent on market conditions and cash flow generation in the future, and our Board will continue to review our financial policy on a regular basis. In summary, we're all focused on long-term value and executing our plans responsibly, safely and efficiently. Despite the recent market conditions, we're optimistic about the value of our assets, the strength of our global team, the fundamentals of the copper business and the future prospects for the markets we serve. We appreciate your attention, and we look forward to your questions. Operator, we'll now open the call for Q&A. Emily, it's primarily timing. We did sell more in the second quarter. We produced more, but we also had some timing variances in second quarter where we sold more in the U.S. than we expected. In Indonesia, we also brought down our concentrate inventory. So it's mainly a timing, we're at -- we're pretty much at run rates currently. I think, Chris, what we're really looking at is the physical markets. And right now, the physical markets are tight. As Richard talked about earlier, inventories are low. We certainly do not want to produce at a loss at any of our operations, and we prefer to keep our reserves in the ground for better markets in the future. But right now, the situation is so dynamic, it appears that physical markets continue to be robust. We're going to be watching it. And it will be a combination of factors, including what input costs do as well. But we go through mine by mine and look at overall production costs capital costs, the overall cash flows, and we'll make adjustments as needed and maybe first adjustments be to defer some capital projects which do have an impact on copper prices -- on copper volumes longer term, but we're going to be looking at all these things and closely monitoring the conditions. As I mentioned, we're we operate everything. So we control all these decisions, and we can look very quickly across the portfolio and where things stand. And so we're prepared to make adjustments. I don't want to give a projection as to what number, but we have reduced copper production in the past, particularly when demand has fallen. Western world has been strong as well, Chris. So that's been different than in past years. And David, you raised this in your comments, and we look at a lot of the publications that show where cost support is for copper. Those estimates are dated. There've been a lot of changes in input costs that the historical cost support for copper has been increased significantly. So $3.25 copper is not the same as it was 2 years ago. And so that's a factor as well. But reading tea leaves about how long this will last, we can move quickly. This has happened suddenly, and we're starting a process to look at what we can do, particularly on the capital spend. That's the quickest way to increase cash flow. Yes. I think another factor out there is, as you look at the copper price needed to support new mine development and compare that to where our share is trading and what's implied in our shares, it's attractive versus new supply development. And on the flip side, we are looking at this steering the situation in the face where new supply development is required. So there's some bunch of disconnects in the market right now. And we wanted to signal positive we're going to use excess cash flows to buy stock back. We've -- the lower copper prices gives us less cash flows to use, but we're going to continue to look at our plans and see how we might modify that with this disconnect in where our share price is trading and what's needed long term to develop new supplies. Yes. Sure. On Slide 9, we show a roll forward. And you can see there where we've gone from $1.44 to $1.50 in the by-product credit because we're using lower gold prices and moly from what we used in our prior forecast is down by $0.05. So we had a $0.06 increase and $0.05 of that is from reduced by-product credits. The site production, the top line number, the site production delivery being up $0.03. The major factors there that are impacting our cost guidance is energy we used -- just for reference in our last forecast, we used $3.50 per gallon for diesel prices just for one reference in our outlook, which was the price -- around the price at the time. The price in the fourth -- in the second quarter ended up being above $4 per gallon, and that's declined somewhat to $3.70. So we're using current or at least prices as of last week for oil prices or diesel prices roughly $3.70 a pound or a gallon in our outlook. Coal prices are also up from our prior forecast. Purchase power costs are up slightly. We had some offsets in currencies. The stronger dollar results in lower operating costs in our international locations. And so we've reflected that. We've had some contractual consumable price increases, which are rolling in, which we've brought into the forecast. We had also -- and this is more of an accounting deal, but we also had, as we are transitioning in a lab from a former leach pad to a new leach pad, we had some changes in estimates in our estimates of what copper is remaining in that leach pad. And so what that does is basically, if we reduce the amount of copper available in leach pad, it increases our costs for the remaining pound. So that is not a cash item. It's essentially we've already spent the cash. But it will roll through our unit net cash costs and that was a factor as well. So -- but the headlines, energy materials and supplies, this deal at El Abra, which is more noise offset by a stronger dollar. And profit sharing and other costs that are driven by copper prices. So net of all that, we were $0.03 on site production and delivery, and our export duties and royalties went down by $0.02. So the biggest factor you can look at this and say it's by-product credits, which we were using $1,950 for gold in the prior forecast and now we're using $1,700, $19 for moly in the prior forecast, which is what it was. And that price has declined to $16. We had already updated in our second quarter -- in the second quarter and our first quarter results in April, we had already updated our labor costs for inflation. We've also -- in contract labor that we're using. Our labor costs actually in this forecast are a little lower because of this currency factor that I mentioned. And that doesn't affect our U.S. operations. But when you look at South America and where the Peruvian and Chilean currencies have moved relative to the dollar, that helps because our costs are in those countries for labor are principally denominated in the local currency. Carlos, regarding the first question related to your comments on leaching, it is our best project in the portfolio and is something that's a catalyst for us to really add value to our business. As you mentioned, low capital intensity, very low operating costs. And particularly in this current environment, we are highly motivated. We've got teams, we're running it like a project. We've got teams highly focused on this. It's our #1 priority. It's got an element of research and development associated with it. So it's not just execution. It's got some science associated with it. But we are advancing our understanding of the science. We -- our company and its predecessors have been really leaders in this area, and we've got a team of people who have a lot of experience in the science of this as well as some new approaches that are going to allow us to be successful here. Cory Stevens is on the line, who is leading this effort and with Josh and the whole Americas team. And Cory, I don't know if you want to make any comments in addition to what we said earlier. But Cory's phone rings quite a bit because this is -- we do see this as being a real value opportunity for us to create value for our business and shareholders. But Cory, is there anything you want to add that wasn't covered? Thanks, Cory. And so it's data analytics, additives, which we're exploring as well as heat, which we're applying covers across all of our stockpiles. And we're well on our way to doing that. And as we retain heat in the stockpile, the data shows that recoveries are greater. So it's a multifaceted approach to it. We're focused initially at Morenci. Chino is the second largest one in the U.S., and we're moving with data analytics there. We're trying out some additives at Sierrita. We've got some third-party some third-party activity going on at our Bagdad mine in Arizona. So we're trying a bunch of alternatives to enhance our understanding and we're gaining confidence that we'll be able to have some. We set this target of 100 million to 200 million pounds over a 12- to 18-month time frame. And we're increasing our ability to -- our confidence in our ability to get to that. And once we get to that, that will open up some iterations that will allow us to expand it from there. But we've got to get the first success. And we've had some early successes. It's just we've got to get to scale on it. So stay tuned. For second question on Cerro Verde... And just to circle back on Cerro Verde, we monitor the share price there, the public share price there. The public float is a historical carry forward that has been in place for a very long time, but we do monitor the trading conditions, opportunities if they arise and being able to repurchase. It's a different scenario than in the U.S. where we can have active share purchase programs. But we are in tune with the market there and with certain of the investors. And we'll look at that on an opportunistic basis as we compare uses of cash flow with other priorities at the corporate level. The first answer is yes to that. We're using spot prices for our energy inputs. And to your question about where we see the most risk or opportunity either way, I'd say energy is the 1 that's the most uncertain. As Richard talked about the correlation, what we're spending on energy, if we did historical correlations going back over a long period of time, our energy costs correlated to a $3.25 copper price, would be 40% lower or greater. And so -- but yet people are talking about potentially energy prices spiking again because of what's going on in the world. But if we really do get this recession really comes through, maybe it's a scenario where historical correlations start to fold in more than they are today. But our current plans are not based on historical correlations. They're based on the current market conditions. We raised the capital we need for the smelter. That's an important part of our agreement with the Indonesian government. And we raised the capital we need, both in the bond and the bank markets earlier this year before things got deteriorated. And so we're in good shape. That's an execution project. The Kucing -- it's complicated execution project, but it's an execution project. The Kucing Liar project is investments over a long period of time. We can have some pluses and minuses as we look out in the plan to tweak it, but it's a long-term investment. The places where we do have opportunities to look at is, in the short term, some of the funding that we were planning in the Americas for various projects to build capacity, to build capacity assurance to sustain higher mining rates so that we could keep our production levels high. Those kinds of things as we've done in the past, we can look at if we need -- we will look at if we need to essentially cut spending. And the reductions in mining rates help current cash flow. It makes it harder in the future to get the flywheel going again as we're just now doing with the cutbacks we did in 2020. But as Richard said, it's something that our team has experience with. We do it in a disciplined way. I think the important thing for the market to understand is that as we do these kinds of things, they don't -- the switch doesn't get turned on quickly. So they have lasting effects. Not -- you don't lose value. It's not lost, but it's deferred for potentially an extended period of time. So we take all that into account when we make these decisions on modifying operating plans. Yes. I think it's a function of where we are in these projects. In Indonesia, a large portion of our capital budget was related to the underground the underground development. And so we were well advanced in this project. The last part of it really is this increase in our SAG milling circuit, which is coming on in Q3. So -- but if we're starting projects today or in the last 6 months, I think that's a fair assumption. And that also goes into the calculus of is this the environment that you want to undertake major new projects in because not only do you have the costs up, but the availability of labor, to someone's question earlier, is that the risks are higher. And so the current copper price doesn't appropriately reflect what is required to get new projects developed. And that's the thing Richard was talking about earlier, where we've got a big disconnect. But our capital projects that we're doing today have been in progress for a long time. So -- and we've got a core amount of sustaining projects, and we do have some higher equipment and parts and those kinds of things. Some of the parts have affected OpEx. But we're not -- given where we are in our capital cycle, we don't have the inflation that someone brand new starting a new project would have today. No, it's not. Yes. We agreed with the EPC contractor to a target price, and we both share some risk in that. And we've got some contingencies, a good portion also when you think about the labor cost, local labor costs and where the dollar is. So that will help us if things stay with the way they are. But it's not a fixed price contract. It's got some risk sharing between the parties."

            "name": "Richard Adkerson",
            "content": "Thank you, Kathleen. Good morning to everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'm going to open up with some brief remarks about where Freeport is as a company. The second quarter was truly a tale of 2 cities for Freeport. We had very strong operations, and then we've had to deal with this sudden and unexpected significant decline in copper prices. For our operations, we executed our plans. We met our production targets. We met our unit production cost target as well of $1.41. And that was really supported by the ongoing success we've had at Grasberg in the 20-year effort to convert the open pit mine to the industry's largest underground operations. Grasberg has now returned as the second largest copper mine in the world, the largest single gold mine in the world, is 38% of our consolidated copper sales at Freeport. Our second quarter unit cost at PT-FI were below 0. Our gold revenue is fully funded our total operating cost and the success in this operation is a highlight in the careers of all of us associated with PT-FI. Our operations in America performed well. We maintained our positive outlook. As Kathleen will illustrate, I just cannot be more pleased with our global team and the way we operate in the second quarter. We executed the financial policy we established early last year. At that time, we set a debt target of $3 billion to $4 billion and an allocation of available cash flows between dividends, share buybacks and investments. We ended the quarter with a comparative debt amount of $1 billion. There was $600 million of Indonesian debt to separately finance there. Our debt reduced to that level simply because we weren't able, for timing reasons, market reasons, to spend money on expansions in accordance with the allocation. We've paid our base dividend and our supplemental dividend. We purchased FCX shares in the open market since we began that program. We purchased 48 million shares. We retired $750 million of debt in the open market at a discount. Our Board has now approved an increase in our buyback program authorization to 5 billion shares. We have roughly 3 billion shares remaining. Our financial policy is solid, and our execution is strong. But that's only one city. But it's an important one. The other side of the coin is markets. It's just striking how quickly and dramatically markets changed in the second quarter. Prior to this call, I went back and read analyst comments going into the quarter, and the optimism was widespread. Copper prices approached $5. Many were expecting it to go higher. We used $4.50 in our outlook. And now we have prices just above $3.25. Market sentiment reversed so dramatically. I read with interest the recent Bank of America investor survey of institutional investors where they described it as a full panic mode, the lowest expectation in the history of the survey going back to 1995 by investors. The economic analysts are debating on how significant in deterioration of the downturn. At Freeport, we hope for the best, we prepare for the worst. Our management team has experienced and successfully managed past downturns, all of which have been followed by significant recoveries. This is not our first rodeo. We have our playbook. We've dealt with this before. But this time, importantly, we have a strong balance sheet, and that will enable us to manage whatever we face in this marketplace. Our strong financial -- we will work to protect our strong financial condition, protect our assets, our growth opportunities for the bright future that lies ahead for copper. There is a disconnect in today's physical market and the current copper price. Our world in producing and selling copper, for us, feels about the same it did when copper was at $4.50. Customers report strong business. Copper inventories are at historical lows. There has been, to date, no significant impact in physical demand. Today's market is tight. Our strategy of being the world's foremost copper company is intact, and that's based on the long-term fundamentals of the demand and supply for copper. But the reality of today's copper price stares us squarely in the face. It's a major impact on our revenues and our cash flows. The outlook is uncertain. Analysts are calling in a range from a near-term major recession to a longer-term stagflation. Some see a less significant downturn with a near-term recovery. If that happens, we'll watch out. We at Freeport do not know what's going to happen near term. As I said, we hope for the best, prepare for the worst. Whatever happens, the long-term outlook for copper is bright. FCX is well positioned to be a major beneficiary. This -- the world is becoming increasingly electrified with the demand for copper growing as the world acts to reduce carbon emissions with electric vehicles and alternative power generations. S&P Global's Dan Yergin, a highly respected authority for many years in the energy business, recently published a report according to a doubling of copper demand because of the energy transition by 2035, accompanied by huge deficits. I encourage you to read this report. With the established need for the copper to support the world's economy, the future global growth, we're in a new era of copper demand with the energy transitions. Supplies for new copper are challenged. There is no clear line of sight for mine development to meet future demand. The result is, there has to be more scrap recovery, has to be conservation of substitution, more mines and expansions, more mines to develop expansions. But all of this takes years to execute, as you can see from our company. The results will be higher copper prices. The current price for copper is unsustainable. Absent a global long-term economic collapse, that is simply inevitable. And now Kathleen, I'll let you review the quarter and present the information we have in our slides. And anyway, we do have challenges with timing in Indonesia from time to time with the shallow water port that we have there. Rough seas can just delay loading and we, of course, record sales at the time of loading. And so that's just something we've had to deal with over the years. Well, Chris, in preparing for this call, I have made a concerted effort with my contacts in the industry, who are very knowledgeable of the business on the ground in China. To answer your direct question there because that was perplexing out. I inquired broadly about where their inventories in China that were not visible, what was going on with Chinese commodity trading companies, and the word came back that inventories were not building, it wasn't unusual trading. You're right, a couple of our mine and the other big mines increased, but there was also fly disruptions in Latin America during the quarter. And it appears that, that, in effect, balanced some of the Chinese demand issues. But we don't see our customers in China -- and we have a diverse customer base in Asia. We, by design, don't sell all of our copper into China, but into Japan and South Korea and Taiwan, and we don't see any impact on demand. So I understand your question, and I just want to share with you what I've been able to find from it, but we're just not seeing it in our business. Right. Even in Europe, our business there is strong. And I know the uncertainty space in Europe over this energy situation, so I'm not diminishing any of that. It's just our business is strong, as many customers over there are avoiding Russian copper. And so it is unusual, as I talked about. It is a disconnect. It's a serious disconnect right now between the physical marketplace that we're seeing and what's going on with copper prices. Well, in response to your question earlier and we had about that, I think everyone understands that we at Freeport have a broad range of operations with different cost structures. I mean that was really the whole basis for putting together Grasberg with the Phelps Dodge assets. It allows us to manage those assets more efficiently when you've got a asset like Grasberg to support it. When times get tough, historically, what we've done has been able to use Grasberg support all of our corporate G&A and our debt financing cost. And then we challenge each one of mines to operate as they minimum cash flow breakeven. And we review this mine by mine, and every mine makes that decision, our decisions to support achieving that objective. But then within the larger mines -- and I'll just use Morenci as an example, the largest mine in North America. They are individual mines, but what goes on in to reflect the current economics. It's a balancing act because decisions you make to do that have consequence -- manage all these operations ourselves, and we run our business in the Americas essentially as a single business unit. So we all get together, we find out what's working, what's not, what can be done, what -- and we balance the longer-term consequences with the need to meet current realities. And it is -- and as I said, we have the same basic team we've had that we've done this before. so we have a game plan for us doing it. And now our operators are ahead of us in occasions. Everybody knows what to do. Everybody is pitching in and acting as a team to deal with our corporate objectives. So it's not an easy question to say, is there a price where this happens with this mine, because it's an interactive process that cuts across all of our mines in the Americas. Of course, in Indonesia, we're going to produce as aggressively as we can safely and consistent with our long-term plans. And it's so great now to be ramped up to the extent we obviously got a couple of steps to do. But just 2 years ago, it was really scary when we were having volumes down there and the world was facing COVID. And we're so much better positioned now. So what we try to do at urging of a number of our shareholders last year was established a financial policy so that people knew what direction we were going in. And so we worked on it for months and finally came up with a policy that was announced about how we were allocating available cash flows, what was our debt targets, how are we allocating cash flows between shareholder returns and investments. There's always a challenge in the investment side of it because it takes so long to do it. So anyway, that's just part of the function. But we felt that -- and we discussed this with our Board, we felt that it was best to give the marketplace a direction since we've executed so much of our existing authorization, that we would have the availability to act for share buybacks when it was warranted by the marketplace. And I would be careful to say this because I'm not predicting anything. I mean clearly, my long career has taught me not to be confident in myself or others in predicting these short-term movements. But David, there is a scenario here with the market being so tight. And if things turn out not to be as dire as most expect now, there could be a dramatic recovery in copper prices, and that would translate to a recovery in Freeport's share price. And we want people to understand what we'd be prepared to do if the circumstances changed dramatically from where they are now or for most to predict. We're still going to run the business with the primary goal of protecting our assets and protecting our future because we believe the future -- we believe we're confident the future of this company is so bright Past actions by the company that they impair all at times. We're not going to do that this time. We're going to have discipline about it. But we wanted the market to know that we have this authorization available to us for us to execute when it makes sense. I mean maybe it's trite because most management say this, but our management and our Board truly believes that the fundamental value of Freeport is substantially higher than the stocks trading now. And growing volumes in Indonesia. I mean, with that cost structure, when it gets to be a greater proportion of consolidated numbers, that's a huge benefit. I want to get a shout out to our supply chain team that's just done a remarkable job in working with our suppliers in a difficult environment, not only from a cost standpoint, but from a delivery standpoint. And they've just done a great job in working directly hand-in-hand with our operations to do what we can to offset these challenges that are broadly across all businesses. Well, let me just add. The real focus is what Kathleen and Cory talked about is taking advantage of our existing leach operations. But with success, the future beyond that is really exciting about what we might do in terms of mining sulfide ores and processing them with this technology or looking at historical lead stacks. It is really exciting. Our whole team is really pumped up about it, very good to see. Our project is called leach to the last drop. Unquestionably, I mean you just think about the impact on corporate strategy, the amount of financing that's available for smaller projects. All -- this is just another element of the series of barriers to supply development that the industry had already faced. And unquestionably, I mean it was pointed out earlier in the discussion that for a company like ours is we got this really great project in Chile that's being delayed by the politic -- political situation there and the uncertainties about taxation. When you balance that out with a company like ours and potentially being able to buy your stock back so cheaply, that's going to happen. That's going to have an impact. The investment in this industry is just so long term, so long term, even for a project as straightforward as doubling our concentrator at Bagdad. That's a multiyear effort to go through the permitting, the planning process, the procurement process. So it's the long-term nature of this business and a head spinning move in prices like this is going to have an impact on those investment decisions. I don't know of any company that's just going to close their eyes and say that the market is so good in the future, we're just going to ignore this. You can't ignore it. I mean it's been such a dramatic decline, and there's still such uncertainties as to what's going to happen, that all of that is going to delay production investments and there was such a limited number of investments available out there anyway, it's just building towards this coming huge deficit in the copper markets. So Timna, thanks for the question. It's -- in looking at our situation, there's a lot of balancing of competing economics for these projects that come into play. The uncertainty at El Abra where we have a 50%, 51% interest, and we operate with Codelco as our partner, just means that, that is a burden on that project, whereas investments in the U.S., where Kathleen mentioned we own substantially all of our landing fees. So there's no royalties where we have a favorable income tax situation that's partially due to the tax legislation that's in place now and partially due to net operating loss carryforward we have from the oil and gas investment. And all the issues around community support and what you have to provide in international operations affects that balance that we have. And Kucing Liar is different because it's just a clear-cut fit into our long-term plan for managing the available ore. Grasberg -- and by the way, I might mention, Emily, you had your report today a question about extending the 4041 deadline there. We're in early discussions. I think we have a pathway forward, but we have a proceed with that. And that is something that would benefit all stakeholders and also open that whole area for further exploration, which has been limited because of the 2041 deadline under our existing operating rights. So it's not an easy question to say, but it's a balancing off on all these things. And right now, the leach focus is not -- it's going to be affected by economics, timing of bag, that maybe the Lone Star project, the near-term expansions are going well and they have some more opportunities there. The sulfide is longer term and then El Abra is the 1 that's really challenged. Beyond that, we have further opportunities in the U.S. at Morenci and at our other mines. But -- what I really like about our company is we have this huge pipeline of projects. The nearest term will take time rather than leaching which will come quicker. But Beyond that, we have such great resources that are available to us beyond reserves. And over time, those will come into reserves. And so this company is sustainable for a very long period of time, without having to do anything else, without having to do anything else. But the decisions about timing and when to come and so forth, has a lot of moving parts, and that got -- it's just gotten more complicated by seeing this 30% drop in copper prices and not knowing what's going to happen in the next 2 to 3 years globally. So it had an impact on us, and it will have an impact on other companies. Yes. And that's just our philosophy and planning overall. We don't like -- we develop an outlook and a plan based on current prices, and then we look at a number of different scenarios for what might happen if that varies. But we don't go into any kind of economic analysis. Our sales are coming up with predictions on the future. Have heard long ago that's a dead man's game. And so we just use current prices and then look at scenarios of -- I'll say this, for those of you who followed the company a long time, you've heard me say about the correlation between our input costs and copper prices that's been there. And that's 1 of the rationales we've always used for not hedging. This current market has disrupted some of those longstanding traditional relationships. Energy is the most significant one, and that's changing. And every day, you see that changing. So we're just having to -- we have to approach this with prudence, with an overall goal of protecting this great set of assets we have and protecting the future that I think is going to be so great for our company. So we're going into that mode that we've followed before of really aggressively managing our business as the world around us changes. With you, and this is obviously -- the biggest risk to our business right now is, is the future demand going to drop off a cliff because of a global recession. And that's what the market -- the market is pricing that in, in large part right now because that's what the expectation was. I mean, look at that Bank of America survey that they did, 80% of the people were projecting bad times. But we haven't had that yet. But that's the risk to our business. If the dire expectations about recession occur, demand will fall off. We can adjust to it. We're not going to put our company at risk. And that's why we're going to be very prudent about the way we manage capital, manage operations and manage our financial policy. I'm such a big believer in copper. I have this urge to be a lot more entrepreneur about it. But history has taught me we need to be really prudent to protect ourselves in case things happen that put us at risk, and we're not going to do that. I'm just not going to do it. Well, let's see, you mentioned people. We made substantial cuts in personnel just over 2 years ago with the COVID issue. We did that. We always treat people fairly. It was mostly between incentivized retirements or incentivized terminations and so forth, and we were very attractive with doing that. By the way, we have carried over some really efficient benefits in our G&A cost. And what we learned during that period of time about not needing to travel as much and working efficiently with our people. I encourage all of you to go back and look at the history of Freeport's G&A and just see what progress we made with it. John, we're actively looking for technical people. I mean we're not talking about cutting back technical people at all because this opportunity with leaching with data analytics, which is used in leaching, but in the rest of our business. And my experience has shown you find good technical people, you can -- they'll create value for you. So steady state, maybe that's one way of saying it now that with Grasberg being where it is with its ramp-up, we're still working on a mill enhancement there, power issues. We're dealing with our power plant there. And we have some other investments made, but we're at our run rate. And clearly, the expansions are being affected by today's copper price. So yes, we're just focused on staying in a strong financial position, keeping all of our options open and being prepared to act when time makes sense. And the timing of that PT-FI $3 billion financing was very fortuitous. Now I was just looking at this this morning and what we issued it with and what today's interest rates are for those bonds that are trading. It was great that Kathleen and our team have done when they got it done. Yes. It's the nature of what we're spending money on. And like Kathleen said, where we are in the cycle. And supply chain issues are still real too, and that would be a very daunting thing to think about as you were undertaking a $6 billion, $7 billion new project in this industry. Just coming back -- it just keep coming back that the supply chain -- I mean, the supply barriers to develop copper to meet this demand are really significant. You just -- you think about we've had high copper prices now for 20 years. And just look at what the industry has tried to spend and develop and what's been developed. And now you've got these new things that are coming in, you can't wipe away community environmental concerns just because the world needs copper. You have all the social issues that are competing for the populations in Latin America and problems -- we in the U.S. benefit because we have greenfield expansions, but you see the problems of trying to build -- I mean, brownfield expansions. You see the problems in trying to build a greenfield expansions here in the U.S., they're just daunting. I've just never seen anything like it and it's just so clear to me after looking at our commodities businesses and actual resource business is now for all these decades about where the copper business is and what the future lies ahead for us. And just why I'm so excited about what our companies will benefit from the assets, people experience, how we do things. So it's going to be a great future. No. Let me just say, you all know how I feel on what's the basis for our company's strategy. So what -- if any of you -- and I'm asking this question broadly within the industry with all my contacts, but any of you on this call and follow our company so closely. If you have a different view about the fundamental outlook for the business, just call me directly. I'd be very interested in hearing it. One thing the reality is that I certainly recognize is that even with institutional investors, their views of the -- of their investments are much more short run than what Freeport's view is of how we have to invest for the future of this copper business. But I'm really interested in hearing contrary views, if any of you would like to share them with me. And with that, we thank you all, it's exciting and we look forward to reporting in the next quarter and seeing how this world unfolds. It's going to be very interesting. Thank you all."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, President. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nKathleen Quirk: Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan conference call. Earlier this morning, we reported first quarter 2022 operating and financial results, and a copy of our press release and slides are available on our website at fcx.com.  Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call, and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today.  Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. I'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our annual report on Form 10-K.  On the call with me today are Richard Adkerson, our Chairman and CEO. I'd also like to welcome Maree Robertson, our new CFO. She's joining us today on the call, and Maree joined us in March. We're delighted to have her on our team. Mark Johnson is on, who is the COO of our Indonesian business; Josh Olmsted, who is the COO of our Americas business; Mike Kendrick is on, who runs our global molybdenum business; and Steve Higgins is also on today, our Chief Administrative Officer.  Richard is going to start by making some opening comments and then we'll be going through the slide materials and the outlook included in our slide materials. So Richard, I'll turn it to you.\nRichard Adkerson: Yes. Thanks, Kathleen. We're going to follow a new format for our earnings presentation today. This format reflects the current position of our company after years, literally years of having to deal with significant company-specific problems that are now largely behind us.  We have a clear mission in Freeport, and that is to be foremost in copper. I will make some very brief opening comments. Kathleen will review our positive first quarter results, our positive outlook, and then we'll be available to answer questions. The case for copper as a commodity is strong. I've been saying this for 20 years, but it's never been better.  Demand is growing globally. Globally, growth is no longer dependent solely on China. With COVID recovery, infrastructure spending, the spread of electricity everywhere, it's generating significant growth in Europe. Business is strong in the U.S. and in Asia, outside China.  The coming demand for carbon reduction and its impact on copper demand is truly extraordinary, and it's coming. It's beginning, but it's not here now. Copper supply development for many reasons is challenging. As I said recently, the supply challenge can't be solved simply by higher prices.  I find it notable that the price of copper today is $4.50 in a world where there are a whole series of economic headwinds. Many of these are transitory. Higher copper prices in the future are likely, and I'm very comfortable with Freeport's strategy of focusing this business on copper. Our strategy to achieve our mission of being foremost in copper straightforward.  We will execute our operating plan safely and responsibly. We have an unmatched set of globally diverse copper-producing assets. We are taking advantage of emerging technology involving data analytics, new work practices and increasingly important advancing and leaching technology where Freeport is well positioned as a global leader in leaching.  We will be developing organic growth projects in a disciplined way over time from our large set of undeveloped resources. We will execute our financial plan, maintain our currently strong balance sheet while returning significant cash to shareholders. Other opportunities for Freeport may arise, and we are positioned to take advantage if they do, but our strategy is focused internally.  Here's a few points I suggest you note in Kathleen's presentation. Look at our strong execution of our plans in the first quarter. Look at our success in meeting the challenges of higher input costs, both through effective cost management and the benefit of past strategic decision.  For example, the long-term development of Grasberg mine and its high copper and gold grades, higher gold grades or higher gold prices are helping to offset input cost increases. Note, our positive situation in Indonesia. With our partner, shareholder MIND ID with the government of Indonesia, local communities and workforce. We worked hard to achieve this.  Our environmental performance in a very challenging location is exemplary in Indonesia. The financial results are spectacular, reflecting the good work of our PT-FI team and literally 3 decades of efforts and investments getting to where we are today. We're progressing with the development of a new large-scale smelter in Indonesia.  Our recent international bond financing at PT-FI was a major milestone for our company. Our team achieved investment-grade ratings and a strong market reception for this $3 billion financing.  Looking back years ago, I would have envisioned our ability to do this. 2/3 of our copper is produced in the Americas, where our team is operating effectively and where we have significant growth for the future. And finally, I want to briefly note steps we have taken this past year to build a high-quality sustainable Board of Directors and a sustainable management team for the future. These are commitments I personally made to myself a year ago when I became Chairman.  We've added 6 new directors in a year, and you'll be able to see the details on this in our proxy, which will soon be available. Four of these 6 are individuals with significant international large company CEO experience, 2 have significant business and financial expertise. Together with the 4 continuing independent directors, we now have a high-quality Board, one that Freeport has long deserved. Building this Board is a highlight in my personal professional career.  At the same time, we made important changes to our management team. Kathleen mentioned that Maree has recently joined us as our CFO. At a young age, she has a distinguished career in international mining. We've made a number of transitions of important positions with internal promotions and added significant capabilities with external hires, particularly in the ESP area.  We now have a younger, more diverse management team at Freeport. They are great people who embrace a special culture we have with the Freeport Global family. I'm personally excited about continuing as a member of this team, blessed to be in good health and energy. I am confident now that Freeport now has a Board and management team that is capable of achieving our mission and executing our strategy beyond my tenure.  With that, Kathleen, I'll turn it over to you.\nKathleen Quirk: Thank you, Richard. And I'll start on Slide 3. Richard mentioned, we had a really good first quarter. Slide 3 summarizes the highlights. We achieved meaningful growth in volumes and margins which translated into strong cash flows and significant cash returns to shareholders.  Our copper and gold sales were 24% higher for copper than the year ago quarter and 59% higher for gold than the year ago quarter. Our copper sales were 6% above our guidance going into the year. We benefited from strong U.S. demand in the quarter, which allowed us to reduce inventories.  Our gold sales were also above our plan, 8%. After reaching the targeted metal run rates in late 2021, Grasberg is operating well and sustaining the high-volume, low-cost operation.  Our average unit net cash cost for the quarter of $1.33 per pound came in under our guidance in the first quarter and below the year ago quarterly average. This is particularly impressive given the cost pressures affecting all of us and allowed us to generate strong margins with average copper realizations of $4.66 per pound during the quarter. Notably, Grasberg's costs were a net credit of $0.06 per pound in the quarter.  Richard referenced this earlier, but this means that the gold revenues more than offset all of our cash production costs at the site. We generated adjusted EBITDA of $3.4 billion in the quarter; and adjusted net income, excluding nonrecurring charges of $1.6 billion or $1.07 per share for the first quarter.  We generated very strong operating cash flows, totaling $1.7 billion. This was net of about $800 million in working capital uses, primarily reflecting the timing of our cash taxes. Our cash flow significantly exceeded our capital spending and that allowed us to return substantial cash to shareholders while maintaining a strong balance sheet.  We continued our share repurchase program during the quarter, funded nearly $600 million of share purchases. Since starting the program in November of last year, we have purchased 27 million shares at an average cost of approximating $42 per share. We're $1.1 billion into the program out of a total of $3 billion.  Our total share repurchases and common stock dividends, which doubled from the last year's rate, approached $800 million in the first quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong. Net debt was $1.3 billion at the end of the quarter. About half of this relates to financing of the Indonesian smelter project, which is advancing.  As Richard said, as we look forward, we're enthusiastic about the embedded opportunities our asset can bring to supply the world's rising demand for copper. With several projects, we are progressing with near-term, medium-term and longer-term horizons. We're continuing to dedicate significant resources to our sustainability objectives and now lead the industry with 9 of our operating sites certified under the Copper Mark. We have a strong foundation for success. We're executing our strategy very effectively, and we'll continue to focus on delivering on our plans.  Slide 4 is just a summary of the recent reports that we filed, our annual report to shareholders and just today filing our 2021 sustainability report. Our theme for our recent annual report is titled Electrifying the Future, and it highlights our assets and the prominent role that Freeport has in supplying modern uses for copper.  We also published the sustainability report. This marks our 21st year of reporting on our sustainability programs. As a leader in the industry, we also want to lead in our reporting and transparency in this important area. We really hope you'll have the opportunity to review the report in detail, it's available on our website.  We're proud of the work we're doing. It's embedded in all of our business plans and supports our responsible production practices. On Slide 5, we had a neat deal earlier this month. We celebrated PT Freeport Indonesia's 55th anniversary. We've operated at this same site for more than 5 decades, and we've developed one of the industry's most prominent operations, providing tens of thousands of jobs and meaningful economic impacts to the Indonesian government and province of Papua.  As Richard mentioned, we've invested heavily over the years to create a modern, world-class operation there that will benefit all stakeholders for decades to come. We lead the industry in technology, supporting our large-scale block cave mining. And as Richard mentioned, with our new partnership with the government established in 2018 and our committed and focused team, we're enthusiastic about the future for this exceptional mining district.  Turning to markets. Richard covered this in his comments, we view the fundamental outlook of the copper business is very positive, supported by copper's role in the global economy, a renewed focus on infrastructure, connectivity and copper's essential role in meeting global decarbonization targets.  The demand trends are broad-based and global in nature. We see this continuing and accelerating with the increased intensity of use for copper associated with modern applications. Many are predicting we're in the early stages of a multiyear period of rising demand.  Over the last decade, most of the growth in demand has come from China. As Richard mentioned, we're now seeing a major expansion of growth and demand for copper for infrastructure spending and decarbonization from Western world economies. The scarcity of new mine supply development is growing at a time when demand is rising.  The project pipeline of actional development opportunities is significantly lower than it has been historically. Beyond the projects which are being completed now, there's a real absence of new supply development necessary to meet estimated demand increases. The current physical markets are tight, as evidenced by the low level of inventories on global exchanges. Supply chain continues to be stretched.  While we'll see macro factors such as China's economy, geopolitical considerations and actions by the Fed impacting sentiment, the low level of inventories and supply limitations sets us up for a scenario of higher prices in the future.  We're in a great position at Freeport as a responsible producer of scale and the strategies Richard outlined focused on copper, long-lived reserves and future growth options, the prospects are bright for our portfolio become more scarce and highly valued in the future.  I'll comment a little bit about some details of our first quarter operations, moving to Slide 7. In the U.S., the Lone Star mine continues to perform well above design capacity. As you remember, we commissioned the mine in late 2020 and produced 265 million pounds of copper in 2021, a 30% increase from the original design.  We're expanding further to take us to 300 million pounds per annum by 2023 with an investment of roughly $250 million. As we accelerate the mining of oxide ores at Lone Star, this will expose a much larger sulfide opportunity for us in the future. At Morenci, our largest mine in the North American portfolio, we completed the restart of our mill in March. We've been ramping up for several months and are now running at capacity.  With the rise in COVID cases early in the quarter, our mining rates were constrained, resulting in the reduction in annual production compared with our prior expectations. We are back on track. We expect Morenci to produce 7% more copper in 2022 compared with last year.  As Richard mentioned, we're also advancing our leach recovery initiatives. We're focused at Morenci using data analytics, and new technologies to enhance our leach production. This is a significant value-enhancing opportunity for Freeport, and we'll be reporting progress on this initiative as we go through the year.  At Bagdad, we are advancing our plans for what we're calling the Bagdad 2x project to double production at this mine in Northwest Arizona. We're advancing studies and planning to commence early works, principally for mine equipment and additional stripping in parallel with the studies.  Turning to South America. The teams have done exceptional work navigating the pandemic. When things started to improve in late '21, we had a spike in cases in January and February in Peru, that did have an impact on our mining rates in the first quarter by about 10%. Situation improved significantly in March, we expect to reach our targeted mill rates of 400,000 tons per day in the balance of the year. The lower mining rate in the first quarter is expected to have a small impact on our 2022 production at Cerro Verde compared with our prior plans, but we still see 8% growth in Cerro Verde production in 2022 compared with 2021.  We continue to target a full restoration at Cerro Verde this year and be on our way back to 1 billion pounds per annum from this large-scale operation. El Abra has been successful in Chile in increasing the stacking rate of material on its leach pad. We expect a 30% increase in 2022 production at El Abra and to sustain a level of 200 million to 250 million pounds per annum for the next several years, as we assess opportunities for future growth.  At Grasberg, we sustained our large-scale metal production after reaching our targeted metal run rate in the fourth quarter of last year. We achieved higher gold recoveries compared with our plan, which contributed to a favorable variance for the quarter.  Our 2022 volumes are consistent with our prior forecast for Grasberg. We incorporated some relatively small adjustments for changes in mine sequencing in Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ, but the 5-year metal forecast is generally consistent with prior expectations. We're advancing mill projects to provide additional capacity targeted for the second half of next year.  We're diversifying our power sources in Indonesia, and we're advancing the long-term development for Kucing Liar. The team there is doing outstanding work and managing and sustaining the largest and most profitable underground operation in the world.  On the next slide, Richard touched upon the leach opportunities we have at Freeport. And this is a major initiative ongoing that we have to extract more value from our historical leach stockpiles. This could unlock significant value for us by increasing production from material already mined and placed on to stockpiles.  In the context of an industry where new projects can take 10 years to develop, this is a significant opportunity for us to bring the equivalent of a new mine on stream in a fraction of the time it takes to develop with a fraction of the carbon footprint, very little incremental capital and operating costs. So a tremendous value opportunity for us, and we're pursuing it with urgency.  During the first quarter, we commenced the process to insulate our leach stockpiles to retain heat. Heat is proven to improve leach recoveries and work to date has indicated the potential to incrementally add to our production in the near term. We're also enhancing our processes with the use of data analytics. This tool is providing new insights and opportunities.  We're working on internal technologies for additives, as well as with third parties who have proprietary technologies. We're optimistic that these collective initiatives have the opportunity to add an incremental 100 million to 200 million pounds of copper across our Americas portfolio in the near term.  Early success will enable us to optimize and expand this potential moving forward. As you'll see in the charts, we currently estimate 38 billion pounds of copper in our stockpiles, which already has been mined, but this is not included in our reserves or production plans.  A significant portion of this opportunity is at our flagship Morenci mine and our cross-functional team of technical experts, metallurgists, mine planners, data scientists, geologists and business analysts are all working together to take full advantage of this great opportunity for us.  The leach opportunity is just one facet of our growth, and Richard touched upon what we'll be focusing on as we go forward. We have multiple options -- looking at Slide 9, multiple options for brownfield, low-risk growth across the portfolio.  Recall, we have over 190 billion pounds of copper mineral resources in our portfolio in addition to the proven and probable reserves of over 100 billion pounds of copper. We talked about the leach opportunity and the ongoing oxide expansion at Lone Star, these are near-term opportunities to add incremental production in a 12- to 18-month time frame.  In the medium term, we're highly optimistic that we'll double the size of Bagdad in the 2026 time frame. We expect to complete the feasibility study in the first half of next year and be in a position to commence construction activities. Longer term, we have the massive Lone Star sulfide opportunity of 50 billion pound copper resource in our established mining area in Eastern Arizona.  The El Abra project in Chile has a resource approaching 30 billion pounds. We've done a lot of work in identifying an operation that could produce over 700 million pounds of copper per annum. We're closely monitoring the developments in Chile, and we'll defer our decision for the time being, pending the results of the ongoing constitutional work that's being done in the country.  At Kucing Liar in the Grasberg district, it's a natural extension of our operations. This will allow us to continue our large-scale operation in Papua for decades to come. We believe the world will need our projects in the future. We have a long track record of success in qualifying and developing projects in an efficient, responsible manner.  And this is enhanced by our industry-leading technical capabilities, our established license to operate and our strong franchises in our areas of focus. Looking at our sales profile on Slide 10, this is the annual sales for the next few years that we update each quarter.  The outlook for volumes is largely in line with our prior forecast and the execution of our plans is on track. We have insignificant changes to our prior guidance for copper sales for 2022 and 2023 in the 1% range. That principally reflects the COVID downtime experienced in the Americas earlier this year and some timing changes at Grasberg between 2023 and 2025.  After delivering a 19% increase in copper sales in 2021, we're projecting a 12% increase in 2022, reflecting higher production across the portfolio and further growth in 2023. We estimate about 36% of our sales for this year will come from our U.S. mines, 27% from South America and 37% from Indonesia.  On Slide 11, there's been a lot of discussion about cost pressures in our industry. The cost pressures that we're facing -- that the entire industry is facing this year are well-documented. Energy and other commodity-related inputs such as sulfuric acid, explosives, grinding media and other consumables have increased. We'll continue to work to manage and mitigate these impacts to the extent possible. We also benefit from the fact that our byproduct credits, particularly for gold, provide mitigation.  We show a reconciliation of our prior unit net cash for 2022 estimates based on our January estimates compared to our current estimates. We've updated all of our plans to incorporate recent commodity pricing and our latest operating plans. You'll see here that half of the unit cost increase is offset by stronger gold prices and production.  Bottom line, unit cash costs are up about $0.09 per pound of copper or an approximate 7% increase. These numbers were built off a copper price assumption that was $0.25 per pound above the prior plan. But we're looking today at $4.70 copper at current market with a cash cost of $1.44 estimated for this year, which will generate very strong margins for us.  We show, on the next slide, Slide 12, the significant cash flow generation at various prices. This is a great strength of Freeport, a big exposure to copper markets and the large-scale nature of our existing capacity. We're in an enviable position with our significant new production that we brought online in recent quarters. And we show on the slide, Slide 12, the significance of cash flow generation using our volume and cost estimates and prices ranging from $4 to $5 copper.  These are modeled results using the average of 2023 and 2024 with current volume and cost estimates. In our annual EBITDA, these prices from $4 to $5 per pound, prices are closer to $5 today than $4 would average over $11 billion at $4 copper to nearly $16 billion per annum at $5 copper. And operating cash flows very strong, ranging from over $8 billion to approach $12 billion at $5 copper.  Also on the chart, we've got sensitivities to various commodities. We can't predict prices, but the long-term fundamentals of our business indicate the prospects for higher copper prices. And as we go forward, you can note that each $0.25 per pound change in copper equates to over $1 billion in annual EBITDA.  We'll generate significant free cash flow. We expect this to continue with cash flows significantly above our capital spending. And you'll see the capital spending on Slide 13. These are largely unchanged from our prior guidance. We're forecasting some offsetting timing differences between 2022 and 2023. And I've also included some early equipment purchases for our Bagdad expansion project in 2023, as well as ramping up the Kucing Liar project.  Both of these projects are designated as discretionary projects for purposes of our available cash returns framework. We've got a tracking of the discretionary category included for your reference in the appendix. Roughly 25% of our capital spend over the next 2 years is associated with value-enhancing projects.  These projects all have solid financial returns and operational benefits, and we'll use a portion of the 50% of free cash flow we are earmarking for organic investments toward these discretionary projects. I'll also note, and you'll see this in the slide, we've got a large decrease in spend on the Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ from 2022 to 2023, totaling $500 million.  So as those projects are being fully developed, we'll see our planned capital expenditures coming down. The next slide, we provide an update on our activities for the smelter. We were engaged in detailed engineering and procurement and early construction activities are advancing with pilings and concrete installation.  We've got about 2,000 workers now on site, and that will grow to over 10,000 workers next year. We've got some updated photos for your reference in the appendix. And as we've been talking about for some time, this project is important for PT Freeport Indonesia and the Indonesian government. We are focused on completing the project as efficiently and timely as possible.  Richard mentioned the successful bond offering we did earlier this month, raised $3 billion to support the cost of the smelter, long-term financing, average duration of roughly 14 years and an average cost of 5.4%. Richard mentioned the investor response, it was very positive and reflects the strength of PT-FI's underlying business.  The cost of this financing is largely offset by a phaseout of the 5% export duty. So the economic impact of the smelter is not material. Turning to the balance sheet. It's a core focus of ours and has been for the last several years. We've made meaningful progress in reducing our debt and our whole financial policy is centered around maintaining a strong balance sheet.  We reduced our debt just over the last 12 months by nearly $4 billion, and our EBITDA continues to grow. Our free cash flow is significant, as you've seen, with growing volumes, positive markets and low capital requirements. We are in a fantastic position to execute the strategy of maintaining a strong balance sheet, investing in our long-term future and returning substantial cash to shareholders.  Last slide that we'll cover is a summary of the financial policy. On Slide 16, we show a scorecard of our shareholder returns. Those have increased meaningfully with a period of strong execution and balance sheet improvement. We began implementing the Board-authorized performance payout policy in November of last year. The combination of our share purchase program with dividends are designed to distribute 50% of our cash flow after capital expenditures, excluding the smelter investments and discretionary projects.  Since November of 2021, when we began to implement the program, we've utilized about 1/3 of the authorized $3 billion share purchase program. We've purchased 27 million shares, common stock at an average cost of just under $42 per share. We also have a variable dividend component in our common stock dividends for 2022. This is double the base dividend and the first payment at this higher rate was made in the first quarter of this year.  Our Board will have the opportunity to consider additional actions as we progress the program further. I mentioned in the first quarter alone, returns to shareholders totaled nearly $800 million. With a continuation of favorable market conditions, solid execution of our plans, we expect shareholder returns to continue to be strong.  As Richard mentioned, we have exceptional opportunities in our business. As a team, we are meeting the challenges and embracing the opportunities. Our future is very bright, and we at Freeport are electrifying the future, and we're going to do this responsibly, reliably and relentlessly.  So that's a summary of our quarter and outlook. And now we'd like to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Chris LaFemina with Jefferies.\nChristopher LaFemina: Question about, Kathleen, you mentioned the sensitivities and every $0.25 per pound change in copper is about $1 billion in annualized EBITDA. But then on the slide where you show the new 2022 cost guidance, I think it's a $0.09 per pound increase in guidance. And you said that there was a $0.25 per pound increase in your price assumption when you derive that guidance.  So the question is, if we think about changes in the copper price, should we assume that a $0.25 increase in the price fully translates into that $1 billion of EBITDA? Or do we need to adjust that for some sort of cost increase as well? And if we do, how much of a cost increase should we expect to reach $0.25? In other words, is that $0.09 per pound increase in costs associated with the 25% increase in price, kind of the way we should think about cost and prices moving together? I'm not sure if that question makes sense, but I'm just trying to understand the sensitivity to prices and costs.\nKathleen Quirk: Yes. We understand the question. The sensitivities that we show are just in terms of the copper price without having changes in input prices. I think right now, what we're seeing is increases that are unusual, correlations that are unusual. Energy prices have risen in some of these other commodities like sulfuric acid and the explosives and things like that, all reflecting kind of a geopolitical situation.  I don't think the long-term trends, if you look at the correlation between copper prices and some of these inputs, are as dramatic as what we're seeing this year. Time will tell, we'll see, but we don't expect to see these kinds of $0.09 increases for $0.25 move in copper prices. It will depend on, obviously, the fundamentals of each commodity.  But right now, some of the commodities are moving in a direction differently on a short-term basis because of what we're seeing in the Russia-Ukraine situation.\nChristopher LaFemina: And just a follow-up to that. And going back to the China cycle, obviously, many years ago, but was the cost inflation that you saw then very different from what you're seeing today? In other words, do you think that the war is having a disproportionate impact on cost inflation today? Or are we just seeing generally typical cost inflation that we get in bull markets and commodities?\nRichard Adkerson: Well, if you go back, I'll talk about three years of copper demand, when copper was correlated to industrial production before China emerged in roughly 2003 as the China era, and now we're in a new era of copper prices, it's been various factors.  Back when copper was cyclical and driven by industrial production in the developed world, there was a correlation between prices. But then when China emerged and copper prices went from a dip below $0.70 and went to $4 in a short period of time when nobody was expected, there wasn't a correlation with prices.  Today, it is affected by the dislocations caused by Russia and the situation in Ukraine, particularly with oil and gas prices, I mean, and you'll just have to reach your own judgment of how sustainable that is or how much is the impact of the current situation. But there are other commodities, it's having an impact on copper prices, but Russia was a relatively small producer of copper globally of 3%, 4% and regionally affected markets and the market is so tight, it has an impact, but other commodities are being more effective than copper.  And as I said, many of these things, I believe, are transitory. So we're taking steps where we can to control prices. Copper prices are rising faster than cost for us. So our profitability is growing, and we're encouraged about that continuing into the future.\nKathleen Quirk: Yes, our diesel costs that we went into the year with our plan of roughly $2.50 a gallon. We've increased that in this most recent guidance by about 40%. And normally, we would not see that kind of dislocation. And when we look at the long-term trends of diesel prices and copper prices, we normally wouldn't see that.  So same holds for some of the fertilizers and ammonia nitrate, the product we use for explosives, has gone up a lot, as sulfuric acid has as well. And we believe a lot of those are up just generally because of commodity prices, but the Ukraine and Russia situation has exacerbated some of that. So we don't see it as a long-term cost in our structure at those levels.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Emily Chieng with Goldman Sachs.\nEmily Chieng: My first question is a little bigger picture in nature and related to how you're thinking about growth. Perhaps how have increasing steel costs, raw materials, consumables and labor change, the business case, if at all, when you think about sanctioning brownfield and greenfield production longer term?\nRichard Adkerson: Emily, those really aren't driving factors on our investment decisions. The resources that we have are just economically not that sensitive to even these kind of price increases. So we -- our timing issue on the brownfield development projects is, one related to engineering and permitting and community relations and things like that.  These are things that affect supply development across the industry, and it's a double-edged sword of copper. It's a major factor of why copper prices are so strong. So we'll factor in the higher prices, but when we undertake a project, the investment decision is not going to be driven by those factors, but by others. For example, in Chile, we're awaiting making investment decision on El Abra, which is a great project, but there's a lot of uncertainties about the government policy towards mining in Chile. And so that's what we're monitoring before we make -- proceed with an investment decision there.\nKathleen Quirk: And Emily, the leaching opportunity that we have, we don't have exposure to steel and structural costs for that opportunity. And that's why we're really pushing that with a sense of urgency because that really is very low capital intensity and operating cost intensity that will translate right to our bottom line if we can crack that code.  So it's the equivalent of bringing on a new mine without having all the capital costs. So that is -- that would be a really, really strong thing for us as a company if we can continue to advance the leaching opportunity.\nRichard Adkerson: And on position, how well positioned Freeport is to take advantage of that -- those advancements. We're the largest leaching operation in the world. Morenci is the largest single mine from leaching, and it's been part of our company's experience for decades. So we're really excited about it.\nEmily Chieng: Great. That makes a lot of sense. And just real quick, if I can follow up on labor markets? And I appreciate any color that you have on the labor cost component than some of that might be higher profit sharing. But anything that you can share on the workforce outlook or labor availability would be helpful. I'll leave it at that.\nRichard Adkerson: Well, thanks, Emily, and I'll let Kathleen follow up. But we do have a special situation with our large workforce in Peru, where under government laws and regulations, there is a mandated profit-sharing plan. And so as profits goes up, their workers automatically benefit in higher wages as part of that process. But Kathleen, why don't you follow up generally on labor cost elsewhere?\nKathleen Quirk: Yes. The main thing that we're experiencing, Emily, in terms of labor is really focused more in the U.S., the main issue. We -- it's a very competitive job environment, as you've seen. We've got significant job openings in our U.S. operations. We've been supplementing our workforce with outside contractors to help us with projects and capacity assurance.  And so really, you're seeing more utilization of contractors right now. But we have made some progress in hiring in the first quarter. We've been -- and have had a number of openings for several months, and we're starting to make progress in the first quarter and getting these positions filled. So -- but I'd say it's more a matter of tightness in terms of availability of people as opposed to really big increases in wage rates.  We have increased our wage rates, and we've provided some supplements and incentives for people. But the main thing has been we've had to use higher price contractors until we get all these positions filled. We aren't seeing the same kind of issues in Indonesia. And Richard mentioned, the Peru impacts with profit sharing.  We just signed a new contract labor agreement, both in Indonesia and in Peru and the labor situation there is much easier than it is in the U.S.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Orest Wowkodaw from Scotiabank.\nOrest Wowkodaw: Just following up on the outlook for costs. And specifically, I was wondering if there is a big lag impact on seeing higher cost flow through? And I don't know if that's from previous contracts that you may have for things for some of the input costs like explosives and fuel? And whether there's still, I guess, this lagging impact that we should see -- if current costs stay where they are, whether we could see a fairly significant rise in your cost base as we approach closer to the end of this year?\nRichard Adkerson: That's really not a significant factor. I mean there may be a short-term contract that gets renegotiated. But costs -- the cost you see are essentially the current costs that we're experiencing now.\nKathleen Quirk: Yes. And we -- so the outlook that you have reflects our current estimate. Each quarter, we update all of our operating plans and cost input. So what you're seeing in the latest outlook for the year is based on the market prices when we prepare this forecast just recently.\nRichard Adkerson: And while there's uncertainties, my expectation is we're facing kind of the height of dislocations from global supply chains to other factors. COVID shutdown in China and situation in Ukraine, so my personal expectation is rather than seeing costs going up in the future, we'll see them come down. But time will tell.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Hacking from Citi.\nAlex Hacking: Can you hear me? \nRichard Adkerson: We can.\nAlex Hacking: Okay. Sorry. Sorry, Richard, I had a problem with my handset there. So let me just play devil's advocate on the growth side. If you look at your production profile, it does peak in 2023 with some declines in '24-'25 in Grasberg and elsewhere, bag that leaching opportunities, are these -- are these more of keeping the production at the current 4.5 billion pound level? Or can they really kind of generate a growth CAGR? And here, I guess I'm setting aside the multibillion dollar sulfide projects.\nKathleen Quirk: In the near term, Alex, you're right. I mean in the near term, what we've got is these leach opportunities. And like I said, it takes 7, 10 years to build a new mine. And -- so these leach opportunities really can fill in the near term.  Longer term, we're really looking at growth coming from this big potential we have at Lone Star and also El Abra. We hadn't made a decision on El Abra yet, but that 700 million pounds-plus of new production and the Lone Star sulfide would be a meaningful amount of increase as well.  But -- I mean, it's a feature of other copper market. It's very, very challenging to develop new supplies, and it takes many years to do it. We've had significant growth in 2021, again in 2022, but it's not common in our industry to see that kind of growth in copper production, and that's really what underpins the fundamental outlook for it.\nRichard Adkerson: And Alex, that's 1 thing I've been trying to get across to policymakers and others who follow our industry, just about how long term the copper business is. I participated in Cambridge Energies, the CERAWeek down in Houston with oil and gas companies, and everybody was asking the oil and gas companies about the time for response to production, and they were talking about it, the executives with the energy companies were saying, \"Well, it's a long-term business. It takes months to respond.\"  And I said, \"Well, copper takes years to respond.\" And so that's why I pointed out at Grasberg, and there was a lot of pressure on us to -- for periods of time to delay development of the Grasberg underground, as we were talking with the Government of Indonesia about our contract rights. But had we done that, we wouldn't have had this production available to us.  And so what we're looking at when we talk about growth, is growth from a very long-term basis. And it's one of the reasons why we have a favorable copper price, and why, I believe copper prices are going to go higher. I mean we're seeing companies across our energy industry today being challenged with meeting their production targets.  We've done that. But it's going -- all of that's going to be supportive of prices. And as I said, I'm really struck by having today's copper price in the kind of global market with headwinds that would normally lead to lower prices.\nAlex Hacking: Great. And congrats on being one of the few in the copper industry that's actually hitting your production targets.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lawson Winder from Bank of America Securities.\nLawson Winder: If I could maybe ask on capital allocation and M&A. One of your partners in Cerro Verde recently divested of its minority interest in another gold mine in Peru. And it just got me wondering that with Freeport, would you guys be open to increasing your interest in Cerro Verde, should the opportunity emerge? And I'm asking particularly in light of the political situation there.\nRichard Adkerson: Yes. We would. It's just such a great asset. Funny historical story before the Phelps Dodge deal. I called the Phelps Dodge CEO when he sold down originally interest in Cerro Verde.  At a time when they needed production, and I said, \"What are you doing?\" I wish they had kept greater production. We got great partners. But yes, it's such a great long-term asset, and those kinds of quality of assets are really, really scarce in our business. And while that's a project that we can enhance growth at the margin, it's not a project where there's going to be a step-change change in volumes in the future. We've got some leaching opportunities there. We can be more efficient. We can overcome some of the issues that COVID has caused us, but it's just a great long-term asset with our positive view of the copper markets. We're glad we have it, and we wish we own more.\nLawson Winder: Okay. That's fantastic. And if I could maybe just sneak in a follow-up question, if you don't mind? But just in terms of the total capital return this quarter, I mean it appears to be in excess of 50% of available cash flow, maybe I'm looking at available cash flow incorrectly. But I mean, if this is the case, is that something you could expect to continue going forward or just something that was sort of even out over time?\nKathleen Quirk: Yes. We're looking at it on an annual basis, really, and we had a big working capital item in the first quarter. And so we're not varying our returns on our working capital change like that, that's not expected to continue through the year. So really, it's a -- we're looking at it as an annual, and we're having to make some estimates and that kind of thing. But it's -- we're trying to have some consistency in the share buyback program.\nRichard Adkerson: Yes. And the facts are because of these time challenges in pursuing investments with strong copper prices, cash is going to come in faster than it's going to go out. So that's something our Board is going to have -- will be considering going forward. And the 50% was a guidance for investors to understand what our thinking is, but it's not any sort of fixed in stone situation.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Abhi Agarwal from Deutsche Bank.\nAbhinandan Agarwal: My first question is on Peru. So Peru is seeing a significant upheaval right now across several mines. Cerro Verde has been immune, thankfully, over the last 12 months or so. Have you seen any signs of disturbance at Cerro Verde given what's happened more recently?\nRichard Adkerson: No, not really. We've worked really hard with the local community in Arequipa and have established a positive relationship. We did some really important things in terms of community investment over the years. We built a freshwater system for the city and second largest city in Peru.  And then we developed a -- for a city that didn't have -- that was just dumping its wastewater into the River Chile, we developed a wastewater collection and processing facility. And so the ecology of the river has really improved, which has been very positive in many levels with agriculture interest and so forth.  So we've done a lot. We pay people well. We managed through COVID effectively, and it was challenging. But fortunately, we have a really positive relationship with the local community, and we work hard to preserve that.\nAbhinandan Agarwal: If I could sneak in another one? So this is a question on the new leach technologies, which you and Kathleen discussed. You mentioned that it was -- it's very low capital intensity, which is great to hear. But the question I have is, in your view, how easy it is to implement it across other operations owned by other mining companies and a bit of a long shot here, but how much do you think it could increase overall production by globally?\nRichard Adkerson: Well, we're advancing. It's still early days. We're working with a group of different technologies. Some of it's proprietary, some of it's with outside contractors and some is in joint ventures with other companies in Latin America. So we're excited about it. But we haven't yet been able to forecast of what we believe will ultimately be a significant incremental production.  Kathleen mentioned 200 million pounds a year is a target we're currently working for, that's focused on our existing active leach stacks. But there's other opportunities if this works, as we anticipate it would with some old historical inactive leach stacks and potentially be an alternative to investments in concentrators to process sulfide ores.  So it's -- I get pumped up when I talk with our technical team about it, and they brief me on what's going on because of the excitement they're expressing. But we'll keep you informed, keep the market informed, as we're able to get more visibility about incremental production.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Carlos De Alba from Morgan Stanley.\nCarlos De Alba: So a question is for me on Grasberg. I know that the changes weren't that significant, but if you could give us a bit more color on the sequence of changes that you guys experience in -- or that you project now in Grasberg, that would be great? And also, if you could comment if this might impact in any way your costs outlook or profile for the operation and therefore for the company?\nRichard Adkerson: No, these are just normal mine plan adjustments that come up as conditions change. When you look at the numbers from Grasberg, it looks like it's almost like an assembly line process, but we're constantly dealing with changes in geology and other conditions. But there's nothing unusual there, and it's certainly nothing that has a fundamental change in the low-cost operations there.  Mark Johnson is on the line, and he's our longtime head of operations there at Grasberg. And Mark, why don't you make a comment in response to this question.\nMark Johnson: Yes, Richard, I think you addressed it pretty well. More specifically, in 2023, this little bit of a swap in metal production '23 to '24 was primarily due to Deep MLZ, where we continue to learn and apply the deposit-specific cadence parameters.  And what we ended up doing is slowing down the cave advance a little bit going to the west, and that deferred a little bit of higher-grade metal from 2023 into 2024 and 2025. At the same time, we were able to increase our milling rate and the additional tons at the mills allows the mines to ramp up. And so that more or less offset any of the change that we made at Deep MLZ.\nCarlos De Alba: All right. Excellent. And then just on Cerro Verde, if I may, very quickly. When do you expect that you might get back to the 1 billion pound level of production?\nKathleen Quirk: We're getting close to that this year. And next year, we expect to be -- and it changes modestly on the margin with grades, but we're getting close to the 1 billion pound mark this year, and we'll be there next year. We did -- in terms of the gold at Grasberg, we did experience some higher recoveries in the first quarter of this year, and we've increased our gold volumes slightly for the year for 2022. We haven't incorporated any of these increases in the out years. And so we do potentially have some benefits for gold as we look forward that we haven't incorporated, but we'll have to see how the experience goes as we go through this year.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas from Vertical Research Partners.\nMichael Dudas: Welcome, Maree. You're going to get this fun going forward. And Kathleen is not too quick to pass on. Anyway, so Richard, I was -- as you mentioned in your prepared remarks, the market price for copper is not listening investment demand or the supply response that I think you would have suspected other cycles.  I just want -- and you talked about some of the issues, but given that it's not just copper, but other metals, given the expectations on EV and net 0 is booming, it appears that mining investment may be constrained across the board, which is going to keep the pressure on pricing, how best to the market to signal to get more confidence in the marketplace if the price isn't similar and left out?\nRichard Adkerson: Well, I mean, there's just -- things are just piling up that's adding to the supply constraints. I mean that's a story 20 years ago when China emerged, there was a general expectation that there would be a major supply response, as there always had been in copper before that. But then people started looking hard, and it's been going on for 20 years now.  Copper has been at the top of the strategic objectives of the major mining companies ever since then. And it's a combination of geology, the quality of deposits are much, much lower than they were before. They're in much more challenging jurisdictions. Often, their grades are lower, many are underground, and so that's been a factor that's overriding everything.  And now with 40% of the copper coming from Chile and Peru and those companies -- countries going through political discussions about the direction of how they're going to be treating the industry, that's clearly a factor that's out there. And as things get delayed because of the amount of time that requires to develop even a straightforward project like this mill project, we have at Bagdad, that is about as simple project as you could have, but it's taken several years to get engineering and permit.  It's just a question of building a new mill, building some tailings facilities. I mean there's nothing really that complicated. But when you start looking at projects that are really complicated, that are really in challenging jurisdictions, you can see around the world, communities opposing new developments, while we benefit in the U.S. because ours are brownfield, and we have good relationships with communities that we worked hard to keep, people who are trying to build new mines in the U.S. are running into really serious delays and sometimes brick walls about not being able to go forward.  So these things are just pyramiding and absent some really significant global economic event, I'm just hard-pressed to see where we're not heading for an environment of where copper prices are going to be very high. And there's going to be real challenges as people try to substitute, get more scrap, develop new projects. All of those things have barriers. So as I said at the start, I'm really confident about our strategy of being a copper company. And I think we're really well suited to benefit for our stakeholders by being good at execution, as we've shown; by being focused; by doing things the right way; by building relationships.  We mentioned Peru, same way in the U.S., same way in Indonesia. We learned long ago, and our experience in coming up and developing the Grasberg in Indonesia was you cannot turn a blind eye to the local people. You have to give them jobs, opportunities, benefits, and so we've learned those lessons and it's paying off for us. And I think it will continue to pay off for us.\nOperator: Your last question comes from the line of Alex Terentiew from Stifel.\nAlexander Terentiew: I just wanted to circle back on some of these -- the growth options here. In particular, the Lone Star and El Abra, sulfides. I know these are long lead time projects. But is there any way you can kind of just lay out for us the time line or schedule? Or another way, is there any way you can kind of see these coming into production, say, within a decade?  And then also, you talked about El Abra 700 million pounds, I know the oxide is currently being mined effectively like a pre-strip. But do you think that -- would you have some overlap with the oxide leach and the sulfides or would it just basically transition to a sulfide operation?\nRichard Adkerson: Yes. Well, El Abra and Lone Star are different. And when we acquired Phelps Dodge 15 years ago, El Abra was viewed as a declining short-term asset. And it was through our explore to our drilling that we discovered there is large sulfide deposit, and it's very large, but it's at altitude, it requires desalinization, energy and so forth. So it would be an expensive project, but certainly one that would be economic with today's and current process.  And so it's just a question of seeing what Chile does and then doing all the work we have to do to get ready for it. The stripping side of things, and I'll let Josh say a couple of comments about it, is really what's happening at Lone Star, which is adjacent to our historical Safford mine just across the mountain ridge from Morenci. And again, a place where we have great community support to do what we're doing.  But there, we are expanding this oxide production, and it's serving as a stripping towards a sulfide resource that we're continuing to evaluate and sort through how to development. The 10-year -- Josh, why don't you make a couple of comments about it?\nKathleen Quirk: I'll just comment on the portfolio there, just on the concurrent, we could have concurrent leach for a period of time at the El Abra alongside of the concentrating same as Lone Star. We have that in many of our operations, including Morenci, where we have concurrent leach operations and concentrating operations. And yes, to answer your question, these projects could be within the decade. But it takes a very long time as we've all been talking about on this call. Sorry to interrupt. Go ahead, Josh.\nJoshua Olmsted: Good morning, everybody. Just a few additional comments. I think Kathleen touched on it. I think we can get those projects would be able to be done within a decade, depending obviously on timing with respect to El Abra. As far as Lone Star, as you indicated in your question, the oxide stripping -- the oxide mining is really functioning as a stripping for the sulfide. One of the things that we continue to discover as we do additional drilling at Lone Star is that ore body is -- what I would classify as while not the same as Morenci, is going to be a district similar to Morenci in the sense that it will be a combination of leaching and milling sulfides as it goes forward and gets put into place.  And so it would be a concurrent thing, concurrent operation and production of both, it wouldn't be a pure oxide then transitioning to a pure sulfide, but rather an ongoing combination of the 2, which will allow us to really maximize the value of the resource and the pounds on an annual basis.\nOperator: Now we will turn the call over to management for any closing remarks.\nRichard Adkerson: All right. Well, thanks, everybody, for your interest, and I'll just close and say I hope to see both Lone Star and El Abra's projects get kicked off. So that will give you some time frame on it. And we are really proud of our team and really feel good about where we are and where we're going. So thank you for your interest, and we look forward to reporting our progress in the future.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our conference call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan conference call. Earlier this morning, we reported first quarter 2022 operating and financial results, and a copy of our press release and slides are available on our website at fcx.com.  Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call, and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today.  Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. I'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our annual report on Form 10-K.  On the call with me today are Richard Adkerson, our Chairman and CEO. I'd also like to welcome Maree Robertson, our new CFO. She's joining us today on the call, and Maree joined us in March. We're delighted to have her on our team. Mark Johnson is on, who is the COO of our Indonesian business; Josh Olmsted, who is the COO of our Americas business; Mike Kendrick is on, who runs our global molybdenum business; and Steve Higgins is also on today, our Chief Administrative Officer.  Richard is going to start by making some opening comments and then we'll be going through the slide materials and the outlook included in our slide materials. So Richard, I'll turn it to you. Thank you, Richard. And I'll start on Slide 3. Richard mentioned, we had a really good first quarter. Slide 3 summarizes the highlights. We achieved meaningful growth in volumes and margins which translated into strong cash flows and significant cash returns to shareholders.  Our copper and gold sales were 24% higher for copper than the year ago quarter and 59% higher for gold than the year ago quarter. Our copper sales were 6% above our guidance going into the year. We benefited from strong U.S. demand in the quarter, which allowed us to reduce inventories.  Our gold sales were also above our plan, 8%. After reaching the targeted metal run rates in late 2021, Grasberg is operating well and sustaining the high-volume, low-cost operation.  Our average unit net cash cost for the quarter of $1.33 per pound came in under our guidance in the first quarter and below the year ago quarterly average. This is particularly impressive given the cost pressures affecting all of us and allowed us to generate strong margins with average copper realizations of $4.66 per pound during the quarter. Notably, Grasberg's costs were a net credit of $0.06 per pound in the quarter.  Richard referenced this earlier, but this means that the gold revenues more than offset all of our cash production costs at the site. We generated adjusted EBITDA of $3.4 billion in the quarter; and adjusted net income, excluding nonrecurring charges of $1.6 billion or $1.07 per share for the first quarter.  We generated very strong operating cash flows, totaling $1.7 billion. This was net of about $800 million in working capital uses, primarily reflecting the timing of our cash taxes. Our cash flow significantly exceeded our capital spending and that allowed us to return substantial cash to shareholders while maintaining a strong balance sheet.  We continued our share repurchase program during the quarter, funded nearly $600 million of share purchases. Since starting the program in November of last year, we have purchased 27 million shares at an average cost of approximating $42 per share. We're $1.1 billion into the program out of a total of $3 billion.  Our total share repurchases and common stock dividends, which doubled from the last year's rate, approached $800 million in the first quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong. Net debt was $1.3 billion at the end of the quarter. About half of this relates to financing of the Indonesian smelter project, which is advancing.  As Richard said, as we look forward, we're enthusiastic about the embedded opportunities our asset can bring to supply the world's rising demand for copper. With several projects, we are progressing with near-term, medium-term and longer-term horizons. We're continuing to dedicate significant resources to our sustainability objectives and now lead the industry with 9 of our operating sites certified under the Copper Mark. We have a strong foundation for success. We're executing our strategy very effectively, and we'll continue to focus on delivering on our plans.  Slide 4 is just a summary of the recent reports that we filed, our annual report to shareholders and just today filing our 2021 sustainability report. Our theme for our recent annual report is titled Electrifying the Future, and it highlights our assets and the prominent role that Freeport has in supplying modern uses for copper.  We also published the sustainability report. This marks our 21st year of reporting on our sustainability programs. As a leader in the industry, we also want to lead in our reporting and transparency in this important area. We really hope you'll have the opportunity to review the report in detail, it's available on our website.  We're proud of the work we're doing. It's embedded in all of our business plans and supports our responsible production practices. On Slide 5, we had a neat deal earlier this month. We celebrated PT Freeport Indonesia's 55th anniversary. We've operated at this same site for more than 5 decades, and we've developed one of the industry's most prominent operations, providing tens of thousands of jobs and meaningful economic impacts to the Indonesian government and province of Papua.  As Richard mentioned, we've invested heavily over the years to create a modern, world-class operation there that will benefit all stakeholders for decades to come. We lead the industry in technology, supporting our large-scale block cave mining. And as Richard mentioned, with our new partnership with the government established in 2018 and our committed and focused team, we're enthusiastic about the future for this exceptional mining district.  Turning to markets. Richard covered this in his comments, we view the fundamental outlook of the copper business is very positive, supported by copper's role in the global economy, a renewed focus on infrastructure, connectivity and copper's essential role in meeting global decarbonization targets.  The demand trends are broad-based and global in nature. We see this continuing and accelerating with the increased intensity of use for copper associated with modern applications. Many are predicting we're in the early stages of a multiyear period of rising demand.  Over the last decade, most of the growth in demand has come from China. As Richard mentioned, we're now seeing a major expansion of growth and demand for copper for infrastructure spending and decarbonization from Western world economies. The scarcity of new mine supply development is growing at a time when demand is rising.  The project pipeline of actional development opportunities is significantly lower than it has been historically. Beyond the projects which are being completed now, there's a real absence of new supply development necessary to meet estimated demand increases. The current physical markets are tight, as evidenced by the low level of inventories on global exchanges. Supply chain continues to be stretched.  While we'll see macro factors such as China's economy, geopolitical considerations and actions by the Fed impacting sentiment, the low level of inventories and supply limitations sets us up for a scenario of higher prices in the future.  We're in a great position at Freeport as a responsible producer of scale and the strategies Richard outlined focused on copper, long-lived reserves and future growth options, the prospects are bright for our portfolio become more scarce and highly valued in the future.  I'll comment a little bit about some details of our first quarter operations, moving to Slide 7. In the U.S., the Lone Star mine continues to perform well above design capacity. As you remember, we commissioned the mine in late 2020 and produced 265 million pounds of copper in 2021, a 30% increase from the original design.  We're expanding further to take us to 300 million pounds per annum by 2023 with an investment of roughly $250 million. As we accelerate the mining of oxide ores at Lone Star, this will expose a much larger sulfide opportunity for us in the future. At Morenci, our largest mine in the North American portfolio, we completed the restart of our mill in March. We've been ramping up for several months and are now running at capacity.  With the rise in COVID cases early in the quarter, our mining rates were constrained, resulting in the reduction in annual production compared with our prior expectations. We are back on track. We expect Morenci to produce 7% more copper in 2022 compared with last year.  As Richard mentioned, we're also advancing our leach recovery initiatives. We're focused at Morenci using data analytics, and new technologies to enhance our leach production. This is a significant value-enhancing opportunity for Freeport, and we'll be reporting progress on this initiative as we go through the year.  At Bagdad, we are advancing our plans for what we're calling the Bagdad 2x project to double production at this mine in Northwest Arizona. We're advancing studies and planning to commence early works, principally for mine equipment and additional stripping in parallel with the studies.  Turning to South America. The teams have done exceptional work navigating the pandemic. When things started to improve in late '21, we had a spike in cases in January and February in Peru, that did have an impact on our mining rates in the first quarter by about 10%. Situation improved significantly in March, we expect to reach our targeted mill rates of 400,000 tons per day in the balance of the year. The lower mining rate in the first quarter is expected to have a small impact on our 2022 production at Cerro Verde compared with our prior plans, but we still see 8% growth in Cerro Verde production in 2022 compared with 2021.  We continue to target a full restoration at Cerro Verde this year and be on our way back to 1 billion pounds per annum from this large-scale operation. El Abra has been successful in Chile in increasing the stacking rate of material on its leach pad. We expect a 30% increase in 2022 production at El Abra and to sustain a level of 200 million to 250 million pounds per annum for the next several years, as we assess opportunities for future growth.  At Grasberg, we sustained our large-scale metal production after reaching our targeted metal run rate in the fourth quarter of last year. We achieved higher gold recoveries compared with our plan, which contributed to a favorable variance for the quarter.  Our 2022 volumes are consistent with our prior forecast for Grasberg. We incorporated some relatively small adjustments for changes in mine sequencing in Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ, but the 5-year metal forecast is generally consistent with prior expectations. We're advancing mill projects to provide additional capacity targeted for the second half of next year.  We're diversifying our power sources in Indonesia, and we're advancing the long-term development for Kucing Liar. The team there is doing outstanding work and managing and sustaining the largest and most profitable underground operation in the world.  On the next slide, Richard touched upon the leach opportunities we have at Freeport. And this is a major initiative ongoing that we have to extract more value from our historical leach stockpiles. This could unlock significant value for us by increasing production from material already mined and placed on to stockpiles.  In the context of an industry where new projects can take 10 years to develop, this is a significant opportunity for us to bring the equivalent of a new mine on stream in a fraction of the time it takes to develop with a fraction of the carbon footprint, very little incremental capital and operating costs. So a tremendous value opportunity for us, and we're pursuing it with urgency.  During the first quarter, we commenced the process to insulate our leach stockpiles to retain heat. Heat is proven to improve leach recoveries and work to date has indicated the potential to incrementally add to our production in the near term. We're also enhancing our processes with the use of data analytics. This tool is providing new insights and opportunities.  We're working on internal technologies for additives, as well as with third parties who have proprietary technologies. We're optimistic that these collective initiatives have the opportunity to add an incremental 100 million to 200 million pounds of copper across our Americas portfolio in the near term.  Early success will enable us to optimize and expand this potential moving forward. As you'll see in the charts, we currently estimate 38 billion pounds of copper in our stockpiles, which already has been mined, but this is not included in our reserves or production plans.  A significant portion of this opportunity is at our flagship Morenci mine and our cross-functional team of technical experts, metallurgists, mine planners, data scientists, geologists and business analysts are all working together to take full advantage of this great opportunity for us.  The leach opportunity is just one facet of our growth, and Richard touched upon what we'll be focusing on as we go forward. We have multiple options -- looking at Slide 9, multiple options for brownfield, low-risk growth across the portfolio.  Recall, we have over 190 billion pounds of copper mineral resources in our portfolio in addition to the proven and probable reserves of over 100 billion pounds of copper. We talked about the leach opportunity and the ongoing oxide expansion at Lone Star, these are near-term opportunities to add incremental production in a 12- to 18-month time frame.  In the medium term, we're highly optimistic that we'll double the size of Bagdad in the 2026 time frame. We expect to complete the feasibility study in the first half of next year and be in a position to commence construction activities. Longer term, we have the massive Lone Star sulfide opportunity of 50 billion pound copper resource in our established mining area in Eastern Arizona.  The El Abra project in Chile has a resource approaching 30 billion pounds. We've done a lot of work in identifying an operation that could produce over 700 million pounds of copper per annum. We're closely monitoring the developments in Chile, and we'll defer our decision for the time being, pending the results of the ongoing constitutional work that's being done in the country.  At Kucing Liar in the Grasberg district, it's a natural extension of our operations. This will allow us to continue our large-scale operation in Papua for decades to come. We believe the world will need our projects in the future. We have a long track record of success in qualifying and developing projects in an efficient, responsible manner.  And this is enhanced by our industry-leading technical capabilities, our established license to operate and our strong franchises in our areas of focus. Looking at our sales profile on Slide 10, this is the annual sales for the next few years that we update each quarter.  The outlook for volumes is largely in line with our prior forecast and the execution of our plans is on track. We have insignificant changes to our prior guidance for copper sales for 2022 and 2023 in the 1% range. That principally reflects the COVID downtime experienced in the Americas earlier this year and some timing changes at Grasberg between 2023 and 2025.  After delivering a 19% increase in copper sales in 2021, we're projecting a 12% increase in 2022, reflecting higher production across the portfolio and further growth in 2023. We estimate about 36% of our sales for this year will come from our U.S. mines, 27% from South America and 37% from Indonesia.  On Slide 11, there's been a lot of discussion about cost pressures in our industry. The cost pressures that we're facing -- that the entire industry is facing this year are well-documented. Energy and other commodity-related inputs such as sulfuric acid, explosives, grinding media and other consumables have increased. We'll continue to work to manage and mitigate these impacts to the extent possible. We also benefit from the fact that our byproduct credits, particularly for gold, provide mitigation.  We show a reconciliation of our prior unit net cash for 2022 estimates based on our January estimates compared to our current estimates. We've updated all of our plans to incorporate recent commodity pricing and our latest operating plans. You'll see here that half of the unit cost increase is offset by stronger gold prices and production.  Bottom line, unit cash costs are up about $0.09 per pound of copper or an approximate 7% increase. These numbers were built off a copper price assumption that was $0.25 per pound above the prior plan. But we're looking today at $4.70 copper at current market with a cash cost of $1.44 estimated for this year, which will generate very strong margins for us.  We show, on the next slide, Slide 12, the significant cash flow generation at various prices. This is a great strength of Freeport, a big exposure to copper markets and the large-scale nature of our existing capacity. We're in an enviable position with our significant new production that we brought online in recent quarters. And we show on the slide, Slide 12, the significance of cash flow generation using our volume and cost estimates and prices ranging from $4 to $5 copper.  These are modeled results using the average of 2023 and 2024 with current volume and cost estimates. In our annual EBITDA, these prices from $4 to $5 per pound, prices are closer to $5 today than $4 would average over $11 billion at $4 copper to nearly $16 billion per annum at $5 copper. And operating cash flows very strong, ranging from over $8 billion to approach $12 billion at $5 copper.  Also on the chart, we've got sensitivities to various commodities. We can't predict prices, but the long-term fundamentals of our business indicate the prospects for higher copper prices. And as we go forward, you can note that each $0.25 per pound change in copper equates to over $1 billion in annual EBITDA.  We'll generate significant free cash flow. We expect this to continue with cash flows significantly above our capital spending. And you'll see the capital spending on Slide 13. These are largely unchanged from our prior guidance. We're forecasting some offsetting timing differences between 2022 and 2023. And I've also included some early equipment purchases for our Bagdad expansion project in 2023, as well as ramping up the Kucing Liar project.  Both of these projects are designated as discretionary projects for purposes of our available cash returns framework. We've got a tracking of the discretionary category included for your reference in the appendix. Roughly 25% of our capital spend over the next 2 years is associated with value-enhancing projects.  These projects all have solid financial returns and operational benefits, and we'll use a portion of the 50% of free cash flow we are earmarking for organic investments toward these discretionary projects. I'll also note, and you'll see this in the slide, we've got a large decrease in spend on the Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ from 2022 to 2023, totaling $500 million.  So as those projects are being fully developed, we'll see our planned capital expenditures coming down. The next slide, we provide an update on our activities for the smelter. We were engaged in detailed engineering and procurement and early construction activities are advancing with pilings and concrete installation.  We've got about 2,000 workers now on site, and that will grow to over 10,000 workers next year. We've got some updated photos for your reference in the appendix. And as we've been talking about for some time, this project is important for PT Freeport Indonesia and the Indonesian government. We are focused on completing the project as efficiently and timely as possible.  Richard mentioned the successful bond offering we did earlier this month, raised $3 billion to support the cost of the smelter, long-term financing, average duration of roughly 14 years and an average cost of 5.4%. Richard mentioned the investor response, it was very positive and reflects the strength of PT-FI's underlying business.  The cost of this financing is largely offset by a phaseout of the 5% export duty. So the economic impact of the smelter is not material. Turning to the balance sheet. It's a core focus of ours and has been for the last several years. We've made meaningful progress in reducing our debt and our whole financial policy is centered around maintaining a strong balance sheet.  We reduced our debt just over the last 12 months by nearly $4 billion, and our EBITDA continues to grow. Our free cash flow is significant, as you've seen, with growing volumes, positive markets and low capital requirements. We are in a fantastic position to execute the strategy of maintaining a strong balance sheet, investing in our long-term future and returning substantial cash to shareholders.  Last slide that we'll cover is a summary of the financial policy. On Slide 16, we show a scorecard of our shareholder returns. Those have increased meaningfully with a period of strong execution and balance sheet improvement. We began implementing the Board-authorized performance payout policy in November of last year. The combination of our share purchase program with dividends are designed to distribute 50% of our cash flow after capital expenditures, excluding the smelter investments and discretionary projects.  Since November of 2021, when we began to implement the program, we've utilized about 1/3 of the authorized $3 billion share purchase program. We've purchased 27 million shares, common stock at an average cost of just under $42 per share. We also have a variable dividend component in our common stock dividends for 2022. This is double the base dividend and the first payment at this higher rate was made in the first quarter of this year.  Our Board will have the opportunity to consider additional actions as we progress the program further. I mentioned in the first quarter alone, returns to shareholders totaled nearly $800 million. With a continuation of favorable market conditions, solid execution of our plans, we expect shareholder returns to continue to be strong.  As Richard mentioned, we have exceptional opportunities in our business. As a team, we are meeting the challenges and embracing the opportunities. Our future is very bright, and we at Freeport are electrifying the future, and we're going to do this responsibly, reliably and relentlessly.  So that's a summary of our quarter and outlook. And now we'd like to take your questions. Yes. We understand the question. The sensitivities that we show are just in terms of the copper price without having changes in input prices. I think right now, what we're seeing is increases that are unusual, correlations that are unusual. Energy prices have risen in some of these other commodities like sulfuric acid and the explosives and things like that, all reflecting kind of a geopolitical situation.  I don't think the long-term trends, if you look at the correlation between copper prices and some of these inputs, are as dramatic as what we're seeing this year. Time will tell, we'll see, but we don't expect to see these kinds of $0.09 increases for $0.25 move in copper prices. It will depend on, obviously, the fundamentals of each commodity.  But right now, some of the commodities are moving in a direction differently on a short-term basis because of what we're seeing in the Russia-Ukraine situation. Yes, our diesel costs that we went into the year with our plan of roughly $2.50 a gallon. We've increased that in this most recent guidance by about 40%. And normally, we would not see that kind of dislocation. And when we look at the long-term trends of diesel prices and copper prices, we normally wouldn't see that.  So same holds for some of the fertilizers and ammonia nitrate, the product we use for explosives, has gone up a lot, as sulfuric acid has as well. And we believe a lot of those are up just generally because of commodity prices, but the Ukraine and Russia situation has exacerbated some of that. So we don't see it as a long-term cost in our structure at those levels. And Emily, the leaching opportunity that we have, we don't have exposure to steel and structural costs for that opportunity. And that's why we're really pushing that with a sense of urgency because that really is very low capital intensity and operating cost intensity that will translate right to our bottom line if we can crack that code.  So it's the equivalent of bringing on a new mine without having all the capital costs. So that is -- that would be a really, really strong thing for us as a company if we can continue to advance the leaching opportunity. Yes. The main thing that we're experiencing, Emily, in terms of labor is really focused more in the U.S., the main issue. We -- it's a very competitive job environment, as you've seen. We've got significant job openings in our U.S. operations. We've been supplementing our workforce with outside contractors to help us with projects and capacity assurance.  And so really, you're seeing more utilization of contractors right now. But we have made some progress in hiring in the first quarter. We've been -- and have had a number of openings for several months, and we're starting to make progress in the first quarter and getting these positions filled. So -- but I'd say it's more a matter of tightness in terms of availability of people as opposed to really big increases in wage rates.  We have increased our wage rates, and we've provided some supplements and incentives for people. But the main thing has been we've had to use higher price contractors until we get all these positions filled. We aren't seeing the same kind of issues in Indonesia. And Richard mentioned, the Peru impacts with profit sharing.  We just signed a new contract labor agreement, both in Indonesia and in Peru and the labor situation there is much easier than it is in the U.S. Yes. And we -- so the outlook that you have reflects our current estimate. Each quarter, we update all of our operating plans and cost input. So what you're seeing in the latest outlook for the year is based on the market prices when we prepare this forecast just recently. In the near term, Alex, you're right. I mean in the near term, what we've got is these leach opportunities. And like I said, it takes 7, 10 years to build a new mine. And -- so these leach opportunities really can fill in the near term.  Longer term, we're really looking at growth coming from this big potential we have at Lone Star and also El Abra. We hadn't made a decision on El Abra yet, but that 700 million pounds-plus of new production and the Lone Star sulfide would be a meaningful amount of increase as well.  But -- I mean, it's a feature of other copper market. It's very, very challenging to develop new supplies, and it takes many years to do it. We've had significant growth in 2021, again in 2022, but it's not common in our industry to see that kind of growth in copper production, and that's really what underpins the fundamental outlook for it. Yes. We're looking at it on an annual basis, really, and we had a big working capital item in the first quarter. And so we're not varying our returns on our working capital change like that, that's not expected to continue through the year. So really, it's a -- we're looking at it as an annual, and we're having to make some estimates and that kind of thing. But it's -- we're trying to have some consistency in the share buyback program. We're getting close to that this year. And next year, we expect to be -- and it changes modestly on the margin with grades, but we're getting close to the 1 billion pound mark this year, and we'll be there next year. We did -- in terms of the gold at Grasberg, we did experience some higher recoveries in the first quarter of this year, and we've increased our gold volumes slightly for the year for 2022. We haven't incorporated any of these increases in the out years. And so we do potentially have some benefits for gold as we look forward that we haven't incorporated, but we'll have to see how the experience goes as we go through this year. I'll just comment on the portfolio there, just on the concurrent, we could have concurrent leach for a period of time at the El Abra alongside of the concentrating same as Lone Star. We have that in many of our operations, including Morenci, where we have concurrent leach operations and concentrating operations. And yes, to answer your question, these projects could be within the decade. But it takes a very long time as we've all been talking about on this call. Sorry to interrupt. Go ahead, Josh."

            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Kathleen. We're going to follow a new format for our earnings presentation today. This format reflects the current position of our company after years, literally years of having to deal with significant company-specific problems that are now largely behind us.  We have a clear mission in Freeport, and that is to be foremost in copper. I will make some very brief opening comments. Kathleen will review our positive first quarter results, our positive outlook, and then we'll be available to answer questions. The case for copper as a commodity is strong. I've been saying this for 20 years, but it's never been better.  Demand is growing globally. Globally, growth is no longer dependent solely on China. With COVID recovery, infrastructure spending, the spread of electricity everywhere, it's generating significant growth in Europe. Business is strong in the U.S. and in Asia, outside China.  The coming demand for carbon reduction and its impact on copper demand is truly extraordinary, and it's coming. It's beginning, but it's not here now. Copper supply development for many reasons is challenging. As I said recently, the supply challenge can't be solved simply by higher prices.  I find it notable that the price of copper today is $4.50 in a world where there are a whole series of economic headwinds. Many of these are transitory. Higher copper prices in the future are likely, and I'm very comfortable with Freeport's strategy of focusing this business on copper. Our strategy to achieve our mission of being foremost in copper straightforward.  We will execute our operating plan safely and responsibly. We have an unmatched set of globally diverse copper-producing assets. We are taking advantage of emerging technology involving data analytics, new work practices and increasingly important advancing and leaching technology where Freeport is well positioned as a global leader in leaching.  We will be developing organic growth projects in a disciplined way over time from our large set of undeveloped resources. We will execute our financial plan, maintain our currently strong balance sheet while returning significant cash to shareholders. Other opportunities for Freeport may arise, and we are positioned to take advantage if they do, but our strategy is focused internally.  Here's a few points I suggest you note in Kathleen's presentation. Look at our strong execution of our plans in the first quarter. Look at our success in meeting the challenges of higher input costs, both through effective cost management and the benefit of past strategic decision.  For example, the long-term development of Grasberg mine and its high copper and gold grades, higher gold grades or higher gold prices are helping to offset input cost increases. Note, our positive situation in Indonesia. With our partner, shareholder MIND ID with the government of Indonesia, local communities and workforce. We worked hard to achieve this.  Our environmental performance in a very challenging location is exemplary in Indonesia. The financial results are spectacular, reflecting the good work of our PT-FI team and literally 3 decades of efforts and investments getting to where we are today. We're progressing with the development of a new large-scale smelter in Indonesia.  Our recent international bond financing at PT-FI was a major milestone for our company. Our team achieved investment-grade ratings and a strong market reception for this $3 billion financing.  Looking back years ago, I would have envisioned our ability to do this. 2/3 of our copper is produced in the Americas, where our team is operating effectively and where we have significant growth for the future. And finally, I want to briefly note steps we have taken this past year to build a high-quality sustainable Board of Directors and a sustainable management team for the future. These are commitments I personally made to myself a year ago when I became Chairman.  We've added 6 new directors in a year, and you'll be able to see the details on this in our proxy, which will soon be available. Four of these 6 are individuals with significant international large company CEO experience, 2 have significant business and financial expertise. Together with the 4 continuing independent directors, we now have a high-quality Board, one that Freeport has long deserved. Building this Board is a highlight in my personal professional career.  At the same time, we made important changes to our management team. Kathleen mentioned that Maree has recently joined us as our CFO. At a young age, she has a distinguished career in international mining. We've made a number of transitions of important positions with internal promotions and added significant capabilities with external hires, particularly in the ESP area.  We now have a younger, more diverse management team at Freeport. They are great people who embrace a special culture we have with the Freeport Global family. I'm personally excited about continuing as a member of this team, blessed to be in good health and energy. I am confident now that Freeport now has a Board and management team that is capable of achieving our mission and executing our strategy beyond my tenure.  With that, Kathleen, I'll turn it over to you. Well, if you go back, I'll talk about three years of copper demand, when copper was correlated to industrial production before China emerged in roughly 2003 as the China era, and now we're in a new era of copper prices, it's been various factors.  Back when copper was cyclical and driven by industrial production in the developed world, there was a correlation between prices. But then when China emerged and copper prices went from a dip below $0.70 and went to $4 in a short period of time when nobody was expected, there wasn't a correlation with prices.  Today, it is affected by the dislocations caused by Russia and the situation in Ukraine, particularly with oil and gas prices, I mean, and you'll just have to reach your own judgment of how sustainable that is or how much is the impact of the current situation. But there are other commodities, it's having an impact on copper prices, but Russia was a relatively small producer of copper globally of 3%, 4% and regionally affected markets and the market is so tight, it has an impact, but other commodities are being more effective than copper.  And as I said, many of these things, I believe, are transitory. So we're taking steps where we can to control prices. Copper prices are rising faster than cost for us. So our profitability is growing, and we're encouraged about that continuing into the future. Emily, those really aren't driving factors on our investment decisions. The resources that we have are just economically not that sensitive to even these kind of price increases. So we -- our timing issue on the brownfield development projects is, one related to engineering and permitting and community relations and things like that.  These are things that affect supply development across the industry, and it's a double-edged sword of copper. It's a major factor of why copper prices are so strong. So we'll factor in the higher prices, but when we undertake a project, the investment decision is not going to be driven by those factors, but by others. For example, in Chile, we're awaiting making investment decision on El Abra, which is a great project, but there's a lot of uncertainties about the government policy towards mining in Chile. And so that's what we're monitoring before we make -- proceed with an investment decision there. And on position, how well positioned Freeport is to take advantage of that -- those advancements. We're the largest leaching operation in the world. Morenci is the largest single mine from leaching, and it's been part of our company's experience for decades. So we're really excited about it. Well, thanks, Emily, and I'll let Kathleen follow up. But we do have a special situation with our large workforce in Peru, where under government laws and regulations, there is a mandated profit-sharing plan. And so as profits goes up, their workers automatically benefit in higher wages as part of that process. But Kathleen, why don't you follow up generally on labor cost elsewhere? That's really not a significant factor. I mean there may be a short-term contract that gets renegotiated. But costs -- the cost you see are essentially the current costs that we're experiencing now. And while there's uncertainties, my expectation is we're facing kind of the height of dislocations from global supply chains to other factors. COVID shutdown in China and situation in Ukraine, so my personal expectation is rather than seeing costs going up in the future, we'll see them come down. But time will tell. We can. And Alex, that's 1 thing I've been trying to get across to policymakers and others who follow our industry, just about how long term the copper business is. I participated in Cambridge Energies, the CERAWeek down in Houston with oil and gas companies, and everybody was asking the oil and gas companies about the time for response to production, and they were talking about it, the executives with the energy companies were saying, \"Well, it's a long-term business. It takes months to respond.\"  And I said, \"Well, copper takes years to respond.\" And so that's why I pointed out at Grasberg, and there was a lot of pressure on us to -- for periods of time to delay development of the Grasberg underground, as we were talking with the Government of Indonesia about our contract rights. But had we done that, we wouldn't have had this production available to us.  And so what we're looking at when we talk about growth, is growth from a very long-term basis. And it's one of the reasons why we have a favorable copper price, and why, I believe copper prices are going to go higher. I mean we're seeing companies across our energy industry today being challenged with meeting their production targets.  We've done that. But it's going -- all of that's going to be supportive of prices. And as I said, I'm really struck by having today's copper price in the kind of global market with headwinds that would normally lead to lower prices. Yes. We would. It's just such a great asset. Funny historical story before the Phelps Dodge deal. I called the Phelps Dodge CEO when he sold down originally interest in Cerro Verde.  At a time when they needed production, and I said, \"What are you doing?\" I wish they had kept greater production. We got great partners. But yes, it's such a great long-term asset, and those kinds of quality of assets are really, really scarce in our business. And while that's a project that we can enhance growth at the margin, it's not a project where there's going to be a step-change change in volumes in the future. We've got some leaching opportunities there. We can be more efficient. We can overcome some of the issues that COVID has caused us, but it's just a great long-term asset with our positive view of the copper markets. We're glad we have it, and we wish we own more. Yes. And the facts are because of these time challenges in pursuing investments with strong copper prices, cash is going to come in faster than it's going to go out. So that's something our Board is going to have -- will be considering going forward. And the 50% was a guidance for investors to understand what our thinking is, but it's not any sort of fixed in stone situation. No, not really. We've worked really hard with the local community in Arequipa and have established a positive relationship. We did some really important things in terms of community investment over the years. We built a freshwater system for the city and second largest city in Peru.  And then we developed a -- for a city that didn't have -- that was just dumping its wastewater into the River Chile, we developed a wastewater collection and processing facility. And so the ecology of the river has really improved, which has been very positive in many levels with agriculture interest and so forth.  So we've done a lot. We pay people well. We managed through COVID effectively, and it was challenging. But fortunately, we have a really positive relationship with the local community, and we work hard to preserve that. Well, we're advancing. It's still early days. We're working with a group of different technologies. Some of it's proprietary, some of it's with outside contractors and some is in joint ventures with other companies in Latin America. So we're excited about it. But we haven't yet been able to forecast of what we believe will ultimately be a significant incremental production.  Kathleen mentioned 200 million pounds a year is a target we're currently working for, that's focused on our existing active leach stacks. But there's other opportunities if this works, as we anticipate it would with some old historical inactive leach stacks and potentially be an alternative to investments in concentrators to process sulfide ores.  So it's -- I get pumped up when I talk with our technical team about it, and they brief me on what's going on because of the excitement they're expressing. But we'll keep you informed, keep the market informed, as we're able to get more visibility about incremental production. No, these are just normal mine plan adjustments that come up as conditions change. When you look at the numbers from Grasberg, it looks like it's almost like an assembly line process, but we're constantly dealing with changes in geology and other conditions. But there's nothing unusual there, and it's certainly nothing that has a fundamental change in the low-cost operations there.  Mark Johnson is on the line, and he's our longtime head of operations there at Grasberg. And Mark, why don't you make a comment in response to this question. Well, I mean, there's just -- things are just piling up that's adding to the supply constraints. I mean that's a story 20 years ago when China emerged, there was a general expectation that there would be a major supply response, as there always had been in copper before that. But then people started looking hard, and it's been going on for 20 years now.  Copper has been at the top of the strategic objectives of the major mining companies ever since then. And it's a combination of geology, the quality of deposits are much, much lower than they were before. They're in much more challenging jurisdictions. Often, their grades are lower, many are underground, and so that's been a factor that's overriding everything.  And now with 40% of the copper coming from Chile and Peru and those companies -- countries going through political discussions about the direction of how they're going to be treating the industry, that's clearly a factor that's out there. And as things get delayed because of the amount of time that requires to develop even a straightforward project like this mill project, we have at Bagdad, that is about as simple project as you could have, but it's taken several years to get engineering and permit.  It's just a question of building a new mill, building some tailings facilities. I mean there's nothing really that complicated. But when you start looking at projects that are really complicated, that are really in challenging jurisdictions, you can see around the world, communities opposing new developments, while we benefit in the U.S. because ours are brownfield, and we have good relationships with communities that we worked hard to keep, people who are trying to build new mines in the U.S. are running into really serious delays and sometimes brick walls about not being able to go forward.  So these things are just pyramiding and absent some really significant global economic event, I'm just hard-pressed to see where we're not heading for an environment of where copper prices are going to be very high. And there's going to be real challenges as people try to substitute, get more scrap, develop new projects. All of those things have barriers. So as I said at the start, I'm really confident about our strategy of being a copper company. And I think we're really well suited to benefit for our stakeholders by being good at execution, as we've shown; by being focused; by doing things the right way; by building relationships.  We mentioned Peru, same way in the U.S., same way in Indonesia. We learned long ago, and our experience in coming up and developing the Grasberg in Indonesia was you cannot turn a blind eye to the local people. You have to give them jobs, opportunities, benefits, and so we've learned those lessons and it's paying off for us. And I think it will continue to pay off for us. Yes. Well, El Abra and Lone Star are different. And when we acquired Phelps Dodge 15 years ago, El Abra was viewed as a declining short-term asset. And it was through our explore to our drilling that we discovered there is large sulfide deposit, and it's very large, but it's at altitude, it requires desalinization, energy and so forth. So it would be an expensive project, but certainly one that would be economic with today's and current process.  And so it's just a question of seeing what Chile does and then doing all the work we have to do to get ready for it. The stripping side of things, and I'll let Josh say a couple of comments about it, is really what's happening at Lone Star, which is adjacent to our historical Safford mine just across the mountain ridge from Morenci. And again, a place where we have great community support to do what we're doing.  But there, we are expanding this oxide production, and it's serving as a stripping towards a sulfide resource that we're continuing to evaluate and sort through how to development. The 10-year -- Josh, why don't you make a couple of comments about it? All right. Well, thanks, everybody, for your interest, and I'll just close and say I hope to see both Lone Star and El Abra's projects get kicked off. So that will give you some time frame on it. And we are really proud of our team and really feel good about where we are and where we're going. So thank you for your interest, and we look forward to reporting our progress in the future."

            "content": "Yes, Richard, I think you addressed it pretty well. More specifically, in 2023, this little bit of a swap in metal production '23 to '24 was primarily due to Deep MLZ, where we continue to learn and apply the deposit-specific cadence parameters.  And what we ended up doing is slowing down the cave advance a little bit going to the west, and that deferred a little bit of higher-grade metal from 2023 into 2024 and 2025. At the same time, we were able to increase our milling rate and the additional tons at the mills allows the mines to ramp up. And so that more or less offset any of the change that we made at Deep MLZ."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions].  I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, President. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nKathleen Quirk: Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Freeport-McMoRan conference call. Earlier this morning, we reported our fourth quarter and full year 2023 operating and financial results. And a copy of today's press release and supplemental schedules and slides are available on our Web site at fcx.com. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today.  Before we begin our comments, we\u2019d like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include non-GAAP measures and forward-looking statements and that actual results may differ materially. I would like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings.  Also on the call with me today are Richard Adkerson, our Chairman and CEO; Maree Robertson, our Chief Financial Officer; Josh Olmsted, our COO of Americas; Mark Johnson, Operating Officer for Indonesia; Mike Kendrick, who runs our molybdenum business; and Steve Higgins, our Chief Administrative Officer. We'll start the call with some opening comments from Richard and then we will go through the slide presentation materials and then open up the call for your questions.  So I'll turn it over to Richard. Richard, go ahead.\nRichard Adkerson: Okay. Good morning, everyone. As you can see, our first quarter was really a sound quarter and outstanding in several respects in terms of our operations. It was really led by PT-FI during the whole year of 2023. We began our ramp up in 2019 of the underground and now we are fully operationally, and the team has been setting records consistently out there and have just outperformed for the full year and faced some really challenges, which is just part of that business. But I'm very proud of our PT-FI team at job site in Jakarta. We are making great progress and fulfilling our 2018 commitment to the government to invest in downstreaming and the copper concentrate business. In December, I was there for the inauguration of the expansion of the older smelter, PT Smelting with President Joko Widodo and that was a good event. And then with our new smelter at Manyar in Eastern Java, we reached an important 90% milestone at the end of the year and we're progressing for physical completion of the smelter and ramping it up on schedule in 2024. A couple of words about the markets. It continues to be the micro versus macro story. Notably, in 2023, the macro factors strengthened notably. 2023 had long been forecasted to be a year of surplus because of new mines coming on stream, but it ended up being a small deficit. And at the same time, there was stronger than expected demand for copper in the United States and in China despite all the issues with China's property business other sectors created a notable growth for copper in China. Then there were the supply shortfalls throughout the industry for some significant mines and these for range of factors that are kind of common to our business. The copper business, mining business is a tough business, but it was political issues in some countries, community issues and then operating issues. As a result of all that, inventories of copper around the world are at historically low levels and the inventory levels are really inconsistent with the current copper price. The copper price clearly being driven by macroeconomic factors. The currency, the strong US dollar, carryover effects of inflations, government fiscal policies, and there are concerns about economies in China and Europe. But if the macro outlook -- and I'll just say when the macro outlook improves, watch out for the copper price. Looking ahead, the world's going to need significantly more copper in the future for a variety of factors. The world's just becoming increasingly electrified and that's what copper is used for. And it's at a time when the industry is simply not investing to grow production that the outlook indicates that will be required for economic, operational and resource nationalism, a series of factors, but the facts are there's an outlook for strong demand and supply challenges. That's why I'm so personally confident about where Freeport is positioned and pleased with it. We have high volume existing production that's sustainable. We have large sustainable reserves and resources. We have growth opportunities that we will pursue prudently from this really exciting leaching initiative that Kathleen will be talking about and from brownfield expansions of our existing orebodies. Before turning over to Kathleen, I just want to send a note of condolences to our friends at Rio Tinto. You may have seen the news, but they had a plane to go down in Canada heading to their diamond operations there. Rio has been a special part of Freeport's history. Of course, they were our partners for many years at Grasberg. I have worked with six, seven, eight CEOs over my career. Some of my closest colleagues have been with that company. And the toughest part of being a CEO is to lose people and I'm just so sad to hear this news and the whole Freeport family's heart goes out to our friends at Rio.  With that Kathleen, I will turn over to you.\nKathleen Quirk: Okay. Thank you, Richard. And I will be covering the presentation materials starting with Slide 3, our achievements for 2023 are summarized here. Our sharp focus on executing our plans in an effective, safe and responsible manner, managing the controllable drivers and navigating challenges successfully, all translated into solid operating results over the year. A big highlight for the year was the outstanding progress in Indonesia where we grew production levels for the fourth year in a row. We posted several new operating records and we continue to enhance values for this large scale, low cost and long life resource. We were also successful in reaching several milestones during the year, including reaching our target run rate for incremental leach production in the Americas, enhancing optionality in the Americas for our brownfield growth projects and reaching our targeted 90% completion milestone for the Indonesian smelter project by the end of 2023. As a leader in the industry, we were one of the first companies to have all of our operating sites certified under the copper and molybdenum marks, and this demonstrates our performance and commitment to responsible mining practices. We ended the year 2023 in a strong financial position, a positive outlook and as we work together to enhance long term value for shareholders. On Slide 4, we summarize the key results for 2023 compared with historical levels. After growing our volumes from 2020 to 2021 and 2022, we were able to same production of copper in 2023 despite a challenging environment for copper supplies Richard discussed, and we reported another year of growth in gold production. Our unit net cash costs for 2023 were above the 2022 level as expected but they came in very close to our original guidance for the year. We are continuing to actively manage cost and profitability initiatives to address cost inflation, and we will be working on that as we go forward. For the year 2023, we generate strong EBITDA of $8.8 billion and operating cash flows of over $5 billion. We are continuing to carefully manage not only our operating costs but also capital expenditures with a priority on spending on projects to sustain production, improve efficiencies and enhance optionality for future development options with attractive rates of return. During 2023, we returned $860 million to shareholders, bringing the total shareholder returns to $3.8 billion since we implemented our performance based payout framework in 2021. We ended the year with net debt of approximately $800 million and that excludes the smelter related debt, which is being financed separately. I'm going to move to Slide 5 and talk about the fourth quarter. During the fourth quarter, our sales were 3% above our estimates going into the quarter. Our gold production was also very strong. But our shipments of gold in the fourth quarter was slightly below the previous estimates and that reflected timing in these shipments when we made in the first quarter. Unit net cash costs averaged $1.52 per pound in the fourth quarter that was better than our guidance of $1.58 per pound and slightly below the year ago period. Notably, unit net cost, cash costs in Indonesia were zero in the fourth quarter, zero cents per pound, meaning our gold credits completely offset the production cost for copper. Average copper realizations in the fourth quarter were $3.81 per pound and we generated $2.3 billion in EBITDA and operating cash flows of $1.3 billion. We go around the world and talk a little bit about our various operations in the fourth quarter. In the US, we made progress in increasing our mining rates, that's been a big focus during the quarter with a 9% increase over the year ago quarter. We have a continued focus on improving our asset efficiencies and workforce experience levels. These are important initiatives as we seek to increase productivities to combat lower ore grades. Our innovative leach initiatives met expectations and also helped to mitigate the impact of lower ore grades in the US. Labor market conditions in the US continue to be tight. We're taking steps to expand housing options in our remote locations for recruiting and retention, and we're also continuing to pursue technology solutions to enhance productivity. Conversion of the bad debt truck fleet to fully autonomous is advancing and we're targeting to commence the transition in the second half of next year. In South America, our ore milled was sustained above 400,000 metric tons per day and our ore stacking rates increased at El Abra. No recoveries at Cerro Verde in the fourth quarter of 2023 were below the year ago level because of the material types that we're mining in the fourth quarter. This is continuing for mining phases in early 2024 and we're working to optimize performance. As Richard discussed, the fourth quarter performance in Indonesia was exceptional. Underground ore mined averaged over 214,000 tons per day and that was 8% higher than the year ago period. Combined with strong grades and recoveries, our copper and gold production in the fourth quarter was over 20% higher than last year's fourth quarter. We completed the installation of a new SAG mill at PT-FI in December and that'll provide additional opportunities for us going forward. And the team is just doing outstanding work, sustaining and optimizing value from this large resource position. We thought it'd be good to look back in history of how the underground transition has gone, Slide 6 covers this. We show the history of the progression of the transition. As Richard mentioned, we stopped mining from the surface in the Grasberg open pit at the end of 2019 and transitioned to fully underground operations beginning in 2020. We have a long history in Indonesia, spanning over 56 years and a great track record for building value over many years for all stakeholders. We\u2019re extremely proud of the team's execution on this transition. We now have the world's largest underground mining complex and it\u2019s been developed in a modern efficient operation. The Grasberg is the world's second largest copper mine and one of the largest gold mines, even though gold is a byproduct. High grades of both copper and gold make it one of the lowest cost operations in the world as well. This took a lot of planning. We began planning for this underground area over 25 years ago and commenced development activities in 2004. And as you can see from the graph, the project is performing exceptionally well and generating strong margins and cash flows. As we look forward, we are continuing to make investments in this resource to enhance value and sustain long term performance. We are working on the extension of our operating rights beyond 2041 and increasingly confident about securing our long term rights, and that would extend lives of our resources and open a whole new set of opportunities for this district. Richard touched on the smelter progress and this is really important for us in terms of securing long term rights. We reached two important milestones on these initiatives in 2023. The projects include a new greenfield smelter in East Java and expansion of our nearby existing smelter, which was developed in the late 1990s. Richard mentioned we celebrated in December the completion of the expansion project with the Indonesian Government and our Japanese partner. And we also reached a really important milestone on progress of the greenfield project with completion progress achieving a target we set with the government of over 90% by the end of December. We posted a video this morning on our Web site that shows the Greenfield smelter project. You can see all the progress that's been made and you can see the sheer size and scale of this impressive facility, and I hope you will have a chance to look at it. Both projects have been executed very efficiently in the context of a challenging market for major project development. The internal team that we have working on this project together with our contractor have done an outstanding job containing costs and maintaining schedules. We are working to complete the construction by the end of May of 2024 and to start commissioning and to conduct the ramp-up period over the balance of 2024. This is a big deal for us. It's not very frequent that you see new smelters starting up, and we have done a lot of planning going into the start up process. Our teams are well prepared and really highly motivated to achieve a safe, efficient and timely start-up in 2024. Turning to the US and the Americas where we've got an important leach initiative ongoing. We achieved our targeted run rate where we were targeting approximately 200 million pounds of copper per year by the end of 2023. This is an exciting and innovative initiative involving new operating practices being applied to our traditional leach operations and really working to get more out of our massive stockpiles that contain material that has been placed in prior years. Remember as we talked about on prior calls, the cost of this, the incremental cost of production, is low from both an operating and capital perspective, because we're targeting material where the material has already been mined and we're largely using existing infrastructure to extract the new metal. The first phase of this initiative essentially involves four basic categories of actions. One, as we talked about previously, we commenced the process to install covers over the stockpiles to increase heat retention and drive higher recoveries. Two, we gained access to areas in the stockpiles that have not previously had the benefit of leach solution initiative, we call leach everywhere. Three, we started using drilling techniques to specifically target areas within the stockpile where solution was lacking. And importantly, the fourth area is developing more sophisticated models using data analytics to optimize the application of solutions to improve performance, and using this data as a valuable tool in guiding work in all the areas of initiatives in this important program. As we look at where the impacts came from, you can see most of the incremental production was from our Morenci mine. That mine has a very long history of leaching operations. We have a massive set of stockpiles there and a very large opportunity set at Morenci. As we go to Phase 2 of the project where we are working to essentially double the initial target from 200 million pounds to 400 million pounds, we really are looking at just scaling these practices further. And by continuing to scale the operating practices, we think we can double the initial target over the next two to three years. And as we continue to work to sustain the production, we can add to our reserve position, and that's a real focus of ours to capitalize the progress into long term reserve additions. The first and second phase of this initiatives is really operationally driven using existing technologies. The third phase, which is also very exciting, is really the work that we and others are doing to advance the leaching process using different additives and different techniques, and this is more of an R&D effort but it's being advanced. We're commencing a large scale testing activity to evaluate the response to new additives. And we're also evaluating opportunities to get more heat retention in our stockpiles, and heat really is an enabler of more copper production and higher recoveries. In aggregate, these initiatives have the potential to reach 800 million pounds per annum and that's equivalent to a large scale copper mine. And notably, it's got very low capital intensity and you have seen how much new copper mines cost. This is a very low capital intensity, low incremental operating costs and a low carbon footprint. The value potential here is very attractive, particularly for a company like Freeport to take advantage of given our large quantities of suitable materials that we previously mined. Richard touched on copper markets earlier and we have some information on Slide 9. Physical markets have continued to tighten, inventories have declined and demand is growing. Despite the weak sentiment over the last several quarters on the Chinese economy and property sector, the reality is that China's copper consumption was strong throughout 2023 and this reflected the intensity of copper used in energy infrastructure, renewables and electric vehicles. In the US, our customers continue to report solid demand for copper with growth in several sectors. At the same time, supply disruption increased meaningfully in recent months. In total, near term supplies of copper had been reduced by over 700,000 tons in a very short period of time. The market was previously expecting that 2024 would be a small surplus market and turning to deficit beginning in 2025 timeframe and continuing for some time. With the recent supply disruptions and continued demand growth, the deficit market has been advanced into 2024, setting up for tight market conditions in the near term. While the fundamentals have become significantly more positive, macro conditions tied to US dollar strength and sentiment about China have influenced copper price movements. Richard mentioned we believe the fundamentals of the market will lead to significantly higher copper prices in the future and that's supported by anticipated strong growth in demand associated with secular trends and the global economy's requirements for copper. Also, the realities of the cost and time frames required for new supply development is an important factor when we look at the fundamental outlook for copper. Turning to how Freeport is positioning to try to grow production in response to this market demand. On Slide 10, we really look at the sizable reserve position of copper and even larger resource position that Freeport has that supports a pipeline for future growth options. Within the portfolio, we look for opportunities to get more out of what we have through innovation and operating efficiencies. We look for investments and projects so we have large resource positions and where we have established track records and opportunities to leverage the existing infrastructure, our people and capabilities, all with the drive focused on increasing value. We categorized on Slide 10 our near term, medium term and longer term development options. And we have outlined identified projects totaling about 1.7 billion pounds of copper in the Americas. And we have also highlighted on the slide the ongoing development of the Kucing Liar project in Indonesia, which is expected to support long term production profiles in the Grasberg District. The opportunities that are shown on the slide in the two to three year category they center around scaling our leach initiatives and achieving incremental production from our operational improvement projects. Together the potential from these opportunities total 400 million pounds of incremental copper per annum and do not require significant investment or long lead times. We discussed earlier the leach projects but we're also dedicating significant resources to enhancing productivity and asset efficiencies, rebuilding the experience of our workforce given the large number of new hires in recent years and utilizing new technologies and automation to restore and improve on productivity metrics that weakened somewhat during the pandemic. As we indicated, we completed a feasibility study late in the year 2023 to evaluate a project to more than double the size of our Bagdad operation in Northwest Arizona. The reserves at Bagdad are -- span for decades and they support expansion of infrastructure at the site to bring value forward. The incremental capital costs to build a new concentrator and support infrastructure for significantly higher mining and milling rates is on the order of $3.5 billion. And an expanded operation would not only substantially increase copper production but would produce economies of scale and reduce unit costs. The project does not require major permitting and is relatively straightforward. But given the tight labor market conditions and general market factors, we're not making a decision right now on the timing of the project. We'll continue to evaluate the timing of when we would go forward, but we are taking steps now to enhance optionality for the future by making some investments in the autonomous haulage for our mining operations, making some investments in housing and also advancing investments in the tailings infrastructure that will put us in a position and we make the decision we could get the project online within a few years. In Chile, at El Abra, we've talked about this. Our resource is very large. We have a major opportunity to install a new concentrator on the order of magnitude size of the concentrator we added at Cerro Verde in 2015. We'll continue to work to retest the economics and updating our project capital costs in light of recent capital cost experience of other large projects. And in parallel, we're starting work in preparation for environmental impact statement that would give us the ability to advance the project and provide optionality for future development. We mentioned the Kucing Liar development project in the Grasberg District, which we've initiated development on. This is a multiyear development project and it's proceeding on schedule and we expect to commence production by 2030, ramping up to over 500 million pounds of copper and over 500,000 ounces of gold. We're also conducting additional exploration in the Grasberg District where we have identified potential. We've got a big potential below our Deep MLZ orebody, and we expect to have additional opportunities in the future at Grasberg. We have a major opportunity in the US at the Safford Lone Star District. We've identified a significant resource there. This year, we're going to work to complete metallurgical testing and mine planning, and start a pre-feasibility study to assess future development options there. We continue to see this district as one that has big potential and potentially being a cornerstone asset in the US adjacent to the Morenci operations. In Indonesia, we\u2019re focused on this extension of our rights beyond 2041 because that would open up substantial opportunity for reserve and resource expansion and a continuation of the large scale mining in one of the world's largest and highest grade copper and gold mine districts. We are in a really strong position to continue our leadership role in supplying copper to a world with growing requirements. But we are going to continue to be disciplined in our approach and focused on executing projects where we can create value for shareholders. We have a lot of history in developing big projects, we included a slide on Page 11 that you can take a look at. A key strength of our company is the ability to execute projects successfully. This does not come easy. It requires a focused hands-on approach. And we have got a business model of pairing internal resources with trusted contractors and that has served us well. We have listed several projects that we have led over the years and we have developed very complex projects around the world. We are going to continue to approach future projects with the same level of preparedness, rigor and a focus on execution. As we look at 2024, turning to Slide 12, we have got our focus areas listed here. And first and foremost, we remain committed to safe and reliable execution of our operating plans across the global business. It seems like a simple thing but this involves discipline and hard work day in and day out. We discussed our focus on enhancing performance in the US through our Leach initiatives and productivity. This is particularly important to mitigate low grades and to manage costs, which have experienced higher inflation in recent years. We are going to have another big year in Indonesia. A key priority for us is to complete the smelter and ramp-up safely and efficiently and to finalize an agreement for extension of our long term operating rights. We are also very focused on enhancing optionality, definition and the value of our embedded growth options. On Slide 13, as usual, we show a three year outlook for sales volumes of copper, gold and molybdenum. For 2024, the copper sales volumes are slightly reduced less than 2% below our prior estimate and are now expected to be similar to 2023 levels. The gold sales are 10% higher than our prior estimate and higher than they were in 2023, higher sales in Indonesia for the year of 2024 offset by slightly lower sales from the Americas. In 2025, our sales estimates are similar to the prior estimates and we have added 2026 estimates, which you can see are slightly above the 2025 levels. For 2024, we currently estimate our consolidated unit costs to approximate $1.60 per pound. We have got some details in the reference materials, I believe, on Page 30 that you can look at the composition of those costs, but $1.60 very similar to what we had in 2023. On Slide 14, we put together our projected volumes and cost projections and we model the results for our EBITDA and cash flow at various copper prices ranging from $4 to $5 copper. These models use the average of 2025 and 2026 and our current volume estimates and our cost estimates and holding gold flat at roughly current levels of $2,000 per ounce and molybdenum flat at $19 per pound. And you can see here on the charts that annual EBITDA in these periods would range from $10 billion per annum at $4 copper to over $14 billion per year at $5 copper and operating cash flows under these price scenarios would range from $7 billion to over $10 billion. And we've got sensitivities to the various commodities on the right hand side of the chart. We're really well positioned with long line preserves, large scale production. We not only have current exposure to copper but all of our future projects and growth opportunities are well positioned to benefit from future metals intensive growth, and this will give us the ability to generate returns on projects and enhance cash returns under our performance based payout framework. Turning to the capital expenditures, on Slide 15. We show our current forecast for 2024 and 2025, which also show where we ended up for 2023, which total of $3.1 billion and that was slightly lower than what we've guided to in October of $3.2 billion. And capital for 2024 is currently forecast to approximate $3.6 billion compared with the $3.9 billion previously. The 2025 estimates that are new here are currently estimated to total $3.8 billion that includes $1.2 billion in discretionary growth projects, which totaled $2.4 billion over the 2024 and 2025 years. This category reflects the capital investments we're making in new projects to generate returns that under our financial policy are funded with 50% of available cash that's not distributed. They're value enhancing projects that are detailed in the reference materials on Slide 33. We're going to continue to be very disciplined around capital expenditures, carefully managing those. You saw we adjusted the capital expenditures down for 2024. And as we go forward, we'll continue to look at opportunities to do things, to sustain our business and to do things on a low capital intensity basis. And finally, before we take your questions, we -- just on Slide 16, we reiterate our financial policies and those are prioritized, centered on a strong balance sheet, cash returns to shareholders, and investments in value enhancing growth projects. Balance sheet is solid. We've got strong credit metrics and a lot of flexibility within our debt targets to execute on our projects. You may have seen that Moody's upgraded our credit rating in December and that just demonstrates our strong financial profile. Indicated on the slide, we've distributed almost $4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share purchases since the payout framework was implemented in the second half of 2021, and we have an attractive future long term portfolio that will enable us to continue to build value, long term value for shareholders. The global team, as we go forward, is really highly focused on our strategy of being foremost in copper. And we're driven to continue pursuing long term value in the business and executing our plans responsibly, safely and efficiently. And I want to thank everybody for their attention, and we'll now take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alex Hacking with Citi.\nAlex Hacking: Richard, I guess my question is around Bagdad and the technical study. Now I was a little surprised by how high the CapEx was $3.5 billion or incremental 100,000 tons, that\u2019s about $35,000 a ton. I mean, in your view, is that the new normal for a concentrate project or are there particular factors the fact that are raising the CapEx above historical levels?\nKathleen Quirk: I think it is somewhat of a new normal for the cost of a concentrator and related mining infrastructure. When you're dividing on the cost per ton, you're looking at how many pounds of copper are going to come out of that concentrator. And our US mines are characterized by relatively low ore grades, and Bagdad has relatively low copper ore grades but also has molybdenum kicker. So molybdenum would add something like 10 million pounds of molybdenum with an expansion. So that will be another benefit. But really, what we need to do is focus on -- it does bring down our overall cost per pound. So that's a big plus for us. When you look at an investment in the US, it may be to develop a relatively low grade mine. But something important to point out is that we don't have the tax burden in the US that you have in the international location. So I think our projects in the US, while they're low grade, when you cut through all the economics and you look at the ability for us to execute the projects and look at the risk associated with them are different than looking at a project in a different location. So there's some pluses or minuses that go into the bottom line. But we started this work on Bagdad some time ago and we've updated all of the capital costs in line with where current capital costs are. And so I think a reality of the market is that the incentive price to develop new copper, even if it's brownfield, is much higher than it has been in the past. And that's another reason why we believe that the markets that they need these copper units are going to have to adjust to the incentive prices required to get these projects going because we don't want to front run the market. We want to be prepared, we want to be -- have options to go forward as soon as we can. But we don't want to be in a position where we're investing in making major capital commitments before the market prices are telling us already.\nRichard Adkerson: Alex, let me just add very briefly that Kathleen makes a really good point about these relative economics. No royalties in the US. US tax rate is much lower -- federal tax rates much lower than outside the US. We have a net operating loss carryforward. Community support is strong in the US and we have no minority interest there. So looking at global benchmarks needs to be adjusted for the site specific factors that we have in the US, and they're very positive.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley.\nCarlos De Alba: Question is on cost. I just want to see if you can provide a little bit more color. The guidance for the first quarter of net unit cash cost of $1.55 per pound, looked very, very good relative to consensus stations and our own estimate. However, for the full year, the guidance came at $1.60 and that is a little bit higher than the market -- than again, consensus and our model suggests. So what are you expecting, what the viability in this, were you surprised at the beginning of the year but then maybe throughout the rest of the quarters is increasing, what is driving that? And to what extent this number for the year is conservative?\nKathleen Quirk: In terms of the first quarter, we do have some gold that was not shipped in the fourth quarter that will be shipped in the first quarter. And so the relative gold-to-copper ratio impacts the first quarter and makes that less than what we expect the average to be for the full year. I don't know what -- Carlos, what you had in there for export duties, but we're assuming in Indonesia that those are continuing. We are continuing to discuss with the government of Indonesia the applicability of those duties. And I think the more that we make progress on the smelter the better our case there is. But that\u2019s something we factored into the estimate but we are continuing to have that discussion. So if we are successful in reducing those duties that would be a benefit.\nCarlos De Alba: And just to clarify then Kathleen. The cash cost guidance for the year of $1.60 includes the duties in Indonesia, concentrate exports remain throughout the entire of the year, right, the full year?\nKathleen Quirk: Our export -- it only applies to export volumes. And so as we go through the year, the exports will decline because we'll be ramping up the smelter. So our goal for 2024 is to get the full ramp up completed. And so that's not something that will continue long term the duties once we get the smelter up and running. But it will start to decline over the course of the second half as we ramp up and we produce more domestically.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Christopher LaFemina with Jefferies.\nChristopher LaFemina: I wanted to ask about the kind of cost trends in North America, in particular, at Morenci. So I know that you're guiding to a slight increase in your site production delivery costs in 2024. And I assume that is a function of volumes being lower. But if we think about kind of where this business could be headed assuming that Morenci can kind of get back to where it was 12 or 18 months ago, and I'm not sure if that's a good assumption, but let's assume that to be the case. With the leaching ramp up, with the staffing and productivity improvements, with the new technologies and potentially even longer term with the Bagdad expansion. Where could that kind of site production and delivery cost number trend down to, could it get back to $2.50 or lower, or is $3 a pound sort of the new normal for that business?\nKathleen Quirk: Well, we hope it's not the new normal, Chris. We're working hard. I mean one of the things that you've got to take into account here is we are in a low grade period in the US. I think the grades that we had in 2023 were the lowest that they had been in probably 10 years or so or more. So we are in a period and that's continued in '24 where we do have some low grades that we're going through. But that is why it's so important for us to bring on units with a lower incremental cost and the leach opportunity will help us there. And as we are able to get those pounds put into reserves longer term, not just what you're mining that year or getting that year but multiyear reserve additions for the leach that spreads the cost -- all the costs over more reserves. And so it does help us with driving the economies of scale and why it's so important. We're not in a position now to say where costs could go. There's been a number of other factors that have -- inflation factors and things like the cost of basic parts and materials and supplies has gone up from where it was just two or three years ago, but we are very focused on it. And all of these self help things for us have very high rates of return. There's not a lot of capital involved. It's focused resources. It's not an easy thing because it would have been done already, but it is an area we think we can make improvements. We can also focus, which we're doing now on the last couple of years, we've had to rely more on contractors because of the staffing issues. But as we get staffing set up and get more experience in the workforce, we can reduce our reliance on contractors, as you probably know, have gotten expensive, and Arizona is a very competitive market. So we're working on all those things within the things that we have within our control and are really going to be focused on trying to drive the cost down. We're also looking at Morenci specifically at different configurations. We're looking at whether it makes sense for us to be operating all of our equipment like we are today and looking at if we cut back some things would that be the cost and benefits to that because that could have volume impacts as well. But is that a better setup, a more efficient setup that will allow us to drive costs lower. So we've got some of those initiatives that are being reviewed right now on what the right setup is given how costs have risen.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Orest Wowkodaw with Scotiabank.\nOrest Wowkodaw: Given the capital costs involved and the timing of building new projects and the strength of your balance sheet. I'm just wondering whether M&A of producing assets is something that's on the radar, because it certainly seems like there could be some assets available out there, especially in jurisdictions you\u2019re not currently in?\nRichard Adkerson: Well, we're constantly monitoring the market and you can be confident that opportunities are available are presented to us and we consider them. The facts are we haven't found those attractive today. We have such great opportunities to create value totally for our shareholders by focusing on internal growth through the leach project, through the brownfield developments in the Americas, through the Kucing Liar project in Indonesia and now with expectation that we'll go beyond 2041, we're going to do additional exploration there to understand what the opportunities are. Success in any of those opportunities creates value where there's no value in our current share price. So it's all for the best of our shareholders and that makes it much more difficult for external opportunities to compete with them. And my experience has shown that small mines get smaller and big mines get bigger. So we really are, as I said in my opening comments, pleased about where Freeport is positioned for what we believe is going to be a great future for our company.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Edward Goldsmith from Deutsche Bank.\nEdward Goldsmith: Two questions from my side. So firstly, can you give an update on the status of the negotiations over concentrate export extension post May? And secondly, can you outline the reductions to the 2024 CapEx? I think they were the discretionary and the other CapEx bucket level.\nKathleen Quirk: On the first part of the question, our current export license in Indonesia goes to May of 2024. And we are continually having discussions with the government of Indonesia about the fact that while we will be substantially complete on construction activities by the end of May, which is -- was really important target for us and for them that just the ordinary course of a smelter start-up, it takes five or six months to get through. And so we're having those discussions, they understand the situation. And they're encouraging us to continue to meet our targets and that those discussions will continue [Technical Difficulty] that the alignment that we have with the 51% ownership of the state-owned company mined ID in PT-FI's operations is really important here. That, combined with tax revenues, et cetera, that the government gets from having consistent operations at PT-FI is we're both aligned in that to have exports continue. So the conversations have been constructive to date but we've got to continue to progress it. And have those -- continuing to have the discussions with the government and we're doing that on a regular basis.\nRichard Adkerson: And Kathleen, just let me add. They're not negotiations over this issue. The mine -- I mean I've spoken in recent months on at least three occasions directly with the President about it. He understands it, the Mines Minister who has the business background clearly understands it. It's just administrative procedurally they concluded not to grant that export rights beyond this date to see if we complete the smelter as we've committed to do it. But beyond that, it will be just be an administrative action to get it approved.\nKathleen Quirk: On the second question with respect to capital expenditures. We always go through a process of looking for opportunities to push out capital if it's not required in the current year. And we went through a process between the last update on this one to really look hard at what we could efficiently spend this year and cut back on some things. Some of that\u2019s showing up in 2025. We'll do the same thing again because really what we want to do is deploy the capital as efficiently as we can and make sure we're sustaining the reliability of our operations, but also looking at -- we don't want to be doing too many things at one time. And so we always take a hard look at it. So we'll continue to do that as we go forward and manage the capital very carefully. But there wasn't really one big thing, there was a number of things that we did in looking at the prior estimate for 2024.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research.\nMichael Dudas: With regard to your proposed investments in the US, maybe even looking in Latin America, maybe if you can remind us on an internal rate of return, risk-adjusted rate return basis, what Freeport is looking for? Certainly, you mentioned US investments, you get benefits from royalty and tax issues. But just on a general basis, even when you're thinking about your assets in Indonesia. And then the follow-up on that, is the industry relative to a year ago today, is the industry ahead of the curve or behind the curve on meeting what the expected demand opportunities are in the market?\nKathleen Quirk: On the first part of the question, with respect to how we evaluate projects and returns, we don't target one number. We look at what the specific project is, what the execution risk is, where it's located. And we run a range of commodity price assumptions around it to look at. What we're really focused on in deploying capital is investing and putting our infrastructure and investments in places where we can execute the plan and in places where we've got long term reserves, because anybody that tells you they can get the copper price right is wrong because it's going to move up and down. And so what we want to have is a situation where we've got a very long life reserve where you can make that capital investment upfront and realize cash flows over a long period of time and not have to get the price forecast for copper perfect in the first year or two. And so when we look at returns, we're looking at those projects that have leverage to future copper. And we look at something outside of the US, we may apply higher risk factors and we look to get higher rates of return than what we would want to have in something like the US where for reasons that Richard talked about, have somewhat of a lower risk profile for us. But it is not one scientific number it's a range of scenarios that we run around a project. And again, looking at the resource and the size of the investment and our ability to generate returns over a long period of time that would be consistent, not that it would go away -- it would fall off, something that could be earned over a long period of time, has a long tail, which a lot of our projects do. And Richard might have some perspectives on the second question. I think it's obvious that there haven't been new projects sanctioned in our industry for some time. And what's happened recently in recent years with the copper prices rallying and then falling off has just caused more delays, more cautiousness by developers in developing the project. So I would say, in my opinion, the situation has become more significant because the projects are taking longer, not shorter. And we talked about when we started on Grasberg Underground, we started planning -- started investing 20 years ago in it. I mean you really have -- these are long lead time projects and we really need to have started investments. And that's why we're really focused on what can we do, continue to plan for these long term projects. So what else can we do and what can we do to take advantage of technology that's available to us and what can we do to get more out of the resources we already have, but not everybody has that ability. And Richard, I don't know if you want to add any comments to that second part.\nRichard Adkerson: Well, I'll add a brief comment to the first part too, Kathleen. My early experience in my career was in the oil and gas industry. And early on, Dan [indiscernible] and I wrote a paper on oil price forecasting, which basically evidenced how wrong forecasts can be. And so we approach, as Kathleen described, all of our investment and business planning on a scenario basis, not trying to predict a particular price or range of price but to look at what impact investment decisions and operating decisions have on our overall portfolio. And we look to protect ourselves on a portfolio basis from downside risk and then structure investments to take advantage of what we have is confidence in the long term price. So it's not any kind of formal rate of return kind of criteria that you see in a lot of industries, which work elsewhere, and have the saying that figures don't lie but liars figure. And so we just really base these things, as I said, on scenario planning and portfolio impacts. The basic thesis, I believe, for the demand for copper is unchanged and continues to be supported. From the very start my work with ICMM where I was Chairman, two occasions, but more recently when all the issues about aspirational goals for carbon reductions were being considered in such promise. I've always said that there are a lot of unanswered questions and the movement towards these aspirational goals will not be consistent, but they'll have issues, complications and so forth and that's certainly what we're seeing. The future of copper is really influenced significantly by investments in carbon reduction and I think it's something the world absolutely has to do. And there are other factors related to global growth, connectivity, these data centers, some of that's being driven by artificial intelligence. Just everywhere you turn, the world is getting more electrified. And that's why I think the fundamental long term demand thesis for copper is just getting stronger and stronger.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian MacArthur with Raymond James.\nBrian MacArthur: It goes back to what Alex was asking in Bagdad. So I just want to make sure as I look at these numbers, so the project capital is $3.5 billion. And I would have to think you get some in structure benefit there, so it's not a true greenfield. And then you talk about a $3.50 to $4 incentive copper prices, and I understand the benefits of new royalties and taxes. Does that sort of say that if you didn't have infrastructure, the capital costs would have been higher. And if you didn't have all these tax benefits, the incentive price would be an awful lot higher, i.e., if anybody else had to do a greenfield there, you'd probably need a incentive price well over $4 to make it work, i.e., those numbers include all the tax benefits and everything that you were talking about before, if I can ask the question that way.\nKathleen Quirk: Brian, if somebody else has the same situation, greenfield and the grades we have, it would be a lot more, a lot more expensive.\nRichard Adkerson: A lot more. And your $4 is absolutely right. I mean you just look at recent projects and look at how costs escalate and then what would have taken from an incentive price to justify that project from the outset if the cost numbers have been known. So this is not that complicated. So it's not a greenfield project. We've operated there for 80 years or so. And it's about a straightforward project as you could have, but it's telling for the industry even with this kind of straightforward project the challenge you face. It's cost, it's tailings and we do benefit from infrastructure. This is just a mill expansion. It's not building a new mine. But then there's a challenge of getting workers and housing for workers. So all of this is real telling on the supply side -- I just talked about the demand side support for copper. So this is a great example of a simple project in terms of the relative complexities of projects in our industry, this is relatively simple. And yet, it faces these challenges of being economically justified in today's price. At the outset, I said today's copper price is not a price that\u2019s adequate to stimulate the kind of investments that are going to be needed for this industry. And that's why we're optimistic about future prices.\nBrian MacArthur: And maybe if I could just ask just on the capital allocation. I mean, you've got lots of options, as you said. But if you're successful for Phase 3, I mean you get as much production there as you would hear, I assume a fraction of the capital cost. Does Bagdad get pushed in that situation? I mean, I get that the world needs probably all of it. But would they get sequenced or are they complementary? I mean I know they don't depend on each other, but are they complementary and you would do both at once if both work?\nKathleen Quirk: We're prioritizing the leach initiative. I mean that is one that's a no-brainer for us. It's very, very little capital that we're investing in it and very low increment -- it's our lowest incremental operating cost of anything in the US. And so that's a no-brainer. We're pursuing that regardless, that makes a ton of sense and we're pursuing that regardless. We think the world is going to need something beyond that, obviously. And so on the Bagdad thing, we just want to get it, get it to where -- continue to enhance the optionality in it, and we need to do some things anyway. We're doing some infrastructure on tailings that we would need to do anyway in the future, maybe not as quickly as what we would need with the new project, but we need to do those anyway. So we're going to do those to the extent we can do that efficiently. We want this autonomous thing that we're pursuing. Years ago, people thought you didn't really need autonomous in the US. But now, particularly in these remote locations, you really, really do when you consider the cost of the workforce and the housing limitations and that sort of thing and the opportunities to upscale our employees, we think it checks all of those boxes. So autonomous, we want that to see how that unfolds. So we don't have to pull the trigger on Bagdad now but we want to put it in a position where it can go forward. It makes sense if the world needs more copper to get copper from where we already have it. And so it does -- it's a good project, it's not a barn burner from an economic standpoint, right now. But it will have its day and I think it will get time at some point, it just we aren't predicting exactly when.\nRichard Adkerson: And Brian, we got a strong enough financial position that we can -- capital is not a barrier for us to do in projects that make sense.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alan Spence with BNP Paribas.\nAlan Spence: You highlighted the record [Technical Difficulty]\u2026\nRichard Adkerson: Alan, you're breaking up on us.\nAlan Spence: I'll try again, hopefully -- hear me\u2026\nKathleen Quirk: Yes, that's better.\nAlan Spence: The strong performance for [Technical Difficulty] in [December], is that a level you think could potentially be [Technical Difficulty] through '24 or was there something unique about what happened last month? And also, if you could remind me in terms of timeline to get to 240,000 tons per day run rate?\nKathleen Quirk: With respect to [Multiple Speakers] I was going to say Mark Johnson is on the line, he can add to it if you want. But with respect to December, it highlights, we got that SAG mill completed, the new SAG mill completed in December So really, that gave us the ability to put more ore throughput through the concentrators. And with the combination of higher grades and strong recoveries, we had a great month. Now we have the ability to continue to have strong performance. We achieved a lot of records in December but we do have the ability and some upside to continue that. That SAG mill was originally put in the plan because over time, we'll need the additional grinding capacity, et cetera, to take the ore that will be coming. But right now while we're in these higher grade sections, the more we can put through the mills the better the copper production will be. In terms of the $240 million, right now, we don't have $240 million in our plans. But over time, with the addition of Kucing Liar we'll have that capacity to do it. But having SAG 3 does give us some more opportunities in the near term to -- if we continue to have high rates of ore produced from the underground will give us some upside. A mine, we don't talk a lot about but one that we're going to try to keep improving on is the [Gossan] mine, it's a relatively small mine, but very, very high grade. And we've got some plans to bring in some additional, and that's reflected in the five year guidance, but some additional throughput from [Gossan] that will add copper production and gold production. And Mark, I don't know if you want to add into any of those comments.\nMark Johnson: Kathleen, the only thing I would add is as part of the KL project, we also add some -- over the shorter term, we had some workflow capacity and optionality at GBC. That allows us to get GBC up from like 120,000 up to 140,000 tons a day in 2026. And at that point, we'll be able to run close to 240,000 tons through the mill. The mine and mill will be matched. And then as you said, the KL come up and then GBC and KL share portions of the ore flow system. But over the short term, we sequenced that part of the KL ore flow that gives us the opportunity at GBC in the much shorter term.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Peterson with JPMorgan.\nBill Peterson: Nice job on the quarterly execution, thanks for sneaking in my question here. So I wanted to come back to the leaching efforts, the incremental 200 million pounds. I think you mentioned two to three year period, is that a 30 linear ramp or is that more back end weighted? And you've consistently talked about low capital intensity. Can you remind us what the capital associated with this is, I guess, quantified and has there been any CapEx creep in interim similar to just other broader projects?\nKathleen Quirk: On the time frame for the incremental 200 million, we have not given a specific time frame. We do feel we can get it done within a couple of years and we'll add whatever we can in the interim. This leach everywhere initiative that we have where we are accessing parts of stockpiles that hadn't been accessed before, getting access to some of the side slopes and some of the areas around the stockpile that we just didn't leach before, that's been a big driver of success and will continue to be. The other one that we're excited about is the targeted drilling. And through our data, we can see where you have situations where the solution that needs to get to the ore has been blocked for some reason over history, and this targeted drilling allows us to get access to it. We are testing this year some abilities to do that more at scale. And that is something that we're really interested to see how that develops and whether that will give us some additional incremental production. We haven't factored that into our plans at this point but we're going to continue to use these covers. We still don't have everything -- the stockpiles are so massive, covering -- spanning particularly Morenci, just miles of area. And so we're still doing the covers. We're still looking for other opportunities to get heat into the stockpiles. We're targeting some pyrite ores in some of our operations that have pyrite in the ores, that is a source of heat as well. But there are a number of things that we're working on that are not the big R&D effort, but things that we can do from an operational standpoint. But well stay tuned, we will -- this is a big initiative and stay tuned will, as we go forward, love to give you a little bit more as we go through 2024 in terms of the time frame. We haven't spent much capital on this initiative. We've already got the infrastructure -- basic infrastructure, the tank house capacity, this is copper that goes to a tank house, not a smelter. And we have already excess latent tank house capacity. We've spent some money but it doesn't round to anything really big. The operating cost, the incremental operating costs of this have been very low on the order of $1 per pound. And so it's just a really, really exciting opportunity for us to generate value. And so as we go forward, we don't see huge amounts of capital either that will come into play. When you get to this piece that's R&D, that's where we need to make sure that all these things can be applied and deployed at scale and can be economic but that thing is ongoing. But the first 400 million pounds we think that we can do that without spending a lot of capital.\nRichard Adkerson: And you may have noted this, Kathleen, but importantly, there's no permitting issues. And that is a real challenge for any kind of project you do in terms of brownfield expansions and really tougher greenfield expansion. So here, no capital or operating costs, no permitting delays.\nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of Lawson Winder with Bank of America Securities.\nLawson Winder: If I could just sneak in one and a half questions. One would be on the current level of the dividend. I mean, is your view that given the cash flow outlook, your view of the copper price, I mean, is this a comfortable level for the dividend for 2024? And then just my half question would be, is there any movement within your existing TCRC contracts to potentially renegotiate those or get the benefit of some of the really, really low spot pricing we're seeing today?\nKathleen Quirk: On the dividend question, our Board reviews the financial policy on a regular basis. And we put in place the base dividend, the variable dividend and we've been paying at that level for some time now. We'll continue to review that with the Board. You can see from our results the financial results that we're projecting for 2024 look very good. But we always going to look at what's going on in the market and don't want to put ourselves in a position of running up debt, but we have a good balance sheet. So I don't want to front run anything. The Board will look at this on a regular basis but our financial position is in really excellent shape. The second question on TCRCs, we reach agreement, as you know, on long term TCRCs that are done on fixed contracts once a year. And since then, spot rates have come a lot, lot lower given the tightness in supply. We do sell some things on a spot basis but most of it is sold under these fixed contracts where we have the TCRCs fixed. The other thing is once we get the smelter in Indonesia up and running, we don't have -- we still have with Cerro Verde concentrate that we sell. But everything from Indonesia will be really just processed through our own smelters.\nRichard Adkerson: And our contracts are long term in terms of volumes, but the TCRCs are renegotiated each year. And you raised a great point for those of you who haven't followed it, but the situation right now with smelters where they can't get concentrate to process is a real strong indicator of where this market is and where it's going.\nOperator: I'll turn the call back to management for any closing remarks.\nKathleen Quirk: We appreciate it, everyone. If there are any follow-ups, feel free to call David and we're available to continue to discuss, and we'll report to you our progress throughout the year.\nRichard Adkerson: Yes. Thank you for joining us today, and everyone, have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kathleen Quirk",
            "content": "Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Freeport-McMoRan conference call. Earlier this morning, we reported our fourth quarter and full year 2023 operating and financial results. And a copy of today's press release and supplemental schedules and slides are available on our Web site at fcx.com. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today.  Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include non-GAAP measures and forward-looking statements and that actual results may differ materially. I would like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings.  Also on the call with me today are Richard Adkerson, our Chairman and CEO; Maree Robertson, our Chief Financial Officer; Josh Olmsted, our COO of Americas; Mark Johnson, Operating Officer for Indonesia; Mike Kendrick, who runs our molybdenum business; and Steve Higgins, our Chief Administrative Officer. We'll start the call with some opening comments from Richard and then we will go through the slide presentation materials and then open up the call for your questions.  So I'll turn it over to Richard. Richard, go ahead. Okay. Thank you, Richard. And I will be covering the presentation materials starting with Slide 3, our achievements for 2023 are summarized here. Our sharp focus on executing our plans in an effective, safe and responsible manner, managing the controllable drivers and navigating challenges successfully, all translated into solid operating results over the year. A big highlight for the year was the outstanding progress in Indonesia where we grew production levels for the fourth year in a row. We posted several new operating records and we continue to enhance values for this large scale, low cost and long life resource. We were also successful in reaching several milestones during the year, including reaching our target run rate for incremental leach production in the Americas, enhancing optionality in the Americas for our brownfield growth projects and reaching our targeted 90% completion milestone for the Indonesian smelter project by the end of 2023. As a leader in the industry, we were one of the first companies to have all of our operating sites certified under the copper and molybdenum marks, and this demonstrates our performance and commitment to responsible mining practices. We ended the year 2023 in a strong financial position, a positive outlook and as we work together to enhance long term value for shareholders. On Slide 4, we summarize the key results for 2023 compared with historical levels. After growing our volumes from 2020 to 2021 and 2022, we were able to same production of copper in 2023 despite a challenging environment for copper supplies Richard discussed, and we reported another year of growth in gold production. Our unit net cash costs for 2023 were above the 2022 level as expected but they came in very close to our original guidance for the year. We are continuing to actively manage cost and profitability initiatives to address cost inflation, and we will be working on that as we go forward. For the year 2023, we generate strong EBITDA of $8.8 billion and operating cash flows of over $5 billion. We are continuing to carefully manage not only our operating costs but also capital expenditures with a priority on spending on projects to sustain production, improve efficiencies and enhance optionality for future development options with attractive rates of return. During 2023, we returned $860 million to shareholders, bringing the total shareholder returns to $3.8 billion since we implemented our performance based payout framework in 2021. We ended the year with net debt of approximately $800 million and that excludes the smelter related debt, which is being financed separately. I'm going to move to Slide 5 and talk about the fourth quarter. During the fourth quarter, our sales were 3% above our estimates going into the quarter. Our gold production was also very strong. But our shipments of gold in the fourth quarter was slightly below the previous estimates and that reflected timing in these shipments when we made in the first quarter. Unit net cash costs averaged $1.52 per pound in the fourth quarter that was better than our guidance of $1.58 per pound and slightly below the year ago period. Notably, unit net cost, cash costs in Indonesia were zero in the fourth quarter, zero cents per pound, meaning our gold credits completely offset the production cost for copper. Average copper realizations in the fourth quarter were $3.81 per pound and we generated $2.3 billion in EBITDA and operating cash flows of $1.3 billion. We go around the world and talk a little bit about our various operations in the fourth quarter. In the US, we made progress in increasing our mining rates, that's been a big focus during the quarter with a 9% increase over the year ago quarter. We have a continued focus on improving our asset efficiencies and workforce experience levels. These are important initiatives as we seek to increase productivities to combat lower ore grades. Our innovative leach initiatives met expectations and also helped to mitigate the impact of lower ore grades in the US. Labor market conditions in the US continue to be tight. We're taking steps to expand housing options in our remote locations for recruiting and retention, and we're also continuing to pursue technology solutions to enhance productivity. Conversion of the bad debt truck fleet to fully autonomous is advancing and we're targeting to commence the transition in the second half of next year. In South America, our ore milled was sustained above 400,000 metric tons per day and our ore stacking rates increased at El Abra. No recoveries at Cerro Verde in the fourth quarter of 2023 were below the year ago level because of the material types that we're mining in the fourth quarter. This is continuing for mining phases in early 2024 and we're working to optimize performance. As Richard discussed, the fourth quarter performance in Indonesia was exceptional. Underground ore mined averaged over 214,000 tons per day and that was 8% higher than the year ago period. Combined with strong grades and recoveries, our copper and gold production in the fourth quarter was over 20% higher than last year's fourth quarter. We completed the installation of a new SAG mill at PT-FI in December and that'll provide additional opportunities for us going forward. And the team is just doing outstanding work, sustaining and optimizing value from this large resource position. We thought it'd be good to look back in history of how the underground transition has gone, Slide 6 covers this. We show the history of the progression of the transition. As Richard mentioned, we stopped mining from the surface in the Grasberg open pit at the end of 2019 and transitioned to fully underground operations beginning in 2020. We have a long history in Indonesia, spanning over 56 years and a great track record for building value over many years for all stakeholders. We're extremely proud of the team's execution on this transition. We now have the world's largest underground mining complex and it's been developed in a modern efficient operation. The Grasberg is the world's second largest copper mine and one of the largest gold mines, even though gold is a byproduct. High grades of both copper and gold make it one of the lowest cost operations in the world as well. This took a lot of planning. We began planning for this underground area over 25 years ago and commenced development activities in 2004. And as you can see from the graph, the project is performing exceptionally well and generating strong margins and cash flows. As we look forward, we are continuing to make investments in this resource to enhance value and sustain long term performance. We are working on the extension of our operating rights beyond 2041 and increasingly confident about securing our long term rights, and that would extend lives of our resources and open a whole new set of opportunities for this district. Richard touched on the smelter progress and this is really important for us in terms of securing long term rights. We reached two important milestones on these initiatives in 2023. The projects include a new greenfield smelter in East Java and expansion of our nearby existing smelter, which was developed in the late 1990s. Richard mentioned we celebrated in December the completion of the expansion project with the Indonesian Government and our Japanese partner. And we also reached a really important milestone on progress of the greenfield project with completion progress achieving a target we set with the government of over 90% by the end of December. We posted a video this morning on our Web site that shows the Greenfield smelter project. You can see all the progress that's been made and you can see the sheer size and scale of this impressive facility, and I hope you will have a chance to look at it. Both projects have been executed very efficiently in the context of a challenging market for major project development. The internal team that we have working on this project together with our contractor have done an outstanding job containing costs and maintaining schedules. We are working to complete the construction by the end of May of 2024 and to start commissioning and to conduct the ramp-up period over the balance of 2024. This is a big deal for us. It's not very frequent that you see new smelters starting up, and we have done a lot of planning going into the start up process. Our teams are well prepared and really highly motivated to achieve a safe, efficient and timely start-up in 2024. Turning to the US and the Americas where we've got an important leach initiative ongoing. We achieved our targeted run rate where we were targeting approximately 200 million pounds of copper per year by the end of 2023. This is an exciting and innovative initiative involving new operating practices being applied to our traditional leach operations and really working to get more out of our massive stockpiles that contain material that has been placed in prior years. Remember as we talked about on prior calls, the cost of this, the incremental cost of production, is low from both an operating and capital perspective, because we're targeting material where the material has already been mined and we're largely using existing infrastructure to extract the new metal. The first phase of this initiative essentially involves four basic categories of actions. One, as we talked about previously, we commenced the process to install covers over the stockpiles to increase heat retention and drive higher recoveries. Two, we gained access to areas in the stockpiles that have not previously had the benefit of leach solution initiative, we call leach everywhere. Three, we started using drilling techniques to specifically target areas within the stockpile where solution was lacking. And importantly, the fourth area is developing more sophisticated models using data analytics to optimize the application of solutions to improve performance, and using this data as a valuable tool in guiding work in all the areas of initiatives in this important program. As we look at where the impacts came from, you can see most of the incremental production was from our Morenci mine. That mine has a very long history of leaching operations. We have a massive set of stockpiles there and a very large opportunity set at Morenci. As we go to Phase 2 of the project where we are working to essentially double the initial target from 200 million pounds to 400 million pounds, we really are looking at just scaling these practices further. And by continuing to scale the operating practices, we think we can double the initial target over the next two to three years. And as we continue to work to sustain the production, we can add to our reserve position, and that's a real focus of ours to capitalize the progress into long term reserve additions. The first and second phase of this initiatives is really operationally driven using existing technologies. The third phase, which is also very exciting, is really the work that we and others are doing to advance the leaching process using different additives and different techniques, and this is more of an R&D effort but it's being advanced. We're commencing a large scale testing activity to evaluate the response to new additives. And we're also evaluating opportunities to get more heat retention in our stockpiles, and heat really is an enabler of more copper production and higher recoveries. In aggregate, these initiatives have the potential to reach 800 million pounds per annum and that's equivalent to a large scale copper mine. And notably, it's got very low capital intensity and you have seen how much new copper mines cost. This is a very low capital intensity, low incremental operating costs and a low carbon footprint. The value potential here is very attractive, particularly for a company like Freeport to take advantage of given our large quantities of suitable materials that we previously mined. Richard touched on copper markets earlier and we have some information on Slide 9. Physical markets have continued to tighten, inventories have declined and demand is growing. Despite the weak sentiment over the last several quarters on the Chinese economy and property sector, the reality is that China's copper consumption was strong throughout 2023 and this reflected the intensity of copper used in energy infrastructure, renewables and electric vehicles. In the US, our customers continue to report solid demand for copper with growth in several sectors. At the same time, supply disruption increased meaningfully in recent months. In total, near term supplies of copper had been reduced by over 700,000 tons in a very short period of time. The market was previously expecting that 2024 would be a small surplus market and turning to deficit beginning in 2025 timeframe and continuing for some time. With the recent supply disruptions and continued demand growth, the deficit market has been advanced into 2024, setting up for tight market conditions in the near term. While the fundamentals have become significantly more positive, macro conditions tied to US dollar strength and sentiment about China have influenced copper price movements. Richard mentioned we believe the fundamentals of the market will lead to significantly higher copper prices in the future and that's supported by anticipated strong growth in demand associated with secular trends and the global economy's requirements for copper. Also, the realities of the cost and time frames required for new supply development is an important factor when we look at the fundamental outlook for copper. Turning to how Freeport is positioning to try to grow production in response to this market demand. On Slide 10, we really look at the sizable reserve position of copper and even larger resource position that Freeport has that supports a pipeline for future growth options. Within the portfolio, we look for opportunities to get more out of what we have through innovation and operating efficiencies. We look for investments and projects so we have large resource positions and where we have established track records and opportunities to leverage the existing infrastructure, our people and capabilities, all with the drive focused on increasing value. We categorized on Slide 10 our near term, medium term and longer term development options. And we have outlined identified projects totaling about 1.7 billion pounds of copper in the Americas. And we have also highlighted on the slide the ongoing development of the Kucing Liar project in Indonesia, which is expected to support long term production profiles in the Grasberg District. The opportunities that are shown on the slide in the two to three year category they center around scaling our leach initiatives and achieving incremental production from our operational improvement projects. Together the potential from these opportunities total 400 million pounds of incremental copper per annum and do not require significant investment or long lead times. We discussed earlier the leach projects but we're also dedicating significant resources to enhancing productivity and asset efficiencies, rebuilding the experience of our workforce given the large number of new hires in recent years and utilizing new technologies and automation to restore and improve on productivity metrics that weakened somewhat during the pandemic. As we indicated, we completed a feasibility study late in the year 2023 to evaluate a project to more than double the size of our Bagdad operation in Northwest Arizona. The reserves at Bagdad are -- span for decades and they support expansion of infrastructure at the site to bring value forward. The incremental capital costs to build a new concentrator and support infrastructure for significantly higher mining and milling rates is on the order of $3.5 billion. And an expanded operation would not only substantially increase copper production but would produce economies of scale and reduce unit costs. The project does not require major permitting and is relatively straightforward. But given the tight labor market conditions and general market factors, we're not making a decision right now on the timing of the project. We'll continue to evaluate the timing of when we would go forward, but we are taking steps now to enhance optionality for the future by making some investments in the autonomous haulage for our mining operations, making some investments in housing and also advancing investments in the tailings infrastructure that will put us in a position and we make the decision we could get the project online within a few years. In Chile, at El Abra, we've talked about this. Our resource is very large. We have a major opportunity to install a new concentrator on the order of magnitude size of the concentrator we added at Cerro Verde in 2015. We'll continue to work to retest the economics and updating our project capital costs in light of recent capital cost experience of other large projects. And in parallel, we're starting work in preparation for environmental impact statement that would give us the ability to advance the project and provide optionality for future development. We mentioned the Kucing Liar development project in the Grasberg District, which we've initiated development on. This is a multiyear development project and it's proceeding on schedule and we expect to commence production by 2030, ramping up to over 500 million pounds of copper and over 500,000 ounces of gold. We're also conducting additional exploration in the Grasberg District where we have identified potential. We've got a big potential below our Deep MLZ orebody, and we expect to have additional opportunities in the future at Grasberg. We have a major opportunity in the US at the Safford Lone Star District. We've identified a significant resource there. This year, we're going to work to complete metallurgical testing and mine planning, and start a pre-feasibility study to assess future development options there. We continue to see this district as one that has big potential and potentially being a cornerstone asset in the US adjacent to the Morenci operations. In Indonesia, we're focused on this extension of our rights beyond 2041 because that would open up substantial opportunity for reserve and resource expansion and a continuation of the large scale mining in one of the world's largest and highest grade copper and gold mine districts. We are in a really strong position to continue our leadership role in supplying copper to a world with growing requirements. But we are going to continue to be disciplined in our approach and focused on executing projects where we can create value for shareholders. We have a lot of history in developing big projects, we included a slide on Page 11 that you can take a look at. A key strength of our company is the ability to execute projects successfully. This does not come easy. It requires a focused hands-on approach. And we have got a business model of pairing internal resources with trusted contractors and that has served us well. We have listed several projects that we have led over the years and we have developed very complex projects around the world. We are going to continue to approach future projects with the same level of preparedness, rigor and a focus on execution. As we look at 2024, turning to Slide 12, we have got our focus areas listed here. And first and foremost, we remain committed to safe and reliable execution of our operating plans across the global business. It seems like a simple thing but this involves discipline and hard work day in and day out. We discussed our focus on enhancing performance in the US through our Leach initiatives and productivity. This is particularly important to mitigate low grades and to manage costs, which have experienced higher inflation in recent years. We are going to have another big year in Indonesia. A key priority for us is to complete the smelter and ramp-up safely and efficiently and to finalize an agreement for extension of our long term operating rights. We are also very focused on enhancing optionality, definition and the value of our embedded growth options. On Slide 13, as usual, we show a three year outlook for sales volumes of copper, gold and molybdenum. For 2024, the copper sales volumes are slightly reduced less than 2% below our prior estimate and are now expected to be similar to 2023 levels. The gold sales are 10% higher than our prior estimate and higher than they were in 2023, higher sales in Indonesia for the year of 2024 offset by slightly lower sales from the Americas. In 2025, our sales estimates are similar to the prior estimates and we have added 2026 estimates, which you can see are slightly above the 2025 levels. For 2024, we currently estimate our consolidated unit costs to approximate $1.60 per pound. We have got some details in the reference materials, I believe, on Page 30 that you can look at the composition of those costs, but $1.60 very similar to what we had in 2023. On Slide 14, we put together our projected volumes and cost projections and we model the results for our EBITDA and cash flow at various copper prices ranging from $4 to $5 copper. These models use the average of 2025 and 2026 and our current volume estimates and our cost estimates and holding gold flat at roughly current levels of $2,000 per ounce and molybdenum flat at $19 per pound. And you can see here on the charts that annual EBITDA in these periods would range from $10 billion per annum at $4 copper to over $14 billion per year at $5 copper and operating cash flows under these price scenarios would range from $7 billion to over $10 billion. And we've got sensitivities to the various commodities on the right hand side of the chart. We're really well positioned with long line preserves, large scale production. We not only have current exposure to copper but all of our future projects and growth opportunities are well positioned to benefit from future metals intensive growth, and this will give us the ability to generate returns on projects and enhance cash returns under our performance based payout framework. Turning to the capital expenditures, on Slide 15. We show our current forecast for 2024 and 2025, which also show where we ended up for 2023, which total of $3.1 billion and that was slightly lower than what we've guided to in October of $3.2 billion. And capital for 2024 is currently forecast to approximate $3.6 billion compared with the $3.9 billion previously. The 2025 estimates that are new here are currently estimated to total $3.8 billion that includes $1.2 billion in discretionary growth projects, which totaled $2.4 billion over the 2024 and 2025 years. This category reflects the capital investments we're making in new projects to generate returns that under our financial policy are funded with 50% of available cash that's not distributed. They're value enhancing projects that are detailed in the reference materials on Slide 33. We're going to continue to be very disciplined around capital expenditures, carefully managing those. You saw we adjusted the capital expenditures down for 2024. And as we go forward, we'll continue to look at opportunities to do things, to sustain our business and to do things on a low capital intensity basis. And finally, before we take your questions, we -- just on Slide 16, we reiterate our financial policies and those are prioritized, centered on a strong balance sheet, cash returns to shareholders, and investments in value enhancing growth projects. Balance sheet is solid. We've got strong credit metrics and a lot of flexibility within our debt targets to execute on our projects. You may have seen that Moody's upgraded our credit rating in December and that just demonstrates our strong financial profile. Indicated on the slide, we've distributed almost $4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share purchases since the payout framework was implemented in the second half of 2021, and we have an attractive future long term portfolio that will enable us to continue to build value, long term value for shareholders. The global team, as we go forward, is really highly focused on our strategy of being foremost in copper. And we're driven to continue pursuing long term value in the business and executing our plans responsibly, safely and efficiently. And I want to thank everybody for their attention, and we'll now take your questions. I think it is somewhat of a new normal for the cost of a concentrator and related mining infrastructure. When you're dividing on the cost per ton, you're looking at how many pounds of copper are going to come out of that concentrator. And our US mines are characterized by relatively low ore grades, and Bagdad has relatively low copper ore grades but also has molybdenum kicker. So molybdenum would add something like 10 million pounds of molybdenum with an expansion. So that will be another benefit. But really, what we need to do is focus on -- it does bring down our overall cost per pound. So that's a big plus for us. When you look at an investment in the US, it may be to develop a relatively low grade mine. But something important to point out is that we don't have the tax burden in the US that you have in the international location. So I think our projects in the US, while they're low grade, when you cut through all the economics and you look at the ability for us to execute the projects and look at the risk associated with them are different than looking at a project in a different location. So there's some pluses or minuses that go into the bottom line. But we started this work on Bagdad some time ago and we've updated all of the capital costs in line with where current capital costs are. And so I think a reality of the market is that the incentive price to develop new copper, even if it's brownfield, is much higher than it has been in the past. And that's another reason why we believe that the markets that they need these copper units are going to have to adjust to the incentive prices required to get these projects going because we don't want to front run the market. We want to be prepared, we want to be -- have options to go forward as soon as we can. But we don't want to be in a position where we're investing in making major capital commitments before the market prices are telling us already. In terms of the first quarter, we do have some gold that was not shipped in the fourth quarter that will be shipped in the first quarter. And so the relative gold-to-copper ratio impacts the first quarter and makes that less than what we expect the average to be for the full year. I don't know what -- Carlos, what you had in there for export duties, but we're assuming in Indonesia that those are continuing. We are continuing to discuss with the government of Indonesia the applicability of those duties. And I think the more that we make progress on the smelter the better our case there is. But that's something we factored into the estimate but we are continuing to have that discussion. So if we are successful in reducing those duties that would be a benefit. Our export -- it only applies to export volumes. And so as we go through the year, the exports will decline because we'll be ramping up the smelter. So our goal for 2024 is to get the full ramp up completed. And so that's not something that will continue long term the duties once we get the smelter up and running. But it will start to decline over the course of the second half as we ramp up and we produce more domestically. Well, we hope it's not the new normal, Chris. We're working hard. I mean one of the things that you've got to take into account here is we are in a low grade period in the US. I think the grades that we had in 2023 were the lowest that they had been in probably 10 years or so or more. So we are in a period and that's continued in '24 where we do have some low grades that we're going through. But that is why it's so important for us to bring on units with a lower incremental cost and the leach opportunity will help us there. And as we are able to get those pounds put into reserves longer term, not just what you're mining that year or getting that year but multiyear reserve additions for the leach that spreads the cost -- all the costs over more reserves. And so it does help us with driving the economies of scale and why it's so important. We're not in a position now to say where costs could go. There's been a number of other factors that have -- inflation factors and things like the cost of basic parts and materials and supplies has gone up from where it was just two or three years ago, but we are very focused on it. And all of these self help things for us have very high rates of return. There's not a lot of capital involved. It's focused resources. It's not an easy thing because it would have been done already, but it is an area we think we can make improvements. We can also focus, which we're doing now on the last couple of years, we've had to rely more on contractors because of the staffing issues. But as we get staffing set up and get more experience in the workforce, we can reduce our reliance on contractors, as you probably know, have gotten expensive, and Arizona is a very competitive market. So we're working on all those things within the things that we have within our control and are really going to be focused on trying to drive the cost down. We're also looking at Morenci specifically at different configurations. We're looking at whether it makes sense for us to be operating all of our equipment like we are today and looking at if we cut back some things would that be the cost and benefits to that because that could have volume impacts as well. But is that a better setup, a more efficient setup that will allow us to drive costs lower. So we've got some of those initiatives that are being reviewed right now on what the right setup is given how costs have risen. On the first part of the question, our current export license in Indonesia goes to May of 2024. And we are continually having discussions with the government of Indonesia about the fact that while we will be substantially complete on construction activities by the end of May, which is -- was really important target for us and for them that just the ordinary course of a smelter start-up, it takes five or six months to get through. And so we're having those discussions, they understand the situation. And they're encouraging us to continue to meet our targets and that those discussions will continue [Technical Difficulty] that the alignment that we have with the 51% ownership of the state-owned company mined ID in PT-FI's operations is really important here. That, combined with tax revenues, et cetera, that the government gets from having consistent operations at PT-FI is we're both aligned in that to have exports continue. So the conversations have been constructive to date but we've got to continue to progress it. And have those -- continuing to have the discussions with the government and we're doing that on a regular basis. On the second question with respect to capital expenditures. We always go through a process of looking for opportunities to push out capital if it's not required in the current year. And we went through a process between the last update on this one to really look hard at what we could efficiently spend this year and cut back on some things. Some of that's showing up in 2025. We'll do the same thing again because really what we want to do is deploy the capital as efficiently as we can and make sure we're sustaining the reliability of our operations, but also looking at -- we don't want to be doing too many things at one time. And so we always take a hard look at it. So we'll continue to do that as we go forward and manage the capital very carefully. But there wasn't really one big thing, there was a number of things that we did in looking at the prior estimate for 2024. On the first part of the question, with respect to how we evaluate projects and returns, we don't target one number. We look at what the specific project is, what the execution risk is, where it's located. And we run a range of commodity price assumptions around it to look at. What we're really focused on in deploying capital is investing and putting our infrastructure and investments in places where we can execute the plan and in places where we've got long term reserves, because anybody that tells you they can get the copper price right is wrong because it's going to move up and down. And so what we want to have is a situation where we've got a very long life reserve where you can make that capital investment upfront and realize cash flows over a long period of time and not have to get the price forecast for copper perfect in the first year or two. And so when we look at returns, we're looking at those projects that have leverage to future copper. And we look at something outside of the US, we may apply higher risk factors and we look to get higher rates of return than what we would want to have in something like the US where for reasons that Richard talked about, have somewhat of a lower risk profile for us. But it is not one scientific number it's a range of scenarios that we run around a project. And again, looking at the resource and the size of the investment and our ability to generate returns over a long period of time that would be consistent, not that it would go away -- it would fall off, something that could be earned over a long period of time, has a long tail, which a lot of our projects do. And Richard might have some perspectives on the second question. I think it's obvious that there haven't been new projects sanctioned in our industry for some time. And what's happened recently in recent years with the copper prices rallying and then falling off has just caused more delays, more cautiousness by developers in developing the project. So I would say, in my opinion, the situation has become more significant because the projects are taking longer, not shorter. And we talked about when we started on Grasberg Underground, we started planning -- started investing 20 years ago in it. I mean you really have -- these are long lead time projects and we really need to have started investments. And that's why we're really focused on what can we do, continue to plan for these long term projects. So what else can we do and what can we do to take advantage of technology that's available to us and what can we do to get more out of the resources we already have, but not everybody has that ability. And Richard, I don't know if you want to add any comments to that second part. Brian, if somebody else has the same situation, greenfield and the grades we have, it would be a lot more, a lot more expensive. We're prioritizing the leach initiative. I mean that is one that's a no-brainer for us. It's very, very little capital that we're investing in it and very low increment -- it's our lowest incremental operating cost of anything in the US. And so that's a no-brainer. We're pursuing that regardless, that makes a ton of sense and we're pursuing that regardless. We think the world is going to need something beyond that, obviously. And so on the Bagdad thing, we just want to get it, get it to where -- continue to enhance the optionality in it, and we need to do some things anyway. We're doing some infrastructure on tailings that we would need to do anyway in the future, maybe not as quickly as what we would need with the new project, but we need to do those anyway. So we're going to do those to the extent we can do that efficiently. We want this autonomous thing that we're pursuing. Years ago, people thought you didn't really need autonomous in the US. But now, particularly in these remote locations, you really, really do when you consider the cost of the workforce and the housing limitations and that sort of thing and the opportunities to upscale our employees, we think it checks all of those boxes. So autonomous, we want that to see how that unfolds. So we don't have to pull the trigger on Bagdad now but we want to put it in a position where it can go forward. It makes sense if the world needs more copper to get copper from where we already have it. And so it does -- it's a good project, it's not a barn burner from an economic standpoint, right now. But it will have its day and I think it will get time at some point, it just we aren't predicting exactly when. Yes, that's better. With respect to [Multiple Speakers] I was going to say Mark Johnson is on the line, he can add to it if you want. But with respect to December, it highlights, we got that SAG mill completed, the new SAG mill completed in December So really, that gave us the ability to put more ore throughput through the concentrators. And with the combination of higher grades and strong recoveries, we had a great month. Now we have the ability to continue to have strong performance. We achieved a lot of records in December but we do have the ability and some upside to continue that. That SAG mill was originally put in the plan because over time, we'll need the additional grinding capacity, et cetera, to take the ore that will be coming. But right now while we're in these higher grade sections, the more we can put through the mills the better the copper production will be. In terms of the $240 million, right now, we don't have $240 million in our plans. But over time, with the addition of Kucing Liar we'll have that capacity to do it. But having SAG 3 does give us some more opportunities in the near term to -- if we continue to have high rates of ore produced from the underground will give us some upside. A mine, we don't talk a lot about but one that we're going to try to keep improving on is the [Gossan] mine, it's a relatively small mine, but very, very high grade. And we've got some plans to bring in some additional, and that's reflected in the five year guidance, but some additional throughput from [Gossan] that will add copper production and gold production. And Mark, I don't know if you want to add into any of those comments. On the time frame for the incremental 200 million, we have not given a specific time frame. We do feel we can get it done within a couple of years and we'll add whatever we can in the interim. This leach everywhere initiative that we have where we are accessing parts of stockpiles that hadn't been accessed before, getting access to some of the side slopes and some of the areas around the stockpile that we just didn't leach before, that's been a big driver of success and will continue to be. The other one that we're excited about is the targeted drilling. And through our data, we can see where you have situations where the solution that needs to get to the ore has been blocked for some reason over history, and this targeted drilling allows us to get access to it. We are testing this year some abilities to do that more at scale. And that is something that we're really interested to see how that develops and whether that will give us some additional incremental production. We haven't factored that into our plans at this point but we're going to continue to use these covers. We still don't have everything -- the stockpiles are so massive, covering -- spanning particularly Morenci, just miles of area. And so we're still doing the covers. We're still looking for other opportunities to get heat into the stockpiles. We're targeting some pyrite ores in some of our operations that have pyrite in the ores, that is a source of heat as well. But there are a number of things that we're working on that are not the big R&D effort, but things that we can do from an operational standpoint. But well stay tuned, we will -- this is a big initiative and stay tuned will, as we go forward, love to give you a little bit more as we go through 2024 in terms of the time frame. We haven't spent much capital on this initiative. We've already got the infrastructure -- basic infrastructure, the tank house capacity, this is copper that goes to a tank house, not a smelter. And we have already excess latent tank house capacity. We've spent some money but it doesn't round to anything really big. The operating cost, the incremental operating costs of this have been very low on the order of $1 per pound. And so it's just a really, really exciting opportunity for us to generate value. And so as we go forward, we don't see huge amounts of capital either that will come into play. When you get to this piece that's R&D, that's where we need to make sure that all these things can be applied and deployed at scale and can be economic but that thing is ongoing. But the first 400 million pounds we think that we can do that without spending a lot of capital. On the dividend question, our Board reviews the financial policy on a regular basis. And we put in place the base dividend, the variable dividend and we've been paying at that level for some time now. We'll continue to review that with the Board. You can see from our results the financial results that we're projecting for 2024 look very good. But we always going to look at what's going on in the market and don't want to put ourselves in a position of running up debt, but we have a good balance sheet. So I don't want to front run anything. The Board will look at this on a regular basis but our financial position is in really excellent shape. The second question on TCRCs, we reach agreement, as you know, on long term TCRCs that are done on fixed contracts once a year. And since then, spot rates have come a lot, lot lower given the tightness in supply. We do sell some things on a spot basis but most of it is sold under these fixed contracts where we have the TCRCs fixed. The other thing is once we get the smelter in Indonesia up and running, we don't have -- we still have with Cerro Verde concentrate that we sell. But everything from Indonesia will be really just processed through our own smelters. We appreciate it, everyone. If there are any follow-ups, feel free to call David and we're available to continue to discuss, and we'll report to you our progress throughout the year."

            "name": "Richard Adkerson",
            "content": "Okay. Good morning, everyone. As you can see, our first quarter was really a sound quarter and outstanding in several respects in terms of our operations. It was really led by PT-FI during the whole year of 2023. We began our ramp up in 2019 of the underground and now we are fully operationally, and the team has been setting records consistently out there and have just outperformed for the full year and faced some really challenges, which is just part of that business. But I'm very proud of our PT-FI team at job site in Jakarta. We are making great progress and fulfilling our 2018 commitment to the government to invest in downstreaming and the copper concentrate business. In December, I was there for the inauguration of the expansion of the older smelter, PT Smelting with President Joko Widodo and that was a good event. And then with our new smelter at Manyar in Eastern Java, we reached an important 90% milestone at the end of the year and we're progressing for physical completion of the smelter and ramping it up on schedule in 2024. A couple of words about the markets. It continues to be the micro versus macro story. Notably, in 2023, the macro factors strengthened notably. 2023 had long been forecasted to be a year of surplus because of new mines coming on stream, but it ended up being a small deficit. And at the same time, there was stronger than expected demand for copper in the United States and in China despite all the issues with China's property business other sectors created a notable growth for copper in China. Then there were the supply shortfalls throughout the industry for some significant mines and these for range of factors that are kind of common to our business. The copper business, mining business is a tough business, but it was political issues in some countries, community issues and then operating issues. As a result of all that, inventories of copper around the world are at historically low levels and the inventory levels are really inconsistent with the current copper price. The copper price clearly being driven by macroeconomic factors. The currency, the strong US dollar, carryover effects of inflations, government fiscal policies, and there are concerns about economies in China and Europe. But if the macro outlook -- and I'll just say when the macro outlook improves, watch out for the copper price. Looking ahead, the world's going to need significantly more copper in the future for a variety of factors. The world's just becoming increasingly electrified and that's what copper is used for. And it's at a time when the industry is simply not investing to grow production that the outlook indicates that will be required for economic, operational and resource nationalism, a series of factors, but the facts are there's an outlook for strong demand and supply challenges. That's why I'm so personally confident about where Freeport is positioned and pleased with it. We have high volume existing production that's sustainable. We have large sustainable reserves and resources. We have growth opportunities that we will pursue prudently from this really exciting leaching initiative that Kathleen will be talking about and from brownfield expansions of our existing orebodies. Before turning over to Kathleen, I just want to send a note of condolences to our friends at Rio Tinto. You may have seen the news, but they had a plane to go down in Canada heading to their diamond operations there. Rio has been a special part of Freeport's history. Of course, they were our partners for many years at Grasberg. I have worked with six, seven, eight CEOs over my career. Some of my closest colleagues have been with that company. And the toughest part of being a CEO is to lose people and I'm just so sad to hear this news and the whole Freeport family's heart goes out to our friends at Rio.  With that Kathleen, I will turn over to you. Alex, let me just add very briefly that Kathleen makes a really good point about these relative economics. No royalties in the US. US tax rate is much lower -- federal tax rates much lower than outside the US. We have a net operating loss carryforward. Community support is strong in the US and we have no minority interest there. So looking at global benchmarks needs to be adjusted for the site specific factors that we have in the US, and they're very positive. Well, we're constantly monitoring the market and you can be confident that opportunities are available are presented to us and we consider them. The facts are we haven't found those attractive today. We have such great opportunities to create value totally for our shareholders by focusing on internal growth through the leach project, through the brownfield developments in the Americas, through the Kucing Liar project in Indonesia and now with expectation that we'll go beyond 2041, we're going to do additional exploration there to understand what the opportunities are. Success in any of those opportunities creates value where there's no value in our current share price. So it's all for the best of our shareholders and that makes it much more difficult for external opportunities to compete with them. And my experience has shown that small mines get smaller and big mines get bigger. So we really are, as I said in my opening comments, pleased about where Freeport is positioned for what we believe is going to be a great future for our company. And Kathleen, just let me add. They're not negotiations over this issue. The mine -- I mean I've spoken in recent months on at least three occasions directly with the President about it. He understands it, the Mines Minister who has the business background clearly understands it. It's just administrative procedurally they concluded not to grant that export rights beyond this date to see if we complete the smelter as we've committed to do it. But beyond that, it will be just be an administrative action to get it approved. Well, I'll add a brief comment to the first part too, Kathleen. My early experience in my career was in the oil and gas industry. And early on, Dan [indiscernible] and I wrote a paper on oil price forecasting, which basically evidenced how wrong forecasts can be. And so we approach, as Kathleen described, all of our investment and business planning on a scenario basis, not trying to predict a particular price or range of price but to look at what impact investment decisions and operating decisions have on our overall portfolio. And we look to protect ourselves on a portfolio basis from downside risk and then structure investments to take advantage of what we have is confidence in the long term price. So it's not any kind of formal rate of return kind of criteria that you see in a lot of industries, which work elsewhere, and have the saying that figures don't lie but liars figure. And so we just really base these things, as I said, on scenario planning and portfolio impacts. The basic thesis, I believe, for the demand for copper is unchanged and continues to be supported. From the very start my work with ICMM where I was Chairman, two occasions, but more recently when all the issues about aspirational goals for carbon reductions were being considered in such promise. I've always said that there are a lot of unanswered questions and the movement towards these aspirational goals will not be consistent, but they'll have issues, complications and so forth and that's certainly what we're seeing. The future of copper is really influenced significantly by investments in carbon reduction and I think it's something the world absolutely has to do. And there are other factors related to global growth, connectivity, these data centers, some of that's being driven by artificial intelligence. Just everywhere you turn, the world is getting more electrified. And that's why I think the fundamental long term demand thesis for copper is just getting stronger and stronger. A lot more. And your $4 is absolutely right. I mean you just look at recent projects and look at how costs escalate and then what would have taken from an incentive price to justify that project from the outset if the cost numbers have been known. So this is not that complicated. So it's not a greenfield project. We've operated there for 80 years or so. And it's about a straightforward project as you could have, but it's telling for the industry even with this kind of straightforward project the challenge you face. It's cost, it's tailings and we do benefit from infrastructure. This is just a mill expansion. It's not building a new mine. But then there's a challenge of getting workers and housing for workers. So all of this is real telling on the supply side -- I just talked about the demand side support for copper. So this is a great example of a simple project in terms of the relative complexities of projects in our industry, this is relatively simple. And yet, it faces these challenges of being economically justified in today's price. At the outset, I said today's copper price is not a price that's adequate to stimulate the kind of investments that are going to be needed for this industry. And that's why we're optimistic about future prices. And Brian, we got a strong enough financial position that we can -- capital is not a barrier for us to do in projects that make sense. Alan, you're breaking up on us. And you may have noted this, Kathleen, but importantly, there's no permitting issues. And that is a real challenge for any kind of project you do in terms of brownfield expansions and really tougher greenfield expansion. So here, no capital or operating costs, no permitting delays. And our contracts are long term in terms of volumes, but the TCRCs are renegotiated each year. And you raised a great point for those of you who haven't followed it, but the situation right now with smelters where they can't get concentrate to process is a real strong indicator of where this market is and where it's going. Yes. Thank you for joining us today, and everyone, have a great day."

That allows us to get GBC up from like 120,000 up to 140,000 tons a day in 2026. And at that point, we'll be able to run close to 240,000 tons through the mill. The mine and mill will be matched. And then as you said, the KL come up and then GBC and KL share portions of the ore flow system. But over the short term, we sequenced that part of the KL ore flow that gives us the opportunity at GBC in the much shorter term."

Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, President. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nKathleen Quirk: Thank you and good morning. Welcome to our conference call. Earlier this morning, FCX reported our third quarter 2023 operating and financial results. And a copy of the press release and slides are available on our website at fcx.com. Our call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call, and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. I'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings. On the call with me today are Richard Adkerson, our Chairman of the Board and CEO; Maree Robertson, our Chief Financial Officer; Mark Johnson, Chief Operating Officer for Indonesia operations; Josh Olmsted, Chief Operating Officer for the Americas, Mike Kendrick, who heads our molybdenum business; Cory Stevens, who leads our technical services and engineering and construction group; and Steve Higgins, our Chief Administrative Officer. We are going to start with Richard. He\u2019ll make some opening comments, and then we\u2019ll be reviewing the slide materials, and then we'll open the call for your questions. Go ahead, Richard.\nRichard Adkerson: Good morning. Yes, good morning. Thanks, Kathleen. As Kathleen said, she's going to review our operations and financial results for the third quarter. Big picture, we had very strong operations performance and this was really notable in face of a number of challenges we faced at different locations around the world. Once again, Team Freeport answered the bell and rang through. Stating the obvious is a complicated geopolitical and macroeconomic world. Freeport family around the world is sad for the poor people in Israel, in Gaza, and in the Ukraine and praying for a resolution to those conflicts. Macroeconomic factors with higher interest rates are negative for the price of copper and Freeport's equity. It goes without saying our business by design, by strategy, is correlated to the price of copper in response to the recent lower copper prices. We are supported by having a strong balance sheet, which we're committed to maintaining, and by having the ability to manage our capital cost and operations to be responsive to the price environment. We remain very confident about the long-term outlook for copper and for our company's equity. The current situation does nothing but bolster the longer-term outlook for copper prices as a commodity and for our future returns to Freeport shareholders. We look forward to answering your questions and I'll turn the call over to Kathleen to review our results.\nKathleen Quirk: Thank you, Richard, and I'm going to start on slide three where we summarize our key operating and financial highlights for the third quarter. We delivered another quarter of strong execution, production results across the portfolio were solid, totaling \u00a31.1 billion of copper and over 500,000 ounces of gold during the quarter. Our copper sales were 8% above our estimates going into the quarter, and despite strong gold production, our third quarter gold shipments were slightly below previous estimates. That reflected timing associated with some administrative approvals in Indonesia, but this is expected to turn and set up for higher gold sales in the fourth quarter. Our unit net cash costs on a consolidated basis averaged $1.73 per pound in the third quarter that was similar to the year ago quarter. The increase compared to our guidance of $1.61 per pound largely reflects the impact of export duties in Indonesia, which we continue to review and discuss with the Indonesian government. With average copper prices of $3.80 per pound in the quarter, we generated EBITDA of $2.2 billion. Our operating cash flows, which were net of $500 million in working capital uses, totaled $1.2 billion, and those exceeded our mining capital expenditures, totaling $800 million, which exclude capital associated with our smelter project, totaling $400 million in the quarter, and that's being funded from proceeds that we raised last year in a financing transaction. We're making steady progress on the smelter projects in Indonesia. The construction project on the new greenfield smelter is 84% complete, and we're on track to begin ramping up during 2024. Richard talked about our balance sheet, our balance sheet, liquidity, financial flexibility remain in great shape, excluding the net debt associated with the smelter projects in Indonesia. We ended the quarter with $800 million in net debt. As we approach the end of 2023, our team remains focused on continuing strong and safe execution of our operating plans. And we expect to have another quarter of strong production results. And we're going to continue to advance several important initiatives to drive long-term value in our business. Moving to the next slide, slide four, we talk about copper markets. And as Richard mentioned, the long-term fundamental outlook for copper remains compelling, characterized by rising demand associated with global investments in electrification and limited supplies. In the short term, copper prices have been impacted by macro sentiment tied to rising interest rates, U.S. dollar strength, and sentiment on the global economy. Copper inventories on exchanges have risen in recent weeks, and that follows a multi-year period of declines. When we look at the overall inventories on the exchanges, they remain low by historical standards and in relation to the growing size of the market. The reality on the ground, when we look at the macro sentiment, we also need to look at the reality on the ground. And the new structural demand drivers for copper are mitigating traditional cyclical uses. In the U.S., several of our customers are reporting growth in power cable and building wire for utilities and data centers and rising demand from the automotive sector. There are pockets of weakness tied to residential housing, but this is being offset in other sectors. China's consumption continues to grow despite the country's weak property sector, supported by massive investments in wind and solar and growth in electric vehicle production. And there are recent signs we're seeing that economic activity is picking up in China. We're also seeing growth in copper consumption in India, which has historically used less copper per capita than other countries. We can't predict short-term macro forces that have heavily influenced the market, but our conviction for the long-term fundamental outlook remains strong. Copper is the metal when it comes to electrification and Freeport's well-positioned as a leader in the global copper industry. When we look at the long-term, we're looking at the next several years where demand is expected to accelerate with third-party projections for demand to double by 2035. At the same time, the ability of the copper industry to meet this rising demand is a major challenge. The recent weakness in price combined with higher capital costs to develop new mines are making it more difficult to justify new project development, which is essential to the future. With this backdrop, we believe the current price is not sustainable and prices will need to rise to incentivize new supplies. At Freeport, we benefit from a large reserve position and an even larger resource position to grow our business in the future. We're going to take a long-term view and also be mindful of the short-term pressures on the market. Moving to the next slide, on slide five, we want to highlight some of the key operational drivers for our business during the quarter. In the U.S., our leach innovation initiative where we're deploying new operating practices to traditional leaching is showing tangible progress. Incremental copper from these incentives totaled 46 million pounds in the third quarter. This is 90% of our initial targeted run rate of 200 million pounds of copper per annum. We see ongoing opportunities for additional scale as we aggressively advance this highly valuable initiative. Additionally, we're continuing to focus on enhancing productivity in our U.S. mining and milling operations. We know there's opportunity here to improve and it's a key focus area for us. At Cerro Verde in Peru, where we operate one of the largest concentrate sites in the world, the mill averaged over 430,000 tons per day during the quarter. That was a new quarterly record. You will recall this is a site that was designed at 360,000 tons per day. Overtime, our team has found ways to improve efficiencies there. We are really proud of the Cerro Verde team. At Grasberg, our mill rates averaged 207,000 tons per day for the quarter, processing high grades of copper and gold ore. The production for the quarter exceeded 400 million pounds of copper and over 500,000 ounces of gold that was in a single quarter, demonstrating the size and scale of this operation. We had several days of the mill throughput in excess of 220,000 tons per day. And a highlight of the quarter was the performance of Grasberg Block Cave. We mined from that ore body over 130,000 tons per day, on average. We installed a new gyratory crusher at the Grasberg Block Cave, which gives us the ability to process more material from that large ore body. And we recently reached new records of over 160,000 tons a day. We're working to complete the new SAG mill at Grasberg. We're expected to complete construction by the end of the year. And that'll give us more opportunities in the future to ramp up our mill rate even further. Turning to slide six, we talk about our growth initiatives. And as we look at this situation where we have growing demand for copper over the next several years, and the limitations and the high capital intensity and risk for greenfield projects, our strategy is really focused on development of extensions of our existing operations and our portfolio of brownfield opportunity. We characterize our growth in near-term, medium-term, and longer-term development options. On the near-term side, the initial target of 200 million pounds per year of copper from our leach initiative has essentially been met. And now we're focusing on sustaining it and scaling it further. On prior calls, we discussed our initiatives to retain more heat in the stockpiles. And those activities are continuing. A big driver of the success in the last several months has been on our Leach Everywhere work, where we're applying solution to areas of the stockpile which have not previously been leached. We're also conducting targeted drilling to inject solution to areas within the stockpile where solution may have been blocked over time. And our data and modeling can now provide information that targets specific areas of opportunity. And we're gearing up to do this more at scale. We now believe we can scale these activities and double the incremental copper to 400 million pounds per annum over time. This is just from applying our operating practices at a larger scale without relying on new technologies. We're also continuing our work on the new technologies front. And that's going to give us the opportunity with success to reach our ultimate goal of 800 million pounds per annum from this initiative over the next three to five years. Remind everybody we have 40 billion pounds of copper in our stockpiles that's already been mined. This is not in our reserves. And it's an opportunity for us to get recovery from this copper that previously was thought to be waste material. This initiative has the best economics of anything in our portfolio given its low capital intensity and low incremental operating costs. And we're pursuing it very aggressively. Our productivities in the U.S., which I mentioned earlier, are focused on rebuilding the experience of our workforce. We've had a large number of new hires in recent years. And we need to rebuild our skills and experience, enhancing our practices to achieve better equipment performance and reliability, and taking advantage of new technologies and automation to restore and improve on productivity metrics that weakened during the pandemic. By increasing our productivity in the U.S., we have the opportunity to add an additional 200 million pounds per year from our existing assets with limited capital investment. We're also continuing our work on a potential expansion of the Baghdad mine in Northwest Arizona. We're completing a feasibility study. And we're taking some steps now to enhance optionality for the future, including making some investments in autonomous haulage in our mining operations at Baghdad. And we're advancing investments in our tailing infrastructure for the future. We are setting up Baghdad expansion project as an option for the future. The timing of it will depend on market conditions. We're looking at the increased capital cost requirements for projects and consider that. We're also looking at the availability of labor. And we'll make all those reviews before finalizing our decision on the timing of this project. But it's a very large resource for us. We've got significant reserves spanning over 80 years there and a good opportunity for expansion in the future at the right time. We also have a major opportunity for expansion at El Abra mine in Chile. This is a very large resource that could support a concentrator on the size of the concentrator we added at Cerro Verde several years ago. We're retesting the economics to update project capital costs in light of the recent capital cost experience of other large projects. And in parallel, we're planning investments in water infrastructure to support the current operation and provide optionality for the future. Again, this is about options for expansion at the right time. And we've got the portfolio with a lot of option value within the Freeport portfolio. Our Kucing Liar development in Grasberg is proceeding on schedule. We expect to commence production by 2030. The huge ore body ramping up to 550 million pounds of copper and 560,000 ounces of gold in the next decade. We're also conducting some additional exploration in the Grasberg district where we have identified some potential below our deep MLZ [Ph] ore body. We're continuing to advance discussions in Indonesia for extension beyond 2041. That would open the door for continuation of large scale mining and potential additional development options in one of the world's largest and highest grade copper and gold mining districts. Longer-term, we're focused on a major opportunity that we have in the U.S. at the Safford Lone Star District. We've identified a significant resource there. And we continue to see the Safford District with the potential to add another cornerstone asset of scale in the U.S. We're in an outstanding position as we look at our large resource and reserve position and the experience of our team to continue our leadership role in supplying copper to a world with growing requirements. We're going to continue to be disciplined in our approach. And we're going to be focused on executing projects so we can create value for shareholders. Slide seven provides our three year outlook for sales volumes. You'll see this is largely unchanged from our prior forecast. We've increased our 2023 copper sales volumes by about 40 million pounds. And that reflects the updated shipping schedules expected in Indonesia. There's no material changes in guidance for 2024 or 2025. We do believe we have some upside to these numbers with continued success in our leach efforts and our work on productivity enhancements in the U.S. We're turning to our regional data on slide eight. We show our projected 2023 volumes and unit net cash costs by region. The Americas, including North America and South America, comprise about 63% of our 2023 copper sales and all of our molybdenum sales. Indonesia represents 37% of our copper sales and all of our gold sales. The Americas volumes are similar to a prior forecast. And our sales estimates from Indonesia have been increased to reflect the shipping schedules that I mentioned earlier. On a consolidated basis, our unit net cash costs for the year are forecast at $1.63 per pound. It's slightly above the prior forecast of $1.55, $0.07 of that relates to export duties, which remain under discussion with the Indonesian government. We've also incorporated some higher costs for energy compared with the prior forecast. And after moderating in the first half of the year, we're seeing energy costs, particularly for diesel fuel, rising. We're continuing to work to enhance productivity to mitigate the cost increases we've experienced since 2022, really across the board for labor, our contract maintenance services, equipment component costs, and a series of input costs that have risen. And we're working hard to try to mitigate those through effective cost management and productivity enhancements. Turning to cash flows on slide nine, we model our results for EBITDA and cash flow for 2024 and 2025 showing a price range of four to five dollar copper. We've got sensitivities on the page so you can use for looking at the changes based on changes in input costs or copper prices. The annual EBITDA would range under these scenarios from nearly ten billion dollars per annum at four dollar copper to fourteen billion dollars at five dollar copper and operating cash flows would range from seven to ten billion dollars under these assumptions. With long live reserves and large scale production, we're well positioned to benefit from future metals intensive growth and that will provide opportunities for organic investments and cash returns under our performance based payout framework. On slide 10, we show our current forecast for capital expenditures for 2023 and 2024. 3.2 billion total for 2023 is similar to our prior estimate and our capital for 2024 is 3.9 billion compared with the prior estimate of 3.8 billion. For 2024, we've added some discretionary capital to commence a new project in Indonesia to transition our energy source from coal to clean air LNG over the next three to four years and we expect to start that project next year. The discretionary projects total a little less than $2 billion over 2023 and 2024. This category reflects the capital investments we're making in new projects that under our financial policy are funded with the 50% of available cash that's not distributed. We've got some details on those projects in the reference materials. Slide 11, we've included some updated pictures of the smelter project in Indonesia. This is a major undertaking. It's being executed very efficiently. We're making steady progress toward completion. For the Greenfield smelter, we're now 84% complete on construction and we expect to begin commissioning the project by the middle of next year and ramping up to full production by the end of the year. We're also nearing completion of an expansion project that we're doing with our partner to expand the existing smelter in Indonesia. We expect construction to be completed by the end of this year in 2023. We're really pleased with the strong execution of our internal project team and our outside contractor to contain costs and meet schedules in a very complex environment for major project development. On slide 12, I just wanted to update you on some climate initiatives. We published an updated climate report during the third quarter, which is available on our website. But I mentioned in Indonesia we're advancing plans to develop, to transition our coal to LNG. We have plans to develop a 265 megawatt gas-fired combined cycle facility and that would replace the coal units that were developed there over 25 years ago. The project has a cost of roughly $1 billion and the economics, as we looked at it, would eliminate the cost to refurbish and expand the existing coal units over time. The incremental economic cost of this project is roughly $400 million. Importantly, the transition would reduce significantly PT-FI's greenhouse gas emissions. And together with other initiatives PT-FI has undertaken, the total reduction would be on the order of 60% compared to the 2018 baseline. It's a very exciting project for us looking forward. We're also very pleased to report that we have a new power purchase agreement in Peru at Cerro Verde that will allow Cerro Verde the benefit of 100% of its power from renewable sources in 2026. And finally, on slide 13, we wanted to reiterate the financial policy priorities centered on a strong balance sheet, cash returns to shareholders, and investments in value-enhancing growth projects. The balance sheet is strong. We've got strong credit metrics, significant flexibility within our debt targets to execute on our projects. At the same time, we've distributed over $3.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share purchases, and we have an attractive future long-term portfolio that will enable us to continue to build long-term value for shareholders. We've got to continue to focus on the current situation, though, and we're going to continue to monitor current market conditions. We'll carefully manage the timing of our projects to ensure our financial flexibility remains strong. Our team is really experienced in navigating challenging conditions while maintaining a focus on pursuing long-term value in the business and executing our plans responsibly, safely, and efficiently. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we appreciate all your attention and interest, and we'll now take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from the line of Alex Hacking with Citi. Please go ahead.\nAlex Hacking: Yes, morning, Richard and Kathleen. I wanted to ask a couple of questions on U.S. operations. Could you maybe discuss the cost performance there? That seems like it's a little bit higher than guidance and how you see that going forward. And then secondly, just on production, just so I understand, production this is about 340 million pounds. Does that include the incremental 46 million pounds from the new leaching? Is that all in the U.S.? And I guess if so, that sort of implies that production without those pounds would be below 300 versus like 370 million last year. So, maybe just some comments around that and how you see the leaching, impacting the production profile there going forward. Thanks.\nKathleen Quirk: Thanks, Alex. I mean, your question is right in terms of the performance in the U.S. of the base business. We're continuing to experience some challenges on productivity. We've got, we've been hiring people. We've got a lot of new people in our workforce. And so we're very focused on improving the productivity in the U.S. We're focused on maintenance. We've had some challenges with premature failures and some maintenance challenges that we're getting caught up on. We've also had a lot of increased costs related to component parts. We've had some increases in the cost of labor, particularly contract labor. You've probably seen all the activity in Arizona outside of copper with a lot of investment in various industries. It's a very competitive market. So the cost rises in North America have been higher than what we've experienced elsewhere. Of course, we've also had the benefit in international locations of the stronger dollar, which offset some of the labor cost impact. So you see that more in the U.S. But you're right that without the leach pounds, the incremental leach pounds that we accomplished year-to-date, we would have had lower production. And what we need to do is really get both of those flywheels going at the same time because the more we place, and we've been missing some of our placements in terms of the mining rates and the placements on the leach piles, the more opportunity we have to get more out of it through these leach initiatives. So it's a big focus of Josh and our whole team to really work on getting productivity up. If you look at grades, we're in a period right now at Morenci where we've got low grades. And the hallmark of Freeport has been to manage costs very well, given the low grades we have. But we've got to work our way through that and get our flywheel moving again to get productivity up. In terms of the leach pounds and the impact on cost, what really needs to happen with the leach project to really start seeing the impact on unit cost is enough confidence to be able to increase our reserves? And that will allow us to essentially, in the financial results, see lower unit costs as we add reserves and we're spreading costs over a larger number of pounds that economy of scale will start to come through. So the more confidence we get in this, the more we're able to actually put these opportunities into reserves and have enough confidence to do that, that's when you'll start to see the impact on the net unit cash costs. But I don't know if that was a long answer, but did that answer your question?\nAlex Hacking: Yes, that was a great answer, Kathleen. I really appreciate all the color. Thanks so much and good luck with everything.\nKathleen Quirk: Thanks, Alex.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris LaFemina with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nChristopher LaFemina: Hi, Richard. Hi Kathleen. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask about El Abra, which has tremendous potential. You've talked about it for a long time. You could build a big mill project there. With the clarity now around Chilean mining taxes, I would assume that's helpful. And also, I'm not sure if you've looked into the recent double taxation treaty, which I think for U.S. companies makes Chile potentially a more attractive investment. So wondering first kind of how you're thinking about that now and what we can sort of expect if you do progress in this project in terms of timing, capital cost scale, and then maybe as importantly, your partner's ability to help fund whatever you develop there, because I assume it's going to be a capital intensive project. I'm not sure Codelco has the capital to contribute alongside you with this. So how should we think about that? And again, does that double taxation treaty between Chile and the U.S. affect the economics of this project to potentially drive an investment decision? Thank you.\nKathleen Quirk: Thanks, Chris. Both of those items that you mentioned, the recent clarity around taxation in Chile and the issue between the treaty between the U.S. and Chile are both helpful. Quite frankly, if that hadn't been resolved, the latter had not been resolved, that would have posed a big challenge for us in developing the project. But that's been resolved. And so now we're really turning to the economic side of the equation. And we've been watching what's been going on in Chile with other major projects. We did a lot of work on this project, on the El Abra project, and it has good economics, but we want to retest those economics with current capital costs. And that'll be something that we've already started working on, but that's something we really want to get our heads around is, does it make sense? What's the timing given rising capital costs? I mean, you've seen really significant cost blowouts in Chile in recent time. And we want to make sure that we can deploy capital effectively, efficiently in this market. And as Richard was talking about, the copper price today doesn't really support new investment. And so, of significance. And so our focus really has been in this kind of environment on what we can do to be less capital intensive while continuing to advance our options and create optionality in the portfolio. Our plans in Chile currently are to invest in some water infrastructure, desalinization project that would allow us to extend the life of the current operation, and then that would give us optionality for the bigger expansion. And so what we're really doing now is trying to advance these things so we have optionality, but we're not wanting to commit to major, major, multi-billion dollar projects in the current environment. We all see this looming deficit coming, but the current price is just don't support big new investments like this at the current time. We know that will change over time and we want to be prepared at the right time to bring this project on. Permitting takes quite a while and Chile is on trying to streamline permitting. We're encouraged by that. In terms of the Codelco question on financing, they're very positive about the project and they've indicated to us support for it at the right time and we'll figure out financing this at the right time when we go forward. But right now we don't have to make that decision.\nChristopher LaFemina: That is very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nMichael Dudas: Good morning, Richard and Kathleen.\nKathleen Quirk: Good morning, Mike.\nMichael Dudas: I'm going to be following up on some of the other questions. I get the sense that access to labor, contracting, rising interest rates, raising the hurdle rates for capital investment, do you think that this has pushed out whatever expectations of maybe Freeport\u2019s longer-term or medium term investments or the industry's investments given these dynamics, especially the copper price, which as you indicated, I think everybody agrees, wouldn't support this type of investment?\nKathleen Quirk: Richard, do you want to take that one?\nRichard Adkerson: Sure. I think there's no question about it, Mike. As I said, our revenues and those of other copper producers are correlated to prices. As I talk with a lot of people, and I was just at LME last week, I was with a group of senators and congressmen in Washington the night before last. With the new cost structure, people's historical views of copper prices need to be adjusted. I mean, at one point, $3.50 or $4.00 copper price was considered to be a very strong price, but with the effects of inflation, it's not the same. And so you have to look at both of those together. And then the thing that's really striking to us, and you can see this in a number of other projects by companies around the world, is that capital costs inflation is significant and persistent. You can see from our own numbers, particularly when diesel costs dropped earlier, they've ticked up again some. But I thought we had good performance with our operating cost measures. But then when you get into this issue of major projects, the capital costs are really significant. We really are motivated to invest because we have strong conviction about the future of copper prices, but at the same time, history has taught us that it's best to be prudent in the way we commit capital. You might could incrementally improve returns if you were more aggressive near term, but we retain all these projects. We don't lose the opportunity, but we, and I believe others, are going to be prudent until they see how this current situation around the world with China and inflation and central banks activities, and now we've got the increasingly complication of geopolitical events going on. And that's why I made my comment at the outset that this does nothing but bolster the future supply deficit that the industry is facing. So it's a two-edged sword. We'd like to go forward, but we've concluded it's best to be prudent. And with the industry, I believe others will as well, and that just means that supplies are going to be limited for the future, the time when copper demand will be growing.\nMichael Dudas: It sounds like discretion is the better part of valor. Thank you, Richard.\nRichard Adkerson: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Oris Waukadal [Ph] with Scotia Bank. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning.\nKathleen Quirk: Good morning.\nUnidentified Analyst: I'm wondering if you can share any expected timeline for reaching any kind of conclusion in Indonesia with respect to the new export royalty rates and potentially the life extension there beyond 41.\nKathleen Quirk: Well, the issue on the duty, you're talking about the duty, the situation there is that, as you're aware, our IUPK says that we're not subject to duties once the smelter gets over 50%. And the government issued some new regulations earlier this year, and this not just applies to Freeport, but all exporters for copper that are required to have smelters that are required to pay a 7.5% duty. And it's a sliding scale depending on how much progress you've made. We have raised the issue with the government, and they are reviewing the issue. They're also reviewing our progress of the smelter, and we're going to continue to work cooperatively with them. I want to just remind everyone that there's alignment of interest to a large degree there because the Indonesian government state-owned company owns 51% of PT-FI, and also PT-FI pays taxes. So the impact to the government of these export duties is also a significant item. So we've got support from our partner there to help us work through this issue with the government, and we're going to continue to -- I don't have a definitive timeline, but we're continuing to engage in discussions to address this. The extension discussions are also continuing. Our partner, MIND ID, is also very supportive of extending the operation. One of the really significant benefits that we've had in the new structure since 2018 where the government owns 51% is there is a better understanding of the time it takes to develop new resources or extend the resources. And so I think all the parties are aligned in that it makes sense to continue this operation beyond 2041. We made a lot of progress in developing a framework with the government on what the terms of that extension would be. A big catalyst for us is getting the smelter advanced and completed, and that, I think, would be a good catalyst for us to be able to continue to extend those operations out for the life of this resource. But conversations are ongoing. Indonesia is in an election cycle now, and so there are other things going on in the government. The government has a lot of priorities that they're balancing. But in terms of the want to and will of getting this extended to be able to continue the benefits that are very significant to the government of Indonesia and the people of Papua, there is good support for doing this. And we're working very hard to try to get it done as soon as possible, but the timeline is not under our control.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you for the color.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Carlos de Alba with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nCarlos de Alba: Yes, good morning, Kathleen and Richard. So the question I have is really on the discussion on the Indonesian funding, the Indonesian projects funding. Just to revisit, the smelter is now being paid by proceeds from the PT-FI senior notes and the revolving credit line. I just wanted to check if that is something that will continue as it is right now, and what about the funding for the other CapEx projects, KL, and other expansion of the Crusher and the new SAG mill there. Is that going to also be paid by these senior nodes and the internal cash regeneration? Or do you expect your non-controlling partners to contribute cash for those projects? And then maybe associated with this is how should we think about the dividends paid to non-controlling interest going forward?\nKathleen Quirk: With respect to your question on the first topic, the Smelter project is being debt financed. And so we raised $3 billion in financing last year in long-term bond financing at the PT-FI level. So the economics of that, even though it's consolidated on FCX's financial statements, the economics essentially are borne by PT-FI shareholders. And we have a revolving credit facility as well to supplement that. So the Smelter, and that's why we look at it separately, it doesn't impact the cash flow we have at the FCX level that's available for distribution because it's being funded through these proceeds. With respect to other capital projects at PT-FI, those are funded internally at the PT-FI level. So when we look at the projects we're doing to complete the new SAG mill, when we look at the copper cleaner project, all of the capital projects at PT-FI, those are funded with that subsidiary's internally generated cash flows, which is very significant. And so, yes, as you increase capital there, it does reduce the dividends that come out of PT-FI. But these are really good projects that PT-FI has the ability to fund with its cash flows and distribute substantial amounts to its shareholders. In terms of the dividends there, that's really a function of what the performance of the business is. We have a policy, a dividend policy at the PT-FI level where all of the available cash flow is distributed to shareholders and FCX gets 49% of that and MIND ID gets 51%. But that's the policy that we're following and expect to continue to follow.\nCarlos de Alba: All right. Thank you, Kathleen.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Bill Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nBill Peterson: Yes. Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking the question. And nice job on execution given all the challenges out there. My first question is actually a bigger picture question tying to an earlier question. So, if you take into account this broader inflationary environment, increased project financing cost, I guess where does pricing need to be and how sustained does that need to be for Freeport and maybe even industry if you want to comment on that, but specifically for Freeport to support projects such as Baghdad expansion or El-Abra as examples?\nKathleen Quirk: Well, we're updating our capital costs now for El-Abra. Previously when we ran the economics several years ago, it's been a few years ago before the pandemic when we outlined the potential for the project, today's price would have worked fine. It would have been a good return. But there were other factors that led us to put the project on hold. In today's world, we need to retest those economics. I mean, just look at the recent project in Chile of how much that cost increased and it's a huge, multi-billion dollar impact. And that impacts our thinking and that impacts economics. So, we don\u2019t think we know the economics we ran previously don't apply currently. And so, we've been doing some work, we've been doing some additional work on the resource and we've got some positive things that have developed since then that will help the economics, but this capital cost inflation is a real issue and it's something that we need to keep in mind. On the Baghdad project, this is a project that with El-Abra, these are new reserves. So with El-Abra, it would allow us to produce reserves currently in the ground where we don't currently have infrastructure that can produce those reserves. At El-Abra, I mean at Baghdad, it's a different analysis. At Baghdad, we can produce those reserves over 80 years or we can double our processing capacity and produce those reserves over a shorter period of time. And so you have to look at the capital cost and how that interplays with it being an acceleration of production rather than new production. So we're looking, we're completing the feasibility study. The costs we believe are going to come in higher than what we expected them to and so that will have an impact on us. The other thing that will have an impact on our decision will be the availability of labor and whether we can execute that project efficiently. We're doing some things now to create options. We got the autonomous plans to put in autonomous haulage at Baghdad. It's our first mine in the U.S. that will do that and that's exciting for us and that creates options for us in the future. And we're doing some work, some early works to give us options there. But the numbers don't work. I think if you ask people in the industry, what it takes, people are going to tell you it's over $4 to develop new projects. But every project is different and that's why when we look at this leach opportunity, the potential to add 800 million pounds of copper with very low capital costs is very compelling and so we're going to be looking for opportunities in the near term during this uncertainty to expand our production but it's going to be through innovation, automation rather than high capital intensity. And we'll continue to test that and that will continue to evolve but that's the current thinking is that right now the copper price is not enough to support a major investment in a big expansion or a greenfield project.\nBill Peterson: Well understood and thanks for that color. I guess just on the second question on working capital, so how should we think about the cadence of working capital through the balance of the year given exports have now resumed in Indonesia? Are you still expecting a slight use for the year?\nKathleen Quirk: Yes, it's a use but we expect some of that will turn in the fourth quarter. Some of what we had in terms of the inventories and receivables will turn but we are expecting a use for the year.\nBill Peterson: Okay, terrific. Thank you.\nRichard Adkerson: Let me just add one quick. Hang on, let me just add one quick comment to support what Kathleen is saying. People, and I understand it if you're doing overall industry analysis, you're looking for what is the incentive price that triggers new production but Kathleen made the point that each project is different and then each company's situation is different. One of the strong things about our business is that because of our production levels, our resource base, our ability to add to production with things like leaching but beyond that more with being more efficient with technology working our assets harder and so forth. We don't face the same pressures from reinvestment risk that some other companies face but also other commodities face because of shorter reserve lives. And that's one thing I like so much about our business is that it gives us that flexibility to not have to take risks, not have to press things during uncertain economic times but as I mentioned earlier, to be just more prudent about how we run our business. It's a great strength of our industry to a certain degree, but of Freeport as a company, because of our strong production base and long-lived [Ph] properties and the ability to maximize production out of our existing properties by doing things smarter and using technology and working assets harder.\nBill Peterson: Thank you, Richard.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Alex Terentiew with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nAlex Terentiew: Hey, good afternoon or morning, everybody. Just two quick questions for me. First, I just wanted to follow up some of the comments here on Indonesia with the smelter export duty. Any changes, latest changes in the regulations that would change your view on whether you expect the export duty to go to zero once the smelter is built? And then the second question, just circling back on the leach expansion, 800 million pounds over, if you can get there in three to five years, I mean, that's a pretty impressive number. I just wanted to get some more details from you if I could, just on the cost for that. I mean, the U.S. operations have been running around, call it, 270 a pound or so. Is that a fair cost for us as well? Or, I mean, would the operating cost be higher but much lower capital costs? Just trying to get a sense of what the upside is for that sort of potential.\nKathleen Quirk: Yes. On the duty issue, the duties are paid on concentrate exports. So, once we get the smelter done and ramped up, we will have no more exports of concentrates. We'll be, we'll be producing copper cathode and gold, the actual metals. So the export duty only applies to this intermediate, step of concentrates. So, there hasn't been anything in terms of we're still working with the government. Right now, the export license is through May. And so, we've still got to work with the government to work through this issue beyond May of having a ramp up period. We'll still be shipping some concentrates, exporting some concentrates during the ramp up. But we're going to work cooperatively with the government to make sure that those that continuity continues. With respect to the leach pounds, not every application is the same. But on average, we expect these leach pounds to come in at roughly a dollar per pound. And so, that is, that's why we're so excited. Most of this is in our U.S. business. And so, it'll bring down, if we're successful, and we're able to put this into our reserves, it'll bring down our average cost in the U.S. over time. And I'll just ask, Corey Stevens on the line, and he and his team are leading this initiative. And just wanted to ask Corey if there's anything that we didn't cover on leaching that you want to make points of that hasn't been discussed so far.\nCorey Stevens: Yes, Kathleen. I guess the one thing I would just add or maybe just emphasize is some of the, the momentum that's been able to build around this effort, really around these executable known technologies has been significant. And so, we've been building, quarter-over-quarter. And now we've got line of sight to the 200 million. But really, the portfolio gives us sustainability going forward into the future and builds this foundation that, I can see it significantly building from there. And then you've got a whole other portfolio of innovation work, whether it's additives or alternate flow sheets or, really leveraging temperature at that next level that the team is really excited about. So super focused on disciplined execution, that the team is super energized, and looking forward to the future.\nKathleen Quirk: Yes. And so there's a lot of value in this opportunity. And we see it, we can feel it. And we're pressing forward. But as we talked about earlier, we've got to get that going, at the same time we get our productivity, our key performance indicators improved in the U.S. And that's a big focus as well. So those two things we believe will generate a lot of value in our U.S. business and it's not capital intensive. So that's really our primary focus right now is on getting those two things going at the same time. And we've made great progress on the leach front. We're making progress on the productivity initiative front, but we've got more work to do there.\nAlex Terentiew: Yes, those are impressive numbers on the production and the cost front. So best of luck to you and your team.\nKathleen Quirk: Thanks Alex.\nOperator: Your final question will come from the line of Brian MacArthur with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nBrian MacArthur: Good morning, Richard and Kathleen. My question just goes back to the export duty. The 147 million you incurred this quarter, two things, I assume that going retroactive back to March 29th when it technically was scaled down. So you're sort of paying two quarters. And the second thing is the text talks about incurring it. Have you actually paid it on a cash basis or is it just a payable as you kind of sign work through all this?\nKathleen Quirk: It was a go forward duty. So it wasn't based on retroactive. So go forward duty. And 7.5% of the exports values were assessed. Some of it's been paid, some of it's not been paid. And there's a process in Indonesia where just like any other process where you have disputed amounts or amounts that you're objecting to, you can go through a process and pay it, but you pay it with that advisory that it remains disputed. But for financial accounting purposes, given just the uncertainty of how it would all play out, we have accrued those costs. And so we've expensed those as we go. If it gets resolved, that'll get favorably, it'll get reversed. But at this point, we're accruing for these costs pending the ultimate outcome.\nBrian MacArthur: Great, thanks. Just to be clear, because last quarter, yes, I'll follow up with David. Because just last quarter, the export duties were zero on the cost per pound. So that's why I was just trying to figure out exactly how this is working. Yes. I can follow up with David.\nRichard Adkerson: Just remember, Brian, we weren\u2019t exporting for a fairly substantial period of time there. We had this administrative delay for even having any exports. And that's when our inventory built up so much, we were able to sell it down. But we went for, what was it, Kathleen, about six weeks without having any exports. And so the duty is paid when it\u2019s export.\nKathleen Quirk: Yes, the new regulation didn't come out to June, July time frame. And so the second quarter, we didn't have duties. It was this June 10th date that triggered some new regulations. So you're right that we didn't have duties in the second quarter. So the duties that you're seeing in the third quarter relate to the third quarter shipments.\nBrian MacArthur: Great. Thanks very much. That's very clear. And thank you, Richard. That's very helpful as well.\nRichard Adkerson: Thank you.\nOperator: With that, we'll turn the call over to management for any closing remarks.\nKathleen Quirk: Well, thanks everyone for your participation. And we're available if anybody has any questions or comments. And just talk to David. And we'll look forward to continuing to report to you on our progress.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kathleen Quirk",
            "content": "Thank you and good morning. Welcome to our conference call. Earlier this morning, FCX reported our third quarter 2023 operating and financial results. And a copy of the press release and slides are available on our website at fcx.com. Our call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call, and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. I'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings. On the call with me today are Richard Adkerson, our Chairman of the Board and CEO; Maree Robertson, our Chief Financial Officer; Mark Johnson, Chief Operating Officer for Indonesia operations; Josh Olmsted, Chief Operating Officer for the Americas, Mike Kendrick, who heads our molybdenum business; Cory Stevens, who leads our technical services and engineering and construction group; and Steve Higgins, our Chief Administrative Officer. We are going to start with Richard. He'll make some opening comments, and then we'll be reviewing the slide materials, and then we'll open the call for your questions. Go ahead, Richard. Thank you, Richard, and I'm going to start on slide three where we summarize our key operating and financial highlights for the third quarter. We delivered another quarter of strong execution, production results across the portfolio were solid, totaling \u00a31.1 billion of copper and over 500,000 ounces of gold during the quarter. Our copper sales were 8% above our estimates going into the quarter, and despite strong gold production, our third quarter gold shipments were slightly below previous estimates. That reflected timing associated with some administrative approvals in Indonesia, but this is expected to turn and set up for higher gold sales in the fourth quarter. Our unit net cash costs on a consolidated basis averaged $1.73 per pound in the third quarter that was similar to the year ago quarter. The increase compared to our guidance of $1.61 per pound largely reflects the impact of export duties in Indonesia, which we continue to review and discuss with the Indonesian government. With average copper prices of $3.80 per pound in the quarter, we generated EBITDA of $2.2 billion. Our operating cash flows, which were net of $500 million in working capital uses, totaled $1.2 billion, and those exceeded our mining capital expenditures, totaling $800 million, which exclude capital associated with our smelter project, totaling $400 million in the quarter, and that's being funded from proceeds that we raised last year in a financing transaction. We're making steady progress on the smelter projects in Indonesia. The construction project on the new greenfield smelter is 84% complete, and we're on track to begin ramping up during 2024. Richard talked about our balance sheet, our balance sheet, liquidity, financial flexibility remain in great shape, excluding the net debt associated with the smelter projects in Indonesia. We ended the quarter with $800 million in net debt. As we approach the end of 2023, our team remains focused on continuing strong and safe execution of our operating plans. And we expect to have another quarter of strong production results. And we're going to continue to advance several important initiatives to drive long-term value in our business. Moving to the next slide, slide four, we talk about copper markets. And as Richard mentioned, the long-term fundamental outlook for copper remains compelling, characterized by rising demand associated with global investments in electrification and limited supplies. In the short term, copper prices have been impacted by macro sentiment tied to rising interest rates, U.S. dollar strength, and sentiment on the global economy. Copper inventories on exchanges have risen in recent weeks, and that follows a multi-year period of declines. When we look at the overall inventories on the exchanges, they remain low by historical standards and in relation to the growing size of the market. The reality on the ground, when we look at the macro sentiment, we also need to look at the reality on the ground. And the new structural demand drivers for copper are mitigating traditional cyclical uses. In the U.S., several of our customers are reporting growth in power cable and building wire for utilities and data centers and rising demand from the automotive sector. There are pockets of weakness tied to residential housing, but this is being offset in other sectors. China's consumption continues to grow despite the country's weak property sector, supported by massive investments in wind and solar and growth in electric vehicle production. And there are recent signs we're seeing that economic activity is picking up in China. We're also seeing growth in copper consumption in India, which has historically used less copper per capita than other countries. We can't predict short-term macro forces that have heavily influenced the market, but our conviction for the long-term fundamental outlook remains strong. Copper is the metal when it comes to electrification and Freeport's well-positioned as a leader in the global copper industry. When we look at the long-term, we're looking at the next several years where demand is expected to accelerate with third-party projections for demand to double by 2035. At the same time, the ability of the copper industry to meet this rising demand is a major challenge. The recent weakness in price combined with higher capital costs to develop new mines are making it more difficult to justify new project development, which is essential to the future. With this backdrop, we believe the current price is not sustainable and prices will need to rise to incentivize new supplies. At Freeport, we benefit from a large reserve position and an even larger resource position to grow our business in the future. We're going to take a long-term view and also be mindful of the short-term pressures on the market. Moving to the next slide, on slide five, we want to highlight some of the key operational drivers for our business during the quarter. In the U.S., our leach innovation initiative where we're deploying new operating practices to traditional leaching is showing tangible progress. Incremental copper from these incentives totaled 46 million pounds in the third quarter. This is 90% of our initial targeted run rate of 200 million pounds of copper per annum. We see ongoing opportunities for additional scale as we aggressively advance this highly valuable initiative. Additionally, we're continuing to focus on enhancing productivity in our U.S. mining and milling operations. We know there's opportunity here to improve and it's a key focus area for us. At Cerro Verde in Peru, where we operate one of the largest concentrate sites in the world, the mill averaged over 430,000 tons per day during the quarter. That was a new quarterly record. You will recall this is a site that was designed at 360,000 tons per day. Overtime, our team has found ways to improve efficiencies there. We are really proud of the Cerro Verde team. At Grasberg, our mill rates averaged 207,000 tons per day for the quarter, processing high grades of copper and gold ore. The production for the quarter exceeded 400 million pounds of copper and over 500,000 ounces of gold that was in a single quarter, demonstrating the size and scale of this operation. We had several days of the mill throughput in excess of 220,000 tons per day. And a highlight of the quarter was the performance of Grasberg Block Cave. We mined from that ore body over 130,000 tons per day, on average. We installed a new gyratory crusher at the Grasberg Block Cave, which gives us the ability to process more material from that large ore body. And we recently reached new records of over 160,000 tons a day. We're working to complete the new SAG mill at Grasberg. We're expected to complete construction by the end of the year. And that'll give us more opportunities in the future to ramp up our mill rate even further. Turning to slide six, we talk about our growth initiatives. And as we look at this situation where we have growing demand for copper over the next several years, and the limitations and the high capital intensity and risk for greenfield projects, our strategy is really focused on development of extensions of our existing operations and our portfolio of brownfield opportunity. We characterize our growth in near-term, medium-term, and longer-term development options. On the near-term side, the initial target of 200 million pounds per year of copper from our leach initiative has essentially been met. And now we're focusing on sustaining it and scaling it further. On prior calls, we discussed our initiatives to retain more heat in the stockpiles. And those activities are continuing. A big driver of the success in the last several months has been on our Leach Everywhere work, where we're applying solution to areas of the stockpile which have not previously been leached. We're also conducting targeted drilling to inject solution to areas within the stockpile where solution may have been blocked over time. And our data and modeling can now provide information that targets specific areas of opportunity. And we're gearing up to do this more at scale. We now believe we can scale these activities and double the incremental copper to 400 million pounds per annum over time. This is just from applying our operating practices at a larger scale without relying on new technologies. We're also continuing our work on the new technologies front. And that's going to give us the opportunity with success to reach our ultimate goal of 800 million pounds per annum from this initiative over the next three to five years. Remind everybody we have 40 billion pounds of copper in our stockpiles that's already been mined. This is not in our reserves. And it's an opportunity for us to get recovery from this copper that previously was thought to be waste material. This initiative has the best economics of anything in our portfolio given its low capital intensity and low incremental operating costs. And we're pursuing it very aggressively. Our productivities in the U.S., which I mentioned earlier, are focused on rebuilding the experience of our workforce. We've had a large number of new hires in recent years. And we need to rebuild our skills and experience, enhancing our practices to achieve better equipment performance and reliability, and taking advantage of new technologies and automation to restore and improve on productivity metrics that weakened during the pandemic. By increasing our productivity in the U.S., we have the opportunity to add an additional 200 million pounds per year from our existing assets with limited capital investment. We're also continuing our work on a potential expansion of the Baghdad mine in Northwest Arizona. We're completing a feasibility study. And we're taking some steps now to enhance optionality for the future, including making some investments in autonomous haulage in our mining operations at Baghdad. And we're advancing investments in our tailing infrastructure for the future. We are setting up Baghdad expansion project as an option for the future. The timing of it will depend on market conditions. We're looking at the increased capital cost requirements for projects and consider that. We're also looking at the availability of labor. And we'll make all those reviews before finalizing our decision on the timing of this project. But it's a very large resource for us. We've got significant reserves spanning over 80 years there and a good opportunity for expansion in the future at the right time. We also have a major opportunity for expansion at El Abra mine in Chile. This is a very large resource that could support a concentrator on the size of the concentrator we added at Cerro Verde several years ago. We're retesting the economics to update project capital costs in light of the recent capital cost experience of other large projects. And in parallel, we're planning investments in water infrastructure to support the current operation and provide optionality for the future. Again, this is about options for expansion at the right time. And we've got the portfolio with a lot of option value within the Freeport portfolio. Our Kucing Liar development in Grasberg is proceeding on schedule. We expect to commence production by 2030. The huge ore body ramping up to 550 million pounds of copper and 560,000 ounces of gold in the next decade. We're also conducting some additional exploration in the Grasberg district where we have identified some potential below our deep MLZ [Ph] ore body. We're continuing to advance discussions in Indonesia for extension beyond 2041. That would open the door for continuation of large scale mining and potential additional development options in one of the world's largest and highest grade copper and gold mining districts. Longer-term, we're focused on a major opportunity that we have in the U.S. at the Safford Lone Star District. We've identified a significant resource there. And we continue to see the Safford District with the potential to add another cornerstone asset of scale in the U.S. We're in an outstanding position as we look at our large resource and reserve position and the experience of our team to continue our leadership role in supplying copper to a world with growing requirements. We're going to continue to be disciplined in our approach. And we're going to be focused on executing projects so we can create value for shareholders. Slide seven provides our three year outlook for sales volumes. You'll see this is largely unchanged from our prior forecast. We've increased our 2023 copper sales volumes by about 40 million pounds. And that reflects the updated shipping schedules expected in Indonesia. There's no material changes in guidance for 2024 or 2025. We do believe we have some upside to these numbers with continued success in our leach efforts and our work on productivity enhancements in the U.S. We're turning to our regional data on slide eight. We show our projected 2023 volumes and unit net cash costs by region. The Americas, including North America and South America, comprise about 63% of our 2023 copper sales and all of our molybdenum sales. Indonesia represents 37% of our copper sales and all of our gold sales. The Americas volumes are similar to a prior forecast. And our sales estimates from Indonesia have been increased to reflect the shipping schedules that I mentioned earlier. On a consolidated basis, our unit net cash costs for the year are forecast at $1.63 per pound. It's slightly above the prior forecast of $1.55, $0.07 of that relates to export duties, which remain under discussion with the Indonesian government. We've also incorporated some higher costs for energy compared with the prior forecast. And after moderating in the first half of the year, we're seeing energy costs, particularly for diesel fuel, rising. We're continuing to work to enhance productivity to mitigate the cost increases we've experienced since 2022, really across the board for labor, our contract maintenance services, equipment component costs, and a series of input costs that have risen. And we're working hard to try to mitigate those through effective cost management and productivity enhancements. Turning to cash flows on slide nine, we model our results for EBITDA and cash flow for 2024 and 2025 showing a price range of four to five dollar copper. We've got sensitivities on the page so you can use for looking at the changes based on changes in input costs or copper prices. The annual EBITDA would range under these scenarios from nearly ten billion dollars per annum at four dollar copper to fourteen billion dollars at five dollar copper and operating cash flows would range from seven to ten billion dollars under these assumptions. With long live reserves and large scale production, we're well positioned to benefit from future metals intensive growth and that will provide opportunities for organic investments and cash returns under our performance based payout framework. On slide 10, we show our current forecast for capital expenditures for 2023 and 2024. 3.2 billion total for 2023 is similar to our prior estimate and our capital for 2024 is 3.9 billion compared with the prior estimate of 3.8 billion. For 2024, we've added some discretionary capital to commence a new project in Indonesia to transition our energy source from coal to clean air LNG over the next three to four years and we expect to start that project next year. The discretionary projects total a little less than $2 billion over 2023 and 2024. This category reflects the capital investments we're making in new projects that under our financial policy are funded with the 50% of available cash that's not distributed. We've got some details on those projects in the reference materials. Slide 11, we've included some updated pictures of the smelter project in Indonesia. This is a major undertaking. It's being executed very efficiently. We're making steady progress toward completion. For the Greenfield smelter, we're now 84% complete on construction and we expect to begin commissioning the project by the middle of next year and ramping up to full production by the end of the year. We're also nearing completion of an expansion project that we're doing with our partner to expand the existing smelter in Indonesia. We expect construction to be completed by the end of this year in 2023. We're really pleased with the strong execution of our internal project team and our outside contractor to contain costs and meet schedules in a very complex environment for major project development. On slide 12, I just wanted to update you on some climate initiatives. We published an updated climate report during the third quarter, which is available on our website. But I mentioned in Indonesia we're advancing plans to develop, to transition our coal to LNG. We have plans to develop a 265 megawatt gas-fired combined cycle facility and that would replace the coal units that were developed there over 25 years ago. The project has a cost of roughly $1 billion and the economics, as we looked at it, would eliminate the cost to refurbish and expand the existing coal units over time. The incremental economic cost of this project is roughly $400 million. Importantly, the transition would reduce significantly PT-FI's greenhouse gas emissions. And together with other initiatives PT-FI has undertaken, the total reduction would be on the order of 60% compared to the 2018 baseline. It's a very exciting project for us looking forward. We're also very pleased to report that we have a new power purchase agreement in Peru at Cerro Verde that will allow Cerro Verde the benefit of 100% of its power from renewable sources in 2026. And finally, on slide 13, we wanted to reiterate the financial policy priorities centered on a strong balance sheet, cash returns to shareholders, and investments in value-enhancing growth projects. The balance sheet is strong. We've got strong credit metrics, significant flexibility within our debt targets to execute on our projects. At the same time, we've distributed over $3.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share purchases, and we have an attractive future long-term portfolio that will enable us to continue to build long-term value for shareholders. We've got to continue to focus on the current situation, though, and we're going to continue to monitor current market conditions. We'll carefully manage the timing of our projects to ensure our financial flexibility remains strong. Our team is really experienced in navigating challenging conditions while maintaining a focus on pursuing long-term value in the business and executing our plans responsibly, safely, and efficiently. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we appreciate all your attention and interest, and we'll now take your questions. Thanks, Alex. I mean, your question is right in terms of the performance in the U.S. of the base business. We're continuing to experience some challenges on productivity. We've got, we've been hiring people. We've got a lot of new people in our workforce. And so we're very focused on improving the productivity in the U.S. We're focused on maintenance. We've had some challenges with premature failures and some maintenance challenges that we're getting caught up on. We've also had a lot of increased costs related to component parts. We've had some increases in the cost of labor, particularly contract labor. You've probably seen all the activity in Arizona outside of copper with a lot of investment in various industries. It's a very competitive market. So the cost rises in North America have been higher than what we've experienced elsewhere. Of course, we've also had the benefit in international locations of the stronger dollar, which offset some of the labor cost impact. So you see that more in the U.S. But you're right that without the leach pounds, the incremental leach pounds that we accomplished year-to-date, we would have had lower production. And what we need to do is really get both of those flywheels going at the same time because the more we place, and we've been missing some of our placements in terms of the mining rates and the placements on the leach piles, the more opportunity we have to get more out of it through these leach initiatives. So it's a big focus of Josh and our whole team to really work on getting productivity up. If you look at grades, we're in a period right now at Morenci where we've got low grades. And the hallmark of Freeport has been to manage costs very well, given the low grades we have. But we've got to work our way through that and get our flywheel moving again to get productivity up. In terms of the leach pounds and the impact on cost, what really needs to happen with the leach project to really start seeing the impact on unit cost is enough confidence to be able to increase our reserves? And that will allow us to essentially, in the financial results, see lower unit costs as we add reserves and we're spreading costs over a larger number of pounds that economy of scale will start to come through. So the more confidence we get in this, the more we're able to actually put these opportunities into reserves and have enough confidence to do that, that's when you'll start to see the impact on the net unit cash costs. But I don't know if that was a long answer, but did that answer your question? Thanks, Alex. Thanks, Chris. Both of those items that you mentioned, the recent clarity around taxation in Chile and the issue between the treaty between the U.S. and Chile are both helpful. Quite frankly, if that hadn't been resolved, the latter had not been resolved, that would have posed a big challenge for us in developing the project. But that's been resolved. And so now we're really turning to the economic side of the equation. And we've been watching what's been going on in Chile with other major projects. We did a lot of work on this project, on the El Abra project, and it has good economics, but we want to retest those economics with current capital costs. And that'll be something that we've already started working on, but that's something we really want to get our heads around is, does it make sense? What's the timing given rising capital costs? I mean, you've seen really significant cost blowouts in Chile in recent time. And we want to make sure that we can deploy capital effectively, efficiently in this market. And as Richard was talking about, the copper price today doesn't really support new investment. And so, of significance. And so our focus really has been in this kind of environment on what we can do to be less capital intensive while continuing to advance our options and create optionality in the portfolio. Our plans in Chile currently are to invest in some water infrastructure, desalinization project that would allow us to extend the life of the current operation, and then that would give us optionality for the bigger expansion. And so what we're really doing now is trying to advance these things so we have optionality, but we're not wanting to commit to major, major, multi-billion dollar projects in the current environment. We all see this looming deficit coming, but the current price is just don't support big new investments like this at the current time. We know that will change over time and we want to be prepared at the right time to bring this project on. Permitting takes quite a while and Chile is on trying to streamline permitting. We're encouraged by that. In terms of the Codelco question on financing, they're very positive about the project and they've indicated to us support for it at the right time and we'll figure out financing this at the right time when we go forward. But right now we don't have to make that decision. Good morning, Mike. Richard, do you want to take that one? Good morning. Well, the issue on the duty, you're talking about the duty, the situation there is that, as you're aware, our IUPK says that we're not subject to duties once the smelter gets over 50%. And the government issued some new regulations earlier this year, and this not just applies to Freeport, but all exporters for copper that are required to have smelters that are required to pay a 7.5% duty. And it's a sliding scale depending on how much progress you've made. We have raised the issue with the government, and they are reviewing the issue. They're also reviewing our progress of the smelter, and we're going to continue to work cooperatively with them. I want to just remind everyone that there's alignment of interest to a large degree there because the Indonesian government state-owned company owns 51% of PT-FI, and also PT-FI pays taxes. So the impact to the government of these export duties is also a significant item. So we've got support from our partner there to help us work through this issue with the government, and we're going to continue to -- I don't have a definitive timeline, but we're continuing to engage in discussions to address this. The extension discussions are also continuing. Our partner, MIND ID, is also very supportive of extending the operation. One of the really significant benefits that we've had in the new structure since 2018 where the government owns 51% is there is a better understanding of the time it takes to develop new resources or extend the resources. And so I think all the parties are aligned in that it makes sense to continue this operation beyond 2041. We made a lot of progress in developing a framework with the government on what the terms of that extension would be. A big catalyst for us is getting the smelter advanced and completed, and that, I think, would be a good catalyst for us to be able to continue to extend those operations out for the life of this resource. But conversations are ongoing. Indonesia is in an election cycle now, and so there are other things going on in the government. The government has a lot of priorities that they're balancing. But in terms of the want to and will of getting this extended to be able to continue the benefits that are very significant to the government of Indonesia and the people of Papua, there is good support for doing this. And we're working very hard to try to get it done as soon as possible, but the timeline is not under our control. With respect to your question on the first topic, the Smelter project is being debt financed. And so we raised $3 billion in financing last year in long-term bond financing at the PT-FI level. So the economics of that, even though it's consolidated on FCX's financial statements, the economics essentially are borne by PT-FI shareholders. And we have a revolving credit facility as well to supplement that. So the Smelter, and that's why we look at it separately, it doesn't impact the cash flow we have at the FCX level that's available for distribution because it's being funded through these proceeds. With respect to other capital projects at PT-FI, those are funded internally at the PT-FI level. So when we look at the projects we're doing to complete the new SAG mill, when we look at the copper cleaner project, all of the capital projects at PT-FI, those are funded with that subsidiary's internally generated cash flows, which is very significant. And so, yes, as you increase capital there, it does reduce the dividends that come out of PT-FI. But these are really good projects that PT-FI has the ability to fund with its cash flows and distribute substantial amounts to its shareholders. In terms of the dividends there, that's really a function of what the performance of the business is. We have a policy, a dividend policy at the PT-FI level where all of the available cash flow is distributed to shareholders and FCX gets 49% of that and MIND ID gets 51%. But that's the policy that we're following and expect to continue to follow. Well, we're updating our capital costs now for El-Abra. Previously when we ran the economics several years ago, it's been a few years ago before the pandemic when we outlined the potential for the project, today's price would have worked fine. It would have been a good return. But there were other factors that led us to put the project on hold. In today's world, we need to retest those economics. I mean, just look at the recent project in Chile of how much that cost increased and it's a huge, multi-billion dollar impact. And that impacts our thinking and that impacts economics. So, we don't think we know the economics we ran previously don't apply currently. And so, we've been doing some work, we've been doing some additional work on the resource and we've got some positive things that have developed since then that will help the economics, but this capital cost inflation is a real issue and it's something that we need to keep in mind. On the Baghdad project, this is a project that with El-Abra, these are new reserves. So with El-Abra, it would allow us to produce reserves currently in the ground where we don't currently have infrastructure that can produce those reserves. At El-Abra, I mean at Baghdad, it's a different analysis. At Baghdad, we can produce those reserves over 80 years or we can double our processing capacity and produce those reserves over a shorter period of time. And so you have to look at the capital cost and how that interplays with it being an acceleration of production rather than new production. So we're looking, we're completing the feasibility study. The costs we believe are going to come in higher than what we expected them to and so that will have an impact on us. The other thing that will have an impact on our decision will be the availability of labor and whether we can execute that project efficiently. We're doing some things now to create options. We got the autonomous plans to put in autonomous haulage at Baghdad. It's our first mine in the U.S. that will do that and that's exciting for us and that creates options for us in the future. And we're doing some work, some early works to give us options there. But the numbers don't work. I think if you ask people in the industry, what it takes, people are going to tell you it's over $4 to develop new projects. But every project is different and that's why when we look at this leach opportunity, the potential to add 800 million pounds of copper with very low capital costs is very compelling and so we're going to be looking for opportunities in the near term during this uncertainty to expand our production but it's going to be through innovation, automation rather than high capital intensity. And we'll continue to test that and that will continue to evolve but that's the current thinking is that right now the copper price is not enough to support a major investment in a big expansion or a greenfield project. Yes, it's a use but we expect some of that will turn in the fourth quarter. Some of what we had in terms of the inventories and receivables will turn but we are expecting a use for the year. Yes. On the duty issue, the duties are paid on concentrate exports. So, once we get the smelter done and ramped up, we will have no more exports of concentrates. We'll be, we'll be producing copper cathode and gold, the actual metals. So the export duty only applies to this intermediate, step of concentrates. So, there hasn't been anything in terms of we're still working with the government. Right now, the export license is through May. And so, we've still got to work with the government to work through this issue beyond May of having a ramp up period. We'll still be shipping some concentrates, exporting some concentrates during the ramp up. But we're going to work cooperatively with the government to make sure that those that continuity continues. With respect to the leach pounds, not every application is the same. But on average, we expect these leach pounds to come in at roughly a dollar per pound. And so, that is, that's why we're so excited. Most of this is in our U.S. business. And so, it'll bring down, if we're successful, and we're able to put this into our reserves, it'll bring down our average cost in the U.S. over time. And I'll just ask, Corey Stevens on the line, and he and his team are leading this initiative. And just wanted to ask Corey if there's anything that we didn't cover on leaching that you want to make points of that hasn't been discussed so far. Yes. And so there's a lot of value in this opportunity. And we see it, we can feel it. And we're pressing forward. But as we talked about earlier, we've got to get that going, at the same time we get our productivity, our key performance indicators improved in the U.S. And that's a big focus as well. So those two things we believe will generate a lot of value in our U.S. business and it's not capital intensive. So that's really our primary focus right now is on getting those two things going at the same time. And we've made great progress on the leach front. We're making progress on the productivity initiative front, but we've got more work to do there. Thanks Alex. It was a go forward duty. So it wasn't based on retroactive. So go forward duty. And 7.5% of the exports values were assessed. Some of it's been paid, some of it's not been paid. And there's a process in Indonesia where just like any other process where you have disputed amounts or amounts that you're objecting to, you can go through a process and pay it, but you pay it with that advisory that it remains disputed. But for financial accounting purposes, given just the uncertainty of how it would all play out, we have accrued those costs. And so we've expensed those as we go. If it gets resolved, that'll get favorably, it'll get reversed. But at this point, we're accruing for these costs pending the ultimate outcome. Yes, the new regulation didn't come out to June, July time frame. And so the second quarter, we didn't have duties. It was this June 10th date that triggered some new regulations. So you're right that we didn't have duties in the second quarter. So the duties that you're seeing in the third quarter relate to the third quarter shipments. Well, thanks everyone for your participation. And we're available if anybody has any questions or comments. And just talk to David. And we'll look forward to continuing to report to you on our progress."

I guess the one thing I would just add or maybe just emphasize is some of the, the momentum that's been able to build around this effort, really around these executable known technologies has been significant.

But really, the portfolio gives us sustainability going forward into the future and builds this foundation that, I can see it significantly building from there.

            "name": "Richard Adkerson",
            "content": "Good morning. Yes, good morning. Thanks, Kathleen. As Kathleen said, she's going to review our operations and financial results for the third quarter. Big picture, we had very strong operations performance and this was really notable in face of a number of challenges we faced at different locations around the world. Once again, Team Freeport answered the bell and rang through. Stating the obvious is a complicated geopolitical and macroeconomic world. Freeport family around the world is sad for the poor people in Israel, in Gaza, and in the Ukraine and praying for a resolution to those conflicts. Macroeconomic factors with higher interest rates are negative for the price of copper and Freeport's equity. It goes without saying our business by design, by strategy, is correlated to the price of copper in response to the recent lower copper prices. We are supported by having a strong balance sheet, which we're committed to maintaining, and by having the ability to manage our capital cost and operations to be responsive to the price environment. We remain very confident about the long-term outlook for copper and for our company's equity. The current situation does nothing but bolster the longer-term outlook for copper prices as a commodity and for our future returns to Freeport shareholders. We look forward to answering your questions and I'll turn the call over to Kathleen to review our results. Sure. I think there's no question about it, Mike. As I said, our revenues and those of other copper producers are correlated to prices. As I talk with a lot of people, and I was just at LME last week, I was with a group of senators and congressmen in Washington the night before last. With the new cost structure, people's historical views of copper prices need to be adjusted. I mean, at one point, $3.50 or $4.00 copper price was considered to be a very strong price, but with the effects of inflation, it's not the same. And so you have to look at both of those together. And then the thing that's really striking to us, and you can see this in a number of other projects by companies around the world, is that capital costs inflation is significant and persistent. You can see from our own numbers, particularly when diesel costs dropped earlier, they've ticked up again some. But I thought we had good performance with our operating cost measures. But then when you get into this issue of major projects, the capital costs are really significant. We really are motivated to invest because we have strong conviction about the future of copper prices, but at the same time, history has taught us that it's best to be prudent in the way we commit capital. You might could incrementally improve returns if you were more aggressive near term, but we retain all these projects. We don't lose the opportunity, but we, and I believe others, are going to be prudent until they see how this current situation around the world with China and inflation and central banks activities, and now we've got the increasingly complication of geopolitical events going on. And that's why I made my comment at the outset that this does nothing but bolster the future supply deficit that the industry is facing. So it's a two-edged sword. We'd like to go forward, but we've concluded it's best to be prudent. And with the industry, I believe others will as well, and that just means that supplies are going to be limited for the future, the time when copper demand will be growing. Thank you. Let me just add one quick. Hang on, let me just add one quick comment to support what Kathleen is saying. People, and I understand it if you're doing overall industry analysis, you're looking for what is the incentive price that triggers new production but Kathleen made the point that each project is different and then each company's situation is different. One of the strong things about our business is that because of our production levels, our resource base, our ability to add to production with things like leaching but beyond that more with being more efficient with technology working our assets harder and so forth. We don't face the same pressures from reinvestment risk that some other companies face but also other commodities face because of shorter reserve lives. And that's one thing I like so much about our business is that it gives us that flexibility to not have to take risks, not have to press things during uncertain economic times but as I mentioned earlier, to be just more prudent about how we run our business. It's a great strength of our industry to a certain degree, but of Freeport as a company, because of our strong production base and long-lived [Ph] properties and the ability to maximize production out of our existing properties by doing things smarter and using technology and working assets harder. Just remember, Brian, we weren't exporting for a fairly substantial period of time there. We had this administrative delay for even having any exports. And that's when our inventory built up so much, we were able to sell it down. But we went for, what was it, Kathleen, about six weeks without having any exports. And so the duty is paid when it's export. Thank you."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, President. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nKathleen Quirk: Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to our conference call. Earlier this morning, we reported our second quarter 2023 operating and financial results. And a copy of the press release and slides are available on our website at fcx.com. Our call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call, and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. I'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings. On the call with me today are Richard Adkerson, our Chairman of the Board and CEO; Maree Robertson, our Chief Financial Officer; Josh Olmsted, who leads our Americas operations; Mark Johnson, who leads our Indonesian operations; Cory Stevens, who heads up our engineering, construction and technical services group; Mike Kendrick, who leads our molybdenum business; and Steve Higgins, our Chief Administrative Officer. We'll start the call. Richard will make some opening comments, and then I'll go through the prepared materials, our slide materials, and then we'll open the call to take your questions. So I'd like to turn the call over to Richard.\nRichard Adkerson: Thanks, Kathleen, and good morning everybody. Thanks for joining us. The positive second quarter results, at outlook we're reporting today, reflect that our operational performance has been in line with our plans and our prior guidance. Our teams and Freeport's global operations are executing with focus, drive and enthusiasm, all hallmarks of the Freeport culture. Fundamentals in the global copper market remain positive. Despite the frequently expressed concerns about a global economic slowdown and issues in China, electrification is expanding with ongoing advances in alternative energy, electric vehicles, connectivity and supporting infrastructure. Global copper inventories remain remarkably low, and this is notable in the context of the concerns about the global economy in China. The current demand for copper is much stronger than headline economic data. While market experts have significantly varying views about the short-term outlook for the economy and for the price of copper, there's a growing positive consensus on the medium and longer term outlook based on projected demand growing faster than supply development. Freeport is extraordinarily well situated in these circumstances with our large scale currently producing assets, which we're focused on executing the ongoing positive performance and attractive pipeline for future growth from the large scale undeveloped reserves and resources already in our current asset base. Kathleen, we'll now summarize the quarter and our outlook, and then I'll be back along with our team to answer any questions you may have.\nKathleen Quirk: Thank you, Richard, and I'll start on Slide 3, where we summarize our key operating and financial highlights for the second quarter. Production results across the portfolio were strong in the second quarter approaching 1.1 billion pounds of copper and nearly 500,000 ounces of gold. Our copper sales were about 3% below our guidance as a result of administrative delays in obtaining PT-FI's export license approval. We expect that PT-FI will receive approval to resume concentrate exports over the next several days. Our unit net cash costs during the quarter averaged $1.47 per pound, and that was a little better than our guidance of $1.51 per pound. With average copper prices realized of $3.84 per pound in the quarter, we generated strong margins and EBITDA of $2.14 billion. Our operating cash flows totaled $1.7 billion, and that was substantially above our mining capital expenditures, which totaled $700 million roughly, and that excludes the smelter capital of approximately $500 million in the quarter, which is being funded from proceeds that we raised last year. The balance sheet liquidity, financial flexibility remain in great shape. Excluding net debt associated with the smelter, we ended the quarter with under $1 billion of net debt. You'll see that we completed and we conducted some additional open market purchases of our public debt in the quarter at prices below par. As we look forward, we're well positioned for strong results in the second half of the year of \u2013 as second half copper volumes are projected to be over 15% higher than the first half and second half gold sales are projected to be over 25% other than what we sold in the first half of the year. I'm going to move to Slide 4 where we showcase a few of the operational highlights that we are particularly proud of in the second quarter. At Cerro Verde, where we operate one of the largest concentrate sites in the world, the mill averaged 425,000 tons of ore throughput per day during the quarter. This was a site that was designed several years ago at 360,000 tons per day. And over time our team has found ways to improve efficiencies and will continue to do that in the future. At Grasberg mill rates averaged over 200,000 tons per day, it was 207,000 tons per day in the quarter, and that was processing very high grades of both copper and gold ore. That was significantly above the first quarter level and actually the highest average quarterly throughput in over a decade. All this ore is coming from our large scale, modern and efficient underground mines now. Notably, the large scale operation at Grasberg produced copper during the quarter at a net cash credit of $0.09 per pound, and it was just extraordinary performance. We are making steady progress on the smelter in Indonesia. This is an important initiative and we're now at 75% compared with 60% progress three months ago. Our project execution is going well, and our team is very focused on completing the project efficiently. Over the next several months, we expect to complete construction by the second quarter of 2024 and begin commissioning and ramp up over the balance of 2024. We are also happy to report ongoing progress with our leach initiative and that's particularly helping our sites in the U.S. During the second quarter, this effort yielded incremental copper of 29 million pounds, and that was over two times the level in last year's second quarter. We're about 60% of our targeted annual run rate at this level, and we are well on our way to getting to our target of roughly 200 million pounds of copper per year incremental from this initiative. We're going to talk later \u2013 about it later in the presentation, but our confidence is increasing in meeting the initial target and on the significant upside for this highly valuable initiative. Turning to Slide 5, and you've seen a lot of press reports over the last several weeks about the regulatory situation in Indonesia, and we're providing an update on recent regulatory changes in the country. As many of you know, Indonesia is highly focused on downstream resource development that's been evolving over many years, and that reflects the country's national strategic priorities. The evolution of this ultimately led to our agreement in 2018 to expand our domestic smelting and refining capacity in the country. In 2020, Indonesia passed the law restricting exports of certain minerals weren't all defined, but that was beginning in June of 2023. Given our IUPK license and rights, and progress on the smelter, we continue to work with the government to allow time for us to complete our projects, which were delayed by the pandemic. As we mentioned, the projects are well advanced and nearing completion, and we were really honored to host Indonesia's President, Joko Widodo, at our smelter site in June. Beginning in June and July of this year various ministries completed regulatory process to enable ongoing exports of copper concentrates through May of 2024 for exporters with more than 50% smelter progress, and we were over 70%. Last week, the trade ministry enacted legislation to allow the exports and now the administrative process we expect to receive formal approval to resume exports over the next several days. We are going to continue to work with the government to enable exports to continue in 2024 until the new smelter is fully ramped up and operational. The Ministry of Finance also passed regulations last week to increase the duties on exports for various products, including copper concentrates for companies with progress of more than 70% of the duty. The new duty rate is 7.5% for the second half of this year. Under our IUPK, which provides stabilized terms for taxes, royalties, and duties, duties are phased out after 50% progress. And so we're currently reviewing the IUPK provisions with the ministry and our engaged in discussions on this matter. To date, the production impacts on our operations from the shipping delays have been limited, and this has been more of a timing consideration between production and sales. We currently have a sizeable volume of copper concentrate at our port site ready for shipment, and we expect to work down inventories over the next several months. Moving to the copper markets on Slide 6 and Richard touched on this in his comments. Copper is the metal when it comes to electrification. And Freeport is really well positioned as a leader in the global copper industry. The short-term market situation is characterized by, on the one hand, favorable demand drivers from growing intensity in autos, renewables and data centers, and that's partly offset by slowing manufacturing growth. China remains the world's largest consumer of copper and even with the country's current economic challenges and the weakness in the property sector, copper consumption continues to grow and that's been bolstered by large investments in copper-intensive electrical grid and strong growth in electric vehicle production. Richard referenced the inventories, which are very low levels by historical standards, they're now lower than they were at the start of this year, and we see this as evidence of a tightly balanced market. As we look forward over the next several years, demand is expected to accelerate with third-party projections for demand to double by 2035. Investments in low carbon renewable power, electrification will lead to massive growth in demand. And in addition to that, the initiatives by many countries for major infrastructure programs and the uses of copper for connectivity, data, AI, those are also growing demand drivers. At the same time, the ability of the copper industry to meet this rising demand is a major challenge, and we are working very hard to increase our supplies as we look forward. We believe prices will need to rise to incentivize new supplies of copper. At Freeport, we benefit from a large reserve position and even greater resource position to be able to grow our business in the future. As I mentioned, we're really focused on continuing to support the growing demand, producing responsibly and we're pursuing several initiatives to enhance our production going forward. Moving to Slide 7. We provide an update of our three-year outlook for sales volumes. This is largely unchanged from our prior forecast. We've reduced our 2023 copper sales volumes by about 40 million pounds, that's about 1%, to take into account the shipping schedules in the balance of the year. The guidance for 2024 and 2025 is unchanged. And we do \u2013 we are focused on continued success in our leach efforts, which we believe have the potential to provide some upside to these estimates. Moving to the regional information on Slide 8. We show our projected 2023 volumes and unit net cash costs by region. Our business in the Americas, including the U.S. and in South America, comprise about two-thirds of our 2023 copper sales and all of our molybdenum sales, and Indonesia represents about one-third of the copper sales and all of our gold sales. On a consolidated basis from a cost standpoint, our unit net cash cost forecast of $1.55 per pound for the year 2023 is consistent with our prior estimate. We've had some small offsetting changes between the regions. But in total, we're continuing to project cash cost of $1.55 for the year. As we move through the year, we're continuing to experience improving cost trends for several of our commodity-based input costs, and we're seeing more stability in labor, services and equipment component costs. We remain focused on cost management and all of our ongoing initiatives to improve productivity to offset the cost increases that we've experienced in recent years. The estimates that were provided on Slide 8 assume that the export duties in Indonesia are unchanged from our existing duties. As I mentioned previously, the new regulations imposed higher duties than our stabilized rates under the IUPK and we're engaged in the discussions with the government to review this. We provided some sensitivities on potential impacts of the higher duty rates on this page, which you can see at the bottom would have a $0.07 per pound impact on consolidated unit net cash cost for the year, take into account the impact in Indonesia of $0.19 per pound for the year with the duty starting in the second half. On Slide 9, we updated our outlook for our margins and cash flows. And if we put together our projected volumes and cost projections, we show the modeled results for our EBITDA and cash flow at various copper prices ranging from $4 to $5 copper. These results on the slide are modeled using the average of our 2024 and 2025 volume and cost estimates, and we hold gold flat in these scenarios at $1,950 per ounce and molybdenum flat at $20 per pound, both of those commodities are slightly above that today. Annual EBITDA under these assumptions would range from about $11 billion per annum to $15 billion per annum at $5. The $11 billion was at $4, and our operating cash flows before working capital would range from nearly $8 billion per year at $4 copper and $11 billion per year at $5 copper. We\u2019ve got some sensitivities to the various commodities both the sales commodities as well as our input costs. On the right of the chart, we\u2019re well-positioned with our long-lived reserves, large scale production to benefit from future metals intensive growth trends. And we\u2019ve got prospects as we look forward for increasing cash returns under our performance based financial policy payout framework. Return to capital expenditures next, on Slide 10 where we show our current forecast for capital expenditures in 2023 and 2024, these include the capital that we\u2019re investing in the Indonesian smelter project, and those amounts are being funded from a debt offering we did last year, we\u2019ve got cash on the balance sheet and availability to support those investments and the detail of those expenditures are on Page 25 of the slide deck. But all in all on the non-smelter related investments, the \u2013 we\u2019ve had some timing adjustments moving some spending from 2023 to 2024, but the current forecast for the two years is pretty similar to what we had before. It\u2019s about 3% higher for the two-year period, and that that reflects some updated estimates principally for projects at Grasberg. We\u2019ve highlighted here on the slide discretionary projects, and these are the projects that are being funded with the 50% of available cash that\u2019s not distributed. Those totaled $2 billion over 2023 and 2024. And these are value enhancing initiatives that we\u2019ve got some details on 24 \u2013 on Slide 24 in our reference material, but value enhancing initiatives to improve our position as we look forward. We\u2019ll talk on development options and our growth on Slide 11. We\u2019re really focused as we said, on looking at the outlook for growing copper demand and looking at our brownfield strategy given the risk and actionability of greenfield projects, our strategy of developing our resources within our portfolio, we\u2019re focused on expansions of our existing operations and our broad portfolio of brownfield opportunities. We\u2019ve categorized the growth on Slide 11 and in near-term, medium-term and longer-term development operations options, and you can see in the near-term the best options for us, for growth are achieving our initial leach targets and the actions that we have particularly in our U.S. operations to enhance productivity and reliability. By increasing our mining rates in the U.S. through workforce additions, automation, and achieving higher targets for asset efficiency and reliability in our equipment and processing facilities, we believe we have the opportunity to add 200 million pounds of copper a year with very limited capital investment. We\u2019re very focused on the details of the reliability and asset efficiency that we\u2019re pursuing and see that potential as we look forward. We also outlined the potential of our leach opportunity beyond the initial target of 200 million pounds per annum. We talk extensively about this on our last call. We\u2019ve got very large areas under leach. We\u2019ve got new approaches and operating practices that we are deploying on this effort, and the more we work on it, the more optimistic we are about this opportunity is much larger than the initial 200 million pounds. We continue to see the clear opportunity of expanding the initial 200 million pounds of copper per annum to 800 million pounds of \u2013 per annum over the next three years to five years. We\u2019re continuing initiatives to increase heat to our stockpiles. We\u2019re continuing to enhance our ability to identify and deploy solution to areas of the stockpiles, which aren\u2019t getting adequate solution. And we\u2019re continuing our work on additives through internal testing, as well as looking at technology that others have with respect to additives. This is a major value opportunity, a major catalyst for us, and Freeport is one of the best place companies in the industry to capture value from it, and that\u2019s because of our large existing stockpiles with billions of pounds of copper still in them, our technical know-how and the ability of our team to deploy learnings quickly across the portfolio through our operational control of all the mines we have interest in. In addition to the leach opportunity, we\u2019ve got more traditional sources of growth that we are pursuing. We\u2019re continuing to evaluate the expansion of our Bagdad mine in Arizona. We\u2019re completing the feasibility studies on that expansion. We\u2019ve got the major El Abra opportunity in Chile, where we have an existing operation and very large reserves \u2013 resources that support future expansion. And of course, we\u2019re developing making progress with the 90,000 ton per day Kucing Liar block-cave in Indonesia, and that\u2019s expected to commence production by the end of the decade. At Bagdad, we\u2019re making some investments to advance tailings and other infrastructure to enhance our optionality for the project. And we\u2019re doing the same at El Abra looking at some investments and water infrastructure, not only that would support the current operation, but provide optionality for the large mill project in the future. After those two projects, we\u2019ve got an \u2013 big opportunity in our Safford/Lone Star district in eastern Arizona. We\u2019ve got current production there and have identified a significant resource that would allow us to make that district another cornerstone asset for Freeport as we look into the 2030 timeframe. We\u2019ve got a series of U.S. Brownfield projects that were also looking at a big opportunity for us as in Indonesia, where an extension of our operating rights beyond 2041, which were continuing to advance would open the door for long-term large scale mining beyond 2041 and potential reserve expansion and additional development options in one of the world\u2019s largest and highest grade copper and gold mining districts. We\u2019re \u2013 with these projects, we\u2019re in a position to continue our leadership role, supplying copper to a worldwith growing requirements, we\u2019re going to continue to be disciplined in our approach, but focused on executing the projects where we can create value for shareholders. On the last slide, we \u2013 on Slide 12, we reiterate the financial policy priorities. Those are really centered on our strong balance sheet, which we have our cash returns to shareholders and investments in our value enhancing growth projects. The balance sheet is solid. We\u2019ve got very strong credit metrics and flexibility within our debt targets to execute on projects. At the same time, we\u2019ve distributed over $3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share purchases since commencing this performance based policy and have an attractive future long-term portfolio that will allow us to use a portion of our cash flow to build long-term value for shareholders. Richard mentioned the team is energized, motivated, and we\u2019re focused on continuing to drive value in our business in executing these plans responsibly, safely and efficiently. Thanks for your attention, your participation and operator we\u2019ll now open the call for questions.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alex Hacking with Citi. Please go ahead.\nAlex Hacking: Yes. Good morning, Kathleen and Richard.\nKathleen Quirk: Good morning.\nAlex Hacking: Yes, morning. So I guess, I only have one question. I saw a press release this morning about a strike at Cerro Verde, 72 hours. Could you maybe give us some context on that? Thanks.\nRichard Adkerson: Sure. Josh, you\u2019re on the line. Why don\u2019t you respond to that? I was just at Cerro Verde and I got to tell you, I was so proud of what the team\u2019s done down there.\nJosh Olmsted: Yes. Good morning. One other thing \u2013 we really pride ourselves on our open and ongoing conversations with all of our employees and the union. There\u2019s we have two unions at Cerro Verde. And this is one of the original unions, which accounts for roughly 28% of our total workforce. And it\u2019s just been some ongoing conversation that we\u2019ve generated dialogue for \u2013 we have some \u2013 a meeting with the labor department tomorrow to try and continue to foster the conversation and avoid the potential strike there. But we\u2019re in \u2013 we\u2019ll continue to have those dialogues and we\u2019re working through and being as open and transparent as we can with the union to work through and address any of the issues.\nAlex Hacking: Okay, thanks.\nRichard Adkerson: We have a long history in Peru and Cerro Verde of being able to deal. Sometimes we get affected by strikes, not related to our operations and so forth, but our team is prepared for it. And we\u2019re hopeful that this thing gets resolved is not really a major substance issue in my observation on it. And our team will be able to manage our way through it if in fact we have to deal with it.\nAlex Hacking: Okay. Thanks, Josh.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line is Christopher LaFemina with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nChristopher LaFemina: Hi, Richard. Hi, Kathleen. Thanks for taking my question. I actually have quite a few questions about the situation in Indonesia, but limited to just two for now. So the first question is, our understanding at the beginning of July is that the concentrate storage areas were nearly filled and you would likely have to shut down the operations if you did not have an export license imminently. And I\u2019m wondering, first of all, whether you\u2019ve been able to continue to operate at Grasberg or if the mines are shut down for now. And the second question is just related to the export. Sorry, you want to answer that one first?\nRichard Adkerson: Let\u2019s answer your first question. Yeah, let\u2019s go ahead and answer that. One of the complications we had with this is that the domestic smelter at Gresik that PT Smelting owns, which is not affected by any sort of export issues. It was undergoing a maintenance \u2013 a plant maintenance turnaround. So there was limited concentrates we could ship domestically. That has been completed and now we\u2019ve begun returning to shipping to Gresik. We haven\u2019t shut down at all. We\u2019ve \u2013 our team is adjusted to the situation by advancing some plant maintenance activities that we had for the second half of the year. And while the storage facilities were approaching their limits or meeting their limits, we have not had a significant \u2013 we\u2019ve had some impact, but not a significant impact on operations. We anticipate resuming exports very shortly and we have a lot of concentrate that\u2019s been produced that\u2019s on site that\u2019s ready to sell and we\u2019ll be moving that to market.\nChristopher LaFemina: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you for that. The second question is regarding, I think Kathleen said the export license is days away. And obviously as per the IUPK, smelter construction passes 50% it means no more export duties for you. But under this new regulation, there will be an export duty. And I\u2019m wondering if the export license will be granted to you, even if you were disputing having to pay the new hire export duty because you potentially are protected via the IUPK.\nKathleen Quirk: Well, in order to export\u2026\nRichard Adkerson: All indications are and expectations are is that we will be able to export. We\u2019re continuing discussions right now to present our case. And if we can resolve it, that would be the best outcome. If we can\u2019t, we\u2019d begin to exports and then pursue our legal rights separately.\nChristopher LaFemina: Great. Thank you for that.\nRichard Adkerson: Kathleen, you have something to add?\nKathleen Quirk: No. That\u2019s great. Thank you, Richard.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Carlos de Alba with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nCarlos de Alba: Yes. Good morning, Kathleen and Richard. So my first question is on Cerro Verde. You are operating quite well there and the company, if I understand correctly it doesn\u2019t really have a significant debt anymore. So with the cash regeneration there, what are your plans? Do you expect to continue to pay dividends? You already announced I think twice payments in the second quarter. You pay more in the third quarter. You typically in the past did pay in the second and fourth quarters. Should we expect another payment in the fourth quarter? So in 2023. Just overall, what can you tell on Cerro Verde? And I\u2019ll come back with the second question.\nKathleen Quirk: We\u2019re \u2013 I think Carlos you characterized it correctly. We\u2019re essentially distributing cash flow out of Cerro Verde. We\u2019ve done very well on the debt side. And from time to time, we reserve cash for items that we know about, obligations that we need to pay or items that we know about. But we expect to continue to generate cash flow at Cerro Verde. And to the extent we don\u2019t have obligations to pay that out to shareholders. I don\u2019t have \u2013 we don\u2019t have a decision at this point exactly what the cash flow and dividends will be quarter by quarter at this point, but we do expect to continue and distribute cash out of Cerro Verde.\nCarlos de Alba: Thanks, Kathleen. And then the second question is regarding CapEx. Your overall CapEx is not changing much as you already mentioned. But when I looked at the individual projects, I did notice that the PMR in Indonesia as well as the Grasberg mill recovery project increased CapEx 10% \u2013 10% to 20% higher than in the last update. So I wonder if you can provide some comments as to what is driving that.\nKathleen Quirk: Yes. We did have an increase in our precious metals refinery an updated estimate for this precious metals refinery. It is an operation that is relatively small compared to the overall capital. But as we\u2019ve gone through more engineering the cost estimates have increased a little different than the big project, the Manyar project where a lot of things were ordered, a lot of things were put in place prior to the big rise in inflation. And so to date, we\u2019ve been on that project we\u2019ve been pretty good at maintaining the cost estimate. So the bigger \u2013 the bigger project we had better terms on components, et cetera. But we are getting hit with some increases related to the precious metals refinery. The copper cleaner with all the projects going on at Grasberg, the mill project, the project we\u2019re doing for power, the filter plant we\u2019re doing at port site. The availability of experts and contractors has been slower than what was originally projected. And the project has taken a little longer, which is impacting the cost. But there\u2019s nothing, materially different about what we\u2019re doing there. It\u2019s just in this environment things are taking a bit longer and adding to the cost. But I do want to have a shoutout to our team managing the bigger smelter that bigger spend is, they\u2019re doing a great job in managing that, that project.\nCarlos de Alba: Thank you.\nRichard Adkerson: And Carlos, you know this industry well enough to see what\u2019s been going on with project costs around the globe. And I joined Kathleen and complimenting our smelter team, but our overall operations team, our supply chain management, you see what our cost performance is in a world that\u2019s still affected by inflation. I mean, commodity related costs are down, but overall we are taking that and running it through with all of our suppliers. And when you look at our operating cost and our project cost, I\u2019m really proud of our operating and supply management teams for the good work they\u2019re doing.\nCarlos de Alba: Yeah, definitely. Thank you, Richard. Thank you, Kathleen.\nKathleen Quirk: Thanks, Carlos.\nRichard Adkerson: Thanks, Carlos.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nTimna Tanners: Hey, good morning everyone.\nKathleen Quirk: Good morning.\nRichard Adkerson: Good morning.\nTimna Tanners: Wanted to speak in too, but this one is really high level, and I know we\u2019ve talked a lot about Indonesia in the short-term, but there\u2019s also the broader issue of the additional 10% stake they\u2019re asking for and the renegotiation IUPK further out. But I just sense that compared to five years, six years ago when you seemed a bit more concerned about the relationship with Indonesia, it seems like you\u2019re not as concerned this time. So, I just wanted to see if you could add some more color to that. Is that indeed the case? And maybe why? And how much time do we have, I guess before we really need to think about and settlement or a decision on this in the near \u2013 is it near term or is it medium term?\nRichard Adkerson: So, Timna, let me correct one thing you said, there\u2019s no renegotiation of the IUPK. Our current IUPK runs to 2041 and we have no rights beyond that. And that was negotiated after a lengthy period and settled in 2018. And the settlement in 2018 has proved to be extraordinary positive for all stakeholders. The government of Indonesia, which acquired Rio Tinto\u2019s interest during that process achieved its goals of getting a 51% equity ownership interest, and together with taxes, royalties, and other fees has essentially a 70% interest in the economics of the project. Through that FCX retained its interest, because it was already burdened by the Rio Tinto joint venture interest. And then since that date, we\u2019ve successfully completed the conversion from the open pit to this underground mine and you can just see the track record that our team\u2019s achieving with that. And over that period of time, copper prices have been good, all stakeholders have benefitted. Now, when the President and when you talk about the relationships, a key factor in that was when President Joko Widodo visited our job site in Papua the end of August, early September, the first Indonesian President to do that since Suharto did in the early 70s. He was very positive about what he saw there, about the progress we\u2019re making, about the extent of progress we made in increasing Indonesian management, Indonesian employees of Papuans that are working in our operations. It\u2019s \u2013 that was a key point in helping to build on the 2018 deal and making relationships so much more positive. Now, we all -- we have a mutual understanding that this operation needs to be run in a way that maximizes the resources that are available there. And having a drop dead date for an operation like this of 2041 is not beneficial to anyone because the exploration, delineation long-term capital planning needs to be factored, taking into account the resources that are available there. So, we had no rights to provide a basis for going forward beyond 2041. We\u2019ve had items for discussion, including an additional ownership interest for Indonesian government to deal with, and we\u2019ve agreed to support Papuan businesses to do things of that nature. So it is much different than the nature of the discussions we had going into 2018 where there was really contentious views and opposing views on various subjects that were all settled. Now we're in a mode of where there's a mutual recognition of the benefit for all stakeholders for us to plan this operation beyond 2041. And I have a lot of confidence we'll be able to achieve it. Is that you have any follow-up on that, Timna?\nTimna Tanners: Yes. I think\u2026\nKathleen Quirk: I just want to add\u2026\nTimna Tanners: Go ahead.\nKathleen Quirk: Timna, I was just going to add that a big change from maybe historically when you were thinking about it is the alignment we have \u2013 better alignment we have with the government, the state-owned enterprise, there we owns 51% of the shares, and of course we pay taxes and royalties. So the economic interest of the government in this operation is much greater than it was. And so the alignment is very positive as we look forward to create this value that Richard is talking about beyond 2041. And when we talk about beyond 2041 and the opportunity, this allows us really to think about the asset and opens the door for development much greater than what we were planning before because as Richard said, the reserves don't end in 2041. We see a lot of opportunity in using the infrastructure that we already have to further development. And the 10% \u2013 the share thing that you read about, what we were engaged in is looking at preserving what we have through 2041, but compensating the government in some way for that extension beyond 2041. So again, like we did in 2018, this would be only done if we could find the right win-win for both Freeport and the government, which we think we can.\nTimna Tanners: That's helpful. I guess\u2026\nRichard Adkerson: Yes. That's a good point, Kathleen.\nTimna Tanners: Yes.\nRichard Adkerson: The 10% would only come into play after 2041. And a key factor is under the 2018 agreement, Freeport-McMoRan manages, controls the management of the operations and everybody's happy with that. There's widespread recognition in the government of just how complicated this business is, and they're very complementary and pleased with our \u2013 the way we're running the business. So it's really a good partnership.\nTimna Tanners: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nMichael Dudas: Good morning, Kathleen, Richard.\nKathleen Quirk: Good morning, Mike.\nRichard Adkerson: Good morning.\nMichael Dudas: Kathleen, you mentioned, you want some debt back at a discount I guess during the quarter and certainly the dividend plan is in place. But as you look into the second half of the year and the CapEx and with the anticipated cash flows might be, how do you \u2013 how's the Board thinking about share repurchases since it appears you refrain from that during the first half? It's evaluation opportunistic, just balance maybe you guys shed a little bit more light on that as we move the second half of year, especially if copper prices into sharply recover?\nKathleen Quirk: Yes. Well, if copper prices sharply to recover, we're going to be generating a lot of free cash flow. Under the policy, we're distributing 50%. And if you go back cumulatively to where \u2013 when we started it in the second half of 2021, we've distributed over 50% between the dividends and the share buybacks. With improved market conditions, that's going to give us a lot of leverage to free cash flow and give us the ability to consider how we deploy that, whether it be share buybacks, dividends, et cetera. And so we're following the policy. We're keeping our debt very low. The cash flow that we've generated since the policy started, over 50% has gone to shareholders, but the other 50% is some of it's still on our balance sheet because we've got projects earmarked to fund. So we're following the policy. We think it's a great balance between balance sheet, capital returns to shareholders and investing in our long-term growth and we're going to continue to follow that.\nMichael Dudas: I appreciate that. Thanks, Kathleen.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of\u2026\nRichard Adkerson: Mike, we believe the shares \u2013 I just want to say, Mike, we believe the shares are a good value at today's levels.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Brian MacArthur with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nBrian MacArthur: Hi, good morning. I just want to follow up and thank you for your answer on Timna\u2019s question. But when you convert it from underground or from open pit underground, I mean we started building that I think in 2005 and it took 15 years. So under this long-term planning for 2041, when do you actually to efficiently develop the ore body post-KL? Are we talking you need to have this all figured out 15 years in advance like before, so you have to start in 2026? So what sort of time horizon are you looking at to be efficient going forward?\nKathleen Quirk: Brian, that's exactly the point that we're making and I think as we talked about earlier with the government now owning a big piece of PT-FI and participating in our \u2013 in our business and our operating committee, they understand that this has to be planned with long-term horizons. And so there's not a drop dead date but the sooner the better because the closer we get to 2041, the more \u2013 the more difficult it would be to \u2013 to change the \u2013 change the outcome. So that's \u2013 that's a point, a really important point and the government has \u2013 has recognized this more so now than they ever have and that gives us the opportunity to have this \u2013 have this discussion about moving forward with a \u2013 with the extension. The smelter is a big part of that. We with the \u2013 with the smelter completion, the regulations in Indonesia now allow for companies with \u2013 with refined processing facilities to be able to apply for longer term horizons. And so the regulatory environment is recognizing that and \u2013 and that's all part of what we're \u2013 we're trying to achieve. It's not a specific date, but the sooner the better in terms of long-term planning.\nRichard Adkerson: And Brian just let me say because of the IUPK term, we only report reserves through 2041. But with our work to develop our mine plans to 2041, we've already identified production that would extend production of significance that would extend beyond that. And Mark Johnson our PT-FI team are already started the process of looking at delineating these ore bodies to see what opportunities are there. And so we would as we did, as you said in the early 2000s for \u2013 for this underground conversion, we would get immediately in developing the plans long-term for extending production. Kucing Liar, we know goes far beyond that and we haven't defined the limits of the Grasberg Block Cave or the \u2013 or the other ore body Kathleen have alluded.\nKathleen Quirk: Deep MLZ.\nRichard Adkerson: Deep MLZ, that's \u2013 that's the same ore system that Freeport began mining in the early 1980s and it's just continued to go further and further at depth. So we're really excited about it and I've been involved in this ore body for so many years and one continual thing is been, it's always gotten bigger than anybody anticipated that would and so it's \u2013 it's really an exciting opportunity for us and for the government.\nBrian MacArthur: So can I just ask to follow up on that, because that's what I was trying to figure out; is the additional or past 2041, is it depth that you said DMLZ KL bigger or is it there's another whole area where you have to put in another whole say common infrastructure project. There's something else out there because originally the original drilling in the area was all cut off and whatever. Is this depth or is it just more development underground or is there another whole like if I call it the whole like original common infrastructure that would've to be put in?\nKathleen Quirk: Well, initially it's that...\nRichard Adkerson: Well you wouldn't have to do a whole common infrastructure. I mean, it would be something that would utilize what we have there and extend beyond that. But the truth is we have a lot of indications of things, but we really need to do more active delineation drilling to see what's there and then develop our plans around that.\nKathleen Quirk: And Brian, if you look at our \u2013 our resource statement and the 10-K, you'll see there's a lot of resource there that's not in reserves and some of that's material that, that comes after 2041, some of it would require some additional processing type handling because some of it has high pyrite content and that \u2013 that could be a challenge and an opportunity for us. But initially the opportunity really is a Deep MLZ we're already starting to conduct some \u2013 some exploration below Deep MLZ. So really from what we know about, we think there's a lot of opportunity. And then with a lack of mine extension we'll have \u2013 we'll have incentive to go do more exploration because we haven\u2019t done exploration for \u2013 20 plus years, given we already had enough reserves to get us through 2041. So it\u2019s a great opportunity for, as Richard said, both the government and for Freeport. And this is an asset that, that\u2019s really needed, in the global copper industry really, really important.\nBrian MacArthur: Great. Thanks very much.\nRichard Adkerson: Brian. And you\u2019ll remember this \u2013 you\u2019ll remember this Brian, because you were around then. The \u2013 when we first started developing this underground operations that 20 years ago we were shooting for 120,000 tons a day through our mill. Look what we did in this quarter, 240,000 tons a day. So that\u2019s just the nature of this great ore body.\nBrian MacArthur: Totally agree. As you said though, takes a lot of long term planning too.\nRichard Adkerson: That\u2019s the nature of our business.\nBrian MacArthur: Great. Thank you very much for all that color. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Cleve Rueckert with UBS. Please go ahead.\nCleve Rueckert: Hey, good morning everybody. Thanks for taking the question. I\u2019ve just one quick follow-up from me, and it\u2019s a little bit more near-term focus than the discussion we\u2019ve been having, but in Indonesia, can you just help frame the next 18 months, the approval that you expect to get in the next several days. How much of an extension does that get you on your ability to export concentrate? And then based on sort of the smelter construction timeline and the ramp, and when would you expect to see shipping concentrate from Indonesia such that, this concentrate export license, isn\u2019t really an issue anymore?\nKathleen Quirk: The regulation \u2013 the regulation that\u2019s just been adjusted goes through May of 2024. And we have export quotas that the government approves in connection with their review of our annual work plans. So our current quota that we\u2019ll be shipping under goes through the year end this year of 2023, we\u2019ll have to update that work plan, which we is just an ordinary course thing, which we do in the fall and that will allow us to increase the, what we the quota to get us through May. And then in connection with that, and we\u2019ve already been discussing this with the government while the smelter we expect will be, mechanically complete in the second quarter of next year, you still have a multi-month period throughout 2024 and it\u2019ll be reducing over time, but a period of time where the smelter needs to be ramped up. And so that part we will continue to review with the government. The big thing is to get mechanical completion done and we believe the government will continue to work with us to allow for some exports beyond that. But we\u2019ll have to \u2013 we\u2019ll have to work that through with the government. But really by the end of next year we are \u2013 we\u2019re expecting that the essentially we\u2019ll have enough capacity to deal with our production out of PT-FI. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on doing. We talked about this earlier. The project team is doing a really good job. We\u2019re very pleased with our EPC contractor there. We\u2019ve got thousands of people on the ground and if you see the pictures, it\u2019s really, really developing. We know and recognize that smelter operations can be complex and we\u2019re doing a lot of work and planning around operational readiness. But our target is to get, the full ramp up done as we, by the end of next year.\nCleve Rueckert: Got it. All right, great. Thank you for that. Appreciate it.\nOperator: And I\u2019ll now hand the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.\nKathleen Quirk: Well, thanks everyone for your participation. If you have any follow ups, feel free to contact David and we look forward to continue to report to you on our progress.\nRichard Adkerson: Thank you all. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today.

I'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings. On the call with me today are Richard Adkerson, our Chairman of the Board and CEO; Maree Robertson, our Chief Financial Officer; Josh Olmsted, who leads our Americas operations; Mark Johnson, who leads our Indonesian operations; Cory Stevens, who heads up our engineering, construction and technical services group; Mike Kendrick, who leads our molybdenum business; and Steve Higgins, our Chief Administrative Officer. We'll start the call. Richard will make some opening comments, and then I'll go through the prepared materials, our slide materials, and then we'll open the call to take your questions. So I'd like to turn the call over to Richard. Thank you, Richard, and I'll start on Slide 3, where we summarize our key operating and financial highlights for the second quarter. Production results across the portfolio were strong in the second quarter approaching 1.1 billion pounds of copper and nearly 500,000 ounces of gold. Our copper sales were about 3% below our guidance as a result of administrative delays in obtaining PT-FI's export license approval. We expect that PT-FI will receive approval to resume concentrate exports over the next several days. Our unit net cash costs during the quarter averaged $1.47 per pound, and that was a little better than our guidance of $1.51 per pound. With average copper prices realized of $3.84 per pound in the quarter, we generated strong margins and EBITDA of $2.14 billion. Our operating cash flows totaled $1.7 billion, and that was substantially above our mining capital expenditures, which totaled $700 million roughly, and that excludes the smelter capital of approximately $500 million in the quarter, which is being funded from proceeds that we raised last year. The balance sheet liquidity, financial flexibility remain in great shape. Excluding net debt associated with the smelter, we ended the quarter with under $1 billion of net debt. You'll see that we completed and we conducted some additional open market purchases of our public debt in the quarter at prices below par. As we look forward, we're well positioned for strong results in the second half of the year of \u2013 as second half copper volumes are projected to be over 15% higher than the first half and second half gold sales are projected to be over 25% other than what we sold in the first half of the year. I'm going to move to Slide 4 where we showcase a few of the operational highlights that we are particularly proud of in the second quarter. At Cerro Verde, where we operate one of the largest concentrate sites in the world, the mill averaged 425,000 tons of ore throughput per day during the quarter. This was a site that was designed several years ago at 360,000 tons per day. And over time our team has found ways to improve efficiencies and will continue to do that in the future. At Grasberg mill rates averaged over 200,000 tons per day, it was 207,000 tons per day in the quarter, and that was processing very high grades of both copper and gold ore. That was significantly above the first quarter level and actually the highest average quarterly throughput in over a decade. All this ore is coming from our large scale, modern and efficient underground mines now. Notably, the large scale operation at Grasberg produced copper during the quarter at a net cash credit of $0.09 per pound, and it was just extraordinary performance. We are making steady progress on the smelter in Indonesia. This is an important initiative and we're now at 75% compared with 60% progress three months ago. Our project execution is going well, and our team is very focused on completing the project efficiently. Over the next several months, we expect to complete construction by the second quarter of 2024 and begin commissioning and ramp up over the balance of 2024. We are also happy to report ongoing progress with our leach initiative and that's particularly helping our sites in the U.S. During the second quarter, this effort yielded incremental copper of 29 million pounds, and that was over two times the level in last year's second quarter. We're about 60% of our targeted annual run rate at this level, and we are well on our way to getting to our target of roughly 200 million pounds of copper per year incremental from this initiative. We're going to talk later \u2013 about it later in the presentation, but our confidence is increasing in meeting the initial target and on the significant upside for this highly valuable initiative. Turning to Slide 5, and you've seen a lot of press reports over the last several weeks about the regulatory situation in Indonesia, and we're providing an update on recent regulatory changes in the country. As many of you know, Indonesia is highly focused on downstream resource development that's been evolving over many years, and that reflects the country's national strategic priorities. The evolution of this ultimately led to our agreement in 2018 to expand our domestic smelting and refining capacity in the country. In 2020, Indonesia passed the law restricting exports of certain minerals weren't all defined, but that was beginning in June of 2023. Given our IUPK license and rights, and progress on the smelter, we continue to work with the government to allow time for us to complete our projects, which were delayed by the pandemic. As we mentioned, the projects are well advanced and nearing completion, and we were really honored to host Indonesia's President, Joko Widodo, at our smelter site in June. Beginning in June and July of this year various ministries completed regulatory process to enable ongoing exports of copper concentrates through May of 2024 for exporters with more than 50% smelter progress, and we were over 70%. Last week, the trade ministry enacted legislation to allow the exports and now the administrative process we expect to receive formal approval to resume exports over the next several days. We are going to continue to work with the government to enable exports to continue in 2024 until the new smelter is fully ramped up and operational. The Ministry of Finance also passed regulations last week to increase the duties on exports for various products, including copper concentrates for companies with progress of more than 70% of the duty. The new duty rate is 7.5% for the second half of this year. Under our IUPK, which provides stabilized terms for taxes, royalties, and duties, duties are phased out after 50% progress. And so we're currently reviewing the IUPK provisions with the ministry and our engaged in discussions on this matter. To date, the production impacts on our operations from the shipping delays have been limited, and this has been more of a timing consideration between production and sales. We currently have a sizeable volume of copper concentrate at our port site ready for shipment, and we expect to work down inventories over the next several months. Moving to the copper markets on Slide 6 and Richard touched on this in his comments. Copper is the metal when it comes to electrification. And Freeport is really well positioned as a leader in the global copper industry. The short-term market situation is characterized by, on the one hand, favorable demand drivers from growing intensity in autos, renewables and data centers, and that's partly offset by slowing manufacturing growth. China remains the world's largest consumer of copper and even with the country's current economic challenges and the weakness in the property sector, copper consumption continues to grow and that's been bolstered by large investments in copper-intensive electrical grid and strong growth in electric vehicle production. Richard referenced the inventories, which are very low levels by historical standards, they're now lower than they were at the start of this year, and we see this as evidence of a tightly balanced market. As we look forward over the next several years, demand is expected to accelerate with third-party projections for demand to double by 2035. Investments in low carbon renewable power, electrification will lead to massive growth in demand. And in addition to that, the initiatives by many countries for major infrastructure programs and the uses of copper for connectivity, data, AI, those are also growing demand drivers. At the same time, the ability of the copper industry to meet this rising demand is a major challenge, and we are working very hard to increase our supplies as we look forward. We believe prices will need to rise to incentivize new supplies of copper. At Freeport, we benefit from a large reserve position and even greater resource position to be able to grow our business in the future. As I mentioned, we're really focused on continuing to support the growing demand, producing responsibly and we're pursuing several initiatives to enhance our production going forward. Moving to Slide 7. We provide an update of our three-year outlook for sales volumes. This is largely unchanged from our prior forecast. We've reduced our 2023 copper sales volumes by about 40 million pounds, that's about 1%, to take into account the shipping schedules in the balance of the year. The guidance for 2024 and 2025 is unchanged. And we do \u2013 we are focused on continued success in our leach efforts, which we believe have the potential to provide some upside to these estimates. Moving to the regional information on Slide 8. We show our projected 2023 volumes and unit net cash costs by region. Our business in the Americas, including the U.S. and in South America, comprise about two-thirds of our 2023 copper sales and all of our molybdenum sales, and Indonesia represents about one-third of the copper sales and all of our gold sales. On a consolidated basis from a cost standpoint, our unit net cash cost forecast of $1.55 per pound for the year 2023 is consistent with our prior estimate. We've had some small offsetting changes between the regions. But in total, we're continuing to project cash cost of $1.55 for the year. As we move through the year, we're continuing to experience improving cost trends for several of our commodity-based input costs, and we're seeing more stability in labor, services and equipment component costs. We remain focused on cost management and all of our ongoing initiatives to improve productivity to offset the cost increases that we've experienced in recent years. The estimates that were provided on Slide 8 assume that the export duties in Indonesia are unchanged from our existing duties. As I mentioned previously, the new regulations imposed higher duties than our stabilized rates under the IUPK and we're engaged in the discussions with the government to review this. We provided some sensitivities on potential impacts of the higher duty rates on this page, which you can see at the bottom would have a $0.07 per pound impact on consolidated unit net cash cost for the year, take into account the impact in Indonesia of $0.19 per pound for the year with the duty starting in the second half. On Slide 9, we updated our outlook for our margins and cash flows. And if we put together our projected volumes and cost projections, we show the modeled results for our EBITDA and cash flow at various copper prices ranging from $4 to $5 copper. These results on the slide are modeled using the average of our 2024 and 2025 volume and cost estimates, and we hold gold flat in these scenarios at $1,950 per ounce and molybdenum flat at $20 per pound, both of those commodities are slightly above that today. Annual EBITDA under these assumptions would range from about $11 billion per annum to $15 billion per annum at $5. The $11 billion was at $4, and our operating cash flows before working capital would range from nearly $8 billion per year at $4 copper and $11 billion per year at $5 copper. We've got some sensitivities to the various commodities both the sales commodities as well as our input costs. On the right of the chart, we're well-positioned with our long-lived reserves, large scale production to benefit from future metals intensive growth trends. And we've got prospects as we look forward for increasing cash returns under our performance based financial policy payout framework. Return to capital expenditures next, on Slide 10 where we show our current forecast for capital expenditures in 2023 and 2024, these include the capital that we're investing in the Indonesian smelter project, and those amounts are being funded from a debt offering we did last year, we've got cash on the balance sheet and availability to support those investments and the detail of those expenditures are on Page 25 of the slide deck. But all in all on the non-smelter related investments, the \u2013 we've had some timing adjustments moving some spending from 2023 to 2024, but the current forecast for the two years is pretty similar to what we had before. It's about 3% higher for the two-year period, and that that reflects some updated estimates principally for projects at Grasberg. We've highlighted here on the slide discretionary projects, and these are the projects that are being funded with the 50% of available cash that's not distributed. Those totaled $2 billion over 2023 and 2024. And these are value enhancing initiatives that we've got some details on 24 \u2013 on Slide 24 in our reference material, but value enhancing initiatives to improve our position as we look forward. We'll talk on development options and our growth on Slide 11. We're really focused as we said, on looking at the outlook for growing copper demand and looking at our brownfield strategy given the risk and actionability of greenfield projects, our strategy of developing our resources within our portfolio, we're focused on expansions of our existing operations and our broad portfolio of brownfield opportunities. We've categorized the growth on Slide 11 and in near-term, medium-term and longer-term development operations options, and you can see in the near-term the best options for us, for growth are achieving our initial leach targets and the actions that we have particularly in our U.S. operations to enhance productivity and reliability. By increasing our mining rates in the U.S. through workforce additions, automation, and achieving higher targets for asset efficiency and reliability in our equipment and processing facilities, we believe we have the opportunity to add 200 million pounds of copper a year with very limited capital investment. We're very focused on the details of the reliability and asset efficiency that we're pursuing and see that potential as we look forward. We also outlined the potential of our leach opportunity beyond the initial target of 200 million pounds per annum. We talk extensively about this on our last call. We've got very large areas under leach. We've got new approaches and operating practices that we are deploying on this effort, and the more we work on it, the more optimistic we are about this opportunity is much larger than the initial 200 million pounds. We continue to see the clear opportunity of expanding the initial 200 million pounds of copper per annum to 800 million pounds of \u2013 per annum over the next three years to five years. We're continuing initiatives to increase heat to our stockpiles. We're continuing to enhance our ability to identify and deploy solution to areas of the stockpiles, which aren't getting adequate solution. And we're continuing our work on additives through internal testing, as well as looking at technology that others have with respect to additives. This is a major value opportunity, a major catalyst for us, and Freeport is one of the best place companies in the industry to capture value from it, and that's because of our large existing stockpiles with billions of pounds of copper still in them, our technical know-how and the ability of our team to deploy learnings quickly across the portfolio through our operational control of all the mines we have interest in. In addition to the leach opportunity, we've got more traditional sources of growth that we are pursuing. We're continuing to evaluate the expansion of our Bagdad mine in Arizona. We're completing the feasibility studies on that expansion. We've got the major El Abra opportunity in Chile, where we have an existing operation and very large reserves \u2013 resources that support future expansion. And of course, we're developing making progress with the 90,000 ton per day Kucing Liar block-cave in Indonesia, and that's expected to commence production by the end of the decade. At Bagdad, we're making some investments to advance tailings and other infrastructure to enhance our optionality for the project. And we're doing the same at El Abra looking at some investments and water infrastructure, not only that would support the current operation, but provide optionality for the large mill project in the future. After those two projects, we've got an \u2013 big opportunity in our Safford/Lone Star district in eastern Arizona. We've got current production there and have identified a significant resource that would allow us to make that district another cornerstone asset for Freeport as we look into the 2030 timeframe. We've got a series of U.S. Brownfield projects that were also looking at a big opportunity for us as in Indonesia, where an extension of our operating rights beyond 2041, which were continuing to advance would open the door for long-term large scale mining beyond 2041 and potential reserve expansion and additional development options in one of the world's largest and highest grade copper and gold mining districts. We're \u2013 with these projects, we're in a position to continue our leadership role, supplying copper to a worldwith growing requirements, we're going to continue to be disciplined in our approach, but focused on executing the projects where we can create value for shareholders. On the last slide, we \u2013 on Slide 12, we reiterate the financial policy priorities. Those are really centered on our strong balance sheet, which we have our cash returns to shareholders and investments in our value enhancing growth projects. The balance sheet is solid. We've got very strong credit metrics and flexibility within our debt targets to execute on projects. At the same time, we've distributed over $3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share purchases since commencing this performance based policy and have an attractive future long-term portfolio that will allow us to use a portion of our cash flow to build long-term value for shareholders. Richard mentioned the team is energized, motivated, and we're focused on continuing to drive value in our business in executing these plans responsibly, safely and efficiently. Thanks for your attention, your participation and operator we'll now open the call for questions. Good morning. Well, in order to export... No. That's great. Thank you, Richard. We're \u2013 I think Carlos you characterized it correctly. We're essentially distributing cash flow out of Cerro Verde. We've done very well on the debt side. And from time to time, we reserve cash for items that we know about, obligations that we need to pay or items that we know about. But we expect to continue to generate cash flow at Cerro Verde. And to the extent we don't have obligations to pay that out to shareholders. I don't have \u2013 we don't have a decision at this point exactly what the cash flow and dividends will be quarter by quarter at this point, but we do expect to continue and distribute cash out of Cerro Verde. Yes. We did have an increase in our precious metals refinery an updated estimate for this precious metals refinery. It is an operation that is relatively small compared to the overall capital. But as we've gone through more engineering the cost estimates have increased a little different than the big project, the Manyar project where a lot of things were ordered, a lot of things were put in place prior to the big rise in inflation. And so to date, we've been on that project we've been pretty good at maintaining the cost estimate. So the bigger \u2013 the bigger project we had better terms on components, et cetera. But we are getting hit with some increases related to the precious metals refinery. The copper cleaner with all the projects going on at Grasberg, the mill project, the project we're doing for power, the filter plant we're doing at port site. The availability of experts and contractors has been slower than what was originally projected. And the project has taken a little longer, which is impacting the cost. But there's nothing, materially different about what we're doing there. It's just in this environment things are taking a bit longer and adding to the cost. But I do want to have a shoutout to our team managing the bigger smelter that bigger spend is, they're doing a great job in managing that, that project. Thanks, Carlos. Good morning. I just want to add... Timna, I was just going to add that a big change from maybe historically when you were thinking about it is the alignment we have \u2013 better alignment we have with the government, the state-owned enterprise, there we owns 51% of the shares, and of course we pay taxes and royalties. So the economic interest of the government in this operation is much greater than it was. And so the alignment is very positive as we look forward to create this value that Richard is talking about beyond 2041. And when we talk about beyond 2041 and the opportunity, this allows us really to think about the asset and opens the door for development much greater than what we were planning before because as Richard said, the reserves don't end in 2041. We see a lot of opportunity in using the infrastructure that we already have to further development. And the 10% \u2013 the share thing that you read about, what we were engaged in is looking at preserving what we have through 2041, but compensating the government in some way for that extension beyond 2041. So again, like we did in 2018, this would be only done if we could find the right win-win for both Freeport and the government, which we think we can. Good morning, Mike. Yes. Well, if copper prices sharply to recover, we're going to be generating a lot of free cash flow. Under the policy, we're distributing 50%. And if you go back cumulatively to where \u2013 when we started it in the second half of 2021, we've distributed over 50% between the dividends and the share buybacks. With improved market conditions, that's going to give us a lot of leverage to free cash flow and give us the ability to consider how we deploy that, whether it be share buybacks, dividends, et cetera. And so we're following the policy. We're keeping our debt very low. The cash flow that we've generated since the policy started, over 50% has gone to shareholders, but the other 50% is some of it's still on our balance sheet because we've got projects earmarked to fund. So we're following the policy. We think it's a great balance between balance sheet, capital returns to shareholders and investing in our long-term growth and we're going to continue to follow that. Brian, that's exactly the point that we're making and I think as we talked about earlier with the government now owning a big piece of PT-FI and participating in our \u2013 in our business and our operating committee, they understand that this has to be planned with long-term horizons. And so there's not a drop dead date but the sooner the better because the closer we get to 2041, the more \u2013 the more difficult it would be to \u2013 to change the \u2013 change the outcome. So that's \u2013 that's a point, a really important point and the government has \u2013 has recognized this more so now than they ever have and that gives us the opportunity to have this \u2013 have this discussion about moving forward with a \u2013 with the extension. The smelter is a big part of that. We with the \u2013 with the smelter completion, the regulations in Indonesia now allow for companies with \u2013 with refined processing facilities to be able to apply for longer term horizons. And so the regulatory environment is recognizing that and \u2013 and that's all part of what we're \u2013 we're trying to achieve. It's not a specific date, but the sooner the better in terms of long-term planning. Deep MLZ. Well, initially it's that... And Brian, if you look at our \u2013 our resource statement and the 10-K, you'll see there's a lot of resource there that's not in reserves and some of that's material that, that comes after 2041, some of it would require some additional processing type handling because some of it has high pyrite content and that \u2013 that could be a challenge and an opportunity for us. But initially the opportunity really is a Deep MLZ we're already starting to conduct some \u2013 some exploration below Deep MLZ. So really from what we know about, we think there's a lot of opportunity. And then with a lack of mine extension we'll have \u2013 we'll have incentive to go do more exploration because we haven't done exploration for \u2013 20 plus years, given we already had enough reserves to get us through 2041. So it's a great opportunity for, as Richard said, both the government and for Freeport. And this is an asset that, that's really needed, in the global copper industry really, really important. The regulation \u2013 the regulation that's just been adjusted goes through May of 2024. And we have export quotas that the government approves in connection with their review of our annual work plans. So our current quota that we'll be shipping under goes through the year end this year of 2023, we'll have to update that work plan, which we is just an ordinary course thing, which we do in the fall and that will allow us to increase the, what we the quota to get us through May. And then in connection with that, and we've already been discussing this with the government while the smelter we expect will be, mechanically complete in the second quarter of next year, you still have a multi-month period throughout 2024 and it'll be reducing over time, but a period of time where the smelter needs to be ramped up. And so that part we will continue to review with the government. The big thing is to get mechanical completion done and we believe the government will continue to work with us to allow for some exports beyond that. But we'll have to \u2013 we'll have to work that through with the government. But really by the end of next year we are \u2013 we're expecting that the essentially we'll have enough capacity to deal with our production out of PT-FI. And that's what we're focused on doing. We talked about this earlier. The project team is doing a really good job. We're very pleased with our EPC contractor there. We've got thousands of people on the ground and if you see the pictures, it's really, really developing. We know and recognize that smelter operations can be complex and we're doing a lot of work and planning around operational readiness. But our target is to get, the full ramp up done as we, by the end of next year. Well, thanks everyone for your participation. If you have any follow ups, feel free to contact David and we look forward to continue to report to you on our progress."

            "name": "Richard Adkerson",
            "content": "Thanks, Kathleen, and good morning everybody. Thanks for joining us. The positive second quarter results, at outlook we're reporting today, reflect that our operational performance has been in line with our plans and our prior guidance. Our teams and Freeport's global operations are executing with focus, drive and enthusiasm, all hallmarks of the Freeport culture. Fundamentals in the global copper market remain positive. Despite the frequently expressed concerns about a global economic slowdown and issues in China, electrification is expanding with ongoing advances in alternative energy, electric vehicles, connectivity and supporting infrastructure. Global copper inventories remain remarkably low, and this is notable in the context of the concerns about the global economy in China. The current demand for copper is much stronger than headline economic data. While market experts have significantly varying views about the short-term outlook for the economy and for the price of copper, there's a growing positive consensus on the medium and longer term outlook based on projected demand growing faster than supply development. Freeport is extraordinarily well situated in these circumstances with our large scale currently producing assets, which we're focused on executing the ongoing positive performance and attractive pipeline for future growth from the large scale undeveloped reserves and resources already in our current asset base. Kathleen, we'll now summarize the quarter and our outlook, and then I'll be back along with our team to answer any questions you may have. Sure. Josh, you're on the line. Why don't you respond to that? I was just at Cerro Verde and I got to tell you, I was so proud of what the team's done down there. We have a long history in Peru and Cerro Verde of being able to deal. Sometimes we get affected by strikes, not related to our operations and so forth, but our team is prepared for it. And we're hopeful that this thing gets resolved is not really a major substance issue in my observation on it. And our team will be able to manage our way through it if in fact we have to deal with it. Let's answer your first question. Yeah, let's go ahead and answer that. One of the complications we had with this is that the domestic smelter at Gresik that PT Smelting owns, which is not affected by any sort of export issues. It was undergoing a maintenance \u2013 a plant maintenance turnaround. So there was limited concentrates we could ship domestically. That has been completed and now we've begun returning to shipping to Gresik. We haven't shut down at all. We've \u2013 our team is adjusted to the situation by advancing some plant maintenance activities that we had for the second half of the year. And while the storage facilities were approaching their limits or meeting their limits, we have not had a significant \u2013 we've had some impact, but not a significant impact on operations. We anticipate resuming exports very shortly and we have a lot of concentrate that's been produced that's on site that's ready to sell and we'll be moving that to market. All indications are and expectations are is that we will be able to export. We're continuing discussions right now to present our case. And if we can resolve it, that would be the best outcome. If we can't, we'd begin to exports and then pursue our legal rights separately. Kathleen, you have something to add? And Carlos, you know this industry well enough to see what's been going on with project costs around the globe. And I joined Kathleen and complimenting our smelter team, but our overall operations team, our supply chain management, you see what our cost performance is in a world that's still affected by inflation. I mean, commodity related costs are down, but overall we are taking that and running it through with all of our suppliers. And when you look at our operating cost and our project cost, I'm really proud of our operating and supply management teams for the good work they're doing. Thanks, Carlos. Good morning. So, Timna, let me correct one thing you said, there's no renegotiation of the IUPK. Our current IUPK runs to 2041 and we have no rights beyond that. And that was negotiated after a lengthy period and settled in 2018. And the settlement in 2018 has proved to be extraordinary positive for all stakeholders. The government of Indonesia, which acquired Rio Tinto's interest during that process achieved its goals of getting a 51% equity ownership interest, and together with taxes, royalties, and other fees has essentially a 70% interest in the economics of the project. Through that FCX retained its interest, because it was already burdened by the Rio Tinto joint venture interest. And then since that date, we've successfully completed the conversion from the open pit to this underground mine and you can just see the track record that our team's achieving with that. And over that period of time, copper prices have been good, all stakeholders have benefitted. Now, when the President and when you talk about the relationships, a key factor in that was when President Joko Widodo visited our job site in Papua the end of August, early September, the first Indonesian President to do that since Suharto did in the early 70s. He was very positive about what he saw there, about the progress we're making, about the extent of progress we made in increasing Indonesian management, Indonesian employees of Papuans that are working in our operations. It's \u2013 that was a key point in helping to build on the 2018 deal and making relationships so much more positive. Now, we all -- we have a mutual understanding that this operation needs to be run in a way that maximizes the resources that are available there. And having a drop dead date for an operation like this of 2041 is not beneficial to anyone because the exploration, delineation long-term capital planning needs to be factored, taking into account the resources that are available there. So, we had no rights to provide a basis for going forward beyond 2041. We've had items for discussion, including an additional ownership interest for Indonesian government to deal with, and we've agreed to support Papuan businesses to do things of that nature. So it is much different than the nature of the discussions we had going into 2018 where there was really contentious views and opposing views on various subjects that were all settled. Now we're in a mode of where there's a mutual recognition of the benefit for all stakeholders for us to plan this operation beyond 2041. And I have a lot of confidence we'll be able to achieve it. Is that you have any follow-up on that, Timna? Yes. That's a good point, Kathleen. The 10% would only come into play after 2041. And a key factor is under the 2018 agreement, Freeport-McMoRan manages, controls the management of the operations and everybody's happy with that. There's widespread recognition in the government of just how complicated this business is, and they're very complementary and pleased with our \u2013 the way we're running the business. So it's really a good partnership. Good morning. Mike, we believe the shares \u2013 I just want to say, Mike, we believe the shares are a good value at today's levels. And Brian just let me say because of the IUPK term, we only report reserves through 2041. But with our work to develop our mine plans to 2041, we've already identified production that would extend production of significance that would extend beyond that. And Mark Johnson our PT-FI team are already started the process of looking at delineating these ore bodies to see what opportunities are there. And so we would as we did, as you said in the early 2000s for \u2013 for this underground conversion, we would get immediately in developing the plans long-term for extending production. Kucing Liar, we know goes far beyond that and we haven't defined the limits of the Grasberg Block Cave or the \u2013 or the other ore body Kathleen have alluded. Deep MLZ, that's \u2013 that's the same ore system that Freeport began mining in the early 1980s and it's just continued to go further and further at depth. So we're really excited about it and I've been involved in this ore body for so many years and one continual thing is been, it's always gotten bigger than anybody anticipated that would and so it's \u2013 it's really an exciting opportunity for us and for the government. Well you wouldn't have to do a whole common infrastructure. I mean, it would be something that would utilize what we have there and extend beyond that. But the truth is we have a lot of indications of things, but we really need to do more active delineation drilling to see what's there and then develop our plans around that. Brian. And you'll remember this \u2013 you'll remember this Brian, because you were around then. The \u2013 when we first started developing this underground operations that 20 years ago we were shooting for 120,000 tons a day through our mill. Look what we did in this quarter, 240,000 tons a day. So that's just the nature of this great ore body. That's the nature of our business. Thank you all."

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, President. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nKathleen Quirk: Thank you, Regina, and good morning. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan conference call. Earlier this morning, we reported our first quarter 2023 operating and financial results and a copy of today's press release and slides are available on our website at fcx.com. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. Like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings. Also on the call today is Richard Adkerson, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Maree Robertson, our CFO; Mark Johnson, our Chief Operating Officer for Indonesia; Josh Olmsted, Chief Operating Officer for the Americas; Mike Kendrick, who leads our Molybdenum Business; Cory Stevens, who leads our Engineering and our Project Development Activities. I'll turn the call over to Richard who will make some opening comments and then we'll come back and review the prepared slide materials and then take your questions. Richard?\nRichard Adkerson: Thank you, Kathleen, and thank you all for joining us. Kathleen will review the results of the quarter and our outlook and I'll join our team in responding to your questions. I'm pleased with our global team's responses to challenges we faced in the first quarter. You all know, mining is a tough business, that's evidenced by the recent reports throughout the industry. Who you are in our industry is defined by your responses to challenges. I'm very proud of who we are at Freeport. Our team in Indonesia, once again, proved resilient in overcoming a major flood event. Now, we're accustomed to dealing with rainfall at Grasberg. It's located high in the mountains of New Guinea, one of the wettest places on the globe. We just celebrated our 56th anniversary of operating there. Our systems are designed to handle significant rainfall. The intensity of the event we experienced in January was unusually severe. Our established systems prevented major damages. Our team bounced back quickly by taking immediate actions to restore production and mitigate future risk and we have a great start in the second quarter with operations there. Kathleen and I have made a series of trips to Indonesia in recent months. For me, it's personally gratifying to experience the markedly more positive attitudes there about Freeport than in years past. All this resulted from the partnership we established with the government in 2018, the success we have achieved in the multi-year large scale development of our underground operations, and the positive outlook for copper in the future. Grasberg has now returned to rank as the world's second largest copper mine. Our net cash cost of production at Grasberg in the first quarter was a negative $0.08 per pound. We're now working positively with the government to extend PT-FI's operating rights beyond 2041 in a way that benefits all stakeholders. At Cerro Verde, our team negotiated through a volatile period of political turmoil in Peru. Our team rallied around the community and our workforce to handle the situation in a remarkable fashion. Our US team is stepping up to overcome the challenges associated with labor availability in the United States. We appreciate the commitment and drive of the global Freeport team to reach our gold in challenging circumstances. Copper markets continue to be supported by low levels of inventories, China's accelerating economic recovery, and the ongoing positive global demand drivers for copper. Our customers continue to buy all the copper we can produce and seek more. As we move forward, copper miners will be required to expand production to meet demand. At Freeport, we're in a strong position to develop new sources of copper supply to grow our business from our vast brownfield resources and also to grow our business from the rapidly developing leach technology and the supporting data analytics. At Freeport, we benefit from strong franchises and support from communities where we operate. We are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet. We have an exemplary track record for success and project and operations execution. Focused execution is the backbone of our culture at Freeport. We have a clearly defined strategy and a relentless drive for achieving long-term success. And Kathleen will now review our slides.\nKathleen Quirk: Thank you, Richard, and I'll start on slide three. You've probably seen, we published our Annual Report and our Sustainability Report today and the reports are available on our website. The theme of this year's Annual Report is The Power of Copper. It highlights the critical role that Freeport and our principal product, copper, play in powering the global economy and the growing uses of copper as the world decarbonize and re-imagines modern infrastructure to support a highly connected world. We're also proud to publish our annual Sustainability Report. We've been reporting on our comprehensive sustainability initiatives for 22 years now and transparency continues to be enhanced. The report summarizes our initiatives, our achievements, and the challenges that we face in managing the safety, social, and environmental aspects of our business, which are critical to our long-term success. We use international standards, best practices, and third-parties, such as The Copper Mark, to measure our performance and responsibility to our stakeholders. We hope you'll have the chance to review this information and engage with us on these topics. We'll turn to slide four, which summarizes our key operating and financial highlights in the first quarter. As previously disclosed, our Grasberg operations were temporarily disrupted in February, following a significant weather impact in our mill area. As Richard said, the team did a great job to safely restore production to normal levels in March. Despite the lower volumes compared with our estimates going into the quarter, our consolidated unit net cash costs were essentially in line with our guidance. Consolidated cost per unit averaged $1.76 per pound in the quarter as higher byproduct credits more than offset the volume impact. As Richard mentioned, notably, even with the disruption, Grasberg unit net cash costs averaged a net credit of $0.08 per pound, meaning, the gold revenues more than offset the cash costs of production. With the return to normal operations in March and a great start in April, we expect our volumes to be strong in the balance of the year. Our margins in the quarter were strong, our EBITDA totaled $2.2 billion in the quarter, operating cash flows, which were net of $500 million use of cash for working capital totaled $1.1 billion. We funded investments during the quarter of $1.1 billion. That included about $400 million for major mining projects and $300 million for the Indonesian smelter, which is being funded from proceeds from financing we raised last year. Excluding net debt associated with the smelter, we ended the quarter with $1.3 billion in net debt. Our balance sheet, liquidity, financial flexibility are in terrific shape. The outlook is positive for free cash flow generation in the balance of the year. The next slide, Richard talked about the challenges we faced in the first quarter and we faced these across our global operations. Our teams executed well in the circumstances. And you can see on the left, the production impact of the weather event at Grasberg in February and the strong recovery in March. In Peru, we and other companies experienced a challenging environment earlier in the year associated with widespread protests, which impacted supply chains and transportation routes. Our team at Cerro Verde did a great job managing the situation efficiently and safely. Situation in Peru has improved in recent weeks and we're now operating at normal rates. In the US, we were challenged with ongoing labor shortages, extreme weather events earlier in the quarter and unplanned maintenance issues. We're working to improve productivity and reliability, working on skills development and pursuing technology and automation initiatives as we aggressively seek to recruit workers with ongoing tight labor market conditions in the US. The leach recovery efforts, which we'll talk more about, really helped to offset some of the shortfalls in mining rates and we're going to continue to build on this. Turning to the markets on slide six. Freeport is well positioned as a leader in the global copper industry. Demand for copper is expected to accelerate going forward with projections for demand to double by 2035. Copper is essential in electrification. Low carbon investments in renewable power and electrification are driving massive growth in demand. In addition, the initiatives by many countries from major infrastructure programs and the uses of copper for connectivity, data, and artificial intelligence are also growing demand drivers. At the same time, the ability of the industry to meet this rising demand is a real challenge. All of us can look back at this time last year when many were projecting the market to move to a surplus in 2023, pointing to the new projects that were coming online. As we look at the situation today, most analysts now project the market to be balanced this year even with the new projects, and longer-term, the projections are for very large deficits. Under this backdrop, we believe prices will need to rise to incentivize new supplies. And at Freeport, we benefit from a large reserve position, as you see on the slide, and an even larger resource position to grow our business in the future. We're strongly positioned to continue to support growing demand and are pursuing several of these initiatives to enhance production going forward. On slide seven, we talk about the molybdenum markets, and as we've discussed, in addition to being a leading copper producer, Freeport is the world's largest molybdenum producer. Last quarter, we spoke about the significant rise in molybdenum from $18 per pound in late 2022 to a high of over $38 per pound in the first quarter of this year. We realized $30 per pound for our molybdenum sales in the first quarter. The price rose sharply beginning in late 2022 in response of supply issues and favorable demand drivers in energy and aerospace sectors. The prices began to drop from the highs in recent weeks, partly related to improved supply. As we look forward, the demand drivers from moly are positive, and since moly is principally produced as a byproduct from copper mines, it's also subject to some of the same supply issues as we have in copper. Current price of moly approximates just over $21 per pound. We're really excited, moving to slide eight, really excited to talk today to give you an update on our leach initiatives, which Richard referred to earlier. Our efforts to increase copper production through enhanced recoveries from our massive leach stockpiles is continuing to gain momentum. Based on our results today, we're gaining increasing confidence in achieving our initial target of 200 million pounds per annum and have begun to model what the next phase could look like. On the left side of the chart, we summarize the various categories that make up the initial 200 million pound target, basically in three buckets. The first is, relates to heat, increasing temperatures within the stockpiles. The second is an initiative we call Leach Everywhere, which is focused on making sure the entire stockpile has the benefit of the liquid solution we use to leach copper. And the third category, which is really important, it involves data analytics using new data available through sensors used in a variety of ways, including optimizing the amount of solution use and the rate of application we use to achieve the best results. It's been proven that increasing heat in the stockpiles enhances recoveries. We've advanced the installation of covers on our stockpiles for heat retention and we've mechanized the process and that's allowed us to execute more efficiently. We now have over 30% of our massive stockpiles covered. These initiatives provide 30% of the targeted increase. The Leach Everywhere initiative makes up 50% of the uplift and uses targeted drilling to improve flow of the solution that may not be getting through the stockpile. We're also drilling injection wells to add the liquid solution to lower stockpile sections. The sensors we've installed and access to other technology used in oil and gas formations are providing new information on where additional leach solution would stimulate the process and support higher production. The data analytics works is providing new insights. We really haven't had the benefit of this in the past, and we're now able to get the benefit to determine the optimal operating protocols under various conditions of the stockpiles. The initial success of these initiatives adds production at low incremental cost and a low carbon footprint. In parallel with our initial activities, we've been doing substantial work on the drivers to stimulate leach production and have modeled results on what the next phase of initiatives could yield. We see an opportunity to add an additional 600 million pounds per annum from these initiatives, which would provide a total of 800 million pounds per year. That's the size of a major new mine without the capital intensity and a very low incremental operating cost. The three areas of focus are highlighted in the center of the slide and we're in various stages of development on each of these initiatives. We've got a lot of work to do to advance these initiatives and some of this requires further innovation, but we have a clear path to success in this program. We're evaluating opportunities to increase the temperature further by heating the liquid solution before application on the stockpile. We're evaluating options to do this using solar generated power, geothermal or other renewable sources at our mine sites to accomplish the additional heat requirement. We're also testing various additives that we're developing both internally as well as from third-party initiatives. And we're using artificial intelligence in our journey and in our evaluations to help expedite the process. We're also evaluating options to inject air into the stockpiles in areas that are not getting enough oxygen. Again, we have much more knowledge of what is going on within the stockpiles and are working to design solutions to restimulate copper production. Freeport is in an exceptionally strong position to lead the industry in this area with massive stockpiles currently under leach, ongoing mine leach, mine for leach activities and the latent tank house capacity that we have. This will be part of our growth plans as we go forward in addition to the organic growth that we have to develop new copper in traditional ways. And slide nine highlights the growth and development outlook. And as we look at growing copper demand and the limitations and risks and actionable greenfield project development, our strategy and development priorities are focused on extensions of our existing operations and our portfolio of brownfield opportunities. On slide nine, we show our near-term, medium-term and longer-term development options. Following the significant growth in recent years achieved through the successful Grasberg development, we're focused on advancing to next phases. In the near-term, we see the best options for growth and achieving our initial leach targets and actions to enhance productivity and reliability in our US operations. If we can get our mining rates up in the US, which we're working on, and hit our targets for asset efficiency and reliability, we have the opportunity to add an additional 200 million pounds per year with limited capital investment. In the medium-term, we've outlined a series of initiatives. The first includes the second phase of our leach project. We're also looking to expand our Bagdad mine in Arizona and expect to complete feasibility studies this year. We have a major opportunity in Chile at our El Abra project and we already have an existing operation and looking to expand it significantly. And we're in the process of developing a new 90,000 ton per day block cave mine in Indonesia called Kucing Liar, which is currently in progress and expected to commence initial production by the end of the decade. At Bagdad, we're making some investments, which are included in our new capital expenditure guidance to conduct early works in the tailings area to enhance optionality to move more quickly with the mill expansion project, following completion of the feasibility study. Longer-term and we're already working on these projects, as they require long lead times, we expect we'll have the opportunity for further major expansion in the Safford/Lone Star district where we have identified significant resource and we have a series of US brownfield projects that can be pursued. In Indonesia, Richard talked about the extension discussions we're having and the extension of our operating rights beyond 2041 would open the door for continuation of large scale mining and potential additional development options in one of the world's largest and highest grade copper and gold mining districts. We're in an outstanding position to continue our leadership role in supplying copper to a world with growing requirements. We're going to continue to be disciplined in our approach and focused on executing projects where we can create value for shareholders. On slide 10, we provide an update of our three-year outlook for sales volumes. We've updated the 2023 sales guidance to take into account the first quarter disruption and the impact of lower mining rates in the US. Despite the disruption at Grasberg in February, our gold volumes for 2023 are about 3% higher than prior estimates. We've incorporated the estimates for stronger gold recoveries than in our January forecast, and we're doing really well in that regard. The guidance for 2024 and 2025 is unchanged. But with continued success in our leach efforts, we have some upside to these estimates. On slide 11, we show, moving to cost, we show a comparison of our prior unit net cash cost guidance for 2023 compared to our current estimate. We currently estimate unit cash cost to average $1.55 per pound for 2023, that's slightly lower than our January estimate of $1.60 per pound. The impact of the lower -- copper volumes is offset by higher byproduct credits and a reduction in export duties in Indonesia associated with our smelter construction progress. Our assumptions for the key commodity based input costs are similar to the January estimates. We're starting to experience less inflationary pressures in certain areas than in 2022, particularly for energy, while labor cost, services and equipment components have increased. In the reference slides on page 23, you'll note an approximate 7% increase in site production and delivery costs for our US mines compared with prior estimates. This largely reflects a reduction in volumes in the US associated with the challenges we discussed earlier. And we've got ongoing initiatives to improve productivity there. Moving to our cash flows. On slide 12, we show modeled results for EBITDA and cash flow at various copper prices ranging from $4 per pound of copper to $5 per pound of copper. These are modeled results for 2024 and 2025 with our current volume estimates and our cost estimates and we hold gold flat at $2,000 and molybdenum flat at $18 per pound in these models. Our annual EBITDA under these scenarios would range from over $10.5 billion per annum at $4 copper to $15 billion per annum at $5 copper. And operating cash flows would range from $7.5 billion per year at $4 copper to $11 billion per year at $5 copper. We show some sensitivities to the various commodities on the right. And with our long-term long-life reserves and large-scale production, we're really in a position to benefit from future metals intensive growth trends and the prospects for increasing cash flows and cash returns under our performance-based pay-out framework. On slide 13, we provide an update to our capital expenditures. Current forecast and these exclude the Indonesian smelter project, which is being funded with cash that we released last year in a bond offering. But our current forecast for 2023 totals $3.5 billion. That's up from the prior estimate of $3.4 billion and capital expenditures for 2024 are currently forecast to approximately $3.3 billion. The change from our prior guidance principally reflects investments we're planning at Bagdad to jump start early works to support optionality for future expansion. The bad debt investments or projects that we categorize as discretionary and do not reduce the cash available for distribution under our pay-out policy as they will be funded with the remaining 50% of free cash flow retained for growth projects. On slide 14, we got some great pictures showing the construction of our new smelter in Indonesia. This is a major undertaking for us. It's impressive and it will be on a world-class scale. The project will become the world's largest single-line flash copper smelting facility and it's advancing rapidly. We expect to commission the project in 2024. The project will include a precious metals processing facility and an expansion of the existing nearby smelter and it will align with Indonesia's downstream policy and enable PT-FI to process all of its concentrates domestically. In closing, on slide 15, we summarize our financial policy, which is centered around three priorities with the cornerstone being a strong balance sheet and we've achieved that. Our balance sheet and liquidity are strong and provide significant financial flexibility for the future. We're executing the performance-based pay-out policy, which provides for 50% of our free cash flow to be allocated to shareholder returns in the form of dividends and share purchases and the balance available to invest in our projects. We'll continue to pay a base dividend and a variable dividend at a combined annual rate of $0.60 per share. And since commencing the performance-based pay-out policy in 2021, we've returned about 60% of our free cash flow to shareholders and it further strengthened our balance sheet along the way, providing capacity for funding new projects over time. We did not purchase shares in the first quarter, but have availability under our share purchase authorization to conduct purchases, pursuant to the policy and we have a positive outlook for substantial free cash flow generation in the future depending on prices and other factors. The three priorities of balance sheet strength, allocating cash flow to a mix of shareholder returns and organic growth, we believe will enhance long-term value for the benefit of our shareholders. Our global team is energized. We're motivated to continue building value in our business and we're executing our plans responsibly, safely and efficiently. Thanks for your attention and we'll now take your questions.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris LaFemina with Jefferies.\nChristopher LaFemina: Hi. Thanks, Operator. Kathleen, Richard, thank you for taking my question. I actually have a bunch of questions, but I'll just ask one and then I'll get back in the queue. There's a lot of M&A activity happening in mining, obviously, at the moment, and copper seems to be a major focus. And I know -- I think Richard has talked a little bit about looking at M&A opportunities in the past, but you obviously haven't done much in recent years. And I'm just wondering with your overall philosophy is around M&A? Are there jurisdictions that you'd be focused on? Is it important to have operational synergies? Are there any kind of key criteria that you would consider or is it just really about being opportunistic? And then secondly, is M&A something that is increasingly on your radar screen just as a result of consolidation in the industry in general? Thank you.\nRichard Adkerson: Thanks, Chris. As you know well for a long time now, I've been saying that consolidation would come to our industry. It's inevitable because of the challenges in developing projects. And it's not just a price issue, it's really just the availability of actionable projects for companies to pursue and companies in our industry that are diversified companies have had copper at the top of their strategic list for a long time. It's notable of the overall lack of success in developing new projects. There have been a few, of course. So all those things come together and lead to what we're seeing going on right now with M&A activity. Now for us, we don't have a strategy of growing through M&A. We are focused on our large-scale inventory of reserves and resources that Kathleen described. And but that does not mean that we would not take advantage of opportunities that may arise. So we're not defining regions or any other criteria. We would only do something if it was clearly something that was value enhancing for our shareholders. So we're not in a position of looking for things to do. But now with our company having made such great progress in strengthening our balance sheet, completing the major underground conversion at Grasberg and advancing on all fronts, we would be in a position if an opportunity arises, but it would only be in that case.\nChristopher LaFemina: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Emily Chieng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nEmily Chieng: Good morning, Richard and Kathleen. My question is just around the leaching technology that you've talked a little bit more about today. And I wanted to dig through the 600 million pounds of step change in leaching volumes there. I think as we talk about the third-party catalytical leaching technology, I think that's been deployed at El Abra and Bagdad currently. What percentage of that 600 million pounds does that account for? And perhaps could you talk to the time line to getting there? And whether or not this could mean the El Abra expansion mill expansion could be delayed further if there's a strong success there?\nKathleen Quirk: Emily, it's Kathleen, and I'll let Cory Stevens fill in on this because he's leading the efforts. But in terms of the additional 600 million pounds, a portion of it could be through these additives, but it's important to note that the additives that we're pursuing are both internal and through third-parties. And we've got a trial going on with a relatively small stockpile at Bagdad with Jetti. And we've got some new initiatives going on with Jetti at El Abra. But the bulk of what we're outlining here is initiatives that we can pursue on our own there. It's really not -- there's a lot of innovation involved and technology involved, but it's not rocket science. And the sensors and data that we have now is pointing us to where the issues are, where is the solution not getting through the stockpile, where is the stockpile not getting oxygen to it. So these things can add -- once we identify the problem, we, as an industry, can fix -- can find a solution. And at Freeport, we have such big stockpiles. That's why we have such a big opportunity here. So the bulk of what we're talking about, the opportunity we're talking about is largely at Morenci. Morenci is -- you see -- you look at our 38 billion pounds and look at the percentage of Morenci and that's where the bulk of the opportunity is. But if we are successful with this, potentially at El Abra, it might, we don't know yet, but it might compete with traditional mill technology. But we're really looking at what's available now through third-parties, but our initiative and our objective is to find a way to solve this on our own because that's the best way to maximize the yields for Freeport. But, Cory, do you want to add anything to those comments?\nCory Stevens: Yes, Kathleen, no, you said it well. So our R&D efforts, we've been chasing some internal leads that look very promising. And then in the first quarter, what we've been able to do couple our work with artificial intelligence and machine learning much like how big pharma uses to develop their new products in a way that's driving us to increase the breadth and scope of the candidates that we're looking for implementation. And then in parallel we're actually bringing in more capabilities to do quick tests and medium scale tests and in the field at scale tests, but that's where we're most excited and then coupling that with some of the temperature activities we see that our confidence is growing on that front.\nEmily Chieng: Great. That's very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nCarlos de Alba: Yeah. Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. Just on Indonesia. I wonder if you can give us perhaps an update on how the conversations are for obtaining the export license, the extension of the export license in June? And also any conversations that you may have had with the government and your local partner on extending the contract beyond 2041 ahead of time? Thank you.\nRichard Adkerson: Yes. Thanks, Carlos. It's all of these things are happening in parallel with each other. To get the contract extension approved and there's widespread support for it within the government, requires some procedural actions to deal with existing government regulations and then also to amend the IUPK that we were granted in December of 2018, that would be a fairly simple process. So we are really encouraged by it. The June date, it has to do with this broader issue the country is pursuing with downstreaming for minerals broadly. And so that's why that was there. We don't anticipate that will be something that would limit our ability to continue operations beyond June. Anything more, Carlos, to be specific on it.\nKathleen Quirk: I'll just point out that our IUPK that we entered into that Richard referred to in 2018 allows us to continue exports through -- at that point contemplated December 2023. And that has some force majeure provisions, which clearly the delays that we've experienced related to COVID and supply chains are force majeure. So our IUPK allows us to do it, but we need to get the approval from the government to put in this regulation after the IUPK was signed to restrict exports in a broad range and it's not defined which minerals they're trying to achieve. But we're working with the government. We are keeping them informed and they're visiting our copper smelter site. They're very impressed with the progress that we've made. Unfortunately, it's not going to be finished. It will be -- the construction will be substantially complete by the end of this year, but it won't be completely finished. And so we'll need the ability to continue to export. And importantly with the alignment we now have with the government ownership, it's very important for the government revenues as well for exports to continue. So we're going to continue to work on it. We don't have the extension beyond June yet, but we do expect to get it.\nRichard Adkerson: And Kathleen is right that we have these legal rights that are documented, but I want to emphasize, we're working cooperatively with the government and not just pushing our legal rights and we're getting a good response from it.\nCarlos de Alba: Right. Okay. And just one clarification. For the extension beyond 2041 or the contract beyond 2041, is this something that requires legislative approval or is it just an executive decision, obviously, together with the ministries and all that?\nRichard Adkerson: The government will decide really how to document it. There is a path forward for it to be done without formally going through new legislation. We do benefit now by having strong support within the parliament of Indonesia, who visited our operations, the parliamentary group overseeing mining came to the US and visited us here. So I just want to emphasize the whole tone has changed. The President visited our operations in late August, early September and it was a very positive. One of the highlights of my career there in Indonesia was his visits and we're building off of this to find the right way forward and do it in a way that everybody wins from it. The government would win, the local community, the workforce, suppliers to our business. So that's how we're working together to see how can we go forward and makes nobody benefits from us having any kind of drop dead date on operations there. It would really be hard to envision. And this 2041 date was in our original 1991 contract of work was carried forward in the 2018 IUPK and we actually have not done significant delineation drilling to see the extent of the resource beyond what's been necessary to fill up the production profile through 2041. And yet, in doing that, we have a very substantial resource beyond that already identified. But I'm really excited about the opportunity to go in and drill to see -- in the 30-plus year history of Grasberg, it always has gotten bigger over time. And I'm confident as we do more drilling, it will continue to be, to grow and be bigger just because of the nature of the ore system there and the grades that are available to us, it's really exciting. And so that's what we want to achieve with the government is to get the extension granted then undertake an active program of delineation. We only report reserves through 2041 and this would give us a chance to develop reserves beyond that date and to develop -- and to come up with plans for developing those reserves for future growth. It's just a great long-term asset as a base for our company for its future.\nCarlos de Alba: All right. Thank you very much, Richard and Kathleen.\nRichard Adkerson: Okay. Thank you for your question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian MacArthur with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nBrian MacArthur: Good morning. I just want to follow up a little bit on the leaching situation and I appreciate all the detail. I just want to clarify, I think, you said most of this was internal, so it's not Jetti. But then you made a comment about the bulk of its Morenci. Morenci is sort of 50% of the stockpiles, but there's a whole bunch of other North American stuff. Is there a tank house issue? Or is that 800 million constrained going forward by anything else? Or could it just be bigger if you can do stuff at Bagdad and Sierrita and everywhere else?\nKathleen Quirk: Brian, we have latent tank house capacity across the business of about 1 billion pounds a year. And it's in different places. But that is what makes this so compelling is that there really isn't a lot of incremental capital involved in these initiatives. So historical leach production, you go back decades, has declined over time. And we're just having a resurgence of what it once was. And this new data available to us that's telling us what's going on within the stockpiles is providing us with a road map to kind of have a renaissance of the prior leach production. So if need be, we could invest in new tank house capacity, but the low hanging fruit is, we've got latent tank house capacity at many of these sites. So we're really approaching this across the footprint. But the highest impact is to-date has been at Morenci. And that will likely be the lion's share of where we get additional pounds. But we have opportunities across the footprint. We also have inactive operations and active leach stockpiles that we can look to in the future. But the first -- the lowest hanging fruit and the highest value is in places where we're already leaching.\nRichard Adkerson: Yes. Morenci is the world's largest leaching operation today, and it was where much of the modern leaching technology was originally developed decades ago. So I just wish I could have a good way of conveying the excitement of our team working on this. It's really fun to see. We're leaching everywhere and we're going to leach to the last drop. So it's -- and the benefits are just -- no permitting to do this kind of stuff. There's very little capital -- tank house capital, if it's necessary, is not significant in the bigger picture of things. And the climate -- the carbon emissions are -- so it's a winner on every respect, and that's why we're working cooperatively with other companies and with Jetti and focusing on what we can do on our own because we do it on our own, we capture all the economics for our shareholders. So it's a multifaceted deal and like I said it's really a lot of fun. It's injected a level of enthusiasm into our whole organization that's really fun to see.\nBrian MacArthur: I might be pushing it here. But just as a related thing, you also talked about North American staffing, asset efficiency of 200 million pounds. So that has nothing to do with any of this. That's independent. What actually is that part of the equation?\nRichard Adkerson: Well, it's not limited to the mining industry. Certainly, it's not restraining us with our efforts to advance leaching. But it's an issue that -- as I talk with other CEOs in the business roundtable, everywhere people are experiencing it. Some of it grew out of COVID in the way people are approaching life work styles as they go forward, but it's a real issue for us, and we're attacking it by aggressively recruiting for people, but also its spurring our efforts to see what can we do with technology to make our business less labor intensive. But it is a real issue in the US, not in Peru, Chile, Indonesia, but it's just a significant matter in the US.\nKathleen Quirk: But, Brian, it's basically getting our mining rates up and also getting our plant and processing to reliability standards consistent with what we've experienced in the past. So some of the experience levels have impacted us for the reasons Richard just talked about. But this is -- these are things -- these are self-help items and we've already got efforts underway to work on it and a game plan for how we're working on, but it's an opportunity that we don't need to go do a major project to go get. And so, again, the leach initiative, the initial leach initiative and this self-help work that we're doing is some of the highest value opportunities we have in the near-term.\nBrian MacArthur: Right. And while 1 billion pounds, I guess, it's equivalent to being one of the biggest -- one of the top five copper mines in the world?\nKathleen Quirk: Yes.\nBrian MacArthur: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nTimna Tanners: Hey, good morning. I want to look at --\nKathleen Quirk: Hi, Timna.\nTimna Tanners: Thanks. I wanted to look at slide five and kind of the cadence as you described and kind of understand what the trajectory is going forward? So is the -- it sounds like the Peruvian situation has really improved from what we hear. So is that fully behind and we can expect this run rate going forward? I know you talked about labor issues continuing, but I assume the weather, we are not going to forecast interruptions there. So I just wanted to get a little bit more about the cadence you'd expect in the regions and any impact on costs that might be lingering? Thanks.\nRichard Adkerson: Kathleen, I'll start by just making a comment about Peru. There are different issues in different parts of the country of Peru. And the -- and our operations is located just off the outskirts of the city of Arequipa, in the Arequipa region. And while there were protests there, they weren't as large as a protest in other areas. And we did have some disruptions of personnel movement and supplies for a period of time. And in our region, it has improved. The issues have not been resolved in the country. And so that remains there as an ongoing risk. But as you look at this trajectory issue, I think, it's important to look at individual regions and see what's going on there and not assume that because we made such improvement that that's carried forward to the same extent in other regions. So it's complicated. This whole business is complicated, but that Peru is very complicated.\nKathleen Quirk: And Timna, you can look at slide 26, and that has our quarterly sales volumes for the balance of the year. The first quarter was impacted by these disruptions, but also we had the conversion to tolling in Indonesia, which we had projected going into the quarter. But you can see where we expected to be -- where we expect to be on a run rate for the balance of this year. And you can see very, very strong recovery from first quarter in the balance of 2023.\nTimna Tanners: Anything on the cost side as a second part of the question, I had asked? Is that also kind of out of the woods for most of the group besides the labor issues?\nKathleen Quirk: Well, the first quarter, we had $1.76, and we're projecting for the year to average $1.55. So our cost -- unit cost in the balance of the year will be less than they were in the first quarter. We talked about some of the inflationary items easing from last year and that's principally energy. We saw the big spike in energy starting around this time last year. And some of the other input costs that were exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine situation. Some of those things have declined in East and so that's that is helpful. But we still have labor or services costs that were contracted for some of our components, equipment components, all those things are still with us in 2023. So we've got some elements of relief and some elements of costs that are higher. They're no higher than what we estimated at the beginning of this year, but still higher than they were last year.\nTimna Tanners: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC. Please go ahead.\nJohn Tumazos: Thank you for taking my question. Could you give us some color on the February escalation $38 spot moly whether there was some specific shortage, probably there were some high purity customers that had to get the good moly? I noticed that the Spence concentrator began reporting moly output to Cochilco for January and presumably Quebrada Blanca will start in April and May. You were not the source of the supply increase, but maybe you have some insight as to where this -- where else the supply might have rebounded when the price doubled? Thank you.\nKathleen Quirk: John, I'll comment and Mike Kendrick can add to it. But partially, what happened in the first quarter was some of the same supply issues from moly that impacted copper. And the situation in South America, particularly in Peru, did have an impact on supplies. And at the same time, we were seeing some strong growth in demand. So there's extreme tightness in the first quarter and some of that got relieved in Peru when things started to return to more normal operations. We continue to see, as we look forward, demand drivers for moly being positive in the supply side, which will fall a lot like copper is it's just a challenge to bring on new supplies. And many times, as you know, in a copper mine that has byproduct moly when people get into trouble with operating constraints. Copper is the one that people try to maximize and sometimes may moly isn't maximized in those scenarios. But that was, I think, the main thing that occurred from a moly perspective on supply. And Mike, I don't know if you want to add. There's other things that we should add to that.\nMichael Kendrick: No, I think you captured it very well, Kathleen. I mean when you -- I think it really highlights what a tight physical market moly is. And as a result, there's no attenuation when there's a demand need in any given week, and there's not supply available, you can see both rapid increases and rapid decreases through the system. And as to your question on quality, we're a large player in that area and we conduct that business under contract. So most of our high quality material has designated 100% all the time to those products.\nJohn Tumazos: Thank you.\nKathleen Quirk: Thanks, John.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nMichael Dudas: Good morning, Richard and Kathleen.\nKathleen Quirk: Good morning.\nMichael Dudas: As you indicated in your prepared remarks, you talked about observation there years ago. The market was in surpluses or balanced to maybe slight and what you witnessing talking about other and the fact that this consolidation may take attention away from growth capital and to acquisitive capital. What do you think the risk is a year from now that the market is there upside or downside risk towards supply given those dynamics as you work through it over the next 12, 18 months?\nRichard Adkerson: You were breaking up a bit, but you were asking about the supply side risk assessment, right?\nMichael Dudas: Yes, yes.\nRichard Adkerson: So if you go back several years when the projects that are now coming on stream were first announced there were to be massive. There was projected massive surpluses in this calendar year and calendar year '24-'25 and those projects got delayed for different reasons, COVID hit, and they're not having the major surplus situation this year as markets basically balance and looking '24 there's potential services. But there's not new projects of significance coming on stream after that. So I would say that the supply side risk is more -- much more on the downside. We've seen issues related to meeting production, projections being higher for various reasons. The Peru situation and operational issues like we had in Indonesia occurred in other places. So I think for -- if you look back for a long-term history, supplies projections tend to be -- the projections tend to be higher than reality when experience actually happens. And I think that's where we are now. It's -- we have this leaching project, which gives us some upside. But overall, the risk, I think, are more on the downside.\nMichael Dudas: Thank you, Richard.\nRichard Adkerson: Thank you, Michael. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Murphy with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Murphy: Hi. Just a question on the cash flow statement. Non-controlling interest distributions were zero this quarter, which I guess it's happened a few times in the past, but what drives that? And in this case, is it -- should we assume that there's going to be a bit of catch up later in the year?\nKathleen Quirk: The first quarter, we had some significant taxes that was expected. We had some significant taxes that we paid in the first quarter related to the prior year period. And so we did not have distributions in the first quarter as that was used to fund those expenses. But we do expect that you'll see that line item increase throughout the year. We're generating a lot of free cash flow at PT-FI and at Cerro Verde and that those funds will be distributed. So in terms of thinking about it, we do provide some guidance on the impact of non-controlling interest on our net income and the estimates for cash flow are similar to that, maybe a bit lower than the earnings impact, but somewhere in that neighbourhood.\nMatthew Murphy: Okay, That's great. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Orest Wowkodaw with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Orest, may be on mute. Our next question will come from the line of Lawson Winder with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\nLawson Winder: Thank you, operator. Good morning, Kathleen and Richard. Very nice to hear from you. Thank you for fitting in my question. I just wanted to touch on Chile where there's been some positive developments. Is the environment there now improving in the correct direction such that El Abra might look more promising for an expansion? And then could you just also please share your views on the outlook for the regulatory environment there for mining? Thanks so much.\nRichard Adkerson: Well, Lawson, it's still uncertain. And while there were some -- from our perspective, some positive developments that have occurred since this process started, we're still waiting to see where it ends up. There's fiscal issues relating to royalties and taxes. There are also regulatory issues related to water use and other impacts on the environment. And bigger picture is better than it has been, but there's still significant uncertainties that we and other miners will wait to see how they play out.\nKathleen Quirk: We're doing some things now to maintain optionality. We're planning some investments in desalinization which will not only benefit the opportunity for us to extend existing operations, but also give us some ability for the potential mill project. As we talked about earlier, we're doing some work on leaching, and that could continue to evolve our expectations about the design of the new expansion project. So we're keeping options open. We're making some advances to enhance that optionality. But the project at El Abra is very strong. We are in the process of updating our capital cost numbers to reflect what the current environment is. But El Abra has a huge resource. We're talking about potentially increasing production there and you saw the numbers in the press release I mean in our slide presentation. And that project is likely a project that will get done. It's a question of -- it's not if, it's when. And we're working to keep the analysis updated so that -- and move forward with some of these initiatives to put us in a position to move more quickly when we make the decision.\nLawson Winder: Thank you both very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bendik Folden Nyttingnes with Clarksons Platou Securities AS. Please go ahead.\nBendik Folden Nyttingnes: Thank you. Looking at that potential doubling in demand within a 12 to 15 year timeframe, what's your thoughts on taking on one of those large scale resources in some of the more underexplored jurisdictions of the world and bring it forward as a greenfield project? Is that something you're looking at, at all, or will you rather focus your strengthened balance sheet on the organic growth pipeline and potential industry consolidation?\nKathleen Quirk: Richard, I'll take that one. We're really focused on our organic opportunities, then you see the portfolio we have, we're really fortunate to have organic growth that some others not everyone has within our industry. And as we've looked at greenfield opportunities over many years, you haven't seen huge greenfield success. It's rare. It's not -- we're not saying it can't be done, we keep our finger on the pulse of what the availability of greenfield is. But our focus is on our brownfield opportunities, the leach opportunities we had, someone noted earlier that it's a major top line if we can get this leach opportunity to reality. And so our focus is more on the lower risk more certainty around our brownfield opportunities while continuing to monitor what's available in greenfield. We spent a little bit of money on greenfield exploration. But our focus, because of our pipeline and asset profile, is focused more on brownfield.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Chris LaFemina with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nChristopher LaFemina: Hi. Thanks, operator again. So, Kathleen, you mentioned the increases in CapEx guidance relate primarily to early investments in Bagdad for future expansions. I think back in October, Richard had said that investment in growth was on hold because, obviously, the macro environment was not very good. So I'm just wondering, has anything changed in Freeport's view of the world over the last six months? Is it just that China has reopened? Is it because supply issues are getting worse or is there just no change and this was kind of the natural progression for these projects? Thanks.\nKathleen Quirk: Not really any significant change. This really gets to optionality. The work that we're doing on -- the early works, a lot of it relates to tailings infrastructure that we would have to do anyway several years out, but we'd have to do any way to support Bagdad's life of mine plans. And so this is bringing some of that forward, so that if we do decide to move forward with Bagdad, we'll be in a better position to bring it on more quickly. But it doesn't change. We still have the challenges of Bagdad of just not only just economic uncertainties, but the challenges of just housing and people for the project. But this project, the acceleration of the tailings infrastructure will give us options as we go forward. And that's what this is really all about for us is maintaining optionality within our portfolio to be able to, none of this happens overnight, but to potentially move more quickly. And when I say more quickly --\nChristopher LaFemina: Has your view about copper changed?\nRichard Adkerson: But having said that, and without underappreciating the uncertainties in today's world, I would say, for our industry, the economic situation has improved from where it was midyear last year. Throughout this, China's demand for copper in the second half of the year was strong. I believe it was the strongest second half that they've ever experienced. And we're encouraged by the GDP growth in 2023. We recognize the comments about it being driven by consumers and that there's continuing issues. Inflation has improved. And so I think the overall environment has improved in recent months. But as Kathleen said, that's not really what's driving our decisions. The Bagdad project faces worker issue, housing issues. Chile is restrained by continuing political uncertainties. But we're -- we believe all these projects will be needed by the world, they'll be very profitable for our shareholders. And so we're investing in them, planning for them and anticipating that the time will come when we execute on them.\nChristopher LaFemina: Great. Thank you. That's very helpful.\nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC. Please go ahead.\nJohn Tumazos: Thank you. Looking at slide 14, that includes the desalination plant, could you give us a little bit of background on that? It rains a lot, obviously, in Indonesia. Why were freshwater supplies not adequate? Could you have used saltwater for cooling? I'm assuming that most of the water is for cooling and the big smelter? Or is this sort of a community relations thing to not draw upon local water supplies?\nKathleen Quirk: We looked at a number of options, John. This is not of water, and this isn't a big part of the project in terms of capital requirements. We thought this was the best option for reliable water for the project. But Corey I don't know if you want to add anything to that, but that was the thought process, but we did look into a number of options for water and designing the overall configuration.\nCory Stevens: Yes. We looked hard at freshwater options. And when we make a decision around water, we're looking decades out in the future and what the social -- potential social impacts are going to be and what future demands are going to be and the renewability of those sources and came to the conclusion that desalinization was the best route and then you look at the capital cost differences to use saltwater versus desal and this became the most prudent route for us.\nJohn Tumazos: Thank you.\nOperator: I'll now turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks.\nRichard Adkerson: We appreciate your participation and your interest. If you have further questions, contact David Joint, and we'll be happy to respond to them. We look forward to reporting in the future on our progress.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Regina, and good morning. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan conference call. Earlier this morning, we reported our first quarter 2023 operating and financial results and a copy of today's press release and slides are available on our website at fcx.com. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. Like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings. Also on the call today is Richard Adkerson, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Maree Robertson, our CFO; Mark Johnson, our Chief Operating Officer for Indonesia; Josh Olmsted, Chief Operating Officer for the Americas; Mike Kendrick, who leads our Molybdenum Business; Cory Stevens, who leads our Engineering and our Project Development Activities. I'll turn the call over to Richard who will make some opening comments and then we'll come back and review the prepared slide materials and then take your questions. Richard? Thank you, Richard, and I'll start on slide three. You've probably seen, we published our Annual Report and our Sustainability Report today and the reports are available on our website. The theme of this year's Annual Report is The Power of Copper. It highlights the critical role that Freeport and our principal product, copper, play in powering the global economy and the growing uses of copper as the world decarbonize and re-imagines modern infrastructure to support a highly connected world. We're also proud to publish our annual Sustainability Report. We've been reporting on our comprehensive sustainability initiatives for 22 years now and transparency continues to be enhanced. The report summarizes our initiatives, our achievements, and the challenges that we face in managing the safety, social, and environmental aspects of our business, which are critical to our long-term success. We use international standards, best practices, and third-parties, such as The Copper Mark, to measure our performance and responsibility to our stakeholders. We hope you'll have the chance to review this information and engage with us on these topics. We'll turn to slide four, which summarizes our key operating and financial highlights in the first quarter. As previously disclosed, our Grasberg operations were temporarily disrupted in February, following a significant weather impact in our mill area. As Richard said, the team did a great job to safely restore production to normal levels in March. Despite the lower volumes compared with our estimates going into the quarter, our consolidated unit net cash costs were essentially in line with our guidance. Consolidated cost per unit averaged $1.76 per pound in the quarter as higher byproduct credits more than offset the volume impact. As Richard mentioned, notably, even with the disruption, Grasberg unit net cash costs averaged a net credit of $0.08 per pound, meaning, the gold revenues more than offset the cash costs of production. With the return to normal operations in March and a great start in April, we expect our volumes to be strong in the balance of the year. Our margins in the quarter were strong, our EBITDA totaled $2.2 billion in the quarter, operating cash flows, which were net of $500 million use of cash for working capital totaled $1.1 billion. We funded investments during the quarter of $1.1 billion. That included about $400 million for major mining projects and $300 million for the Indonesian smelter, which is being funded from proceeds from financing we raised last year. Excluding net debt associated with the smelter, we ended the quarter with $1.3 billion in net debt. Our balance sheet, liquidity, financial flexibility are in terrific shape. The outlook is positive for free cash flow generation in the balance of the year. The next slide, Richard talked about the challenges we faced in the first quarter and we faced these across our global operations. Our teams executed well in the circumstances. And you can see on the left, the production impact of the weather event at Grasberg in February and the strong recovery in March. In Peru, we and other companies experienced a challenging environment earlier in the year associated with widespread protests, which impacted supply chains and transportation routes. Our team at Cerro Verde did a great job managing the situation efficiently and safely. Situation in Peru has improved in recent weeks and we're now operating at normal rates. In the US, we were challenged with ongoing labor shortages, extreme weather events earlier in the quarter and unplanned maintenance issues. We're working to improve productivity and reliability, working on skills development and pursuing technology and automation initiatives as we aggressively seek to recruit workers with ongoing tight labor market conditions in the US. The leach recovery efforts, which we'll talk more about, really helped to offset some of the shortfalls in mining rates and we're going to continue to build on this. Turning to the markets on slide six. Freeport is well positioned as a leader in the global copper industry. Demand for copper is expected to accelerate going forward with projections for demand to double by 2035. Copper is essential in electrification. Low carbon investments in renewable power and electrification are driving massive growth in demand. In addition, the initiatives by many countries from major infrastructure programs and the uses of copper for connectivity, data, and artificial intelligence are also growing demand drivers. At the same time, the ability of the industry to meet this rising demand is a real challenge. All of us can look back at this time last year when many were projecting the market to move to a surplus in 2023, pointing to the new projects that were coming online. As we look at the situation today, most analysts now project the market to be balanced this year even with the new projects, and longer-term, the projections are for very large deficits. Under this backdrop, we believe prices will need to rise to incentivize new supplies. And at Freeport, we benefit from a large reserve position, as you see on the slide, and an even larger resource position to grow our business in the future. We're strongly positioned to continue to support growing demand and are pursuing several of these initiatives to enhance production going forward. On slide seven, we talk about the molybdenum markets, and as we've discussed, in addition to being a leading copper producer, Freeport is the world's largest molybdenum producer. Last quarter, we spoke about the significant rise in molybdenum from $18 per pound in late 2022 to a high of over $38 per pound in the first quarter of this year. We realized $30 per pound for our molybdenum sales in the first quarter. The price rose sharply beginning in late 2022 in response of supply issues and favorable demand drivers in energy and aerospace sectors. The prices began to drop from the highs in recent weeks, partly related to improved supply. As we look forward, the demand drivers from moly are positive, and since moly is principally produced as a byproduct from copper mines, it's also subject to some of the same supply issues as we have in copper. Current price of moly approximates just over $21 per pound. We're really excited, moving to slide eight, really excited to talk today to give you an update on our leach initiatives, which Richard referred to earlier. Our efforts to increase copper production through enhanced recoveries from our massive leach stockpiles is continuing to gain momentum. Based on our results today, we're gaining increasing confidence in achieving our initial target of 200 million pounds per annum and have begun to model what the next phase could look like. On the left side of the chart, we summarize the various categories that make up the initial 200 million pound target, basically in three buckets. The first is, relates to heat, increasing temperatures within the stockpiles. The second is an initiative we call Leach Everywhere, which is focused on making sure the entire stockpile has the benefit of the liquid solution we use to leach copper. And the third category, which is really important, it involves data analytics using new data available through sensors used in a variety of ways, including optimizing the amount of solution use and the rate of application we use to achieve the best results. It's been proven that increasing heat in the stockpiles enhances recoveries. We've advanced the installation of covers on our stockpiles for heat retention and we've mechanized the process and that's allowed us to execute more efficiently. We now have over 30% of our massive stockpiles covered. These initiatives provide 30% of the targeted increase. The Leach Everywhere initiative makes up 50% of the uplift and uses targeted drilling to improve flow of the solution that may not be getting through the stockpile. We're also drilling injection wells to add the liquid solution to lower stockpile sections. The sensors we've installed and access to other technology used in oil and gas formations are providing new information on where additional leach solution would stimulate the process and support higher production. The data analytics works is providing new insights. We really haven't had the benefit of this in the past, and we're now able to get the benefit to determine the optimal operating protocols under various conditions of the stockpiles. The initial success of these initiatives adds production at low incremental cost and a low carbon footprint. In parallel with our initial activities, we've been doing substantial work on the drivers to stimulate leach production and have modeled results on what the next phase of initiatives could yield. We see an opportunity to add an additional 600 million pounds per annum from these initiatives, which would provide a total of 800 million pounds per year. That's the size of a major new mine without the capital intensity and a very low incremental operating cost. The three areas of focus are highlighted in the center of the slide and we're in various stages of development on each of these initiatives. We've got a lot of work to do to advance these initiatives and some of this requires further innovation, but we have a clear path to success in this program. We're evaluating opportunities to increase the temperature further by heating the liquid solution before application on the stockpile. We're evaluating options to do this using solar generated power, geothermal or other renewable sources at our mine sites to accomplish the additional heat requirement. We're also testing various additives that we're developing both internally as well as from third-party initiatives. And we're using artificial intelligence in our journey and in our evaluations to help expedite the process. We're also evaluating options to inject air into the stockpiles in areas that are not getting enough oxygen. Again, we have much more knowledge of what is going on within the stockpiles and are working to design solutions to restimulate copper production. Freeport is in an exceptionally strong position to lead the industry in this area with massive stockpiles currently under leach, ongoing mine leach, mine for leach activities and the latent tank house capacity that we have. This will be part of our growth plans as we go forward in addition to the organic growth that we have to develop new copper in traditional ways. And slide nine highlights the growth and development outlook. And as we look at growing copper demand and the limitations and risks and actionable greenfield project development, our strategy and development priorities are focused on extensions of our existing operations and our portfolio of brownfield opportunities. On slide nine, we show our near-term, medium-term and longer-term development options. Following the significant growth in recent years achieved through the successful Grasberg development, we're focused on advancing to next phases. In the near-term, we see the best options for growth and achieving our initial leach targets and actions to enhance productivity and reliability in our US operations. If we can get our mining rates up in the US, which we're working on, and hit our targets for asset efficiency and reliability, we have the opportunity to add an additional 200 million pounds per year with limited capital investment. In the medium-term, we've outlined a series of initiatives. The first includes the second phase of our leach project. We're also looking to expand our Bagdad mine in Arizona and expect to complete feasibility studies this year. We have a major opportunity in Chile at our El Abra project and we already have an existing operation and looking to expand it significantly. And we're in the process of developing a new 90,000 ton per day block cave mine in Indonesia called Kucing Liar, which is currently in progress and expected to commence initial production by the end of the decade. At Bagdad, we're making some investments, which are included in our new capital expenditure guidance to conduct early works in the tailings area to enhance optionality to move more quickly with the mill expansion project, following completion of the feasibility study. Longer-term and we're already working on these projects, as they require long lead times, we expect we'll have the opportunity for further major expansion in the Safford/Lone Star district where we have identified significant resource and we have a series of US brownfield projects that can be pursued. In Indonesia, Richard talked about the extension discussions we're having and the extension of our operating rights beyond 2041 would open the door for continuation of large scale mining and potential additional development options in one of the world's largest and highest grade copper and gold mining districts. We're in an outstanding position to continue our leadership role in supplying copper to a world with growing requirements. We're going to continue to be disciplined in our approach and focused on executing projects where we can create value for shareholders. On slide 10, we provide an update of our three-year outlook for sales volumes. We've updated the 2023 sales guidance to take into account the first quarter disruption and the impact of lower mining rates in the US. Despite the disruption at Grasberg in February, our gold volumes for 2023 are about 3% higher than prior estimates. We've incorporated the estimates for stronger gold recoveries than in our January forecast, and we're doing really well in that regard. The guidance for 2024 and 2025 is unchanged. But with continued success in our leach efforts, we have some upside to these estimates. On slide 11, we show, moving to cost, we show a comparison of our prior unit net cash cost guidance for 2023 compared to our current estimate. We currently estimate unit cash cost to average $1.55 per pound for 2023, that's slightly lower than our January estimate of $1.60 per pound. The impact of the lower -- copper volumes is offset by higher byproduct credits and a reduction in export duties in Indonesia associated with our smelter construction progress. Our assumptions for the key commodity based input costs are similar to the January estimates. We're starting to experience less inflationary pressures in certain areas than in 2022, particularly for energy, while labor cost, services and equipment components have increased. In the reference slides on page 23, you'll note an approximate 7% increase in site production and delivery costs for our US mines compared with prior estimates. This largely reflects a reduction in volumes in the US associated with the challenges we discussed earlier. And we've got ongoing initiatives to improve productivity there. Moving to our cash flows. On slide 12, we show modeled results for EBITDA and cash flow at various copper prices ranging from $4 per pound of copper to $5 per pound of copper. These are modeled results for 2024 and 2025 with our current volume estimates and our cost estimates and we hold gold flat at $2,000 and molybdenum flat at $18 per pound in these models. Our annual EBITDA under these scenarios would range from over $10.5 billion per annum at $4 copper to $15 billion per annum at $5 copper. And operating cash flows would range from $7.5 billion per year at $4 copper to $11 billion per year at $5 copper. We show some sensitivities to the various commodities on the right. And with our long-term long-life reserves and large-scale production, we're really in a position to benefit from future metals intensive growth trends and the prospects for increasing cash flows and cash returns under our performance-based pay-out framework. On slide 13, we provide an update to our capital expenditures. Current forecast and these exclude the Indonesian smelter project, which is being funded with cash that we released last year in a bond offering. But our current forecast for 2023 totals $3.5 billion. That's up from the prior estimate of $3.4 billion and capital expenditures for 2024 are currently forecast to approximately $3.3 billion. The change from our prior guidance principally reflects investments we're planning at Bagdad to jump start early works to support optionality for future expansion. The bad debt investments or projects that we categorize as discretionary and do not reduce the cash available for distribution under our pay-out policy as they will be funded with the remaining 50% of free cash flow retained for growth projects. On slide 14, we got some great pictures showing the construction of our new smelter in Indonesia. This is a major undertaking for us. It's impressive and it will be on a world-class scale. The project will become the world's largest single-line flash copper smelting facility and it's advancing rapidly. We expect to commission the project in 2024. The project will include a precious metals processing facility and an expansion of the existing nearby smelter and it will align with Indonesia's downstream policy and enable PT-FI to process all of its concentrates domestically. In closing, on slide 15, we summarize our financial policy, which is centered around three priorities with the cornerstone being a strong balance sheet and we've achieved that. Our balance sheet and liquidity are strong and provide significant financial flexibility for the future. We're executing the performance-based pay-out policy, which provides for 50% of our free cash flow to be allocated to shareholder returns in the form of dividends and share purchases and the balance available to invest in our projects. We'll continue to pay a base dividend and a variable dividend at a combined annual rate of $0.60 per share. And since commencing the performance-based pay-out policy in 2021, we've returned about 60% of our free cash flow to shareholders and it further strengthened our balance sheet along the way, providing capacity for funding new projects over time. We did not purchase shares in the first quarter, but have availability under our share purchase authorization to conduct purchases, pursuant to the policy and we have a positive outlook for substantial free cash flow generation in the future depending on prices and other factors. The three priorities of balance sheet strength, allocating cash flow to a mix of shareholder returns and organic growth, we believe will enhance long-term value for the benefit of our shareholders. Our global team is energized. We're motivated to continue building value in our business and we're executing our plans responsibly, safely and efficiently. Thanks for your attention and we'll now take your questions. Emily, it's Kathleen, and I'll let Cory Stevens fill in on this because he's leading the efforts. But in terms of the additional 600 million pounds, a portion of it could be through these additives, but it's important to note that the additives that we're pursuing are both internal and through third-parties. And we've got a trial going on with a relatively small stockpile at Bagdad with Jetti. And we've got some new initiatives going on with Jetti at El Abra. But the bulk of what we're outlining here is initiatives that we can pursue on our own there. It's really not -- there's a lot of innovation involved and technology involved, but it's not rocket science. And the sensors and data that we have now is pointing us to where the issues are, where is the solution not getting through the stockpile, where is the stockpile not getting oxygen to it. So these things can add -- once we identify the problem, we, as an industry, can fix -- can find a solution. And at Freeport, we have such big stockpiles. That's why we have such a big opportunity here. So the bulk of what we're talking about, the opportunity we're talking about is largely at Morenci. Morenci is -- you see -- you look at our 38 billion pounds and look at the percentage of Morenci and that's where the bulk of the opportunity is. But if we are successful with this, potentially at El Abra, it might, we don't know yet, but it might compete with traditional mill technology. But we're really looking at what's available now through third-parties, but our initiative and our objective is to find a way to solve this on our own because that's the best way to maximize the yields for Freeport. But, Cory, do you want to add anything to those comments? I'll just point out that our IUPK that we entered into that Richard referred to in 2018 allows us to continue exports through -- at that point contemplated December 2023. And that has some force majeure provisions, which clearly the delays that we've experienced related to COVID and supply chains are force majeure. So our IUPK allows us to do it, but we need to get the approval from the government to put in this regulation after the IUPK was signed to restrict exports in a broad range and it's not defined which minerals they're trying to achieve. But we're working with the government. We are keeping them informed and they're visiting our copper smelter site. They're very impressed with the progress that we've made. Unfortunately, it's not going to be finished. It will be -- the construction will be substantially complete by the end of this year, but it won't be completely finished. And so we'll need the ability to continue to export. And importantly with the alignment we now have with the government ownership, it's very important for the government revenues as well for exports to continue. So we're going to continue to work on it. We don't have the extension beyond June yet, but we do expect to get it. Brian, we have latent tank house capacity across the business of about 1 billion pounds a year. And it's in different places. But that is what makes this so compelling is that there really isn't a lot of incremental capital involved in these initiatives. So historical leach production, you go back decades, has declined over time. And we're just having a resurgence of what it once was. And this new data available to us that's telling us what's going on within the stockpiles is providing us with a road map to kind of have a renaissance of the prior leach production. So if need be, we could invest in new tank house capacity, but the low hanging fruit is, we've got latent tank house capacity at many of these sites. So we're really approaching this across the footprint. But the highest impact is to-date has been at Morenci. And that will likely be the lion's share of where we get additional pounds. But we have opportunities across the footprint. We also have inactive operations and active leach stockpiles that we can look to in the future. But the first -- the lowest hanging fruit and the highest value is in places where we're already leaching. But, Brian, it's basically getting our mining rates up and also getting our plant and processing to reliability standards consistent with what we've experienced in the past. So some of the experience levels have impacted us for the reasons Richard just talked about. But this is -- these are things -- these are self-help items and we've already got efforts underway to work on it and a game plan for how we're working on, but it's an opportunity that we don't need to go do a major project to go get. And so, again, the leach initiative, the initial leach initiative and this self-help work that we're doing is some of the highest value opportunities we have in the near-term. Yes. Hi, Timna. And Timna, you can look at slide 26, and that has our quarterly sales volumes for the balance of the year. The first quarter was impacted by these disruptions, but also we had the conversion to tolling in Indonesia, which we had projected going into the quarter. But you can see where we expected to be -- where we expect to be on a run rate for the balance of this year. And you can see very, very strong recovery from first quarter in the balance of 2023. Well, the first quarter, we had $1.76, and we're projecting for the year to average $1.55. So our cost -- unit cost in the balance of the year will be less than they were in the first quarter. We talked about some of the inflationary items easing from last year and that's principally energy. We saw the big spike in energy starting around this time last year. And some of the other input costs that were exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine situation. Some of those things have declined in East and so that's that is helpful. But we still have labor or services costs that were contracted for some of our components, equipment components, all those things are still with us in 2023. So we've got some elements of relief and some elements of costs that are higher. They're no higher than what we estimated at the beginning of this year, but still higher than they were last year. John, I'll comment and Mike Kendrick can add to it. But partially, what happened in the first quarter was some of the same supply issues from moly that impacted copper. And the situation in South America, particularly in Peru, did have an impact on supplies. And at the same time, we were seeing some strong growth in demand. So there's extreme tightness in the first quarter and some of that got relieved in Peru when things started to return to more normal operations. We continue to see, as we look forward, demand drivers for moly being positive in the supply side, which will fall a lot like copper is it's just a challenge to bring on new supplies. And many times, as you know, in a copper mine that has byproduct moly when people get into trouble with operating constraints. Copper is the one that people try to maximize and sometimes may moly isn't maximized in those scenarios. But that was, I think, the main thing that occurred from a moly perspective on supply. And Mike, I don't know if you want to add. There's other things that we should add to that. Thanks, John. Good morning. The first quarter, we had some significant taxes that was expected. We had some significant taxes that we paid in the first quarter related to the prior year period. And so we did not have distributions in the first quarter as that was used to fund those expenses. But we do expect that you'll see that line item increase throughout the year. We're generating a lot of free cash flow at PT-FI and at Cerro Verde and that those funds will be distributed. So in terms of thinking about it, we do provide some guidance on the impact of non-controlling interest on our net income and the estimates for cash flow are similar to that, maybe a bit lower than the earnings impact, but somewhere in that neighbourhood. We're doing some things now to maintain optionality. We're planning some investments in desalinization which will not only benefit the opportunity for us to extend existing operations, but also give us some ability for the potential mill project. As we talked about earlier, we're doing some work on leaching, and that could continue to evolve our expectations about the design of the new expansion project. So we're keeping options open. We're making some advances to enhance that optionality. But the project at El Abra is very strong. We are in the process of updating our capital cost numbers to reflect what the current environment is. But El Abra has a huge resource. We're talking about potentially increasing production there and you saw the numbers in the press release I mean in our slide presentation. And that project is likely a project that will get done. It's a question of -- it's not if, it's when. And we're working to keep the analysis updated so that -- and move forward with some of these initiatives to put us in a position to move more quickly when we make the decision. Richard, I'll take that one. We're really focused on our organic opportunities, then you see the portfolio we have, we're really fortunate to have organic growth that some others not everyone has within our industry. And as we've looked at greenfield opportunities over many years, you haven't seen huge greenfield success. It's rare. It's not -- we're not saying it can't be done, we keep our finger on the pulse of what the availability of greenfield is. But our focus is on our brownfield opportunities, the leach opportunities we had, someone noted earlier that it's a major top line if we can get this leach opportunity to reality. And so our focus is more on the lower risk more certainty around our brownfield opportunities while continuing to monitor what's available in greenfield. We spent a little bit of money on greenfield exploration. But our focus, because of our pipeline and asset profile, is focused more on brownfield. Not really any significant change. This really gets to optionality. The work that we're doing on -- the early works, a lot of it relates to tailings infrastructure that we would have to do anyway several years out, but we'd have to do any way to support Bagdad's life of mine plans. And so this is bringing some of that forward, so that if we do decide to move forward with Bagdad, we'll be in a better position to bring it on more quickly. But it doesn't change. We still have the challenges of Bagdad of just not only just economic uncertainties, but the challenges of just housing and people for the project. But this project, the acceleration of the tailings infrastructure will give us options as we go forward. And that's what this is really all about for us is maintaining optionality within our portfolio to be able to, none of this happens overnight, but to potentially move more quickly. And when I say more quickly -- We looked at a number of options, John. This is not of water, and this isn't a big part of the project in terms of capital requirements. We thought this was the best option for reliable water for the project. But Corey I don't know if you want to add anything to that, but that was the thought process, but we did look into a number of options for water and designing the overall configuration."

            "name": "Richard Adkerson",
            "content": "Thank you, Kathleen, and thank you all for joining us. Kathleen will review the results of the quarter and our outlook and I'll join our team in responding to your questions. I'm pleased with our global team's responses to challenges we faced in the first quarter. You all know, mining is a tough business, that's evidenced by the recent reports throughout the industry. Who you are in our industry is defined by your responses to challenges. I'm very proud of who we are at Freeport. Our team in Indonesia, once again, proved resilient in overcoming a major flood event. Now, we're accustomed to dealing with rainfall at Grasberg. It's located high in the mountains of New Guinea, one of the wettest places on the globe. We just celebrated our 56th anniversary of operating there. Our systems are designed to handle significant rainfall. The intensity of the event we experienced in January was unusually severe. Our established systems prevented major damages. Our team bounced back quickly by taking immediate actions to restore production and mitigate future risk and we have a great start in the second quarter with operations there. Kathleen and I have made a series of trips to Indonesia in recent months. For me, it's personally gratifying to experience the markedly more positive attitudes there about Freeport than in years past. All this resulted from the partnership we established with the government in 2018, the success we have achieved in the multi-year large scale development of our underground operations, and the positive outlook for copper in the future. Grasberg has now returned to rank as the world's second largest copper mine. Our net cash cost of production at Grasberg in the first quarter was a negative $0.08 per pound. We're now working positively with the government to extend PT-FI's operating rights beyond 2041 in a way that benefits all stakeholders. At Cerro Verde, our team negotiated through a volatile period of political turmoil in Peru. Our team rallied around the community and our workforce to handle the situation in a remarkable fashion. Our US team is stepping up to overcome the challenges associated with labor availability in the United States. We appreciate the commitment and drive of the global Freeport team to reach our gold in challenging circumstances. Copper markets continue to be supported by low levels of inventories, China's accelerating economic recovery, and the ongoing positive global demand drivers for copper. Our customers continue to buy all the copper we can produce and seek more. As we move forward, copper miners will be required to expand production to meet demand. At Freeport, we're in a strong position to develop new sources of copper supply to grow our business from our vast brownfield resources and also to grow our business from the rapidly developing leach technology and the supporting data analytics. At Freeport, we benefit from strong franchises and support from communities where we operate. We are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet. We have an exemplary track record for success and project and operations execution. Focused execution is the backbone of our culture at Freeport. We have a clearly defined strategy and a relentless drive for achieving long-term success. And Kathleen will now review our slides. Thanks, Chris. As you know well for a long time now, I've been saying that consolidation would come to our industry. It's inevitable because of the challenges in developing projects. And it's not just a price issue, it's really just the availability of actionable projects for companies to pursue and companies in our industry that are diversified companies have had copper at the top of their strategic list for a long time. It's notable of the overall lack of success in developing new projects. There have been a few, of course. So all those things come together and lead to what we're seeing going on right now with M&A activity. Now for us, we don't have a strategy of growing through M&A. We are focused on our large-scale inventory of reserves and resources that Kathleen described. And but that does not mean that we would not take advantage of opportunities that may arise. So we're not defining regions or any other criteria. We would only do something if it was clearly something that was value enhancing for our shareholders. So we're not in a position of looking for things to do. But now with our company having made such great progress in strengthening our balance sheet, completing the major underground conversion at Grasberg and advancing on all fronts, we would be in a position if an opportunity arises, but it would only be in that case. Yes. Thanks, Carlos. It's all of these things are happening in parallel with each other. To get the contract extension approved and there's widespread support for it within the government, requires some procedural actions to deal with existing government regulations and then also to amend the IUPK that we were granted in December of 2018, that would be a fairly simple process. So we are really encouraged by it. The June date, it has to do with this broader issue the country is pursuing with downstreaming for minerals broadly. And so that's why that was there. We don't anticipate that will be something that would limit our ability to continue operations beyond June. Anything more, Carlos, to be specific on it. And Kathleen is right that we have these legal rights that are documented, but I want to emphasize, we're working cooperatively with the government and not just pushing our legal rights and we're getting a good response from it. The government will decide really how to document it. There is a path forward for it to be done without formally going through new legislation. We do benefit now by having strong support within the parliament of Indonesia, who visited our operations, the parliamentary group overseeing mining came to the US and visited us here. So I just want to emphasize the whole tone has changed. The President visited our operations in late August, early September and it was a very positive. One of the highlights of my career there in Indonesia was his visits and we're building off of this to find the right way forward and do it in a way that everybody wins from it. The government would win, the local community, the workforce, suppliers to our business. So that's how we're working together to see how can we go forward and makes nobody benefits from us having any kind of drop dead date on operations there. It would really be hard to envision. And this 2041 date was in our original 1991 contract of work was carried forward in the 2018 IUPK and we actually have not done significant delineation drilling to see the extent of the resource beyond what's been necessary to fill up the production profile through 2041. And yet, in doing that, we have a very substantial resource beyond that already identified. But I'm really excited about the opportunity to go in and drill to see -- in the 30-plus year history of Grasberg, it always has gotten bigger over time. And I'm confident as we do more drilling, it will continue to be, to grow and be bigger just because of the nature of the ore system there and the grades that are available to us, it's really exciting. And so that's what we want to achieve with the government is to get the extension granted then undertake an active program of delineation. We only report reserves through 2041 and this would give us a chance to develop reserves beyond that date and to develop -- and to come up with plans for developing those reserves for future growth. It's just a great long-term asset as a base for our company for its future. Okay. Thank you for your question. Yes. Morenci is the world's largest leaching operation today, and it was where much of the modern leaching technology was originally developed decades ago. So I just wish I could have a good way of conveying the excitement of our team working on this. It's really fun to see. We're leaching everywhere and we're going to leach to the last drop. So it's -- and the benefits are just -- no permitting to do this kind of stuff. There's very little capital -- tank house capital, if it's necessary, is not significant in the bigger picture of things. And the climate -- the carbon emissions are -- so it's a winner on every respect, and that's why we're working cooperatively with other companies and with Jetti and focusing on what we can do on our own because we do it on our own, we capture all the economics for our shareholders. So it's a multifaceted deal and like I said it's really a lot of fun. It's injected a level of enthusiasm into our whole organization that's really fun to see. Well, it's not limited to the mining industry. Certainly, it's not restraining us with our efforts to advance leaching. But it's an issue that -- as I talk with other CEOs in the business roundtable, everywhere people are experiencing it. Some of it grew out of COVID in the way people are approaching life work styles as they go forward, but it's a real issue for us, and we're attacking it by aggressively recruiting for people, but also its spurring our efforts to see what can we do with technology to make our business less labor intensive. But it is a real issue in the US, not in Peru, Chile, Indonesia, but it's just a significant matter in the US. Kathleen, I'll start by just making a comment about Peru. There are different issues in different parts of the country of Peru. And the -- and our operations is located just off the outskirts of the city of Arequipa, in the Arequipa region. And while there were protests there, they weren't as large as a protest in other areas. And we did have some disruptions of personnel movement and supplies for a period of time. And in our region, it has improved. The issues have not been resolved in the country. And so that remains there as an ongoing risk. But as you look at this trajectory issue, I think, it's important to look at individual regions and see what's going on there and not assume that because we made such improvement that that's carried forward to the same extent in other regions. So it's complicated. This whole business is complicated, but that Peru is very complicated. You were breaking up a bit, but you were asking about the supply side risk assessment, right? So if you go back several years when the projects that are now coming on stream were first announced there were to be massive. There was projected massive surpluses in this calendar year and calendar year '24-'25 and those projects got delayed for different reasons, COVID hit, and they're not having the major surplus situation this year as markets basically balance and looking '24 there's potential services. But there's not new projects of significance coming on stream after that. So I would say that the supply side risk is more -- much more on the downside. We've seen issues related to meeting production, projections being higher for various reasons. The Peru situation and operational issues like we had in Indonesia occurred in other places. So I think for -- if you look back for a long-term history, supplies projections tend to be -- the projections tend to be higher than reality when experience actually happens. And I think that's where we are now. It's -- we have this leaching project, which gives us some upside. But overall, the risk, I think, are more on the downside. Thank you, Michael. Appreciate it. Well, Lawson, it's still uncertain. And while there were some -- from our perspective, some positive developments that have occurred since this process started, we're still waiting to see where it ends up. There's fiscal issues relating to royalties and taxes. There are also regulatory issues related to water use and other impacts on the environment. And bigger picture is better than it has been, but there's still significant uncertainties that we and other miners will wait to see how they play out. But having said that, and without underappreciating the uncertainties in today's world, I would say, for our industry, the economic situation has improved from where it was midyear last year. Throughout this, China's demand for copper in the second half of the year was strong. I believe it was the strongest second half that they've ever experienced. And we're encouraged by the GDP growth in 2023. We recognize the comments about it being driven by consumers and that there's continuing issues. Inflation has improved. And so I think the overall environment has improved in recent months. But as Kathleen said, that's not really what's driving our decisions. The Bagdad project faces worker issue, housing issues. Chile is restrained by continuing political uncertainties. But we're -- we believe all these projects will be needed by the world, they'll be very profitable for our shareholders. And so we're investing in them, planning for them and anticipating that the time will come when we execute on them. We appreciate your participation and your interest. If you have further questions, contact David Joint, and we'll be happy to respond to them. We look forward to reporting in the future on our progress."

Richard will make some opening remarks, Kathleen will review our slide materials, and then we'll open up the call for questions. Richard?\nRichard Adkerson: Thanks, David. Thanks everyone for joining us. It was a solid quarter as you can see and that's the result of the good work that our global Freeport team has accomplished and really proud of them and look forward to the future. We've got great outlook for our company, great outlook long term for our copper and commodity that we base our strategy on. So Kathleen will review with you the results of the quarter and talk about it, and we're making progress with this fire we had at our new smelter in Indonesia and we'll review that as well. We have a new president in Indonesia, Prabowo Subianto. When Prabowo was General three decades ago, we worked together closely on issues affecting our operations in Papua. He knows our business. He's appointed cabinet, which includes a number of cabinet members from Joko Widodo\u2019s cabinet and other people that we've known over the years. We look forward to working with him and believe his understanding of our business and of our location in Papua will be a big benefit as we work with this administration going forward. Kathleen, I'll turn the call over to you to review our results and our outlook.\nKathleen Quirk: Okay, great. Thank you, Richard. And I'm going to start on our slide presentation, starting on Slide 3 with our highlights for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024. Our team continues to deliver on our operating plans and pursue value through enhancing efficiencies, managing costs aggressively and building value in our organic growth portfolio. You'll see here we generated strong margins and cash flows during the quarter with $2.7 billion in EBITDA and $1.9 billion in operating cash flows. Our operating performance was supported by sales volumes exceeding guidance for both copper and gold and favorable unit cash cost performance compared to both our guidance and the year ago quarter. We're focused on initiatives to build value from organic growth. At Freeport, we benefit from a large reserve and resource position with near term, medium term and longer term embedded growth options. The high potential innovative leach technologies are delivering results and we've several ongoing initiatives to add scale and low cost copper volumes in our Americas business. In the first nine months of 2024, the incremental copper production from our leach initiative was nearly 70% higher than the comparable period last year, and we have additional projects underway to build scale and improve on our US cost position. We're also advancing our brownfield expansion opportunities position the business for long term growth to supply a market with increased requirements for copper. During the third quarter, we purchased 5.3 million shares of Cerro Verde in at market transactions on the Peruvian Stock Exchange at a cost of $210 million and that allowed us to increase our ownership in this highly attractive asset from the prior level of 53.6% to 55%. The public flow of Cerro verde now represents about 4.3% of the outstanding shares. We ended the quarter in a strong position financially. And as we look forward, we're very optimistic about the markets we serve, our portfolio of high quality copper assets and the future prospects for strong cash flow generation to support investments and value enhancing projects and returns to shareholders. We'll talk about markets on Slide 4. Copper prices again during the third quarter traded in a broad range. On the LME, they range between 3.91 and 4.47 per pound. And on the COMEX exchange range from 3.94 per pound to 4.66 per pound. The settlement prices on the LME for the quarter averaged $4.18 per pound. As we look at the quarter and where prices traded, they largely followed macro sentiment, which weighed global economic data and economic pressures in China against actions by the Fed and other central banks to cut interest rates and the potential for large economic stimulus in China. At the micro level, we continue to see secular demand trends associated with electrification, providing strong demand for copper and offsetting the impact of a cyclical slowdown. In the US, our customers continue to report strong demand for power cable and building wire associated with substantial investment in electrical infrastructure and AI data centers. This growing sector more than offset weakness in traditional demand sectors in residential construction and autos. Demand from China continues to be supported by significant investments in the electrical grid and continued growth in China's production of electric vehicles. Notably, China's demand for copper continues to grow despite a weak property sector. Recent announcements for economic stimulus in China to support the country's economic growth targets could provide further support for metals demand as we move through 2024 and into 2025. As we've discussed in the past, Copper is a foundational metal and a key component of electrification. It's physical characteristics and superior connectivity make it essential to electrification. New massive investment in the power grid, renewable generation, technology infrastructure and transportation are driving increased demand for copper and forecast call for above trend growth and demand for the foreseeable future. As we look at these fundamentals of demand and match it up with supply, we continue to see a tightly balanced market in the near term and deficit conditions longer run. This is going to require new investments and innovative technologies to build supplies longer term and at Freeport, we\u2019ve driven supply of copper reliably and responsibly to a growing market. With our leading industry position, our large scale current operations and our future growth pipeline, we're well positioned to benefit from this fundamental outlook for copper. I remind everyone that in addition to copper, we're also a major gold producer and are benefiting from increasing gold prices. We'll turn to operations on Slide 5, where we summarize the quarterly operating results by geographic region. In the US, we are continuing to take actions to improve efficiencies and cost performance to mitigate the impact of lower grades. We have more work to do but recent trends are improving. We're closely monitoring key performance indicators and seeing positive trends in recent months in asset efficiency associated with key areas of loading, hauling, crushing and stacking. Our equipment reliability is a focus area and we're making strides in reducing unplanned downtime. We're also rationalizing the use of contractors to reduce costs and allocating internal resources to our key focus areas. In addition, success in our leaching initiative and further scaling incremental low cost production will also drive reductions in our cost structure. In South America, the team at the Cerro Verde operation posted another solid quarter. Mill throughput exceeded 420,000 metric tons of ore per day during the quarter and our mill recovery improved from last year's third quarter. Our unit net cash costs were slightly less than last year's third quarter after excluding the $0.12 per pound nonrecurring charge in the quarter for a new labor agreement. After reaching agreement with Cerro Verde's second union, we now have multiyear labor agreements covering Cerro Verde's hourly workforce. Mentioned earlier we purchased additional Cerro Verde shares that gives us more exposure to this established long lived and high quality assets. In Indonesia, results were quite strong and that's evidenced by a unit net cash credit of $0.71 per pound. The team is consistently delivering strong volumes of both copper and gold from our large scale underground ore bodies. Our sales in the quarter were higher than our estimates going into the period with increased mill rates and oil grades. We also benefited from strong gold sales in the quarter, reflecting good production performance and a reduction in inventory from June 30th levels. Our near term focus areas include continued strong execution of our operating plans, commissioning of a value driven copper cleaning circuit at our site in Papua to support strong mill recoveries and commissioning the precious metals refinery. We're also working to restore smelter operations following the recent smelter fire event, which we'll talk about more on the next slide. Just an update on where we are with the smelter. We made good progress during the third quarter on our commissioning and start-up. This is a project that our team managed construction in a challenging market in a very effective manner. But we did experience a setback last week on October 14th from a fire incident in a gas cleaning facility used in the sulfuric acid production process. Our safety protocols were effective and the fire was extinguished in a short period of time without injury to our personnel. Start-up activities have been temporarily suspended as a result while we conduct damage and root cause assessments and develop our recovery plans. We've presented a picture on the slide that you can review. But as you can see, the incident affected a relatively small area of the overall project. We have teams actively engaged in planning the repairs and assessing lead times for replacement equipment. We expect that the repair cost will be covered by our insurance programs and we're also working with the Indonesian government on continuity of concentrate exports during the outage. Our mining operations in Papua have not been impacted and our team is focused on restoring smelter operations safely and expeditiously. We look forward to achieving our objective of being a fully integrated producer in Indonesia, which positions us to secure a long term extension of our operating rights there. Really continue to be very excited about our innovative leach initiative. On Slide 7, you can see that early results continue to indicate significant value potential. Just a reminder, we achieved our initial targeted run rate of 200 million pounds per annum of copper per annum at the end of last year and are now driving initiatives to scale this initiative to 300 million to 400 million pounds per annum in the next couple of years. Ultimately, our goal was to achieve 800 million pounds per annum from this value enhancing growth initiative. This is the size of a major new mine with low capital investment required, low incremental operating costs and that will significantly enhance the value and competitive position of our Americas production. You can see on the slide, the significant growth in incremental volumes from these initiatives over the last several quarters, our results have been achieved by enhancing heat retention in the leach stockpiles using data from sensors and analytics to identify targets and through deploying new operational tactics to direct solution injection to areas that were previously inaccessible. We continue to build confidence in boosting the run rate to 300 million to 400 million pounds per year during 2026. Some of the examples of the initiatives that are now underway that will add volumes in the future include expanding our surface area under leach by using helicopters to install irrigation in areas previously inaccessible under conventional techniques and by scaling our targeted solution injection wells. We're making great progress on our leach injection technology, great progress on our drilling. We're drilling much more efficiently and we're able to increase the rate of well development. In parallel, we're also advancing innovation driven initiatives which would support our ultimate objective of reaching 800 million pounds per annum. We believe there's significant opportunity from increasing heat to the stockpiles. We're looking at adding heat to the leach solution using external energy or using pyrite hosted ores to generate additional heat. Heat is a proven source to improve recoveries in this type of application. We're also continuing to advance testing of new additives at scale and we look forward to reporting to you on our progress on these initiatives. At Freeport, we're really well positioned to capture the value of this opportunity with an extensive inventory of substantial residual copper from material already mined, an industry leading technical team with expertise in leaching technology and a strong multi-disciplined innovation team dedicated to this initiative. We've got additional opportunities for growth beyond the leach opportunity, and you can see that on Slide 8, where we list our organic growth projects. All of these projects are brownfield opportunities where we're leveraging existing assets and established operations. The leach initiative that we just talked about is our best opportunity to grow in the near term and we're pursuing this initiative very aggressively. In the US, we also have opportunities for expansion at our Bagdad and Safford Lone Star operations. And at Bagdad, we're advancing investments in automation, tailings and energy infrastructure and expanded employee housing in this remote location to position us to execute the project more efficiently when the time is right. We don't have major permitting hurdles and this is really a straightforward option. We're monitoring conditions and progress with our derisking initiatives and continue to expect to be in a position to make a decision next year on the expansion plans. In the Safford Lone Star District where we have a very large resource, we're engaged in studies to define a brownfield expansion. We're targeting opportunities to more than double current production levels, which are currently around 300 million pounds per annum. The large resource that we have at this location, it gives us an opportunity for Safford Lone Star to become a generational cornerstone asset for Freeport and Arizona in the next decade. At El Abra in Chile, this is our partnership with Codelco, as we previously reported, we completed pre-feasibility studies and we're in the process of preparing an environmental impact statement which we expect to be completed by the end of next year. The project involves investment in a new concentrator of scale similar to the size of Cerro Verde that we installed nearly 10 years ago, investments in the desalinization and pipeline system to support our water requirements. This project is large. It would provide 750 million pounds of annual copper production and 9 million pounds of annual molybdenum production. It's a long lead project. It would require something on the order of seven to eight years because of the time frame for permitting in Chile. And we're going to continue to review economics in the context of market conditions but we believe this is a project that will be required in the future to support long term copper demand trends, and this is a project in our portfolio that Freeport can execute. In Indonesia, we continue to progress our large scale Kucing Liar development. This is a very large ore body adjacent to our existing operations, our existing ore bodies in Papua. We expect to commence production by 2030. We're also conducting exploration below our Deep MLZ ore body. We're getting encouraging results. We expect that an extension of our operating rights in Indonesia beyond 2041 will set us up for additional long term development options in this highly attractive district. By pursuing all of these initiatives and advancing them, we're really focused on building optionality for future growth. We're going to continue to be disciplined in our approach and focused on targeting opportunities that can be executed over time that enhance long term value. Our Slide 9 shows our three year outlook, which we show every quarter and keep updated. This is the outlook for sales of copper, gold and molybdenum and that you'll see the sales guidance is very similar to our previous outlook. We also have updated our estimates for our unit net cash cost. We expect our average for 2024 to approximate $1.58 per pound. That is below our July estimate of $1.63 per pound and similar to our guidance at the start of the year of $1.60 per pound. We've got some details of this information by region on Slide 19 and the reference materials. So as we move to cash flows, margins and cash flows and putting together our projected volumes and cost projections on Slide 9 -- Slide 10, we show modeled results for EBITDA and cash flow at various copper prices ranging from $4 to $5 per pound. These are modeled results using the average of 2025 and 2026 with our current volume projections and cost estimates and holding gold flat at $2,600 per ounce and molybdenum flat at $20 per pound. You'll see here that annual EBITDA at $4 copper would range from $11 billion and it would go to approximately $15 billion per annum at $5 copper. Our operating cash flows at these product ranges would be over $7 billion at $4 copper to $10.5 billion at $5 copper. We've got sensitivities that we've presented on the right of this chart. You'll note that we're highly leveraged to copper price with each $0.10 per pound equating to about $420 million in annual EBITDA. We're also leveraged to gold and will benefit from improving gold prices with each $100 change in gold prices approximating $150 million in annual EBITDA. With long live reserves, large scale production, Freeport is well positioned to generate substantial cash flow to fund future organic growth and cash returns under our performance based payout framework. Moving to the next slide, on Slide 11, we're showing our current forecast for capital expenditures for this year and next. Capital expenditures for 2024 are forecast at about $3.6 billion and we estimate capital expenditures for next year to total about $4.2 billion. You'll see there have been some timing shifts between the two years but over the two years the changes are not material. We'll note that the discretionary projects over this two year period totaled $2.5 billion. This is a category that reflects the capital investments we're making in new projects that under our financial policy are funded with the 50% of available cash that's not distributed. They're value enhancing projects, growth projects, provide good returns and they're detailed on Slide 23 in our reference materials. As we look forward, we're going to continue to be disciplined in deploying capital and really focused on those opportunities that build value in our business. And finally, on Slide 12, we reiterate the financial policy priorities centered on a strong balance sheet, cash returns to shareholders and investments in value enhancing growth projects. We've got a very solid balance sheet, investment grade ratings from all three agencies, strong credit metrics and flexibility within our debt targets to execute on projects. We've distributed $4.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share purchases since implementing this framework, got a very attractive future long term portfolio that will enable us to continue to build value for shareholders. Our global team is very focused on driving value. We're committed to strong execution of our plans, providing cash to invest in profitable growth and returns to shareholders. Thanks for everyone for your attention. And now I would like to open the call to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Chris LaFemina with Jefferies.\nChris LaFemina: Just wanted to ask a couple of questions about Indonesia. And first, on smelter fire with the insurance. Kathleen, you mentioned that the insurance would cover the costs for repairs. What if there is a situation where there's a delay to being able to export concentrate? Do you have any business interruption insurance that might cover the cost of loss shipments or any insurance that might cover the incremental royalties that you had have to pay on concentrate on exports?\nKathleen Quirk: The policy that we're referring to is a construction insurance policy that does not have business interruption coverage. It does cover the cost of the repairs. This is not a -- as you can see from the picture, it's not a big area of the affected facilities, it is an essential area. The process is essential to the overall production of copper, refining of copper, but it's not a large part of the overall facility. So our focus, Chris, really is getting the repairs done as quickly as possible. We do have discussions with the government. It's in everyone's interest that the concentrate continue. We do have some flexibility within our existing quota of what we can ship through 2024 but we'll be asking for additional flexibility to make sure that we can we can ship everything that we produce in 2024. And then depending on the time frame that it takes to restore operations, we'll work with the governments for continuity in the portion of 2025 that will be affected, it's in everyone's interest. As you run through the math, the government gets essentially through taxes and royalties and dividends over 70% of the economics or the cash flow. So it will be in everyone's interest for this to continue and we'll work hard to get this operation restored as quickly as possible. But in the interim, we expect that we'll continue to be able to export.\nChris LaFemina: And then just secondly, on Indonesia as well. So the $1 billion of restricted cash, which I think is what 30% of the export proceeds and it's held for 90 days in Indonesian banks. Does that restricted cash policy continue even after the smelter ramps up? And can you just remind us of kind of the background behind that and what the reason for that cash restriction is?\nKathleen Quirk: Chris, it refers to all exports. So it doesn't just affect copper, it affects all exports in Indonesia required to hold in bank accounts for 90 days, temporarily your export proceeds. And it was a measure taken last year by the government to look at its currency and fiscal situation. And so it don't -- not only applies to us but implies the oil companies and other people that are exporting. So that will continue unless the regulation has changed that will continue beyond 2020 -- beyond the smelter startup. But it is there. We're earning returns on the investments. It's there temporarily. We withdraw it after 90 days. And so right now, it's just held in deposit. But that's something that the government will continue to consider in light of its objectives.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Liam Fitzpatrick with Deutsche Bank.\nLiam Fitzpatrick: A couple more on the smelter, I'm afraid. Firstly, I appreciate you're still assessing the situation. But can you give some high level guidance on the length of delay that we're talking about, is it three months, could it be substantially longer than that? And then in terms of the government reaction, do you think -- and the export extension, do you think this will be just a formality and received in good time or could there be a risk that it could be delayed beyond the year end? And then a quick one just separate to the smelter on the Cerro Verde stake increase, it's small but probably the best type of M&A that you can do. Is this a one-off or do you think there could be more opportunities to increase your stake?\nKathleen Quirk: On the time frame for the repairs, we don't have that information yet. This is a event that happened essentially a week ago and our teams have been on the ground inspecting the damaged equipment, determining what needs to be replaced, what does not need to be replaced. And we're working in parallel with our vendors on understanding lead times for various equipment. The early results in terms of the area affected, not everything on the structure was damaged. We were fortunate we did not have big impacts to structural steel. There will be some equipment and piping that needs to be replaced. And so we're just working through that right now, trying to understand what the lead times are for this equipment. This is not equipment off the shelf. So will need to be fabricated and we'll work quickly. The fortunate thing is right now it's not a time in the market where supply chains are real tight. So we're getting really good response from our vendors, working to understand the root cause of this and when the vendors are involved in that exercise with us as well. So we don't have a specific time frame other than to assure you that we've got the right teams in place. We've got the right organization that's working through this in a professional way to expedite what we can and get this back up and running so that we can achieve our start-up goals. The government has been supportive, they sent -- we have our own fire department there at the site. But the government also sent support and has been very supportive. They've been looking also -- the police, this was normal procedure, looking at the investigation of the causes and we're collaborating on that exercise as well. I think if you look at the world and these smelters, this is not the first time there's been a fire. In Indonesia, the people that we are talking with understand the hazards involved in these types of operations. We're working hard and designing these operations so that they don't have hazards. But if you look at history, there have been have been other similar type incidents. So they understand it, they understand our good faith and getting the smelter completed. And they also understand the economics that this -- continuity will benefit them as we go forward. So I think we'll just continue to work collaboratively to make sure that all of the -- the impacts of this are mitigated, and they can be mitigated through insurance and through continued exports. And that's what we want to make sure that we do to every extent possible is mitigate the impact of this incident. With the Cerro Verde question, Cerro Verde has a public market trades in the relatively small float that trades on the Peruvian Stock Exchange. And so we're interested in buying more if there's opportunities to do it. There were some funds that were interested in selling and we were able to pick up those shares. But it's a high quality asset, very difficult to replicate. And so to the extent there are opportunities to purchase additional shares, we're interested in doing that but that takes a willing seller as well. So we'll just continue to monitor that as we go forward.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.\nBob Brackett: A question back to Indonesia but this is around IUPK. If I overly analyze the 2Q versus 3Q, there was an expectation that you might file for IUPK extension in 2024 in the 2Q release but in 3Q, it feels a little more vague. Am I over-interpreting or is there anything about the end of the year and filing that, that matters to you specifically?\nRichard Adkerson: Definitely -- let me make one comment here first. We had hoped, based on discussions that go back a couple of years that we would be able to accomplish this during the term of Joko Widodo. And with everything that went on with the transition to the new president, the election occurred months ago but the transition was occurred later, we just weren't able to get it. There's an established regulation in place that provides us the ability to file for and we'll be working with the new government and working on the right time to do that, we feel confident that it will happen.\nBob Brackett: A quick follow-up. Can you tease us a little with the pre-feasibility study launched on Safford Lone Star, what should really broad goalposts, what sort of opportunity should we think about?\nKathleen Quirk: This is a very large resource. We've been doing a lot of drilling over the last several years and have identified a resource that is multiples of the current reserve. And it's in an established area. It's over the mountain range from Morenci where we've operated for a century more. And Safford is relatively new. I mean it's one of the newest mines in the US, we brought it online in 2007, '08 time frame and then have expanded it to date. So what we have is this opportunity to a vision where you could have another cornerstone asset in this district where we've got talented workforce. We've got an established community support and we've got a resource. And so you could have an operation there that is both doing leaching, which that's what -- it's 100% leach operation today, but could add additional milling there to essentially double the production, the resource might support even more than doubling. But what we're looking at is the opportunity to go from 300 million pounds of copper a year there to $600 million and through efficient leaching and milling operation. And so what we're doing now is designing, based on the resource, what the next step would be in terms of expanding the operation. And we're all very excited about it. We're pushing to really define what it could be. We know from the resource, it could be something that will be with us for a very long time. And so that's the objective. We're doing the pre-feasibility study work and we'll have more information next year about what a project could look like. One of the things that is important to recognize here is it's not like El Abra. In that El Abra is going to -- El Abra is a very attractive project, but it takes a long time because of the permitting requirements. We don't have the same degree. We don't believe we'll have the same degree of permitting required for this that you would have in something like El Abra. So it's possible that if this is fast tracked, it could come online not too much different than where El Abra. So that's exciting as well. We're fortunate at Freeport that we have these brownfield opportunities. We have big resources. We have the community support that allows us to grow, and that's what we're doing. We're focused on technology. We're focused on automating what we do to make sure that we can be as efficient as possible long term. And I think technology, not only in our leach initiative but also in our mining initiatives is going to turn the corner and make our US operations much more attractive as we go forward. So that's -- we're working on that in parallel with these studies.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research Partners.\nMichael Dudas: Maybe you could shed -- I appreciate the comments about North America and the impact on some of your initiatives on the cost side. But maybe you could give a sense of how quickly some of these efficiency initiatives will be moving forward, looking at the marketplace for labor, where do you stand on that? And is there a normalized level or expectation away from the improvement from the leaching contribution that we'd see a moderation in the mining cost, of course, recognizing that the great issues that you've been dealing with?\nKathleen Quirk: Well, over the last several quarters, we've had two -- it's been twofold. One is we -- starting in '22, we\u2019ve had rising costs, and that came at a time when we started getting into lower grade. So we've had two things that we've been dealing with. The good news is that we're not seeing the rise in costs like we were previously. And actually, there's some things that -- like energy that have come -- that are actually -- have trended lower. But the thing we're focused on now is making sure that our assets are as productive as possible. We did some benchmarking against our South America operations and back in 2022, the two were pretty much on top of each other in terms of their unit costs. Now when we look at the comparison, there's a big gap between South America and North America and that's mainly this great issue. We haven't had the grade decline in South America like we've had in North America, but that requires us to be more efficient and we think we can do that. We think that we can be more productive with our equipment, more productive with our people as our people are getting better training, more experience, that is a big help. The other issue that we're making some progress on is downtime. We've had some experience in recent years with premature equipment failures. We're turning the corner on that. We're focused on systems and planning our downtime so that when we do go down for planned maintenance that the downtime is delivered, the projects delivered on the cost we expected and in the time frame we expected. But it's a lot of basics but we're making progress. When we look at all the KPIs that we track, the key performance indicators that we track, we're seeing better utilization, better availability on our equipment than we've experienced in recent quarters. And that's just going to have to continue to be the case that we have to work day in, day out to achieve better asset availability and productivity metrics. The other thing we're focused on is contractor costs. We've had some labor rate increases that have not been insignificant but the contractor costs have been even more significant. So what we're doing there is we're reducing the amount of contractors that we have in our operations. We're down about 10% or so from where we were and we're allocating our own internal resources differently to reduce costs there that will be something we're continuing to work on. The other thing we're doing in our global supply chain group is leading an effort to really push back what's happened over the last couple of years with component parts and all aspects of maintenance supplies. People are trying to push through cost increases, price increases on equipment and parts. And we just don't see the data that supports that. So we're pushing back on that. We're looking to bring costs back down to reasonable levels where our vendors can generate returns but not egregious returns. So we've got multifaceted, multifaceted initiatives going on. As you mentioned, the leach initiative is one component of that and that's going to help a lot. But there are other areas that we've got teams focused on. And we will make progress if we continue to follow these key performance indicators and achieve these targets that we've set out that each of our teams know about, know what we need to do, we will bring down the cost even though grades may not improve. So that's something that we're committed to. And I think you'll start to see in 2025 all other things being equal in terms of input costs but you'll see our unit cost trending lower in the US compared to where they are now. And I'll ask Josh or Maree, either of you, if you want to add to anything I commented on, on costs. This is a big effort for our whole team. So anybody else want to comment, please do.\nJosh Olmsted: Kathleen, I think you touched on everything that I was going to touch on. I mean really the laser focus by the team on efficiencies, productivities and managing our costs via contractor spend are really key in driving our unit cost down in addition to the work in the maintenance and reliability space. The more reliable our equipment is, the more productive it is and therefore, that just helps all the way across the board, not only from a deviser perspective but also from a cost perspective, because when equipment is down it typically costs more. So you touched on the things that are the most important for us. And we're very, very focused organizationally on those key performance indicators so that we can manage that stuff on a day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month basis and drive it in the direction we need to go.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Orest Wowkodaw with Scotiabank.\nOrest Wowkodaw: My question is around the same lines with respect to cost. I mean with North American cost above $3 and South America around $2.50, I understand that you're working on some cost reduction initiatives. But should we think about sort of the go forward run rate for costs in North America more in the $2.50 to $3 range post these initiatives with South America more in the $2.25 to $2.50 a pound? Like is that just the new reality of today's cost environment?\nKathleen Quirk: I think directionally, that's right. Now to the extent that we can bring down some of these input costs, that will help but I think that is what you're saying is accurate. Now I want to remind everybody that our leach initiative, if we're successful there and continuing to scale that's a big deal. So you're talking about costs in the US for average today in the $3 range, this leach initiative is bringing on incremental pounds at a cost of less than $1. And so that will bring down the average as we scale it more, because the reason why it's so attractive is because this is getting more copper out of what's already been mined. So the mining cost is a big part of the overall cost of copper production. And this is taking advantage of material that's already been mined and investing some incremental costs to get more. So that could really make a difference. And that's why we're talking about it so much and we're making progress on it, it could it could really change the cost structure in the US. And we've got some opportunities for leach, in particular, at El Abra that we're pursuing but the meaningful impact will be in our US operations, principally Morenci and Safford and our Chino mine.\nOrest Wowkodaw: Just as a follow-up to that, I mean, we've seen North American costs creep up seemingly quarter-over-quarter. Where do you see that inflection point? Should we -- do you think we peaked here at 3.14 a pound or could we still see those costs flatline or go higher before they start coming down on the new leaching?\nKathleen Quirk: Our objectives and our targets are that they'll come down. So we should -- you should see -- in 2025, you should see lower costs from what we had in 2024. Now that depends on moly and some other things but just site production costs you should see costs trending lower in 2025 from where they were in '24.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Daniel Major with UBS.\nDaniel Major: The first one, just on the sort of M&A capital allocation. You've acquired some more stock in Cerro Verde, but as you mentioned, you need a willing seller. I guess two parts to the question. Assuming you can't buy any more stock in Cerro Verde going forward, should we expect Freeport share buybacks in Q4 and into Q1 of next year? That's the first part of the question.\nKathleen Quirk: Well, I was just going to say, Richard, we're following our framework for cash allocation for shareholder returns. And so we deploy 50% of cash flow to -- cash flow available after CapEx, excluding the discretionary items, of 50% to shareholder returns and 50% to organic growth. And so we do expect that share purchases, to the extent that we're generating cash above the current dividend levels, will be available for us in the future to continue to buy stock back. The Cerro Verde was opportunistic. If there are opportunities in the future to buy Cerro Verde stock, like we said, it's a very high quality asset and so that's really just an opportunistic purchase.\nRichard Adkerson: We have ongoing discussions with our shareholders and there's obviously differences in views about dividends versus stock buybacks. But this is something we actively discuss with our Board at every meeting and we'll be making decisions. It's great to be in a position now to be able to have those discussions and we're well below our debt levels targets. So we'll be able to execute this policy that Kathleen just spoke with you about.\nDaniel Major: And maybe a follow-up, if I could, just on bigger picture, M&A. You're obviously seeing larger scale transactions starting to become more prominent in the sector. Is this something that you see as an opportunity going forward before some of these larger assets potentially get kind of taken off the market?\nKathleen Quirk: We monitor market activity\u2026\nRichard Adkerson: I've said for a long time that M&A is coming in our industry and it certainly will. And we're engaged in observing what goes on, discussions with our bankers and with other companies to see what opportunities might arise. But M&A is not fundamental to our strategy. I mean, we are focused and have opportunities to grow values for our shareholders organically and that's our primary focus, but we'll be in the marketplace and prepare to respond to opportunities. I've always felt that the best M&A comes from opportunities as opposed to predetermined strategic moves.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Lawson Winder with Bank of America Securities.\nLawson Winder: Just wanted to ask about capital allocation, particularly with respect to the larger projects. So I'm thinking of Bagdad and thinking of El Abra and thinking as now Lone Star. Would it be fair to characterize your decision making as one where you would wait on a decision on Bagdad until you have the information on the study that you're now expecting at the end of next year for both El Abra and Lone Star?\nKathleen Quirk: Well, Bagdad is a project that we can execute in the near term. We do want to -- and we've got the information on El Abra. So we know the comparison between El Abra and Bagdad. For Lone Star, we need to get these studies done and that's why we're pushing to get the studies done next year, that will help us assess that. But Bagdad is something that can be executed in a three to four year horizon. Lone Star, Safford will take longer to evaluate. But yes, in a perfect world we would like to have and that's the beauty of Freeport in that we have -- we manage all of these assets. And so we can look at capital allocation as to where it makes the most sense, where it has the best impact, the best returns for us to evaluate projects next to each other. So that's a real advantage and we do that regularly to make sure we're allocating capital to the projects that make the most sense, not just to the projects that we can do. We want to invest our capital in the projects that drive the most value. There are other considerations in terms of time frames that can be executed within et cetera. But generally, that's our philosophy is to allocate capital to the most valuable projects within our portfolio to compare and contrast those. So we will have more information on Safford next year and look at that next to Bagdad. But we think that Bagdad will -- the project will benefit Bagdad long term. Again, we're talking about -- we've got an 80 year plus reserve life there. And so that is a place where we feel investments make sense. And that's part of what guides our investment decisions is where do we have the resource and in this case, an established operation that we can leverage from. But they're not mutually exclusive. We can do more than one project. And so our goal is to -- if we've got projects that create value and we can execute those efficiently, we want to advance those aggressively.\nLawson Winder: And then just my follow-up would be just thinking about 2025 CapEx. I mean, how would you handicap thinking about that? I mean should we be thinking about 2025 CapEx being sort of in line with 24 ex smelter or should we be thinking about the possibility of major CapEx commitment at some point in '25, that would be cash outflow next year?\nKathleen Quirk: At this point in time, we don't see a major change to '25 CapEx. We do have some investments in our discretionary bucket in '25 to advance Bagdad, to derisk Bagdad. We're making some investments in power infrastructure. We're making some investments in tailings work that we're doing that we'd have to do anyway longer term. So we do have some investments in Bagdad in 2025 to derisk the overall project. But I don't see, based on the projects we're talking about in terms of El Abra, Bagdad, Lone Star, I don't see significant CapEx above what we have in our 2025 plans. But we'll continue to review those. If there's opportunities for us to advance things and that makes sense, we'll certainly be open to it. But at this point in time, this is our best estimate of what capital will look like in 2025.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Bill Peterson with JP Morgan.\nBennett Moore: I wanted to start real quick, if you could provide any updates on some of your smaller and near term discretionary projects on Slide 23, namely increasing stacking at Lone Star, Atlantic Copper recycling and the improvements at the Grasberg mill?\nKathleen Quirk: Just for everyone else, what he's talking about is these are the discretionary projects that are included in our capital that generally are not maintenance related that actually have investment returns associated with them. The Lone Star oxide expansion is coming to an end. We're going to be completing that in the 2025 time frame. And so that will allow us to basically sustain 300 million pounds of copper per annum. Beyond that, Lone Star, we're talking about a major expansion and that is what we were talking about earlier studying. At Grasberg, we're installing a copper cleaner that will allow us to improve our concentrate grades and our metal recoveries. That investment is -- essentially, we've completed the major construction and we'll be installing that project, commissioning that project here in the fourth quarter. So that one is coming to an end, you won't see any significant cost for that one in 2025. The circular project at Atlantic Copper is taking advantage of Atlantic Copper's position in the market, the existing infrastructure. And we're developing a new circuit there to recycle e-scrap, electronic scrap material and that project is underway. It's expected to be in production next year, at the end of next year and it is going to add to Atlantic Copper. This may not be significant overall to Freeport, $60 million per annum, but it's significant to Atlantic Copper and particularly in the context of of low TCRCs. This allows Atlantic Copper to continue to generate business outside of copper and it's -- Atlantic is very well suited to do this kind of work and recycling the material that are in phones and other things that have value. So that project is in construction, and as I said, expect to be completed next year.\nBennett Moore: And then real quick, if I could just ask about the progress of the cleanup work going on at Grasberg, you've had success with placing this remote pumping equipment that you were speaking to last quarter?\nKathleen Quirk: We've made a lot of progress there. Things are -- continue to go very well at Grasberg. The team did well this quarter and actually exceeded the forecast, was able to get more tons through the mill than we had forecast and grades were strong. And so operations there are continuing to go very well.\nOperator: And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to management.\nKathleen Quirk: Thanks, Regina. Thank you, everyone, for all your good questions and participation. And we look forward to continue to keep you updated. And if you have any follow-ups, please contact David.\nOperator: And that will conclude today's call. We thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kathleen Quirk",
            "content": "Okay, great. Thank you, Richard. And I'm going to start on our slide presentation, starting on Slide 3 with our highlights for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024. Our team continues to deliver on our operating plans and pursue value through enhancing efficiencies, managing costs aggressively and building value in our organic growth portfolio. You'll see here we generated strong margins and cash flows during the quarter with $2.7 billion in EBITDA and $1.9 billion in operating cash flows. Our operating performance was supported by sales volumes exceeding guidance for both copper and gold and favorable unit cash cost performance compared to both our guidance and the year ago quarter. We're focused on initiatives to build value from organic growth. At Freeport, we benefit from a large reserve and resource position with near term, medium term and longer term embedded growth options. The high potential innovative leach technologies are delivering results and we've several ongoing initiatives to add scale and low cost copper volumes in our Americas business. In the first nine months of 2024, the incremental copper production from our leach initiative was nearly 70% higher than the comparable period last year, and we have additional projects underway to build scale and improve on our US cost position. We're also advancing our brownfield expansion opportunities position the business for long term growth to supply a market with increased requirements for copper. During the third quarter, we purchased 5.3 million shares of Cerro Verde in at market transactions on the Peruvian Stock Exchange at a cost of $210 million and that allowed us to increase our ownership in this highly attractive asset from the prior level of 53.6% to 55%. The public flow of Cerro verde now represents about 4.3% of the outstanding shares. We ended the quarter in a strong position financially. And as we look forward, we're very optimistic about the markets we serve, our portfolio of high quality copper assets and the future prospects for strong cash flow generation to support investments and value enhancing projects and returns to shareholders. We'll talk about markets on Slide 4. Copper prices again during the third quarter traded in a broad range. On the LME, they range between 3.91 and 4.47 per pound. And on the COMEX exchange range from 3.94 per pound to 4.66 per pound. The settlement prices on the LME for the quarter averaged $4.18 per pound. As we look at the quarter and where prices traded, they largely followed macro sentiment, which weighed global economic data and economic pressures in China against actions by the Fed and other central banks to cut interest rates and the potential for large economic stimulus in China. At the micro level, we continue to see secular demand trends associated with electrification, providing strong demand for copper and offsetting the impact of a cyclical slowdown. In the US, our customers continue to report strong demand for power cable and building wire associated with substantial investment in electrical infrastructure and AI data centers. This growing sector more than offset weakness in traditional demand sectors in residential construction and autos. Demand from China continues to be supported by significant investments in the electrical grid and continued growth in China's production of electric vehicles. Notably, China's demand for copper continues to grow despite a weak property sector. Recent announcements for economic stimulus in China to support the country's economic growth targets could provide further support for metals demand as we move through 2024 and into 2025. As we've discussed in the past, Copper is a foundational metal and a key component of electrification. It's physical characteristics and superior connectivity make it essential to electrification. New massive investment in the power grid, renewable generation, technology infrastructure and transportation are driving increased demand for copper and forecast call for above trend growth and demand for the foreseeable future. As we look at these fundamentals of demand and match it up with supply, we continue to see a tightly balanced market in the near term and deficit conditions longer run. This is going to require new investments and innovative technologies to build supplies longer term and at Freeport, we've driven supply of copper reliably and responsibly to a growing market. With our leading industry position, our large scale current operations and our future growth pipeline, we're well positioned to benefit from this fundamental outlook for copper. I remind everyone that in addition to copper, we're also a major gold producer and are benefiting from increasing gold prices. We'll turn to operations on Slide 5, where we summarize the quarterly operating results by geographic region. In the US, we are continuing to take actions to improve efficiencies and cost performance to mitigate the impact of lower grades. We have more work to do but recent trends are improving. We're closely monitoring key performance indicators and seeing positive trends in recent months in asset efficiency associated with key areas of loading, hauling, crushing and stacking. Our equipment reliability is a focus area and we're making strides in reducing unplanned downtime. We're also rationalizing the use of contractors to reduce costs and allocating internal resources to our key focus areas. In addition, success in our leaching initiative and further scaling incremental low cost production will also drive reductions in our cost structure. In South America, the team at the Cerro Verde operation posted another solid quarter. Mill throughput exceeded 420,000 metric tons of ore per day during the quarter and our mill recovery improved from last year's third quarter. Our unit net cash costs were slightly less than last year's third quarter after excluding the $0.12 per pound nonrecurring charge in the quarter for a new labor agreement. After reaching agreement with Cerro Verde's second union, we now have multiyear labor agreements covering Cerro Verde's hourly workforce. Mentioned earlier we purchased additional Cerro Verde shares that gives us more exposure to this established long lived and high quality assets. In Indonesia, results were quite strong and that's evidenced by a unit net cash credit of $0.71 per pound. The team is consistently delivering strong volumes of both copper and gold from our large scale underground ore bodies. Our sales in the quarter were higher than our estimates going into the period with increased mill rates and oil grades. We also benefited from strong gold sales in the quarter, reflecting good production performance and a reduction in inventory from June 30th levels. Our near term focus areas include continued strong execution of our operating plans, commissioning of a value driven copper cleaning circuit at our site in Papua to support strong mill recoveries and commissioning the precious metals refinery. We're also working to restore smelter operations following the recent smelter fire event, which we'll talk about more on the next slide. Just an update on where we are with the smelter. We made good progress during the third quarter on our commissioning and start-up. This is a project that our team managed construction in a challenging market in a very effective manner. But we did experience a setback last week on October 14th from a fire incident in a gas cleaning facility used in the sulfuric acid production process. Our safety protocols were effective and the fire was extinguished in a short period of time without injury to our personnel. Start-up activities have been temporarily suspended as a result while we conduct damage and root cause assessments and develop our recovery plans. We've presented a picture on the slide that you can review. But as you can see, the incident affected a relatively small area of the overall project. We have teams actively engaged in planning the repairs and assessing lead times for replacement equipment. We expect that the repair cost will be covered by our insurance programs and we're also working with the Indonesian government on continuity of concentrate exports during the outage. Our mining operations in Papua have not been impacted and our team is focused on restoring smelter operations safely and expeditiously. We look forward to achieving our objective of being a fully integrated producer in Indonesia, which positions us to secure a long term extension of our operating rights there. Really continue to be very excited about our innovative leach initiative. On Slide 7, you can see that early results continue to indicate significant value potential. Just a reminder, we achieved our initial targeted run rate of 200 million pounds per annum of copper per annum at the end of last year and are now driving initiatives to scale this initiative to 300 million to 400 million pounds per annum in the next couple of years. Ultimately, our goal was to achieve 800 million pounds per annum from this value enhancing growth initiative. This is the size of a major new mine with low capital investment required, low incremental operating costs and that will significantly enhance the value and competitive position of our Americas production. You can see on the slide, the significant growth in incremental volumes from these initiatives over the last several quarters, our results have been achieved by enhancing heat retention in the leach stockpiles using data from sensors and analytics to identify targets and through deploying new operational tactics to direct solution injection to areas that were previously inaccessible. We continue to build confidence in boosting the run rate to 300 million to 400 million pounds per year during 2026. Some of the examples of the initiatives that are now underway that will add volumes in the future include expanding our surface area under leach by using helicopters to install irrigation in areas previously inaccessible under conventional techniques and by scaling our targeted solution injection wells. We're making great progress on our leach injection technology, great progress on our drilling. We're drilling much more efficiently and we're able to increase the rate of well development. In parallel, we're also advancing innovation driven initiatives which would support our ultimate objective of reaching 800 million pounds per annum. We believe there's significant opportunity from increasing heat to the stockpiles. We're looking at adding heat to the leach solution using external energy or using pyrite hosted ores to generate additional heat. Heat is a proven source to improve recoveries in this type of application. We're also continuing to advance testing of new additives at scale and we look forward to reporting to you on our progress on these initiatives. At Freeport, we're really well positioned to capture the value of this opportunity with an extensive inventory of substantial residual copper from material already mined, an industry leading technical team with expertise in leaching technology and a strong multi-disciplined innovation team dedicated to this initiative. We've got additional opportunities for growth beyond the leach opportunity, and you can see that on Slide 8, where we list our organic growth projects. All of these projects are brownfield opportunities where we're leveraging existing assets and established operations. The leach initiative that we just talked about is our best opportunity to grow in the near term and we're pursuing this initiative very aggressively. In the US, we also have opportunities for expansion at our Bagdad and Safford Lone Star operations. And at Bagdad, we're advancing investments in automation, tailings and energy infrastructure and expanded employee housing in this remote location to position us to execute the project more efficiently when the time is right. We don't have major permitting hurdles and this is really a straightforward option. We're monitoring conditions and progress with our derisking initiatives and continue to expect to be in a position to make a decision next year on the expansion plans. In the Safford Lone Star District where we have a very large resource, we're engaged in studies to define a brownfield expansion. We're targeting opportunities to more than double current production levels, which are currently around 300 million pounds per annum. The large resource that we have at this location, it gives us an opportunity for Safford Lone Star to become a generational cornerstone asset for Freeport and Arizona in the next decade. At El Abra in Chile, this is our partnership with Codelco, as we previously reported, we completed pre-feasibility studies and we're in the process of preparing an environmental impact statement which we expect to be completed by the end of next year. The project involves investment in a new concentrator of scale similar to the size of Cerro Verde that we installed nearly 10 years ago, investments in the desalinization and pipeline system to support our water requirements. This project is large. It would provide 750 million pounds of annual copper production and 9 million pounds of annual molybdenum production. It's a long lead project. It would require something on the order of seven to eight years because of the time frame for permitting in Chile. And we're going to continue to review economics in the context of market conditions but we believe this is a project that will be required in the future to support long term copper demand trends, and this is a project in our portfolio that Freeport can execute. In Indonesia, we continue to progress our large scale Kucing Liar development. This is a very large ore body adjacent to our existing operations, our existing ore bodies in Papua. We expect to commence production by 2030. We're also conducting exploration below our Deep MLZ ore body. We're getting encouraging results. We expect that an extension of our operating rights in Indonesia beyond 2041 will set us up for additional long term development options in this highly attractive district. By pursuing all of these initiatives and advancing them, we're really focused on building optionality for future growth. We're going to continue to be disciplined in our approach and focused on targeting opportunities that can be executed over time that enhance long term value. Our Slide 9 shows our three year outlook, which we show every quarter and keep updated. This is the outlook for sales of copper, gold and molybdenum and that you'll see the sales guidance is very similar to our previous outlook. We also have updated our estimates for our unit net cash cost. We expect our average for 2024 to approximate $1.58 per pound. That is below our July estimate of $1.63 per pound and similar to our guidance at the start of the year of $1.60 per pound. We've got some details of this information by region on Slide 19 and the reference materials. So as we move to cash flows, margins and cash flows and putting together our projected volumes and cost projections on Slide 9 -- Slide 10, we show modeled results for EBITDA and cash flow at various copper prices ranging from $4 to $5 per pound. These are modeled results using the average of 2025 and 2026 with our current volume projections and cost estimates and holding gold flat at $2,600 per ounce and molybdenum flat at $20 per pound. You'll see here that annual EBITDA at $4 copper would range from $11 billion and it would go to approximately $15 billion per annum at $5 copper. Our operating cash flows at these product ranges would be over $7 billion at $4 copper to $10.5 billion at $5 copper. We've got sensitivities that we've presented on the right of this chart. You'll note that we're highly leveraged to copper price with each $0.10 per pound equating to about $420 million in annual EBITDA. We're also leveraged to gold and will benefit from improving gold prices with each $100 change in gold prices approximating $150 million in annual EBITDA. With long live reserves, large scale production, Freeport is well positioned to generate substantial cash flow to fund future organic growth and cash returns under our performance based payout framework. Moving to the next slide, on Slide 11, we're showing our current forecast for capital expenditures for this year and next. Capital expenditures for 2024 are forecast at about $3.6 billion and we estimate capital expenditures for next year to total about $4.2 billion. You'll see there have been some timing shifts between the two years but over the two years the changes are not material. We'll note that the discretionary projects over this two year period totaled $2.5 billion. This is a category that reflects the capital investments we're making in new projects that under our financial policy are funded with the 50% of available cash that's not distributed. They're value enhancing projects, growth projects, provide good returns and they're detailed on Slide 23 in our reference materials. As we look forward, we're going to continue to be disciplined in deploying capital and really focused on those opportunities that build value in our business. And finally, on Slide 12, we reiterate the financial policy priorities centered on a strong balance sheet, cash returns to shareholders and investments in value enhancing growth projects. We've got a very solid balance sheet, investment grade ratings from all three agencies, strong credit metrics and flexibility within our debt targets to execute on projects. We've distributed $4.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share purchases since implementing this framework, got a very attractive future long term portfolio that will enable us to continue to build value for shareholders. Our global team is very focused on driving value. We're committed to strong execution of our plans, providing cash to invest in profitable growth and returns to shareholders. Thanks for everyone for your attention. And now I would like to open the call to take your questions. The policy that we're referring to is a construction insurance policy that does not have business interruption coverage. It does cover the cost of the repairs. This is not a -- as you can see from the picture, it's not a big area of the affected facilities, it is an essential area. The process is essential to the overall production of copper, refining of copper, but it's not a large part of the overall facility. So our focus, Chris, really is getting the repairs done as quickly as possible. We do have discussions with the government. It's in everyone's interest that the concentrate continue. We do have some flexibility within our existing quota of what we can ship through 2024 but we'll be asking for additional flexibility to make sure that we can we can ship everything that we produce in 2024. And then depending on the time frame that it takes to restore operations, we'll work with the governments for continuity in the portion of 2025 that will be affected, it's in everyone's interest. As you run through the math, the government gets essentially through taxes and royalties and dividends over 70% of the economics or the cash flow. So it will be in everyone's interest for this to continue and we'll work hard to get this operation restored as quickly as possible. But in the interim, we expect that we'll continue to be able to export. Chris, it refers to all exports. So it doesn't just affect copper, it affects all exports in Indonesia required to hold in bank accounts for 90 days, temporarily your export proceeds. And it was a measure taken last year by the government to look at its currency and fiscal situation. And so it don't -- not only applies to us but implies the oil companies and other people that are exporting. So that will continue unless the regulation has changed that will continue beyond 2020 -- beyond the smelter startup. But it is there. We're earning returns on the investments. It's there temporarily. We withdraw it after 90 days. And so right now, it's just held in deposit. But that's something that the government will continue to consider in light of its objectives. On the time frame for the repairs, we don't have that information yet. This is a event that happened essentially a week ago and our teams have been on the ground inspecting the damaged equipment, determining what needs to be replaced, what does not need to be replaced. And we're working in parallel with our vendors on understanding lead times for various equipment. The early results in terms of the area affected, not everything on the structure was damaged. We were fortunate we did not have big impacts to structural steel. There will be some equipment and piping that needs to be replaced. And so we're just working through that right now, trying to understand what the lead times are for this equipment. This is not equipment off the shelf. So will need to be fabricated and we'll work quickly. The fortunate thing is right now it's not a time in the market where supply chains are real tight. So we're getting really good response from our vendors, working to understand the root cause of this and when the vendors are involved in that exercise with us as well. So we don't have a specific time frame other than to assure you that we've got the right teams in place. We've got the right organization that's working through this in a professional way to expedite what we can and get this back up and running so that we can achieve our start-up goals. The government has been supportive, they sent -- we have our own fire department there at the site. But the government also sent support and has been very supportive. They've been looking also -- the police, this was normal procedure, looking at the investigation of the causes and we're collaborating on that exercise as well. I think if you look at the world and these smelters, this is not the first time there's been a fire. In Indonesia, the people that we are talking with understand the hazards involved in these types of operations. We're working hard and designing these operations so that they don't have hazards. But if you look at history, there have been have been other similar type incidents. So they understand it, they understand our good faith and getting the smelter completed. And they also understand the economics that this -- continuity will benefit them as we go forward. So I think we'll just continue to work collaboratively to make sure that all of the -- the impacts of this are mitigated, and they can be mitigated through insurance and through continued exports. And that's what we want to make sure that we do to every extent possible is mitigate the impact of this incident. With the Cerro Verde question, Cerro Verde has a public market trades in the relatively small float that trades on the Peruvian Stock Exchange. And so we're interested in buying more if there's opportunities to do it. There were some funds that were interested in selling and we were able to pick up those shares. But it's a high quality asset, very difficult to replicate. And so to the extent there are opportunities to purchase additional shares, we're interested in doing that but that takes a willing seller as well. So we'll just continue to monitor that as we go forward. This is a very large resource. We've been doing a lot of drilling over the last several years and have identified a resource that is multiples of the current reserve. And it's in an established area. It's over the mountain range from Morenci where we've operated for a century more. And Safford is relatively new. I mean it's one of the newest mines in the US, we brought it online in 2007, '08 time frame and then have expanded it to date. So what we have is this opportunity to a vision where you could have another cornerstone asset in this district where we've got talented workforce. We've got an established community support and we've got a resource. And so you could have an operation there that is both doing leaching, which that's what -- it's 100% leach operation today, but could add additional milling there to essentially double the production, the resource might support even more than doubling. But what we're looking at is the opportunity to go from 300 million pounds of copper a year there to $600 million and through efficient leaching and milling operation. And so what we're doing now is designing, based on the resource, what the next step would be in terms of expanding the operation. And we're all very excited about it. We're pushing to really define what it could be. We know from the resource, it could be something that will be with us for a very long time. And so that's the objective. We're doing the pre-feasibility study work and we'll have more information next year about what a project could look like. One of the things that is important to recognize here is it's not like El Abra. In that El Abra is going to -- El Abra is a very attractive project, but it takes a long time because of the permitting requirements. We don't have the same degree. We don't believe we'll have the same degree of permitting required for this that you would have in something like El Abra. So it's possible that if this is fast tracked, it could come online not too much different than where El Abra. So that's exciting as well. We're fortunate at Freeport that we have these brownfield opportunities. We have big resources. We have the community support that allows us to grow, and that's what we're doing. We're focused on technology. We're focused on automating what we do to make sure that we can be as efficient as possible long term. And I think technology, not only in our leach initiative but also in our mining initiatives is going to turn the corner and make our US operations much more attractive as we go forward. So that's -- we're working on that in parallel with these studies. Well, over the last several quarters, we've had two -- it's been twofold. One is we -- starting in '22, we've had rising costs, and that came at a time when we started getting into lower grade. So we've had two things that we've been dealing with. The good news is that we're not seeing the rise in costs like we were previously. And actually, there's some things that -- like energy that have come -- that are actually -- have trended lower. But the thing we're focused on now is making sure that our assets are as productive as possible. We did some benchmarking against our South America operations and back in 2022, the two were pretty much on top of each other in terms of their unit costs. Now when we look at the comparison, there's a big gap between South America and North America and that's mainly this great issue. We haven't had the grade decline in South America like we've had in North America, but that requires us to be more efficient and we think we can do that. We think that we can be more productive with our equipment, more productive with our people as our people are getting better training, more experience, that is a big help. The other issue that we're making some progress on is downtime. We've had some experience in recent years with premature equipment failures. We're turning the corner on that. We're focused on systems and planning our downtime so that when we do go down for planned maintenance that the downtime is delivered, the projects delivered on the cost we expected and in the time frame we expected. But it's a lot of basics but we're making progress. When we look at all the KPIs that we track, the key performance indicators that we track, we're seeing better utilization, better availability on our equipment than we've experienced in recent quarters. And that's just going to have to continue to be the case that we have to work day in, day out to achieve better asset availability and productivity metrics. The other thing we're focused on is contractor costs. We've had some labor rate increases that have not been insignificant but the contractor costs have been even more significant. So what we're doing there is we're reducing the amount of contractors that we have in our operations. We're down about 10% or so from where we were and we're allocating our own internal resources differently to reduce costs there that will be something we're continuing to work on. The other thing we're doing in our global supply chain group is leading an effort to really push back what's happened over the last couple of years with component parts and all aspects of maintenance supplies. People are trying to push through cost increases, price increases on equipment and parts. And we just don't see the data that supports that. So we're pushing back on that. We're looking to bring costs back down to reasonable levels where our vendors can generate returns but not egregious returns. So we've got multifaceted, multifaceted initiatives going on. As you mentioned, the leach initiative is one component of that and that's going to help a lot. But there are other areas that we've got teams focused on. And we will make progress if we continue to follow these key performance indicators and achieve these targets that we've set out that each of our teams know about, know what we need to do, we will bring down the cost even though grades may not improve. So that's something that we're committed to. And I think you'll start to see in 2025 all other things being equal in terms of input costs but you'll see our unit cost trending lower in the US compared to where they are now. And I'll ask Josh or Maree, either of you, if you want to add to anything I commented on, on costs. This is a big effort for our whole team. So anybody else want to comment, please do. I think directionally, that's right. Now to the extent that we can bring down some of these input costs, that will help but I think that is what you're saying is accurate. Now I want to remind everybody that our leach initiative, if we're successful there and continuing to scale that's a big deal. So you're talking about costs in the US for average today in the $3 range, this leach initiative is bringing on incremental pounds at a cost of less than $1. And so that will bring down the average as we scale it more, because the reason why it's so attractive is because this is getting more copper out of what's already been mined. So the mining cost is a big part of the overall cost of copper production. And this is taking advantage of material that's already been mined and investing some incremental costs to get more. So that could really make a difference. And that's why we're talking about it so much and we're making progress on it, it could it could really change the cost structure in the US. And we've got some opportunities for leach, in particular, at El Abra that we're pursuing but the meaningful impact will be in our US operations, principally Morenci and Safford and our Chino mine. Our objectives and our targets are that they'll come down. So we should -- you should see -- in 2025, you should see lower costs from what we had in 2024. Now that depends on moly and some other things but just site production costs you should see costs trending lower in 2025 from where they were in '24. Well, I was just going to say, Richard, we're following our framework for cash allocation for shareholder returns. And so we deploy 50% of cash flow to -- cash flow available after CapEx, excluding the discretionary items, of 50% to shareholder returns and 50% to organic growth. And so we do expect that share purchases, to the extent that we're generating cash above the current dividend levels, will be available for us in the future to continue to buy stock back. The Cerro Verde was opportunistic. If there are opportunities in the future to buy Cerro Verde stock, like we said, it's a very high quality asset and so that's really just an opportunistic purchase. We monitor market activity... Well, Bagdad is a project that we can execute in the near term. We do want to -- and we've got the information on El Abra. So we know the comparison between El Abra and Bagdad. For Lone Star, we need to get these studies done and that's why we're pushing to get the studies done next year, that will help us assess that. But Bagdad is something that can be executed in a three to four year horizon. Lone Star, Safford will take longer to evaluate. But yes, in a perfect world we would like to have and that's the beauty of Freeport in that we have -- we manage all of these assets. And so we can look at capital allocation as to where it makes the most sense, where it has the best impact, the best returns for us to evaluate projects next to each other. So that's a real advantage and we do that regularly to make sure we're allocating capital to the projects that make the most sense, not just to the projects that we can do. We want to invest our capital in the projects that drive the most value. There are other considerations in terms of time frames that can be executed within et cetera. But generally, that's our philosophy is to allocate capital to the most valuable projects within our portfolio to compare and contrast those. So we will have more information on Safford next year and look at that next to Bagdad. But we think that Bagdad will -- the project will benefit Bagdad long term. Again, we're talking about -- we've got an 80 year plus reserve life there. And so that is a place where we feel investments make sense. And that's part of what guides our investment decisions is where do we have the resource and in this case, an established operation that we can leverage from. But they're not mutually exclusive. We can do more than one project. And so our goal is to -- if we've got projects that create value and we can execute those efficiently, we want to advance those aggressively. At this point in time, we don't see a major change to '25 CapEx. We do have some investments in our discretionary bucket in '25 to advance Bagdad, to derisk Bagdad. We're making some investments in power infrastructure. We're making some investments in tailings work that we're doing that we'd have to do anyway longer term. So we do have some investments in Bagdad in 2025 to derisk the overall project. But I don't see, based on the projects we're talking about in terms of El Abra, Bagdad, Lone Star, I don't see significant CapEx above what we have in our 2025 plans. But we'll continue to review those. If there's opportunities for us to advance things and that makes sense, we'll certainly be open to it. But at this point in time, this is our best estimate of what capital will look like in 2025. Just for everyone else, what he's talking about is these are the discretionary projects that are included in our capital that generally are not maintenance related that actually have investment returns associated with them. The Lone Star oxide expansion is coming to an end. We're going to be completing that in the 2025 time frame. And so that will allow us to basically sustain 300 million pounds of copper per annum. Beyond that, Lone Star, we're talking about a major expansion and that is what we were talking about earlier studying. At Grasberg, we're installing a copper cleaner that will allow us to improve our concentrate grades and our metal recoveries. That investment is -- essentially, we've completed the major construction and we'll be installing that project, commissioning that project here in the fourth quarter. So that one is coming to an end, you won't see any significant cost for that one in 2025. The circular project at Atlantic Copper is taking advantage of Atlantic Copper's position in the market, the existing infrastructure. And we're developing a new circuit there to recycle e-scrap, electronic scrap material and that project is underway. It's expected to be in production next year, at the end of next year and it is going to add to Atlantic Copper. This may not be significant overall to Freeport, $60 million per annum, but it's significant to Atlantic Copper and particularly in the context of of low TCRCs. This allows Atlantic Copper to continue to generate business outside of copper and it's -- Atlantic is very well suited to do this kind of work and recycling the material that are in phones and other things that have value. So that project is in construction, and as I said, expect to be completed next year. We've made a lot of progress there. Things are -- continue to go very well at Grasberg. The team did well this quarter and actually exceeded the forecast, was able to get more tons through the mill than we had forecast and grades were strong. And so operations there are continuing to go very well. Thanks, Regina. Thank you, everyone, for all your good questions and participation. And we look forward to continue to keep you updated. And if you have any follow-ups, please contact David."

It was a solid quarter as you can see and that's the result of the good work that our global Freeport team has accomplished and really proud of them and look forward to the future. We've got great outlook for our company, great outlook long term for our copper and commodity that we base our strategy on. So Kathleen will review with you the results of the quarter and talk about it, and we're making progress with this fire we had at our new smelter in Indonesia and we'll review that as well. We have a new president in Indonesia, Prabowo Subianto. When Prabowo was General three decades ago, we worked together closely on issues affecting our operations in Papua. He knows our business. He's appointed cabinet, which includes a number of cabinet members from Joko Widodo's cabinet and other people that we've known over the years. We look forward to working with him and believe his understanding of our business and of our location in Papua will be a big benefit as we work with this administration going forward. Kathleen, I'll turn the call over to you to review our results and our outlook. Definitely -- let me make one comment here first. We had hoped, based on discussions that go back a couple of years that we would be able to accomplish this during the term of Joko Widodo. And with everything that went on with the transition to the new president, the election occurred months ago but the transition was occurred later, we just weren't able to get it. There's an established regulation in place that provides us the ability to file for and we'll be working with the new government and working on the right time to do that, we feel confident that it will happen. We have ongoing discussions with our shareholders and there's obviously differences in views about dividends versus stock buybacks. But this is something we actively discuss with our Board at every meeting and we'll be making decisions. It's great to be in a position now to be able to have those discussions and we're well below our debt levels targets. So we'll be able to execute this policy that Kathleen just spoke with you about. I've said for a long time that M&A is coming in our industry and it certainly will. And we're engaged in observing what goes on, discussions with our bankers and with other companies to see what opportunities might arise. But M&A is not fundamental to our strategy. I mean, we are focused and have opportunities to grow values for our shareholders organically and that's our primary focus, but we'll be in the marketplace and prepare to respond to opportunities. I've always felt that the best M&A comes from opportunities as opposed to predetermined strategic moves."

I mean really the laser focus by the team on efficiencies, productivities and managing our costs via contractor spend are really key in driving our unit cost down in addition to the work in the maintenance and reliability space. The more reliable our equipment is, the more productive it is and therefore, that just helps all the way across the board, not only from a deviser perspective but also from a cost perspective, because when equipment is down it typically costs more. So you touched on the things that are the most important for us. And we're very, very focused organizationally on those key performance indicators so that we can manage that stuff on a day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month basis and drive it in the direction we need to go."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Joint, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nDavid Joint: Thank you, Regina and good morning everyone. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan conference call. Earlier this morning, FCX reported its second quarter 2024 operating and financial results. A copy of today's release with supplemental schedules and slides is available on our website, fcx.com.

Richard will make some few opening comments, Kathleen will review our slide materials, and then we'll open up the call for questions. Richard?\nRichard Adkerson: Thank you, David and thank you all for joining us today. Well, we've seen quite a couple of months of volatility in the markets. I was on CNBC right when copper hit $5 for the first time ever, and I had big smiles on my face. Now, the reality of the copper markets have shown up and I just want to say a couple of comments about it. Many of you have heard me say for a long time that copper move from a cyclical metal that it had been in years past to one that's been driven more by episodic events. In China, its demand had been growing recently and has set records even in the face of poor performance in certain sectors, most notably the property segment. Recently, demand has been softening in other sectors. Credit markets in China have been soft, the high prices led to destocking. There's been a very tight concentrate market, which persists, TCs and RCs are record low levels and that's brought a lot of scrap to the marketplace. The government incentivized scrap for a period of time. And as a result, was a destocking, the softening demand, global inventories have risen, and that has triggered macro trading in commodities, particularly after the disappointment that the Third Plenum didn't result in a clear statement of incentivizing the economy in China. This simply won't last. There's limits to destocking, China will respond to its economy, there's underlying strength there, and we're very confident that this will improve over time. In fact, they've taken the first step with the recent interest rate cut. Underlying all of this is really the fundamentals of the global copper marketplace. The world is getting more and more electrified with connectivity, with dealing with carbon emissions, challenges there, but that's the fact that the world has to deal with A1 and Jeff Currie, recently talked about the importance of increased defense spending and that creates another element of demand. Supply changes, supply challenges continue and in certain cases are growing. And so as we look forward, our strategy is based on a fundamentally positive outlook about long-term copper demand and the reality of developing new supplies to meet that demand. It was really something to see, copper at $5. And I'll tell you, we're going to see it again. I want to make one quick comment to recognize our team for the great work we've done in reaching the commissioning of our new smelter in Indonesia. This was a major project, the world's largest single-line smelter. Construction is essentially complete. We posted a new video on our website last evening. I encourage you all to watch it just to see the size and scale of this new world-class facility. It's really something to visit it and seeing just the extent of the facility. This was a key commitment we made to the government of Indonesia in 2018, when we resolved to reach a global resolution of the issues that had been under discussion for so many years, it's a strategic importance for our business interest in Indonesia for the long-term by becoming a fully-integrated producer there with our mining operations, PT-FI will now be able to apply for extension of its operations for the long-term, which will really enhance the benefits of all stakeholders; the government, the people of Papua, our employees, Freeport and all shareholders and our partner, MIND ID, a state-owned company. Project has been in works for several years in a world that was challenged during this period of time by COVID and inflationary factors that have been evident in so many projects around our copper industry, it's really accomplishment by our team to bring this in on time and with reasonable budget spending on it. It's quite a facility. Take a look at the video. We are looking forward to getting our extension and then developing our plans to maximize the value of this resource over its life and not have any time limit of 2041 facing it. So we're really encouraged by -- and again, our team just did a tremendous job there. Kathleen, I'll turn it over to you.\nKathleen Quirk: Okay. Thank you, Richard, and I'm going to start on Slide 3, with the information reflecting the results of our second quarter and first half of 2024. Our team continues to focus on what matters in driving value in our business, focused on executing our plans reliably and responsibly, enhancing efficiencies, managing costs aggressively and building optionality value in our organic growth portfolio. During the second quarter, we generated strong margins and cash flows with $2.7 billion in EBITDA and $2 billion in operating cash flows. Our production volumes were largely in line with our estimates going into the period, but as we reported early July, our shipments of copper and gold were impacted in June as a result of obtaining export license in Indonesia, which has now been secured. I want to highlight two important items of significance and momentum for the future. The first item, Richard talked about it, it's the Indonesian smelter project advancing to the commissioning phase. As Richard discussed, our team has managed this large and complex project in an exemplary manner, and we're now focused on further derisking through a successful startup in the months ahead. Solid project execution is hallmark of our Freeport team who stepped up once again to deliver in a challenging environment for major capital projects. The successful completion of this strategic investment is of significance and positions us to secure a long-term extension of our operating rights in Indonesia. The second value driver I want to highlight is the ongoing momentum in our innovative leach project to build additional scale in low-cost incremental production. Continued scaling of this initiative is a major value driver and a differentiator for Freeport. As you'll see, our second quarter and first half incremental production from this initiative doubled from the comparable period since 2023. As we set our sights on scaling this initiative further, we see the opportunity to lower our unit costs in the U.S. meaningfully. We continue to execute our established shareholder return framework with $0.5 billion in dividends and share purchases year-to-date. We ended the quarter in a strong position financially, with a favorable future outlook as we head into the second half of this year. Turning to copper markets on Slide 4. Richard just talked about this, copper prices traded in a broad range between $3.67 per pound and $4.92 per pound on the LME exchange and a wider range on the U.S. COMEX exchange, that's been -- during 2024. We've discussed on prior calls, the impact of macro sentiment and investor positioning that can drive large moves in pricing. Richard referred to the domestic economic challenges in China, the ongoing weakness in the Chinese property market, destocking and working capital management and increase in copper exchange inventories and delays in actions to stimulate economic growth, which have all weighed on the market. In the U.S., we're seeing -- continuing to see strong demand for copper from a broad range of sectors. And globally, we favorable demand drivers for the future associated with copper's increasingly important role in the global economy. Copper is a foundational essential metal when it comes to electrification, and the world is becoming more and more focused on copper-intensive energy applications. The facts are its physical characteristics and superior conductivity make it the metal of electrification. New massive investment in the power grid, renewable generation, technology infrastructure and transportation are driving increased demand for copper and forecast call for above-trend growth and demand for the foreseeable future. As we review the fundamentals and match the demand side up with supply, we look at the limitations of existing supply growth, the challenges and extended time frames required to build new supplies and projections for peak mine supply over the next couple of years. These factors, combined with secular demand trends point to tight market conditions as we go forward. With Freeport's leading position in the industry, large-scale current operations and future growth pipeline, we're very well positioned to benefit from this fundamental outlook in the future. Now, turning to our operations on slide 5. We summarized the quarterly operating results by geographic region. In the US, we continue to focus our efforts on mitigating the impact of lower ore grade phases currently being mined. You'll see in our operational details provided in our press release that the ore grades processed through our mill and leach facilities in the US had more than a 10% decrease in ore grades compared to the year ago period. All else being equal, this results in higher costs on a per unit basis. We're very focused on mitigating these impacts, and to mitigate it, we're focused on initiatives to improve productivity, equipment reliability, take advantage of automation and new technologies and importantly, add low-cost incremental volumes through our innovative leach initiative, and we think this can have an impact as we go forward. In South America, our team and our large-scale Cerro Verde operation posted a solid second quarter. You can see the mill throughput exceeded 425,000 tons of ore per day. This is a strong recovery from the first quarter with higher throughput and recoveries contributed to higher copper and molybdenum volumes. Our unit net cash costs improved sequentially from the first quarter in South America, even after giving effect to a $0.22 per pound non-recurring charge for the new labor agreement reached during the quarter. In Indonesia, despite delays in shipping during the month of June, the results were strong, and you'll see net unit cash credits of $0.21 per pound. Our quarterly mill rates were lower than what we achieved in the first quarter as we advanced maintenance in June to manage inventory during the shipping delays. We also announced previously a change in mine sequencing that will affect gold volumes for the year. During the second quarter, we modified our mine plans for 2024 to address some disruption from certain wet draw points in the Grasberg Block Cave. We're currently maintaining our mining rates but have shifted to areas with slightly lower gold grades as we implement operating solutions to regain access to the higher-grade material. This is a timing matter and not a significant issue for our long-term plans. I want to talk some more about our innovative leach initiative, and we've got some information on slide 6. We're continuing to build momentum with this initiative. Given the low incremental cost and low capital intensity associated with these activities, which essentially involve recovering incremental copper from material that has already been mined. The returns and value proposition on this opportunity are significant and a major catalyst for us. You can see the significant growth in incremental volumes from these initiatives over the last several quarters. As a refresher, we have achieved our initial targeted run rate of 200 million pounds of copper per annum and now have our sights on scaling this to 400 million pounds per annum in the next couple of years. Ultimately, our goal is to achieve 800 million pounds per annum from this exciting initiative. This is the size of a major new mine with low capital investment required and incremental operating costs, which will greatly enhance the value and competitive position of our Americas production. I want to go over how we're doing this. The results to date have been achieved by enhancing heat retention in the leach stockpiles, by using data from sensors and analytics, which help us identify where the opportunities are located within these massive stockpiles and deploying new operational tactics to bring our catalyst solution to areas that were previously inaccessible. We're now building on these successful initiatives and have a high degree of confidence in boosting the run rate to 300 million pounds to 400 million pounds during 2026. Some examples of new initiatives include, expanding our surface area under leach by using drone technology and helicopters to install irrigations in areas previously inaccessible under conventional techniques and scaling our solution injection wells. With this experience, we're drilling more efficiently, getting more injection wells placed and are testing techniques to expand the impact of injection wells over broader areas. In parallel, we're working on innovation-driven initiatives, which would really move the needle to our ultimate objective of reaching 800 million pounds for annum. These include adding direct heat to the stockpiles from renewable or other sources, taking advantage of pyrite-hosted ore to generate additional heat and testing new additives that we've been developing. At Freeport, we're really well positioned to capture this value with an extensive inventory of substantial residual copper from material already mined, industry-leading technical expertise and leaching technology and a strong multi-disciplined and focused innovation team dedicated to this initiative. Turning to our other areas of growth of project pipeline on Slide 7. We discussed earlier the extended time frames required for the industry to develop new supplies. At Freeport, we have the advantage of leveraging existing infrastructure to develop new supplies and have a series of projects we are advancing. Our leach initiative is our best opportunity to grow in the near term, and we're pursuing this aggressively as we talked about. But beyond that, in the US, we have a brownfield expansion at our Bagdad mine in Arizona where we have an extensive reserve position. We've already reported. We've completed our studies. We're now advancing investments in automation, tailings and energy infrastructure and expanded employee housing in this remote location to position us to execute the project more efficiently when the time is right. This project, unlike other things that you see around the industry, it does not have major permitting hurdles and it represents a straightforward option. We're monitoring conditions and progress with our derisking initiatives and expect to be in a position to make a decision on our investment next year. We've also commenced pre-feasibility studies to define a brownfield expansion in the Lone Star, Safford District. Most of you know, this is our newest operation in the US and we're really just getting started here. We have our sights on more than doubling current production levels in the 300 million pounds per annum range. This is an enormous resource, and we expect this district will become a generational cornerstone asset for Freeport in Arizona in the next decade. At El Abra in Chile, where we are in partnership with CODELCO, we have completed pre-feasibility studies, and we're now preparing an environmental impact statement expected to be completed by the end of next year. The project involves \u2013 that we're considering, involves an investment in a new concentrator of scale similar to the size of Cerro Verde concentrator we installed nearly 10 years ago, investments in desalinization and a pipeline system to support our water requirements. The preliminary estimate for incremental capital costs for the new concentrator project and related infrastructure, which continue to be reviewed approximate $7.5 billion and would provide 750 million pounds of annual copper production and 9 million pounds of molybdenum per annum over a very long life. This project would require about seven to eight years of lead time because of permitting requirements, but we're advancing so we have optionality, and we're going to continue to review the economics in the context of market conditions, but believe this is a project that will be required in the future to support long-term copper demand trends. In Indonesia, we're making great progress on our large-scale Kucing Liar development scheduled to commence production prior to 2030. We're also conducting additional exploration below our Deep MLZ ore body and expect an extension of our operating lines beyond 2041 will set up for additional long-term exploration and development options in this highly-attractive district. We're advancing all these initiatives to build optionality for growth, and we'll continue to be disciplined in our approach, targeting opportunities that can be executed efficiently, profitably and value-enhancing. Richard talked about the PT-FI extension beyond 2041, and the key role that the smelter plays in that process. We've reviewed in the past our discussions with Indonesian government to extend our rights, to provide continuity of the significant benefits of this operation to the people of Papua and Republic of Indonesia. During the second quarter, the government enacted a regulation applicable to a broad range of license holders in Indonesia. We've highlighted the applicable provisions for IUPK license holders such as PT-FI, and these are the requirements for the conditions, which need to be met to \u2013 for approval for an extension. These conditions are in line with our expectations, and we're in the process of completing an application to be in a position to file the application during 2024. The previous requirement for extensions could only be requested five years before expiry. So these new regulations allow us to apply now, reflecting the government's recognition of the long lead times required for investment. It is a really positive development for PT-FI and its stakeholders. We look forward to making our application and be in a position to extend our rights so that we can continue our long-range planning and maximize the value of this great resource. Slide 9 shows our three-year outlook for sales volumes of copper, gold and molybdenum, made some modest changes to 2024 copper sales, reflecting small revisions in the US and Indonesia. And as previously discussed, our gold volumes for 2024 will now reflect the change in the mine sequencing, which we discussed earlier, and this is really timing in nature. The rest of the guidance is very similar to our previous outlook. For 2024, we currently estimate consolidated unit cash costs to approximate $1.63 per pound, slightly above the April estimate of $1.57 and similar to our guidance of $1.60 per pound at the start of the year. The details of this are presented in the back -- on Slide 20, in reference materials. Slide 10 shows the cash flow generating capacity of this business, putting together our projected volumes and cost projections. We show a modeled result for our EBITDA and cash flow at various copper prices ranging from $4 a pound to $5 per pound copper. With these model results for 2025 and 2026 and current volume and cost estimates, holding gold flat at $2,300 per ounce and molybdenum flat at $20 a pound, EBITDA on an annual basis would range from nearly $11 billion per annum at $4 copper to $15 billion per annum at $5 copper. And our operating cash flows under these price cases would range from $7.5 billion per year to $11 billion at $5 copper. And we show some sensitivities for your reference on the right of this chart. We've got long life reserves, large-scale production. We're really well-positioned to benefit from a better fundamental picture as we go forward. On Slide 11, we show as we have in the past, our current forecast for capital expenditures in 2024 and 2025 -- capital expenditures for 2024, our forecast of approximate $3.7 billion and $4.1 billion in 2025. It's a relatively small increase over two years and principally relates to revisions and estimates for our sustaining capital program and long-term projects in the Grasberg District. We're going to continue to be disciplined in deploying capital, really making sure that the capital we're deploying pays off and build initiatives to enhance value. The discretionary projects over this two-year period totaled $2.5 billion. This is the category that reflects the capital investments we're making in new projects that under our financial policy are funded with 50% of available cash that is not distributed. We've got some details in the back on Slide 23 in our reference materials that provide some more information about these projects, which are value-enhancing and it will help us as we look to build value in the future. On Slide 12, in conclusion, we reiterate the financial policy priorities centered on a strong balance sheet, cash returns to shareholders, and investments in value-enhancing growth projects. Our balance sheet is solid. We've got strong credit metrics and flexibility within our debt targets to execute on our strategy. During the quarter, our credit rating was upgraded by S&P and now we're investment-grade rating by all three major rating agencies. As indicated on the slide, we've distributed $4.3 billion to shareholders year-to-date through dividends and share purchases. We've got an attractive future long-term portfolio that allow us to continue to build value and follow-up policy of investing in projects that build long-term value and returning cash to shareholders. We actively monitor the market conditions and carefully manage the timing of our projects to make sure our financial flexibility remains strong. Our global team is driven by value. We're focused on our clear strategy to execute our plans, invest in our future and return cash to shareholders. And thank you for your attention, and we'll now take your questions.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alan Spence with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nAlan Spence: Thank you all. Good morning.\nKathleen Quirk: Good morning, Alan.\nAlan Spence: Good morning, Kathleen, Maree and Richard. On the North American operations, your grades were lower year-on-year. And the leaching volumes in Q2 annualizing above the 2024 target, yet copper sales guidance was decreased, I appreciate just by 1%. But do we put those together and conclude that North American kind of optimization targets are maybe proving a bit more challenging this year?\nKathleen Quirk: Alan, we are really focused on productivity in North America. This is a big priority of our management team. During the second quarter, we made really good progress. We've got a series of metrics we're following that will drive the production higher. The one area that we're working on is we're continuing to have some unplanned maintenance, some disruptions caused by that. And really the asset health and reliability programs that we're putting in place and continue to build on, which has been a hallmark of our US operations are important to make sure that we meet our production targets. So I think we feel we're turning the corner. We've got very, very sharp focus on these things. The leach production is helping us to offset these impacts of low ore grades, and as I mentioned before, that's really going to help us bring down the average cost of our US production as we scale this further. But we've got to get these productivity objectives met. We're making progress on it. We had some issues in the quarter with some downtime in our mill and also some of our crush and convey facilities, but we're making progress to make sure our equipment is reliable and we don't have unplanned outages. And that's something we're really focused on as we go forward.\nAlan Spence: Thanks for that. And just a quick follow-up question on the leaching. You provided some helpful additional color on it. You mentioned a high probability of getting to the $300 million to $400 million range by 2026. But just to confirm, none of that would be in current 2026 sales volume guidance?\nKathleen Quirk: Right. The -- we basically got our current rate that we're sustaining on the 200 million pounds per annum into our forecast. And so to the extent that we build on that scale and have a high confidence that we will, that is -- that provides some upside to our numbers. And what also provides upside is these productivity initiatives that I mentioned coming into play. So we know what to focus on. We've got teams working on it, and we're going to get there. But this leach thing will really help with the unit costs.\nAlan Spence: Understood. Thanks, Kathleen.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nCarlos De Alba: Yeah. Thank you very much. Good morning, Kathleen and Richard. So Kathleen, just continue with the discussion on the leach projects and initiatives in North America. Can you remind us or give us some color as to how much lower cash cost does those initiatives or those volumes have relative to the North American and overall current cash cost?\nKathleen Quirk: Yeah. So the incremental cost per pound for the leach initiatives or under $1 per pound incrementally. And the reason why they're lower is because the -- essentially, the mining cost has already been incurred. So this is ore that is in stockpiles where we're essentially recovering more metal than what our prior plans suggested we could do. And so we're identifying places within the stockpile where the rock has not gotten the benefit of this catalyst solution. And we've been able to identify these areas through our censoring and data analytics. And so now we're working on operational tactics to go after it. And so essentially, you don't have the mining cost because you've already incurred that. So this is all just incremental. And so that -- to the extent it scales, that has the benefit of bringing down the average unit cost in the US. And so it's something we're really, really focused on because it will change the competitive position of these US operations, principally our Morenci mine, which has most this potential. So we're really excited about it. We've got new technologies. We're bringing in some expertise from other industries, adjacent industries. It's helping us. We've got the agricultural industry that we've been taking the page from. We've got oil and gas industry, services industry that's helping us with some of these drilling techniques where we're drilling basically putting the solution. Usually, it's irrigated through, but over time, there's blockages, so we're now able to directly drill and put solution down into areas that aren't getting the benefit of the solution. And that's giving us a boost. We also call this other initiative, Leach Everywhere, and that's what I was referring to, where we're accessing areas that we couldn't get to before, and we're now able to get to them with drone technology helicopters where we can go places where humans couldn't go to lay these irrigation lines. So there's a lot happening here, a lot of excitement. We've got really major new mine potential here without big capital intensity and low incremental operating costs. So we're all over this one, Carlos. And -- but it does help us in terms of the incremental operating cost position of the US operations, the more we scale it.\nCarlos De Alba: Thanks, Kathleen. And maybe just another one, and I understand this might be difficult to answer precisely. But with the new regulation for IUPK in Indonesia in place, and basically, as you mentioned, PT-FI imposition or having met basically the requirements to apply for an extension. What is the path ahead to get the approval of extension? I don't know if there is anything on timing or milestones that you can point to, and is this something that we have to wait until the new President is sworn in?\nKathleen Quirk : Well, the regulation was issued. We were waiting for a while the regulation to be finalized. And the regulation was issued in -- at the end of May. So that's a really positive development. And the catalyst really to put us in a position to be qualified as an integrated producer, which you have to be under this regulation to apply for a life of mine extension was the smelter. And so moving the smelter into commissioning and to the operational phase as we move into the next few months, really positions us to be able to apply. None of the conditions that are outlined in the regulation were surprises to us. It was in line with what we've been talking about with the government for some time now. We've got to actually put together the application package, which we're doing and we can apply now at any time. So we expect to apply to the license, there's not any guidelines for how long the government has to respond to that application. But the discussions we've had previously have been that the government wants to move forward with this quickly because they understand the long lead times, and they want to really see us get started on defining new resources and mine plans that allow us to have a continuity beyond 2041. So our objective is to get this done during 2024. I think that is really doable. And whether or not it's within this administration, the current administration is in place through October. I think there's large spread positive reaction to the smelter and to PT-FI being an integrated producer and to continuing the long-term benefits. And so whether it's this administration or the next, I think there's positive momentum for PT-FI to get this done during 2024.\nCarlos De Alba : Thank you.\nRichard Adkerson : And Kathleen, let me just add that this is different from what we had to face in the past. We're not debating on this. It's in everyone's best interest there's widespread acceptance for it. And there's a clear understanding now that shareholder -- all stakeholders benefit from us looking how to maximize the value of this resource. So it's -- for those of you who follow us in the past, this is a different process, and it's very positive.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Liam Fitzpatrick with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nLiam Fitzpatrick: Good morning everyone. Just a question around the new smelter in Indonesia and the ramp-up profile. On the face of it, it appears a fairly optimistic target to achieve full capacity by year-end, just given the size and the complexity of it. So can you give us some color on some of the key ramp-up milestones that you'll need to achieve through H2 to hit that target? And then separately, moving forward, do you plan to give us any separate disclosure for the smelter, so that we can assess the operating performance and the profitability so on? Thank you.\nKathleen Quirk: Liam, in terms of your first question, it is a very large complex project and smelter startups there aren't a lot of them on the scale in the Western world in recent years. And so we've recognized that for some time and have been planning for this over an extensive period of time. We've brought together the expertise that Freeport has around the world in operating smelters. We operate a smelter in the US, in Arizona. We have efficient smelter in Huelva, Spain, that we've operated for some time. We also have an existing smelter in Indonesia that we're in partnership with a Japanese partner there that has been very successful. So we've brought to bear all of the expertise in not only looking at construction, and we've had a team, a dedicated team on the construction side who have just done a great job. But on an operational side, we've been standing up this team for some time to be able to run the smelter and training people, we've had \u2013 we've already got the people employed. We've brought in expertise from around the world to lead startup. And so we've planned for it. And your point is well understood by the company. We feel we're well-prepared for it, with any start-up you're going to have issues. We recognize that. But every time we've thrown issues and challenges at this team through the construction period and into the commissioning period, we've been able to overcome them. I hope you have a chance, if you haven't already, to look at the video showing really where this \u2013 where the smelter is in terms of operational readiness, and we're showing all the various facilities as part of it. So we've planned for it. We understand it's going to be a different way of marketing our product. In the past, in Indonesia, we've loaded concentrate on a ship and pay the TC/RC and collected our revenue, and that was pretty simple. Now it's got a more a more complex logistics situation, and we've got a number of products we'll be marketing. But the team has been working on this, and we've got expertise in operating smelters and marketing various products. And so we're well situated for it. In terms of the reporting, it will be reported. It's integrated into PT-FI. It will be reported as part of PT-FI's results, you'll be able to see its operating costs through the TC and RC line on our unit cost. But above that line in the revenue line, of course, we're going to be able to generate higher revenues because we're marketing directly. We have the -- essentially the free metal that will come through to our benefit. We don't have to pay a smelter, the payable factors, et cetera. So, it will be a piece of revenues and a piece of operating costs, but we'll provide disclosures to help you through that. We won't have the duties any longer. And so that's a sizable benefit as well. for our results. But just in terms of the operations and readiness, I'm going to ask Cory Stevens make a couple of comments. Cory is -- he Heads up our Engineering Group, our Project Construction Group, our group that deals with operational efficiencies. So, he's got a big portfolio, not only leading the smelter project, but also the leach innovation initiative. But Cory is just back from Indonesia and maybe, Cory, you can just supplement what I was talking about in terms of the readiness for operations.\nCory Stevens: Yes. Thanks Kathleen. Yes. So, the commissioning work is well underway. It's a number of giant unit processes and the teams are collaborating between operations and Kathleen mentioned it, but we've got a large contingent of operating folks from around the world, we're calling boots on the ground, and they're all out there together working side-by-side to commission this large project. I mean, it's pretty -- it's immense. And just to give you an idea, I mean, there's 45,000 pieces of instrumentation and computer connections that we're verifying and double checking and running the equipment through the operating ranges to be able to start up. And the ramp-up plan, when we go to start this up, I mean the plant wasn't designed to run very slow. So, you end up having to run it at essentially 50% capacity or a little bit better than that right from the start. And so there's a lot of checks and safety checks going on right now to be able operate at that level and then double check the procedures so forth and then we'll be able to ramp up from there. So, team's energized, it's well choreographed and has been planned for years, and we're ready to make it happen.\nKathleen Quirk: Yes. And I just want to emphasize one thing at Freeport, when we do a major project, we benefit from having a centralized team that supports operating teams. And so unlike some other companies that don't have this kind of infrastructure that can really help manage the construction period and transition to operations, we really can bring together the best of the best when it comes to executing a start-up. And I'm not sugarcoating, we're going to have things that come up, we know that, but we really have the right people that -- in place to have a safe and efficient start-up. We expect in August that we'll get first processing of concentrate through the facility. And as Cory said, the ramp up we expect to move pretty quickly to go through the end of 2025 -- I mean 2024, we're also -- we got a precious metal refinery that will be starting up in the same timeframe. in the revenue line, of course, we're going to be able to generate higher revenues because we're marketing directly. We have the -- essentially the free metal that will come through to our benefit. We don't have to pay a smelter, the payable factors, et cetera. So, it will be a piece of revenues and a piece of operating costs, but we'll provide disclosures to help you through that. We won't have the duties any longer. And so that's a sizable benefit as well. for our results. But just in terms of the operations and readiness, I'm going to ask Cory Stevens make a couple of comments. Cory is -- he Heads up our Engineering Group, our Project Construction Group, our group that deals with operational efficiencies.

And as Cory said, the ramp up we expect to move pretty quickly to go through the end of 2025 -- I mean 2024, we're also -- we got a precious metal refinery that will be starting up in the same time frame. So a lot has gone into this project, a lot of planning. And it's been executed well, and we expect that we'll continue to execute it well through the ramp-up.\nLiam Fitzpatrick: That was a very comprehensive answer. So thank you both. Could I just ask a quick follow-up? Is there one item along the critical path over the next few months that you'd highlight that once you get through that, you'll be sleeping a bit easier at night?\nKathleen Quirk: Cory, you have one on your mind?\nCory Stevens: Yes. So we're taking extra precautions on the second stage of the smelting furnace, the flash converting furnace, there's only six of these running in the world. It's fairly specialized and we're taking extra precautions there. That is at the heart of what's going to enable the smelter to operate at the levels that we want to.\nLiam Fitzpatrick: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nBob Brackett: Good morning. A question around the gold sales revision. I understand the wet conditions in the Block Cave changed your mine sequencing into maybe a lower gold grade area, but why doesn't those ounces come back in the plan period? So if you lost 0.2 million ounces this year, wouldn't you argue that it should reappear in 2025 or 2026?\nKathleen Quirk: Yes, it's 150,000 ounces, Bob, and it comes back into our plan over the next few years. And so it just didn't -- it didn't round enough to up our numbers, but it is purely a timing situation. And when we look at the \u2013 our overall 5-year plan, it really it didn't change much. Mark Johnson is on the call, the issue we had in the second quarter, and we expect will continue for a period 2024 is we had some wet draw points that had spillage that we couldn't get back in to clean up. It took -- takes a while to clean it up. We've got a robust remote mining, underground mining system, and that's working really well. And what the team is working on is a remote pumping system that allows us to clean up these spills more quickly, and so we don't have as much disruption in these areas. But it really is just a timing thing. And Mark, I don't know if there's anything you want to add to those comments?\nMark Johnson: No, Kathleen, I think you touched on it. We've been managing wet muck going back to the IOZ, so roughly over 20 years. Some of the things, as you mentioned, we had some spills that traveled a bit further. So that in the GBC, there's some unique material characteristics that we're mitigating. And the primary one, as Kathleen mentioned, is the ability to remotely place pumping equipment and pump out the water that accumulates during some of our time entry criteria. So what we have is a period of time that we wait to get safely back in, what we're seeing is that the water builds up during that period of waiting. By getting the remote pumping in, we'll be able to have it pump before the -- while this time is taking place and then we can start our cleanup much quicker. One of the things that we did in GBC is -- that was a bit unique, we -- because it's the foundation of our operation and the primary source of value, we built in the additional operational flexibility by developing more draw points than theoretically required to meet the production rate. And that's what allowed us to shift to this other area that had very similar copper grades, but incrementally lower gold grades. And as Kathleen mentioned, over the five years, that that goal you had mentioned is back in the plan. And we plan to have this mitigation measure strongly in place, firmly in place in the fourth quarter, and I'm confident we can do that.\nBob Brackett: Great. That's very clear. A quick follow-up on sort of the third condition around the IUPK application is commitment for additional exploration and increases in refining capacity, is that a hard dollar amount that you have to put into the application? Or is that something that you've discussed? Or is that a softer sort of target?\nKathleen Quirk: That's something that would be approved by the by the Minister of Energy & Minerals. We've been talking with the government. We do have plans to conduct exploration and we're doing some of that now. In the future, we'll conduct additional exploration that will allow us to identify additional resources. And so that is -- it's really part of our plan for extension. In terms of the additional refining capacity, there's been discussion with the government. There is an aspiration to have additional capacity in Papua. Our current smelter is located in Gresik, and there's an aspiration to have additional capacity in Papua, and that continues to be discussed with the government. But there's not a -- the regulation doesn't have a specific number or level of investment. It really is a matter of looking at what's needed in country and the desire is to have it located in Papua, and we'll be working to evaluate that along with the government.\nBob Brackett: Very clear. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Orest Wowkodaw with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nOrest Wowkodaw: Hi. Good morning. Just a clarification on the potential IUPK extension. The -- it sounds like you're moving towards giving up an extra 10% in the asset post 2041, would you receive any proceeds for that? Or is that effectively just the cost of the extension?\nKathleen Quirk: The 10%, offering a 10% interest to a state-owned company, and we're talking with MIND ID about their objective to acquire additional 10%. The discussions we've had to date with the government have involved offering that 10%, and this is coming from FCX's shares, offering that 10% at -- with a reimbursement of our capital costs incurred for the current period through 2041 to the extent that, that benefits the period beyond 2041. So it's essentially a book value concept. And the rationale for offering the 10% and the mechanism for valuing it has been that the government is granting PT-FI with the extension and it's a cost of the deal. And from our perspective, being able to extend beyond 2041, there's a lot of value there that if we don't move forward and make investments that we won't be able to accomplish. So we felt it in the spirit of the partnership we have with the government where it's a one-off alignment and a win-win that this was an appropriate to give us the optionality to have value significant value beyond 2041.\nOrest Wowkodaw: Okay. Thank you. And just as a quick follow-up, it's nice to see the buyback resume here in July. It's been two years, I think, since we've seen any share repurchase. Should we expect that now to ramp up in the second half of the year with the smelter commissioning and ramp-up?\nKathleen Quirk: The financial policy is basically one where we distribute through dividends and share purchases, available cash, 50% of available cash. The smelter investments were not part of that math. So we're financing the separately. So the available cash definition is really just the flow and less the CapEx that's required for the current operation. It doesn't include the smelter. It doesn't include our future growth that we're investing in the discretionary projects that we've labeled earlier. So that will be a function of what our cash flows are. We certainly want to continue buying back stock, but it will be a function of what ultimate cash flows, and we'll continue to follow that policy.\nOrest Wowkodaw: Thank you.\nKathleen Quirk: Just as a reminder, we're moving past the hour here, and I know people have been asking more than one question, so please limit to one and we'll get back to you with follow-ups.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Michael Dudas with VRP. Please go ahead.\nKathleen Quirk: Hi, Mike.\nMichael Dudas: David and Richard.\nRichard Adkerson : Hey, Mike.\nKathleen Quirk: Mike, I think your line is cutting out.\nMichael Dudas: Can you hear me now?\nKathleen Quirk: I can hear you now.\nMichael Dudas: Thank you. Your relationship and negotiations with the Indonesian government has been going quite well as you portrayed here today and in past calls. Maybe you can update us on how things are in Peru, Chile, maybe even in North America, how -- relative to the amount of investments that you're going to be looking at, maybe others and your competitors as well, how that's played out given the volatility and the upside in the copper price and any thought from those governments and those ministers to move along with the needed supplies that the market seems to be calling for?\nKathleen Quirk: I think in South America, there's a strong desire to see more investment certainly Peru and Chile, both, want to see more investment in mining is such a big part of their economy. So they are very, very interested. Now you've got to make sure you've got the community and social matters done in the right way, but there is a strong desire for those to make investments. Chile is going through a process now of looking at its permitting and trying to streamline permitting. We talked about El Abra project going through a long permitting process, and we're hopeful that this process that the government is now undertaking will allow a streamlining of permits. But I think both countries want to see more investment in mining. The US as well, you've seen that in recent times with the US prioritizing metals that are critical to the supply chain. And so I think the environment for -- in these countries for making investments is more positive than it has been in the past. But again, I want to emphasize the social aspect of this and the community aspect. It doesn't mean that, that lowers the bar and what our responsibilities are to sustainability into communities and environmental management and social good. So you've got to tick all the boxes, but there is a growing recognition of a need for these metals, and copper is one of the leads for that. So we are in a good position. We're in a particularly good position in the US with our current operations where \u2013 what we're talking about doing is building on existing operations. And so the permitting requirements are not as extensive for types of projects we're pursuing as they would be for a greenfield project or project in Chile, for example. And US is also talking about streamlining, permitting and regulatory. So we're in a good position, the Lone Star, Safford opportunity that I talked about earlier is one that even though our studies are a little behind where we are in Chile with El Abra, that project will catch up pretty quickly because we don't have the extensive permitting requirements to do that project that we have in Chile. So we're very focused on getting that project defined, so we can look at them together and see, which one is -- drives the most value for our business and shareholders. And so we really have an advantage in the US with the existing operations and leveraging our current position. Of course, the leaching doesn't require new permits. So we're in a good position to bring on projects more quickly than maybe others could.\nRichard Adkerson: Years of commitment to doing what Kathleen just said of doing the right thing, building relationships have led us in the US to have uniform support from communities, from native American groups, from state governments and regulators. The same goes true in Peru for our Cerro Verde project in the Arequipa region where Peru can be very challenging. It's got very challenging politics right now, but we benefit from work we've done to support the community and that's very helpful. And then in Chile, we're \u2013 our 49% partner at El Abra is CODELCO, and they are very anxious for us to move forward and very supportive. We developed a relationship with [indiscernible] will be on a panel with him at APAC and Peru this fall. And the tone has significantly changed from his initial election period where he's met the realities of the need for Chile to help support the mining sector. This is always such a big important part of our business, as you can see around the world. We learned a lot of lessons early on with the development of Grasberg and the need to have good relationships with indigenous people there as well as with central government. So, I'm proud of what our team has done, and we're just committed to finding common ground and doing things in the right way.\nMichael Dudas: Very helpful Richard and Kathleen. Thank you.\nKathleen Quirk: Thanks Mike.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Lawson Winder with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\nLawson Winder: Operator, thank you very much and Kathleen and Richard, hello and thank you for making the time for my call -- my question. I'll just keep it brief. I wanted to ask about Kucing Liar, hugely high-return project for you all. Effectively one topic, three questions. I just wanted to get an update on when you were expecting first production and then ask as to the pace of spending? So, I mean it's a $4 billion project, and you're noting that about $400 million have been spent to date over a period of about two years. When do you expect that to start to pick up a little more? Thanks very, very much.\nKathleen Quirk: Lawson, you're right. It's like our other projects, long-term development, Grasberg underground blockade, the capital is spent over a multiyear period. And we do, in our projections, show that we'll start ramping up spending in Kucing Liar as we go forward. The average of $400 million a year over a 10-year period was -- we're spending a little bit lower than that, and that will begin to ramp up and we'll have some years where it's higher than $400 million. And there may be additional development in that $4 billion that will occur after we start. So, -- but we are expecting a start-up KL towards the end of this decade in advance of 2030. And it is a very large scale, 90,000 tons a day of ore, significant copper and gold production from that deposit. A real benefit of this extension beyond 2041, is the resource is much larger than what we'll mine between late 20s, late 2020s and in 2041. So, we'll have -- we did the economics and the economics paid at just the life that ends in 2041. But there's a lot of resource beyond that, that will come in the fold with an extension. So, it's a great extension of Grasberg. It's in that district. We're leveraging everything that we've learned from developing the Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ, and prior to that, our other ore bodies, but it's basically the same kind of development that we've had in the past, and we're using all the new learnings and technologies that have benefited us in the development of Grasberg Block Cave. So, we're in a good place there and feel good about our execution of this project over the next several years, leading into 2030, where we'll have good production coming from this operation.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Brian MacArthur with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nKathleen Quirk: Hey, Brian.\nBrian MacArthur: Good morning, Rick. Good morning, Rick and Kathleen. Thank you for taking my question. I just want to go back to this 10% on the IUPK. I just want to confirm, A, until 2041 you maintain your 48.76%. I think that's what I understand is that it's 10% thereafter. But then two, on the capital, do you put it all in for 2041 and then get it back? Or is this going to be more like for a while at Rio, where as you develop reserves and their ownership goes up, that you share the cap in different ratios like we saw that said, with the Rio Tinto stuff historically. I'm just trying to figure out exactly like how the cash flows are going to work on this.\nKathleen Quirk: Yes. Well, as part of the application to the government for the extension, we will submit an agreement to make the transaction. And that agreement is currently being discussed with MIND ID. The -- what's been discussed over the last couple of years with respect to this, or the last year plus, is the way it will work is the 10% share transfer will take place in 2041. And the price paid at that point will be a reimbursement of the capital that was incurred between now and 2041 that benefits the period beyond 2021. So to the extent, it's not like the Rio Tinto deal at all. It's basically just a reimbursement at book value of what's there to benefit the period beyond 2041. So essentially, look at the at the book value end of 2041 and that pro rata percentage, 10% of our shares will be transferred and that will be the purchase price will be the reimbursement of capital. So the cash flows between now and 2041 won't be impacted by it.\nRichard Adkerson: And Brian, that transaction occurs after 2041. It's not like the Rio deal where the transaction occurred in the mid-90s, and it was just a question of how it was applied. So if for whatever reason it doesn't occur, then our interest will stay the same. It's anticipated the government would act to acquire that 10%, and that would be the agreement on the cost reimbursement, we get triggered when that transaction occurs.\nBrian MacArthur: All right.\nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of Bill Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nBill Peterson: Hi, Kathleen and team. Thanks for taking the question. Nice to see the doubling of the leaching in the first half 2024 relative to the first half last year. Looking ahead, how should we think about the trajectory from here? Do you expect to be at a similar output as the recent quarter, 55 million pounds or some of the productivity items you highlighted, such as using technology, you see further upside in the back half of the year and into 2025 as you progress to the 300 million to 400 million pounds per year target in 2026?\nKathleen Quirk: The current run rate is what's in our numbers. We do see opportunities to build on it through these initiatives that we're pursuing to move up to this 300 million to 400 million pound per annum range. And so it will come over time. It's not going to come in all at once. And so as we go through this year and next year, we'll probably have more than what we've currently got in our plans. But we haven't put forward. We're still deploying these tactics, we feel very confident about them, but we haven't put those into our numbers at this stage, and that will be something that we'll continue to update as we go forward.\nBill Peterson: Thank you.\nOperator: With that, I'll turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks.\nKathleen Quirk: Thank you, Regina, and thank you, everyone, for your interest and participation. And if you have any follow-ups, feel free to contact David.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

So we're taking extra precautions on the second stage of the smelting furnace, the flash converting furnace, there's only six of these running in the world. It's fairly specialized and we're taking extra precautions there. That is at the heart of what's going to enable the smelter to operate at the levels that we want to."

            "name": "Kathleen Quirk",
            "content": "Okay. Thank you, Richard, and I'm going to start on Slide 3, with the information reflecting the results of our second quarter and first half of 2024. Our team continues to focus on what matters in driving value in our business, focused on executing our plans reliably and responsibly, enhancing efficiencies, managing costs aggressively and building optionality value in our organic growth portfolio. During the second quarter, we generated strong margins and cash flows with $2.7 billion in EBITDA and $2 billion in operating cash flows. Our production volumes were largely in line with our estimates going into the period, but as we reported early July, our shipments of copper and gold were impacted in June as a result of obtaining export license in Indonesia, which has now been secured. I want to highlight two important items of significance and momentum for the future. The first item, Richard talked about it, it's the Indonesian smelter project advancing to the commissioning phase. As Richard discussed, our team has managed this large and complex project in an exemplary manner, and we're now focused on further derisking through a successful startup in the months ahead. Solid project execution is hallmark of our Freeport team who stepped up once again to deliver in a challenging environment for major capital projects. The successful completion of this strategic investment is of significance and positions us to secure a long-term extension of our operating rights in Indonesia. The second value driver I want to highlight is the ongoing momentum in our innovative leach project to build additional scale in low-cost incremental production. Continued scaling of this initiative is a major value driver and a differentiator for Freeport. As you'll see, our second quarter and first half incremental production from this initiative doubled from the comparable period since 2023. As we set our sights on scaling this initiative further, we see the opportunity to lower our unit costs in the U.S. meaningfully. We continue to execute our established shareholder return framework with $0.5 billion in dividends and share purchases year-to-date. We ended the quarter in a strong position financially, with a favorable future outlook as we head into the second half of this year. Turning to copper markets on Slide 4. Richard just talked about this, copper prices traded in a broad range between $3.67 per pound and $4.92 per pound on the LME exchange and a wider range on the U.S. COMEX exchange, that's been -- during 2024. We've discussed on prior calls, the impact of macro sentiment and investor positioning that can drive large moves in pricing. Richard referred to the domestic economic challenges in China, the ongoing weakness in the Chinese property market, destocking and working capital management and increase in copper exchange inventories and delays in actions to stimulate economic growth, which have all weighed on the market. In the U.S., we're seeing -- continuing to see strong demand for copper from a broad range of sectors. And globally, we favorable demand drivers for the future associated with copper's increasingly important role in the global economy. Copper is a foundational essential metal when it comes to electrification, and the world is becoming more and more focused on copper-intensive energy applications. The facts are its physical characteristics and superior conductivity make it the metal of electrification. New massive investment in the power grid, renewable generation, technology infrastructure and transportation are driving increased demand for copper and forecast call for above-trend growth and demand for the foreseeable future. As we review the fundamentals and match the demand side up with supply, we look at the limitations of existing supply growth, the challenges and extended time frames required to build new supplies and projections for peak mine supply over the next couple of years. These factors, combined with secular demand trends point to tight market conditions as we go forward. With Freeport's leading position in the industry, large-scale current operations and future growth pipeline, we're very well positioned to benefit from this fundamental outlook in the future. Now, turning to our operations on slide 5. We summarized the quarterly operating results by geographic region. In the US, we continue to focus our efforts on mitigating the impact of lower ore grade phases currently being mined. You'll see in our operational details provided in our press release that the ore grades processed through our mill and leach facilities in the US had more than a 10% decrease in ore grades compared to the year ago period. All else being equal, this results in higher costs on a per unit basis. We're very focused on mitigating these impacts, and to mitigate it, we're focused on initiatives to improve productivity, equipment reliability, take advantage of automation and new technologies and importantly, add low-cost incremental volumes through our innovative leach initiative, and we think this can have an impact as we go forward. In South America, our team and our large-scale Cerro Verde operation posted a solid second quarter. You can see the mill throughput exceeded 425,000 tons of ore per day. This is a strong recovery from the first quarter with higher throughput and recoveries contributed to higher copper and molybdenum volumes. Our unit net cash costs improved sequentially from the first quarter in South America, even after giving effect to a $0.22 per pound non-recurring charge for the new labor agreement reached during the quarter. In Indonesia, despite delays in shipping during the month of June, the results were strong, and you'll see net unit cash credits of $0.21 per pound. Our quarterly mill rates were lower than what we achieved in the first quarter as we advanced maintenance in June to manage inventory during the shipping delays. We also announced previously a change in mine sequencing that will affect gold volumes for the year. During the second quarter, we modified our mine plans for 2024 to address some disruption from certain wet draw points in the Grasberg Block Cave. We're currently maintaining our mining rates but have shifted to areas with slightly lower gold grades as we implement operating solutions to regain access to the higher-grade material. This is a timing matter and not a significant issue for our long-term plans. I want to talk some more about our innovative leach initiative, and we've got some information on slide 6. We're continuing to build momentum with this initiative. Given the low incremental cost and low capital intensity associated with these activities, which essentially involve recovering incremental copper from material that has already been mined. The returns and value proposition on this opportunity are significant and a major catalyst for us. You can see the significant growth in incremental volumes from these initiatives over the last several quarters. As a refresher, we have achieved our initial targeted run rate of 200 million pounds of copper per annum and now have our sights on scaling this to 400 million pounds per annum in the next couple of years. Ultimately, our goal is to achieve 800 million pounds per annum from this exciting initiative. This is the size of a major new mine with low capital investment required and incremental operating costs, which will greatly enhance the value and competitive position of our Americas production. I want to go over how we're doing this. The results to date have been achieved by enhancing heat retention in the leach stockpiles, by using data from sensors and analytics, which help us identify where the opportunities are located within these massive stockpiles and deploying new operational tactics to bring our catalyst solution to areas that were previously inaccessible. We're now building on these successful initiatives and have a high degree of confidence in boosting the run rate to 300 million pounds to 400 million pounds during 2026. Some examples of new initiatives include, expanding our surface area under leach by using drone technology and helicopters to install irrigations in areas previously inaccessible under conventional techniques and scaling our solution injection wells. With this experience, we're drilling more efficiently, getting more injection wells placed and are testing techniques to expand the impact of injection wells over broader areas. In parallel, we're working on innovation-driven initiatives, which would really move the needle to our ultimate objective of reaching 800 million pounds for annum. These include adding direct heat to the stockpiles from renewable or other sources, taking advantage of pyrite-hosted ore to generate additional heat and testing new additives that we've been developing. At Freeport, we're really well positioned to capture this value with an extensive inventory of substantial residual copper from material already mined, industry-leading technical expertise and leaching technology and a strong multi-disciplined and focused innovation team dedicated to this initiative. Turning to our other areas of growth of project pipeline on Slide 7. We discussed earlier the extended time frames required for the industry to develop new supplies. At Freeport, we have the advantage of leveraging existing infrastructure to develop new supplies and have a series of projects we are advancing. Our leach initiative is our best opportunity to grow in the near term, and we're pursuing this aggressively as we talked about. But beyond that, in the US, we have a brownfield expansion at our Bagdad mine in Arizona where we have an extensive reserve position. We've already reported. We've completed our studies. We're now advancing investments in automation, tailings and energy infrastructure and expanded employee housing in this remote location to position us to execute the project more efficiently when the time is right. This project, unlike other things that you see around the industry, it does not have major permitting hurdles and it represents a straightforward option. We're monitoring conditions and progress with our derisking initiatives and expect to be in a position to make a decision on our investment next year. We've also commenced pre-feasibility studies to define a brownfield expansion in the Lone Star, Safford District. Most of you know, this is our newest operation in the US and we're really just getting started here. We have our sights on more than doubling current production levels in the 300 million pounds per annum range. This is an enormous resource, and we expect this district will become a generational cornerstone asset for Freeport in Arizona in the next decade. At El Abra in Chile, where we are in partnership with CODELCO, we have completed pre-feasibility studies, and we're now preparing an environmental impact statement expected to be completed by the end of next year. The project involves \u2013 that we're considering, involves an investment in a new concentrator of scale similar to the size of Cerro Verde concentrator we installed nearly 10 years ago, investments in desalinization and a pipeline system to support our water requirements. The preliminary estimate for incremental capital costs for the new concentrator project and related infrastructure, which continue to be reviewed approximate $7.5 billion and would provide 750 million pounds of annual copper production and 9 million pounds of molybdenum per annum over a very long life. This project would require about seven to eight years of lead time because of permitting requirements, but we're advancing so we have optionality, and we're going to continue to review the economics in the context of market conditions, but believe this is a project that will be required in the future to support long-term copper demand trends. In Indonesia, we're making great progress on our large-scale Kucing Liar development scheduled to commence production prior to 2030. We're also conducting additional exploration below our Deep MLZ ore body and expect an extension of our operating lines beyond 2041 will set up for additional long-term exploration and development options in this highly-attractive district. We're advancing all these initiatives to build optionality for growth, and we'll continue to be disciplined in our approach, targeting opportunities that can be executed efficiently, profitably and value-enhancing. Richard talked about the PT-FI extension beyond 2041, and the key role that the smelter plays in that process. We've reviewed in the past our discussions with Indonesian government to extend our rights, to provide continuity of the significant benefits of this operation to the people of Papua and Republic of Indonesia. During the second quarter, the government enacted a regulation applicable to a broad range of license holders in Indonesia. We've highlighted the applicable provisions for IUPK license holders such as PT-FI, and these are the requirements for the conditions, which need to be met to \u2013 for approval for an extension. These conditions are in line with our expectations, and we're in the process of completing an application to be in a position to file the application during 2024. The previous requirement for extensions could only be requested five years before expiry. So these new regulations allow us to apply now, reflecting the government's recognition of the long lead times required for investment. It is a really positive development for PT-FI and its stakeholders. We look forward to making our application and be in a position to extend our rights so that we can continue our long-range planning and maximize the value of this great resource. Slide 9 shows our three-year outlook for sales volumes of copper, gold and molybdenum, made some modest changes to 2024 copper sales, reflecting small revisions in the US and Indonesia. And as previously discussed, our gold volumes for 2024 will now reflect the change in the mine sequencing, which we discussed earlier, and this is really timing in nature. The rest of the guidance is very similar to our previous outlook. For 2024, we currently estimate consolidated unit cash costs to approximate $1.63 per pound, slightly above the April estimate of $1.57 and similar to our guidance of $1.60 per pound at the start of the year. The details of this are presented in the back -- on Slide 20, in reference materials. Slide 10 shows the cash flow generating capacity of this business, putting together our projected volumes and cost projections. We show a modeled result for our EBITDA and cash flow at various copper prices ranging from $4 a pound to $5 per pound copper. With these model results for 2025 and 2026 and current volume and cost estimates, holding gold flat at $2,300 per ounce and molybdenum flat at $20 a pound, EBITDA on an annual basis would range from nearly $11 billion per annum at $4 copper to $15 billion per annum at $5 copper. And our operating cash flows under these price cases would range from $7.5 billion per year to $11 billion at $5 copper. And we show some sensitivities for your reference on the right of this chart. We've got long life reserves, large-scale production. We're really well-positioned to benefit from a better fundamental picture as we go forward. On Slide 11, we show as we have in the past, our current forecast for capital expenditures in 2024 and 2025 -- capital expenditures for 2024, our forecast of approximate $3.7 billion and $4.1 billion in 2025. It's a relatively small increase over two years and principally relates to revisions and estimates for our sustaining capital program and long-term projects in the Grasberg District. We're going to continue to be disciplined in deploying capital, really making sure that the capital we're deploying pays off and build initiatives to enhance value. The discretionary projects over this two-year period totaled $2.5 billion. This is the category that reflects the capital investments we're making in new projects that under our financial policy are funded with 50% of available cash that is not distributed. We've got some details in the back on Slide 23 in our reference materials that provide some more information about these projects, which are value-enhancing and it will help us as we look to build value in the future. On Slide 12, in conclusion, we reiterate the financial policy priorities centered on a strong balance sheet, cash returns to shareholders, and investments in value-enhancing growth projects. Our balance sheet is solid. We've got strong credit metrics and flexibility within our debt targets to execute on our strategy. During the quarter, our credit rating was upgraded by S&P and now we're investment-grade rating by all three major rating agencies. As indicated on the slide, we've distributed $4.3 billion to shareholders year-to-date through dividends and share purchases. We've got an attractive future long-term portfolio that allow us to continue to build value and follow-up policy of investing in projects that build long-term value and returning cash to shareholders. We actively monitor the market conditions and carefully manage the timing of our projects to make sure our financial flexibility remains strong. Our global team is driven by value. We're focused on our clear strategy to execute our plans, invest in our future and return cash to shareholders. And thank you for your attention, and we'll now take your questions. Good morning, Alan. Alan, we are really focused on productivity in North America. This is a big priority of our management team. During the second quarter, we made really good progress. We've got a series of metrics we're following that will drive the production higher. The one area that we're working on is we're continuing to have some unplanned maintenance, some disruptions caused by that. And really the asset health and reliability programs that we're putting in place and continue to build on, which has been a hallmark of our US operations are important to make sure that we meet our production targets. So I think we feel we're turning the corner. We've got very, very sharp focus on these things. The leach production is helping us to offset these impacts of low ore grades, and as I mentioned before, that's really going to help us bring down the average cost of our US production as we scale this further. But we've got to get these productivity objectives met. We're making progress on it. We had some issues in the quarter with some downtime in our mill and also some of our crush and convey facilities, but we're making progress to make sure our equipment is reliable and we don't have unplanned outages. And that's something we're really focused on as we go forward. Right. The -- we basically got our current rate that we're sustaining on the 200 million pounds per annum into our forecast. And so to the extent that we build on that scale and have a high confidence that we will, that is -- that provides some upside to our numbers. And what also provides upside is these productivity initiatives that I mentioned coming into play. So we know what to focus on. We've got teams working on it, and we're going to get there. But this leach thing will really help with the unit costs. Yeah. So the incremental cost per pound for the leach initiatives or under $1 per pound incrementally. And the reason why they're lower is because the -- essentially, the mining cost has already been incurred. So this is ore that is in stockpiles where we're essentially recovering more metal than what our prior plans suggested we could do. And so we're identifying places within the stockpile where the rock has not gotten the benefit of this catalyst solution. And we've been able to identify these areas through our censoring and data analytics. And so now we're working on operational tactics to go after it. And so essentially, you don't have the mining cost because you've already incurred that. So this is all just incremental. And so that -- to the extent it scales, that has the benefit of bringing down the average unit cost in the US. And so it's something we're really, really focused on because it will change the competitive position of these US operations, principally our Morenci mine, which has most this potential. So we're really excited about it. We've got new technologies. We're bringing in some expertise from other industries, adjacent industries. It's helping us. We've got the agricultural industry that we've been taking the page from. We've got oil and gas industry, services industry that's helping us with some of these drilling techniques where we're drilling basically putting the solution. Usually, it's irrigated through, but over time, there's blockages, so we're now able to directly drill and put solution down into areas that aren't getting the benefit of the solution. And that's giving us a boost. We also call this other initiative, Leach Everywhere, and that's what I was referring to, where we're accessing areas that we couldn't get to before, and we're now able to get to them with drone technology helicopters where we can go places where humans couldn't go to lay these irrigation lines. So there's a lot happening here, a lot of excitement. We've got really major new mine potential here without big capital intensity and low incremental operating costs. So we're all over this one, Carlos. And -- but it does help us in terms of the incremental operating cost position of the US operations, the more we scale it. Well, the regulation was issued. We were waiting for a while the regulation to be finalized. And the regulation was issued in -- at the end of May. So that's a really positive development. And the catalyst really to put us in a position to be qualified as an integrated producer, which you have to be under this regulation to apply for a life of mine extension was the smelter. And so moving the smelter into commissioning and to the operational phase as we move into the next few months, really positions us to be able to apply. None of the conditions that are outlined in the regulation were surprises to us. It was in line with what we've been talking about with the government for some time now. We've got to actually put together the application package, which we're doing and we can apply now at any time. So we expect to apply to the license, there's not any guidelines for how long the government has to respond to that application. But the discussions we've had previously have been that the government wants to move forward with this quickly because they understand the long lead times, and they want to really see us get started on defining new resources and mine plans that allow us to have a continuity beyond 2041. So our objective is to get this done during 2024. I think that is really doable. And whether or not it's within this administration, the current administration is in place through October. I think there's large spread positive reaction to the smelter and to PT-FI being an integrated producer and to continuing the long-term benefits. And so whether it's this administration or the next, I think there's positive momentum for PT-FI to get this done during 2024. Liam, in terms of your first question, it is a very large complex project and smelter startups there aren't a lot of them on the scale in the Western world in recent years. And so we've recognized that for some time and have been planning for this over an extensive period of time. We've brought together the expertise that Freeport has around the world in operating smelters. We operate a smelter in the US, in Arizona. We have efficient smelter in Huelva, Spain, that we've operated for some time. We also have an existing smelter in Indonesia that we're in partnership with a Japanese partner there that has been very successful. So we've brought to bear all of the expertise in not only looking at construction, and we've had a team, a dedicated team on the construction side who have just done a great job. But on an operational side, we've been standing up this team for some time to be able to run the smelter and training people, we've had \u2013 we've already got the people employed. We've brought in expertise from around the world to lead startup. And so we've planned for it. And your point is well understood by the company. We feel we're well-prepared for it, with any start-up you're going to have issues. We recognize that. But every time we've thrown issues and challenges at this team through the construction period and into the commissioning period, we've been able to overcome them. I hope you have a chance, if you haven't already, to look at the video showing really where this \u2013 where the smelter is in terms of operational readiness, and we're showing all the various facilities as part of it. So we've planned for it. We understand it's going to be a different way of marketing our product. In the past, in Indonesia, we've loaded concentrate on a ship and pay the TC/RC and collected our revenue, and that was pretty simple. Now it's got a more a more complex logistics situation, and we've got a number of products we'll be marketing. But the team has been working on this, and we've got expertise in operating smelters and marketing various products. And so we're well situated for it. In terms of the reporting, it will be reported. It's integrated into PT-FI. It will be reported as part of PT-FI's results, you'll be able to see its operating costs through the TC and RC line on our unit cost. But above that line in the revenue line, of course, we're going to be able to generate higher revenues because we're marketing directly. We have the -- essentially the free metal that will come through to our benefit. We don't have to pay a smelter, the payable factors, et cetera. So, it will be a piece of revenues and a piece of operating costs, but we'll provide disclosures to help you through that. We won't have the duties any longer. And so that's a sizable benefit as well. for our results. But just in terms of the operations and readiness, I'm going to ask Cory Stevens make a couple of comments. Cory is -- he Heads up our Engineering Group, our Project Construction Group, our group that deals with operational efficiencies. So, he's got a big portfolio, not only leading the smelter project, but also the leach innovation initiative. But Cory is just back from Indonesia and maybe, Cory, you can just supplement what I was talking about in terms of the readiness for operations. Yes. And I just want to emphasize one thing at Freeport, when we do a major project, we benefit from having a centralized team that supports operating teams. And so unlike some other companies that don't have this kind of infrastructure that can really help manage the construction period and transition to operations, we really can bring together the best of the best when it comes to executing a start-up. And I'm not sugarcoating, we're going to have things that come up, we know that, but we really have the right people that -- in place to have a safe and efficient start-up. We expect in August that we'll get first processing of concentrate through the facility. And as Cory said, the ramp up we expect to move pretty quickly to go through the end of 2025 -- I mean 2024, we're also -- we got a precious metal refinery that will be starting up in the same timeframe. in the revenue line, of course, we're going to be able to generate higher revenues because we're marketing directly. We have the -- essentially the free metal that will come through to our benefit. We don't have to pay a smelter, the payable factors, et cetera. So, it will be a piece of revenues and a piece of operating costs, but we'll provide disclosures to help you through that. We won't have the duties any longer. And so that's a sizable benefit as well. for our results. But just in terms of the operations and readiness, I'm going to ask Cory Stevens make a couple of comments. Cory is -- he Heads up our Engineering Group, our Project Construction Group, our group that deals with operational efficiencies. So, he's got a big portfolio, not only leading the smelter project, but also the leach innovation initiative. But Cory is just back from Indonesia and maybe, Cory, you can just supplement what I was talking about in terms of the readiness for operations. Yes. And I just want to emphasize one thing at Freeport, when we do a major project, we benefit from having a centralized team that supports operating teams. And so unlike some other companies that don't have this kind of infrastructure that can really help manage the construction period and transition to operations, we really can bring together the best of the best when it comes to executing a start-up. And I'm not sugarcoating, we're going to have things that come up, we know that, but we really have the right people that -- in place to have a safe and efficient start-up. We expect in August that we'll get first processing of concentrate through the facility. And as Cory said, the ramp up we expect to move pretty quickly to go through the end of 2025 -- I mean 2024, we're also -- we got a precious metal refinery that will be starting up in the same time frame. So a lot has gone into this project, a lot of planning. And it's been executed well, and we expect that we'll continue to execute it well through the ramp-up. Cory, you have one on your mind? Yes, it's 150,000 ounces, Bob, and it comes back into our plan over the next few years. And so it just didn't -- it didn't round enough to up our numbers, but it is purely a timing situation. And when we look at the \u2013 our overall 5-year plan, it really it didn't change much. Mark Johnson is on the call, the issue we had in the second quarter, and we expect will continue for a period 2024 is we had some wet draw points that had spillage that we couldn't get back in to clean up. It took -- takes a while to clean it up. We've got a robust remote mining, underground mining system, and that's working really well. And what the team is working on is a remote pumping system that allows us to clean up these spills more quickly, and so we don't have as much disruption in these areas. But it really is just a timing thing. And Mark, I don't know if there's anything you want to add to those comments? That's something that would be approved by the by the Minister of Energy & Minerals. We've been talking with the government. We do have plans to conduct exploration and we're doing some of that now. In the future, we'll conduct additional exploration that will allow us to identify additional resources. And so that is -- it's really part of our plan for extension. In terms of the additional refining capacity, there's been discussion with the government. There is an aspiration to have additional capacity in Papua. Our current smelter is located in Gresik, and there's an aspiration to have additional capacity in Papua, and that continues to be discussed with the government. But there's not a -- the regulation doesn't have a specific number or level of investment. It really is a matter of looking at what's needed in country and the desire is to have it located in Papua, and we'll be working to evaluate that along with the government. The 10%, offering a 10% interest to a state-owned company, and we're talking with MIND ID about their objective to acquire additional 10%. The discussions we've had to date with the government have involved offering that 10%, and this is coming from FCX's shares, offering that 10% at -- with a reimbursement of our capital costs incurred for the current period through 2041 to the extent that, that benefits the period beyond 2041. So it's essentially a book value concept. And the rationale for offering the 10% and the mechanism for valuing it has been that the government is granting PT-FI with the extension and it's a cost of the deal. And from our perspective, being able to extend beyond 2041, there's a lot of value there that if we don't move forward and make investments that we won't be able to accomplish. So we felt it in the spirit of the partnership we have with the government where it's a one-off alignment and a win-win that this was an appropriate to give us the optionality to have value significant value beyond 2041. The financial policy is basically one where we distribute through dividends and share purchases, available cash, 50% of available cash. The smelter investments were not part of that math. So we're financing the separately. So the available cash definition is really just the flow and less the CapEx that's required for the current operation. It doesn't include the smelter. It doesn't include our future growth that we're investing in the discretionary projects that we've labeled earlier. So that will be a function of what our cash flows are. We certainly want to continue buying back stock, but it will be a function of what ultimate cash flows, and we'll continue to follow that policy. Just as a reminder, we're moving past the hour here, and I know people have been asking more than one question, so please limit to one and we'll get back to you with follow-ups. Hi, Mike. Mike, I think your line is cutting out. I can hear you now. I think in South America, there's a strong desire to see more investment certainly Peru and Chile, both, want to see more investment in mining is such a big part of their economy. So they are very, very interested. Now you've got to make sure you've got the community and social matters done in the right way, but there is a strong desire for those to make investments. Chile is going through a process now of looking at its permitting and trying to streamline permitting. We talked about El Abra project going through a long permitting process, and we're hopeful that this process that the government is now undertaking will allow a streamlining of permits. But I think both countries want to see more investment in mining. The US as well, you've seen that in recent times with the US prioritizing metals that are critical to the supply chain. And so I think the environment for -- in these countries for making investments is more positive than it has been in the past. But again, I want to emphasize the social aspect of this and the community aspect. It doesn't mean that, that lowers the bar and what our responsibilities are to sustainability into communities and environmental management and social good. So you've got to tick all the boxes, but there is a growing recognition of a need for these metals, and copper is one of the leads for that. So we are in a good position. We're in a particularly good position in the US with our current operations where \u2013 what we're talking about doing is building on existing operations. And so the permitting requirements are not as extensive for types of projects we're pursuing as they would be for a greenfield project or project in Chile, for example. And US is also talking about streamlining, permitting and regulatory. So we're in a good position, the Lone Star, Safford opportunity that I talked about earlier is one that even though our studies are a little behind where we are in Chile with El Abra, that project will catch up pretty quickly because we don't have the extensive permitting requirements to do that project that we have in Chile. So we're very focused on getting that project defined, so we can look at them together and see, which one is -- drives the most value for our business and shareholders. And so we really have an advantage in the US with the existing operations and leveraging our current position. Of course, the leaching doesn't require new permits. So we're in a good position to bring on projects more quickly than maybe others could. Thanks Mike. Lawson, you're right. It's like our other projects, long-term development, Grasberg underground blockade, the capital is spent over a multiyear period. And we do, in our projections, show that we'll start ramping up spending in Kucing Liar as we go forward. The average of $400 million a year over a 10-year period was -- we're spending a little bit lower than that, and that will begin to ramp up and we'll have some years where it's higher than $400 million. And there may be additional development in that $4 billion that will occur after we start. So, -- but we are expecting a start-up KL towards the end of this decade in advance of 2030. And it is a very large scale, 90,000 tons a day of ore, significant copper and gold production from that deposit. A real benefit of this extension beyond 2041, is the resource is much larger than what we'll mine between late 20s, late 2020s and in 2041. So, we'll have -- we did the economics and the economics paid at just the life that ends in 2041. But there's a lot of resource beyond that, that will come in the fold with an extension. So, it's a great extension of Grasberg. It's in that district. We're leveraging everything that we've learned from developing the Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ, and prior to that, our other ore bodies, but it's basically the same kind of development that we've had in the past, and we're using all the new learnings and technologies that have benefited us in the development of Grasberg Block Cave. So, we're in a good place there and feel good about our execution of this project over the next several years, leading into 2030, where we'll have good production coming from this operation. Hey, Brian. Yes. Well, as part of the application to the government for the extension, we will submit an agreement to make the transaction. And that agreement is currently being discussed with MIND ID. The -- what's been discussed over the last couple of years with respect to this, or the last year plus, is the way it will work is the 10% share transfer will take place in 2041. And the price paid at that point will be a reimbursement of the capital that was incurred between now and 2041 that benefits the period beyond 2021. So to the extent, it's not like the Rio Tinto deal at all. It's basically just a reimbursement at book value of what's there to benefit the period beyond 2041. So essentially, look at the at the book value end of 2041 and that pro rata percentage, 10% of our shares will be transferred and that will be the purchase price will be the reimbursement of capital. So the cash flows between now and 2041 won't be impacted by it. The current run rate is what's in our numbers. We do see opportunities to build on it through these initiatives that we're pursuing to move up to this 300 million to 400 million pound per annum range. And so it will come over time. It's not going to come in all at once. And so as we go through this year and next year, we'll probably have more than what we've currently got in our plans. But we haven't put forward. We're still deploying these tactics, we feel very confident about them, but we haven't put those into our numbers at this stage, and that will be something that we'll continue to update as we go forward. Thank you, Regina, and thank you, everyone, for your interest and participation. And if you have any follow-ups, feel free to contact David."

            "content": "Thank you, David and thank you all for joining us today. Well, we've seen quite a couple of months of volatility in the markets. I was on CNBC right when copper hit $5 for the first time ever, and I had big smiles on my face. Now, the reality of the copper markets have shown up and I just want to say a couple of comments about it. Many of you have heard me say for a long time that copper move from a cyclical metal that it had been in years past to one that's been driven more by episodic events. In China, its demand had been growing recently and has set records even in the face of poor performance in certain sectors, most notably the property segment. Recently, demand has been softening in other sectors. Credit markets in China have been soft, the high prices led to destocking. There's been a very tight concentrate market, which persists, TCs and RCs are record low levels and that's brought a lot of scrap to the marketplace. The government incentivized scrap for a period of time. And as a result, was a destocking, the softening demand, global inventories have risen, and that has triggered macro trading in commodities, particularly after the disappointment that the Third Plenum didn't result in a clear statement of incentivizing the economy in China. This simply won't last. There's limits to destocking, China will respond to its economy, there's underlying strength there, and we're very confident that this will improve over time. In fact, they've taken the first step with the recent interest rate cut. Underlying all of this is really the fundamentals of the global copper marketplace. The world is getting more and more electrified with connectivity, with dealing with carbon emissions, challenges there, but that's the fact that the world has to deal with A1 and Jeff Currie, recently talked about the importance of increased defense spending and that creates another element of demand. Supply changes, supply challenges continue and in certain cases are growing. And so as we look forward, our strategy is based on a fundamentally positive outlook about long-term copper demand and the reality of developing new supplies to meet that demand. It was really something to see, copper at $5. And I'll tell you, we're going to see it again. I want to make one quick comment to recognize our team for the great work we've done in reaching the commissioning of our new smelter in Indonesia. This was a major project, the world's largest single-line smelter. Construction is essentially complete. We posted a new video on our website last evening. I encourage you all to watch it just to see the size and scale of this new world-class facility. It's really something to visit it and seeing just the extent of the facility. This was a key commitment we made to the government of Indonesia in 2018, when we resolved to reach a global resolution of the issues that had been under discussion for so many years, it's a strategic importance for our business interest in Indonesia for the long-term by becoming a fully-integrated producer there with our mining operations, PT-FI will now be able to apply for extension of its operations for the long-term, which will really enhance the benefits of all stakeholders; the government, the people of Papua, our employees, Freeport and all shareholders and our partner, MIND ID, a state-owned company. Project has been in works for several years in a world that was challenged during this period of time by COVID and inflationary factors that have been evident in so many projects around our copper industry, it's really accomplishment by our team to bring this in on time and with reasonable budget spending on it. It's quite a facility. Take a look at the video. We are looking forward to getting our extension and then developing our plans to maximize the value of this resource over its life and not have any time limit of 2041 facing it. So we're really encouraged by -- and again, our team just did a tremendous job there. Kathleen, I'll turn it over to you. And Kathleen, let me just add that this is different from what we had to face in the past. We're not debating on this. It's in everyone's best interest there's widespread acceptance for it. And there's a clear understanding now that shareholder -- all stakeholders benefit from us looking how to maximize the value of this resource. So it's -- for those of you who follow us in the past, this is a different process, and it's very positive. Hey, Mike. Years of commitment to doing what Kathleen just said of doing the right thing, building relationships have led us in the US to have uniform support from communities, from native American groups, from state governments and regulators. The same goes true in Peru for our Cerro Verde project in the Arequipa region where Peru can be very challenging. It's got very challenging politics right now, but we benefit from work we've done to support the community and that's very helpful. And then in Chile, we're \u2013 our 49% partner at El Abra is CODELCO, and they are very anxious for us to move forward and very supportive. We developed a relationship with [indiscernible] will be on a panel with him at APAC and Peru this fall. And the tone has significantly changed from his initial election period where he's met the realities of the need for Chile to help support the mining sector. This is always such a big important part of our business, as you can see around the world. We learned a lot of lessons early on with the development of Grasberg and the need to have good relationships with indigenous people there as well as with central government. So, I'm proud of what our team has done, and we're just committed to finding common ground and doing things in the right way. And Brian, that transaction occurs after 2041. It's not like the Rio deal where the transaction occurred in the mid-90s, and it was just a question of how it was applied. So if for whatever reason it doesn't occur, then our interest will stay the same. It's anticipated the government would act to acquire that 10%, and that would be the agreement on the cost reimbursement, we get triggered when that transaction occurs."

            "content": "No, Kathleen, I think you touched on it. We've been managing wet muck going back to the IOZ, so roughly over 20 years. Some of the things, as you mentioned, we had some spills that traveled a bit further. So that in the GBC, there's some unique material characteristics that we're mitigating. And the primary one, as Kathleen mentioned, is the ability to remotely place pumping equipment and pump out the water that accumulates during some of our time entry criteria. So what we have is a period of time that we wait to get safely back in, what we're seeing is that the water builds up during that period of waiting. By getting the remote pumping in, we'll be able to have it pump before the -- while this time is taking place and then we can start our cleanup much quicker. One of the things that we did in GBC is -- that was a bit unique, we -- because it's the foundation of our operation and the primary source of value, we built in the additional operational flexibility by developing more draw points than theoretically required to meet the production rate. And that's what allowed us to shift to this other area that had very similar copper grades, but incrementally lower gold grades. And as Kathleen mentioned, over the five years, that that goal you had mentioned is back in the plan. And we plan to have this mitigation measure strongly in place, firmly in place in the fourth quarter, and I'm confident we can do that."

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Joint, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nDavid Joint: Thank you, Regina, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan conference call. Earlier this morning, Freeport reported its first quarter 2024 operating and financial results. A copy of our press release with supplemental schedules and slides is available on our website, fcx.com. Today's conference call is being broadcast live on the Internet. Anyone may listen to the conference call by accessing our website home page and clicking on the webcast link. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call. A replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin today's \u2013 our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that our press release and certain of our comments on the call include non-GAAP measures and forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. Please refer to our cautionary language included in our press release and slides and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings, all of which are available on our website. Also on the call with me today are Richard Adkerson, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Kathleen Quirk, President; Maree Robertson, Senior Vice President and CFO; and other senior members of our management team. Richard will make some opening comments, Kathleen will review our slide materials and then we'll open up the call for questions. I would now like to call \u2013 turn the call over to Richard.\nRichard Adkerson: Thank you, David, and thank you all for joining us. We're really pleased today to report our first quarter results. They reflect a continuation of Freeport's long-running success in executing our business plans. Kathleen will present our results, as David said, and then we'll answer your questions. Kathleen will become Freeport's CEO, effective with our Annual Shareholders Meeting on June 11. I will continue as Chairman and support Kathleen and our management team on important strategic issues and external relations. This will be the most seamless management transition in history. There's been a 20-year transition, in fact. Coincidentally, Kathleen joined Freeport shortly after I did 35 years ago and I've been an adviser to the company for the previous two decades. She advanced through our finance group to become CFO when I became CEO 20 years ago. And since then, she has been integral to the management of the company. When I became Chairman three years ago, I made a personal commitment to build a sustainable Board and a sustainable management team. And since that time, we've added six high-quality independent directors, new directors, which together with our continuing directors comprise a very strong independent board to represent our shareholders. We bolstered our staff with internal promotions and external hires. Freeport is strongly positioned for the future, and I'm personally proud to be able to say that at this point. 20 years ago, we made a strategic commitment to copper based on the fundamentals of supply and demand for the commodity. The validity of that commitment has never been more evident, and the best is yet to come. My personal enthusiasm for Freeport's future has never been stronger. I cannot be more pleased with our Board and with our management team under Kathleen's leadership. Kathleen, I'll turn the call over to you for your slides.\nKathleen Quirk: Great, and thank you, Richard. And a special thank you to you for your outstanding and visionary leadership during your long tender as our \u2013 tenure as our CEO. As I prepare to become CEO in June, I'm focused on our copper-leading strategy centered on reliable execution of our plans, disciplined cost and capital management and continuing our drive for profitable growth. Our seasoned team knows this business has a proven ability to navigate challenges and a passion for finding value in our assets. I look forward to building on our past success and to leading our company to new highs in the future. Starting on Page 3, Slide 3, we have a new annual report out with this year's theme being the value of copper. The report is available on our website. It highlights our performance, our copper-focused strategy and our strength as a premier copper producer. We'll also be publishing our annual sustainability report, which will be available on our website later this week. This report, which we've been doing for some time now, details our environmental and social performance, which we take very seriously as part of our commitment to responsible production. On Slide 4, we present our key focus areas of \u2013 for 2024. These are the same items we discussed in our January call and we thought it would be good to show these again for reference so you can track our progress against these areas as we go through the year. On Slide 5, turning to the first quarter highlights. We're off to a really good start so far in 2024. As summarized, we exceeded our guidance for first quarter copper sales. Gold sales were in line with our estimates and consolidated unit net cash costs were better than forecast. We generated strong margins and cash flows during the quarter with $2.5 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1.9 billion in operating cash flows, and that was at an average copper price of $3.94 per pound. Capital expenditures, excluding $0.5 billion for the Indonesian smelter project totaled $800 million in the quarter, and we reduced our net debt. We made great progress on several important initiatives, including on the Indonesian smelter, which is scheduled to start up in June, building momentum in our innovative copper leach initiative and continuing to build optionality in our organic growth pipeline. Market conditions are increasingly positive. They are growing recognition of factors, driving favorable fundamentals in copper and we've also seen a rise in gold prices year-to-date. Recall that Grasberg is one of the world's largest mines in terms of both copper and gold production. Moving to copper markets, starting on Slide 6, the growing intensity of use of copper in the global economy is supported by secular trends, particularly in electrification. Copper is a foundational, essential metal when it comes to electrification, and the world is becoming more and more focused on copper-intensive energy applications. New massive investment in the power grid, renewable generation, technology infrastructure and transportation are driving increased demand for copper and forecasts call for above-trend growth and demand for the foreseeable future. This is occurring at a time when there are constraints on existing supplies, an absence of major new copper development projects and extended multiyear lead times for supply development, pointing to tight market conditions for an extended period of time. Copper producers, including us, at Freeport have been citing physical market tightness for some time. And in the last several weeks, the copper price has risen to reflect the reality of the market situation. Based on historical periods of above trend growth in demand, we may be in the early stages of a repricing for long-term copper prices. And we illustrate this on Slide 7, where we show how copper prices responded 20 years ago when China emerged as a major consumer of copper. You can see on this chart that within 12 months, the copper price increased by 40% and was up nearly four times within a three-year period. During 2023, the secular drivers for copper demand provide a growth in demand despite weakness in some of the more cyclical drivers of copper demand. In the fourth quarter of last year, industry announcements of sizable supply disruptions tightened the market significantly. This is clearly evident when you look at the physical concentrate markets where smelters drop TC, treatment charges, sharply as a result of the shortage of concentrate supply. Notably, recent manufacturing data points also indicate that the global economy is recovering. Recently improved macroeconomic sentiment, combined with physical market conditions have driven prices higher, copper prices higher year-to-date, and many analysts are now projecting significantly higher copper prices in the future. At Freeport, our financial performance is highly levered to copper prices, as you'll see from our sensitivities; we'll review later in the presentation. We're not predicting where prices will go from here, and recognize there will be volatility. But clearly, the fundamentals point to an extended period of deficits and significantly higher copper prices over the long term. That's very positive for a company like ours with large-scale, long-life producing assets and organic development opportunities. Now I will cover the operating highlights from the quarter. This is presented on Slide 8. We are summarizing the key operating highlights by geographic region. In the U.S., we continue to work to mitigate the impact of lower ore grades by focusing on initiatives to improve efficiency and reliability of our equipment, the productivity of our workforce and sharpening our focus on cost reduction. We're making progress in these areas, but we still have work to do to regain our goal of being at the top of the industry in terms of efficiency and productivity. Our innovative leach initiative is providing incremental volumes and has helped us mitigate the impact of lower ore grades. As we previously reported, we reached over our 200 million pound per annum run rate, we've got several initiatives in progress to scale this to the 300 million-pound to 400 million-pound per annum range over the next two years. We're also continuing to take advantage of new technologies and automation across the portfolio, which we believe have a lot of potential to move the needle as we go forward. In South America, we \u2013 our ore milled was slightly below 400,000 metric tons of ore per day at Cerro Verde. Team worked through several challenges during the quarter associated with material types, which required optimizing mill throughput to address recoveries. And the team was successful in achieving copper volume targets by increasing mine rates and accessing higher than planned grades. Our moly byproduct volumes were impacted, however, by low recoveries associated with the material types and progress is being made to address this. At our El Abra mine in Chile, we had a good quarter, and we met expectations. We are also pleased to report that Cerro Verde recently finalized an agreement for a new four-year labor agreement with its workforce. In Indonesia, we had another exceptional quarter of performance. Both copper and gold production exceeded our forecast with higher mill rates, higher ore grades and recoveries. Our net unit cash costs for the quarter in Indonesia was a net credit of $0.12 per pound. That means our gold byproduct credits more than offset all of the cash production costs. Our underground ore mined, which is the largest block-cave mine district in the world averaged 220,000 tons per day that was above the fourth quarter of 2023 and significantly above last year's first quarter. The Grasberg Block Cave mine is our largest in the district, and it continues to achieve strong performance. We've also increased our rates at the extra high-grade smaller mine at Big Gossan by nearly 30%. Our new SAG mill, which we installed at the end of last year, is performing very well. We're nearing completion of a mill recovery project, and that will enable higher mill recoveries in the future. And our team there is just doing outstanding work in sustaining and optimizing value from this large resource position. Topping it off the PT-FI team recently finalized a new two-year labor agreement with our workforce. Give a report on Slide 9 of where we stand with our smelter project and the completion of this new smelter in Indonesia is a very important catalyst for us, as we work to secure an extension of our long-term operating rights in Indonesia. We made substantial progress in the first quarter and now we're focused on the remaining critical path and transitioning to commissioning and start-up activities. We're on track to begin hitting the furnaces during June, followed by concentrate process in August and first cathode in October. We're working closely with the Indonesian government to continue to export concentrates and anode slimes until the smelter and precious metals are fully operational, and we expect that by year-end when we will become a PT-FI, a fully integrated metals producer. Discussions with the government to-date are positive and that's supported by the project status and the startup plans. In terms of our startup, we have a very talented local team who will be supported by a large team of Freeporters from around the globe, including from our Spanish operations and our U.S. smelting operations to support an efficient startup. We're very focused on our growth and optionality in our growth pipeline, and we've got a summary on Slide 10, where we go through where we stand on the various projects. We have dedicated teams working on advancing opportunities to grow production in the future. And here, you'll see the update for each of the major initiatives underway, starting with the innovative leach initiative where our team has several work streams in progress to take our initial success and build substantial scale. This project has the highest net present value potential of any project we have seen historically because of low capital intensity, low incremental operating costs. And at Freeport, we're uniquely positioned to capture this value with our sizable existing footprint, technical know-how and new technologies available to us. At our Bagdad operation in Northwest Arizona, we talked about it on our last call. And now we're continuing to take steps to derisk the brownfield expansion project by converting the existing haul truck fleet to fully autonomous, expanding housing infrastructure at the site and expanding our tailings facilities. We're also continuing to monitor labor market conditions in Arizona and hope to be in a position to make an investment decision by the end of next year. From there, the project would take about three to four years to construct. At our Lone Star, Safford brownfield project in Eastern Arizona, we're commencing a pre-feasibility study this year to define and frame a major expansion. As we've been talking about over many quarters, we have a sizable resource here and expect this district will become a major cornerstone asset for us in Arizona during the next decade. At El Abra, in Chile, we have a large resource that can support a new concentrator of scale and we're looking at a concentrator similar to the size of the Cerro Verde concentrator expansion we installed nearly 10 years ago. We've done substantial work to define the project, and we're currently in the process of retesting the economics and taking a hard look at capital costs in light of the recent industry experience in Chile. We're working to be in a position to file an environmental impact statement by the end of next year, and this project would require seven to eight years of lead time because of permitting requirements. In Indonesia, we're continuing to advance our large-scale Kucing Liar development to commence production by 2030. We also have several additional exploration targets in the district and expect to have additional long-term development options that would become available with an extension of our operating rights beyond 2041. We're going to continue to be disciplined in our approach, targeting opportunities that can be executed efficiently and profitably and where we think we can create value for our shareholders. We wanted to take you through a little bit of our leach history on Slide 11 that provides history of what we've achieved to-date on this innovative project. We started on this journey two years ago with data analytics and new operating practices to tap into our large stockpiles to recover copper from material that was previously mined. Through a combination of actions to achieve greater heat retention in the stockpiles, gaining access to areas of the stockpiles that had not been optimally leached historically, and through the use of better identification of trap potential, we\u2019ve been successful in adding incremental copper previously thought to be unrecoverable. This initiative has grown now to be a major value driver for our Americas business, particularly for our largest U.S. mine in Morenci. As we mentioned, we achieved our initial target for an annual run rate of 200 million pounds per annum, now focused on doubling this or scaling what we\u2019ve learned to date. To date, the success has largely been operationally driven, complemented by new data and technology. At the same time, in parallel, we\u2019re advancing studies on new additives that could boost recoveries and we\u2019re exploring options for adding heat to existing stockpiles to generate incremental copper. In the aggregate, these initiatives have the potential to reach 800 million pounds per annum and that\u2019s the equivalent of a large-scale copper mine with low capital intensity, low cost and a low carbon footprint. About half of this can be achieved through further scaling, as we mentioned, and the other half relates to technology under development. The value potential is very attractive, particularly for Freeport given our large quantities of suitable materially \u2013 material that we previously mined. In terms of our timing of all this on Slide 12, we summarized potential growth and that we frame it in near-term, medium-term and longer-term horizons. We\u2019ve outlined identified projects in the Americas, totaling 1.7 billion pounds and the Kucing Liar project currently in development in Indonesia, and that\u2019s expected to continue to support long-term production profiles in the Grasberg District. In the two to three-year category, we set our focus on incremental production, on scaling our leach initiatives and operational improvement projects. Together, the potential from these opportunities total 400 million pounds and do not require significant investment or long lead times. In three to five-year category, we\u2019ve got the Bagdad expansion opportunity and the additional potential from our leach initiatives. El Abra is reflected in the seven to eight-year category and Lone Star is not on here, but it\u2019s also a major opportunity, which we\u2019re currently defining. It\u2019s likely a bit further out, but we feel it will be a major new opportunity for us as we go forward. The KL development in Indonesia is proceeding on schedule. We expect to commence production before 2030 and ramp up to over 500 million pounds of copper and 500,000 ounces of gold, which is meaningful operation. In Indonesia, an extension of our rights beyond 2041 would open substantial opportunity for reserve and resource expansion and continuation of large-scale mining in one of the world\u2019s largest and highest grade copper and gold mining districts. We\u2019re in a strong position, as you see here, to continue our leadership role in supplying copper to a world with growing requirements. On Slide 13, as we usually do, we show our three-year outlook for sales volume of copper, gold and molybdenum. We\u2019ve increased our 2024 copper sales by about 1.5%, reflecting the first quarter outperformance. The rest of the guidance is similar to our outlook at the start of the year. We\u2019re also estimating consolidated net unit cash costs to approximate $1.57 per pound on a consolidated basis that\u2019s slightly below our previous guidance of $1.60 per pound. We\u2019ve got some details of the makeup of this average presented on Slide 25 in the restaurants materials. With a strong cash flow generator, as you can see on Slide 14, where we show modeled results for our EBITDA and cash flows at various copper prices ranging from $4 per pound to $5 per pound for the average of 2025 and 2026. We\u2019re using our current volume estimates for 2025 and 2026, our cost estimates and we\u2019re holding gold flat here at $2,300 per ounce and molybdenum at $20 an ounce for illustration. Under this scenario, annual EBITDA would range from almost $11 billion per annum at $4 copper to in excess of $15 billion per annum at $5 copper and our operating cash flows would range from over $7.5 billion per year at $4 copper and over $11 billion per year at $5 per pound copper. We\u2019ve got sensitivities to the various commodities on the right with long life reserves, large-scale production; we\u2019re extremely well-positioned to benefit from improved pricing, providing substantial cash flow for investments in our organic growth and cash returns to shareholders on our performance-based payout framework. On Slide 15, we show our current estimates for capital expenditures for 2024 and 2025. Not much has changed since our last update. $3.6 billion is projected for 2024, which is consistent with our prior guidance. And in 2025, we estimate CapEx will total about $3.9 billion. That\u2019s about $100 million higher than the January estimate and reflects timing changes for our Kucing Liar project spend for 2025. During this period \u2013 during this two-year period, discretionary projects totaled $2.5 billion. This is \u2013 this category reflects the capital investments we're making in new projects that under our financial policy, are funded with the half of available cash that is not distributed. And these projects are all value-enhancing initiatives, and we've got some details in the back \u2013 in the reference materials. Finally, getting to financial policy on Slide 16. We reiterate the policy priorities centered on a strong balance sheet, cash returns to shareholders and investments and value-enhancing growth projects. Balance sheet continues to be very strong. We've got great metrics \u2013 credit metrics and significant flexibility within our debt targets to execute on our projects. As indicated here, we've distributed about $4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share purchases since starting this new financial policy and we've got a very attractive future long-term portfolio that will enable us to continue to build long-term value for shareholders. A sustained higher price for copper will drive higher cash returns to shareholders while allowing us to invest in future value-oriented growth. We're going to continue to actively monitor the market conditions. We'll carefully manage the timing of our projects and make sure that our financial flexibility remains strong. In closing, our global team is driven by value, and we continue to focus on what matters in our business by executing our plans responsibly, safely and efficiently and maximizing the value of our vast resources. We thank you all for your attention, and we'll now open up the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Liam Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nLiam Fitzpatrick: Good morning, Kathleen.\nKathleen Quirk: Good morning.\nLiam Fitzpatrick: Good morning. Liam Fitzpatrick from Deutsche Bank. The first question is just on your U.S. assets. You've been talking about for some time, the productivity improvements that you're targeting. Could you give us a bit more color on when we should expect some of this to be visible in the numbers? And what sort of change are you hoping for? Is this just to do better than inflation? Or could there be more of a step change at some stage? And then the second question, two parts to it really is just on your projects. Firstly, on Bagdad, I think the timing you give in the presentation suggests you could make an investment decision next year. I just wanted to check that's the right timing to think about. And then at El Abra, if you do nothing at that mine, when will it be facing a more material drop off in grades? Thank you.\nKathleen Quirk: Thanks, Liam. In terms of the U.S. operations, what we're faced with right now is very low ore grades, the lowest ore grades we've had in \u2013 since 2010. So that is structurally a challenge for us. Over the last couple of years, we've also been dealing with labor shortages in the U.S. and needing to make sure that our people are trained and can gain the efficiencies that we've had in 2019 before COVID. We're making really good progress with the work that we're doing. It's not easy work. It's hard work every single day, but we know what the work is. And we've got to make sure that our equipment is operating that we're getting the asset efficiencies in our equipment that we should be getting. If we look back over the last couple of years, we haven't gotten the asset efficiencies that we've had historically. And so we've been working on that. We've been working on maintenance to make sure that our equipment health is strong; we're working on training of a workforce that's less experienced. And it's just basic blocking and tackling, but the headwind is the ore grades. And we're really happy with the results of the leach initiative, and that's provided us with some benefits as we've gone through these lower ore grades. But we still think we have a lot of potential. And we're making the progress. We've got detailed scorecards of what we're doing every day in all the drivers of what makes us efficient. Everybody is focused on it. We're also focused on technology advancements. You read about the advancements we have at Bagdad, where we're looking to convert the haul truck fleet there to fully autonomous. We've got all kinds of technology initiatives available to us that we haven't had historically. And I think that is a key driver for us also as we look at improving our North American operations. But we think we do have opportunities within the portfolio, within the North American portfolio to increase production as we gain productivity and that\u2019s the 200 million pound a year range. And that\u2019s a focus of ours and I think we\u2019re on the path. It doesn\u2019t happen overnight, but it takes working every day and discipline around it. But we know what to focus on. Regarding your question at Bagdad, we\u2019ve got the study done. What we\u2019re focused on there is really this workforce situation where we want to make sure that when we go forward with the project that we can do it efficiently and that we can deliver the project within the capital cost estimates and within the timeframes. And so we want to take our time in doing additional work, de-risking the plan as we go forward over the next 18 months. And then once we get this autonomous fleet converted, we\u2019ll be in a position to reassess the situation and be in a position to move forward. It\u2019s not \u2013 in an ordinary environment, it\u2019s not a complex project. It\u2019s a brownfield project where we have a substantial history in the district. The issue really gets to the labor market conditions and also, we want to continue to monitor the copper markets, et cetera, as we always do. But this is a very executable plan if we can deal with the workforce challenges that we have in Arizona, which is a very competitive place right now given all the activity in the state. With respect to El Abra, we\u2019re looking at the current operation, which is very small relative to the size of Freeport, has got life to it over the next several years and will start to decline, probably give us another 10 years, but we have some water. We\u2019ve got to get some water extensions and things that we\u2019re working on there. But the El Abra project is very exciting from the standpoint of the resource. It\u2019s very large. It\u2019s not in our current reserves. And so we have the ability to add reserves of scale. In terms of the overall project, like I mentioned, we\u2019ve done a lot of work on it. We feel very good about being able to execute it. But the things that we\u2019re working on there are really going back and looking at our capital cost estimates really stress testing those, understanding what happened at other projects in Chile and figuring out, make sure we\u2019re comfortable that the economics of the project are as good as they look initially. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re testing now. The long lead time in Chile is because of the permitting requirements. It takes an extended period of time to get the data necessary to file the application. And then as you know, there\u2019s a review period that can span two to three years. And I know Chile is working to streamline its permitting that would be helpful for us as well. But really, what we\u2019re focused on there is getting to a point where we can file the environmental impact statement and then that will give us additional optionality. But there\u2019s good value in that project for us.\nLiam Fitzpatrick: Okay. That\u2019s great color. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Chris LaFemina with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nChris LaFemina: Hi, Richard and Kathleen. Thanks for taking my question. First, I just wanted to say congratulations on the operating performance in Indonesia. That has been very impressive. And once again, this past quarter, pretty incredible what you\u2019ve done there, so congrats on that. And then secondly, I just wanted to ask a follow-up on the trends in cost in the U.S. So if you did, what, 51 million pounds of leach \u2013 production from that new leaching initiatives in the U.S. in the first quarter. And if we assume that\u2019s around $1 a pound, that would imply that the rest of your production in the U.S. is around $3.35, $3.40 a pound for net cash cost. And then if we add to that sustaining CapEx, it\u2019s probably something close to $4 a pound free cash flow breakeven. So my first question is, is that right? Are you at around $4 a pound free cash flow breakeven in the U.S. if you exclude the benefit of the new leaching initiatives?\nKathleen Quirk: In terms of the leaching initiatives, when you look at our reported cash costs, you have to consider that until we add additional pounds to the stockpiles. What we\u2019re recording as our average cost is reflective of our average cost of per unit and stockpiles. So as we gain more confidence, the denominator will drop, so we\u2019re pulling those pounds out now out of the stockpiles are reflecting like a $3 average cost. When in reality, the incremental cost is closer to $1. So as we get more confidence and we\u2019re able to add more pounds, multiyear amounts of this leach reserve, you'll see that unit costs come down. But in terms of your analysis, it may be shy of the $4 you're talking about, but we are in a lower grade area of the North America right now. And so our unit costs are relatively high compared to historical levels. We've had cost inflation as everybody has seen, but the other area where we're focused on is more on the things that we can control. And we've seen some of the inflationary pressures moderate, but the things that we want to continue to work on is to avoid unplanned maintenance, to avoid \u2013 to reduce our maintenance costs. And also as we get more workers within our own team, and we get those workers trained up, it will reduce our reliance on contractors, which has been a big cost for us. And that's what we've had to do during this period of the labor challenges is rely more on contractors, and so right now, we're really rationalizing contractors and training up our people to be able to do this work. So the leach opportunity, big picture, is really going to be a step change, though, as we go forward in the U.S. And if we're able to be successful in adding another 200 million pounds from the leach initiative at a very low incremental cost and improving our technology \u2013 I mean, our productivity gains, you'll see our costs start to trend a lot lower in the U.S., and that's what we're focused on. That's what Josh and his team are focused on. Maree is very focused on it as well and her team. So we're all over this, Chris.\nChris LaFemina: Right. So that $1 per pound cash cost for leaching is not what's reflected in the production cost in the first quarter and that was reflected in the 2024 full year guidance, right? You're using something like $3 a pound in the guidance as well?\nKathleen Quirk: Yes. It's just coming out at the average when we report it. And the way it will come down on our financial books is with an increase in estimates and future estimates, because the costs are spread over what's remaining in the stockpiles. And as we add more volumes to the stockpiles, that will reduce the incremental cost and be reflective really truly of what's really occurring.\nChris LaFemina: Got it. Thank you.\nKathleen Quirk: From a cash flow standpoint, it doesn't affect cash flow. So the cash flow, we really are getting the benefit of the incremental cost below $1.\nChris LaFemina: So if we think about the cash flow, you have the smelter construction is nearly complete. You're going to one way or another, not be paying royalties at the smelters ramped up. Copper price is obviously higher\u2026\nKathleen Quirk: Duty.\nChris LaFemina: Duty, sorry, the copper price is obviously higher, gold price is higher, balance sheet is clean. You have your performance-based capital return policy, which you haven't really executed on in the last year. You've had a lot going on, but I'm just wondering in terms of timing of when we could see those supplemental capital returns. Is that something the Board will consider imminently? Or is it kind of \u2013 do we have to get through certain events before you consider delivering those capital returns? Thanks.\nKathleen Quirk: Yes. Well, we have been executing under the policy. We've distributed since we started the policy, 50% of our available cash flow. And so all the items that you cite and that excludes the smelter, but all the items that you cite are building to give us more cash that will be available for distribution. And we'll continue to file that policy of higher prices is going to be more cash flows and more cash returns to shareholders. And that is the policy.\nChris LaFemina: Great. Thank you very much. Good luck.\nKathleen Quirk: Thanks, Chris.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nKathleen Quirk: Hi, Mike.\nMichael Dudas: Good morning, David, Richard and Kathleen.\nRichard Adkerson: Hey, Mike.\nMichael Dudas: Hi, I think you mentioned in response to the question about operating costs and cost moderation. So maybe you can touch a little bit more on what you're seeing on the ground more specifically in your North America and South American mines on cost improvement, what your expectations are versus what it might have been a few months ago? And how are you seeing that in some of the feasibility studies that you're working on and completed? And what kind of \u2013 have we seen double-digit inflation continuing on the capital cost side that's going to continue to make it a little bit more challenging for Freeport and others to really follow through and provide the material of our market needs?\nKathleen Quirk: Yes. I think those issues have moderated a bunch, and we're getting more into a stable situation, while it's higher than it has been. It is more stable. For instance, when we were going out for bids for things a year or two ago, you might get one bidder on a project. And now things are opening up some more for us. So on that part, I think it's stabilized now. We\u2019ll continue to test it. And whenever we run our projects and run our economics, we always look at a range of what the capital costs are and what the sensitivities are to higher or lower capital spend. But in terms of the extremes that we have seen in the recent years, we\u2019re not encountering that right now. And in terms of commodity input costs and things, they\u2019ve been more moderate and more stable than we\u2019ve seen in some time. We all know that that can change, but it has been more stable. The things that we need to work on are particularly in the U.S. of this issue I mentioned with respect to the labor force and the experience levels and with contractors. And the third thing, and one of the most important is reliable asset efficiency. And so those are the challenges that we have and we\u2019re working on them. I feel very confident that we\u2019re turning the corner on that. We\u2019re continuing to make good progress on really driving efficiency within the U.S. operations. We haven\u2019t had the issue in South America and in Indonesia. We\u2019ve got a much more stable workforce, much more experienced workforce. We\u2019ve also benefited there from a stronger dollar. So many of our \u2013 much of our labor cost is in foreign currency. So we have benefited there from a stronger dollar and have not seen, obviously haven\u2019t seen that benefit in the U.S. But we do believe there are some things within our control that we\u2019re focused on now. And now that things have moderated some with inflation. We\u2019ve got a clear focus on being as efficient as we can, recognizing that low grades becomes a challenge. But we want to do better than inflation. I mean, that\u2019s what we want to make sure that we can overcome inflation in our costs with productivity gains and efficiency gains. And we\u2019ve got technologies available to us that we haven\u2019t had in the past. And I think as a company, we\u2019re going to be leaning a lot more into innovation as a tool to help us with productivity.\nMichael Dudas: Excellent, Kathleen. Thank you.\nRichard Adkerson: Let me just add one point on the broader copper market implications of that question. Kathleen described very well the things we\u2019re doing within our company. And when you look back at our cost history in relation to general inflation, we\u2019ve done a good job with our supply chain team. But the shocking amount of overruns on the major project in Chile, but elsewhere and also the political situation in Panama, as I talk with CEOs around the industry, makes us all step back and say we have to be careful. We have to be careful because the overruns are more than just simply inflation. And we\u2019re still trying to get our arms around what\u2019s going on with these projects to cause them to be delayed and to have the kind of cost situations they have. At the end of the day, this is just another major element for the positive outlook for copper prices. I mean, if these problems were easily solved and this is a tough business, you wouldn\u2019t have the supply shortfalls that we\u2019re having. And that\u2019s been a major factor from seeing the recent run up in copper prices. And it\u2019s also something that\u2019s very supportive for the longer-term outlook for copper prices.\nMichael Dudas: Well said, Richard.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Bill Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nKathleen Quirk: Hey, Bill.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning, Kathleen, Richard, it\u2019s actually Bennett on for Bill this morning.\nKathleen Quirk: Hey, Bennett.\nUnidentified Analyst: If I could, I wanted to ask what, if any, is the company\u2019s current dialogue with the new leadership in Indonesia and how you see that relationship developing over time.\nKathleen Quirk: Well, the transition doesn\u2019t take place until October, and we\u2019re continuing to work with the existing administration. We\u2019ve got some matters that we\u2019re working together on with respect to the concentrate license that we talked about earlier as well as the IUPK extension. And so we\u2019re continuing to work with the current administration on these matters. We have a long history in Indonesia. We just celebrated 57 years of operation there. And we\u2019ve worked with many governments over the years and many administrations. And we feel very confident that we\u2019ll continue to have good relations with the new administration. And what we focus on, we\u2019re not \u2013 we don\u2019t get involved in politics. So we focus on what we do there to be a good citizen of Indonesia, to provide benefits to the national government, the local government, all of our workforce, the community and stakeholder work that we do there is very important and that\u2019s \u2013 that lasts that survives administrations. And so we really focus on the things that make the asset good for Indonesia and good for all the stakeholders. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ll continue. Richard, I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything to those comments?\nRichard Adkerson: Sure. I\u2019ve been going to Indonesia now for all my career with Freeport over 35 years, and our relationships have never been better. I was just in Washington Friday evening for a reception to celebrate 75 years of positive relationships between the U.S. government and the Republic of Indonesia and the Finance Minister, Sri Mulyani and the Central Bank Governor Perry were there. And I wish you all could just hear the positive things that were set around this table of a number of companies and a number of Indonesian government officials about the current way that Freeport is viewed and how positive they see our partnership is in building PT-FI, which is an Indonesian company and to be in such a success for all the stakeholders.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks. That's helpful. And if I could just squeeze in one more on the topic regarding the future mining rates in Indonesia, we saw a headline last week that these could potentially be granted as soon as this upcoming June. So I'm wondering if there's any updates you can provide there? And what additional ask maybe on the table from the government there?\nRichard Adkerson: Let me just say that we have gotten \u2013 we have an agreement with the government on the structure beyond 2041. There's no controversy over that, and there's general support for it. The \u2013 I believe the fact that the election occurred and we just went through Ramadan is having an effect on the timing, but we're very pleased. I mean it's important to know that we currently under our existing permit have no rights to anything beyond 2041. And it makes no sense for any stakeholder to have this operation run without having a long-term plan for it in terms of doing more drilling to understand what resources are there, doing long-term planning or how those resources will be developed. The Indonesian \u2013 our Indonesian shareholder mines ID understands that. The Ministry of Mines understands that the President's Office does as well. So I'm confident we're going to be able to get that. As always, there's uncertainties as to when the actual formalities will be concluded to grant the regulations to allow us to continue. But there's no real controversy about the structure going forward.\nKathleen Quirk: And delivery of the smelter is an important part of that. And the government is very pleased with the progress we've made in getting the smelter to a point where it can be commissioned next quarter \u2013 this quarter.\nUnidentified Analyst: All right. Understood. Thank you very much and best of luck going forward.\nKathleen Quirk: Thank you, Bennett.\nRichard Adkerson: Thanks, Bannett.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Lawson Winder with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\nLawson Winder: Hi. Good morning.\nRichard Adkerson: Good morning, Lawson.\nLawson Winder: Good morning, operator. Yes. Good morning Richard and Kathleen. Thank you for today's update. Maybe just on Cerro Verde, if I could, is there still a pathway to consistently exceeding well over 400,000 tons per day at that asset?\nKathleen Quirk: Absolutely.\nRichard Adkerson: I can't tell you what a great job our team down there has done. I visited recently and I mean, just the spirit, the relationships with the local community. And as you all know, Peru is a very complicated country and has a lot of issues politically and economically to deal with, but it is just an uplifting experience to see what our team has done down there. I had some friends with me and to see an operation where we're moving 400,000 \u2013 over 400,000 metric tons of material a day, that's the equivalent of 80,000 street dump trucks moving material in a single day. And so it's an inspiration quite frank, for me to see it. The community supports us. We've got a great workforce. We're actually bringing some of our Peruvian operating people to work in Arizona and New Mexico to support our operations there, but it's an uplifting place to go for me.\nKathleen Quirk: Lawson, it's not without challenges this team has demonstrated, as Richard said, that they can \u2013 they're very resilient team and can deal with a lot of different challenges. But water is something that is always a concern. We did with our expansion almost 10 years ago to put in a water treatment facility, and we provide clean water to the community, and it also supports our own operations. But particularly during this time where we've been through El Nino and droughts and there's always a focus on water, but the ore is there, the resource is there, and the team has got \u2013 we've got the assets there and the team has got really good work practices. And as Richard said, the relationship with the community is top-notch.\nLawson Winder: Okay. That addresses my question. Thank you very much.\nRichard Adkerson: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of John Tumazos from John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please go ahead.\nJohn Tumazos: Thank you very much. In the first quarter, the minority interest was $689, and the income to shareholders was $473. Could we interpret from that that the U.S. mines made about $200 million less profits than the overhead or the U.S. operations are losing money? And what are the short term remedies? For example, how quickly can you convert to autonomous drugs and mitigate wage inflation, et cetera?\nRichard Adkerson: But one thing, John. Kathleen, let me say one thing to John before you answer the question, Kathleen. And I've seen some of your writings, John, and the minority ownership in PT-FI came about from the Rio Tinto deal in the mid-1990s, and that really hasn't changed. That just was transferred to the government of Indonesia and that joint venture interest was converted to shares. But in 2018, Freeport, through the agreement that we reached, maintained virtually the same economic interest in the mine that we've had all along. So this wasn't something that happened because of the government, but because of a deal that was cut back in the mid-1990s. And you know, the, when you look through it, and I talk with our Americas people and our people in the U.S. about it, because even though our mines in the U.S. are low grade, because of the fact we have a very favorable income tax situation in the U.S., bolstered by net operating loss carryforwards, we own our lands in fees, so there's no royalties. We get community support for schools and hospitals and our workers. We don't have to provide for the same things we do overseas that we do overseas. And so the profitability of those mines is really very attractive. And that's what makes these growth opportunities in the U.S. so attractive for Freeport. You and I both remember a time when people thought the Southwest copper district was dead. And right now it's a big part of the future for our country in terms of providing the copper resource needed for the energy transition and electrification broadly. But also it's a great opportunity for our shareholders to create value for Freeport, to create value for our shareholders.\nKathleen Quirk: John, I was just going to point you to the press release. There's some, in the back of the press release, there's some segment analysis, and you can look at the segments we show, how much the U.S. mines contributed, etcetera. And if that doesn't answer your question, just follow up with us afterward.\nJohn Tumazos: Thank you.\nOperator: Our last question will come from the line of Martin Malloy with Johnson Rice and Company. Please go ahead.\nKathleen Quirk: Hi, Marty.\nMartin Malloy: Good morning. I wanted to ask, with your leaching technology, does that give you a competitive advantage and maybe looking at acquisition opportunities?\nKathleen Quirk: Well, we're focused on \u2013 I mean, we've got almost 40 billion pounds in our own in our inventory. And that doesn't include some really old areas where we're not active. But yes, I mean, to answer your question, it does give us some interest in some things that may have this opportunity to be able to apply our know-how to it. But we're really focused on our own organic situation. If an opportunity came available that had this, we would be interested in seeing what we could make out of it. But we've got a lot within our portfolio to be able to get substantial value for our shareholders from.\nRichard Adkerson: Yes. And a lot is understating it. It is massive, what we have the opportunity to develop from what's already owned by Freeport from our existing stockpiles and Kathleen mentioned our historical stockpiles. So yes, an opportunity came along, but I'm not expecting it. I think that we're going to be able to grow tremendous amounts of value doing with what we have, which now the company really has, others have opportunities. No one else has it in this kind of scale that we do.\nMartin Malloy: Thank you.\nOperator: With that, we'll turn the call over to management for any closing remarks.\nKathleen Quirk: Thanks, everyone, for all your good questions today and your interest in Freeport, and we look forward to reporting in the future on our progress.\nRichard Adkerson: Thank you, all.\nOperator: That concludes our call for today. Thank you all for joining, and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kathleen Quirk",
            "content": "Great, and thank you, Richard. And a special thank you to you for your outstanding and visionary leadership during your long tender as our \u2013 tenure as our CEO. As I prepare to become CEO in June, I'm focused on our copper-leading strategy centered on reliable execution of our plans, disciplined cost and capital management and continuing our drive for profitable growth. Our seasoned team knows this business has a proven ability to navigate challenges and a passion for finding value in our assets. I look forward to building on our past success and to leading our company to new highs in the future. Starting on Page 3, Slide 3, we have a new annual report out with this year's theme being the value of copper. The report is available on our website. It highlights our performance, our copper-focused strategy and our strength as a premier copper producer. We'll also be publishing our annual sustainability report, which will be available on our website later this week. This report, which we've been doing for some time now, details our environmental and social performance, which we take very seriously as part of our commitment to responsible production. On Slide 4, we present our key focus areas of \u2013 for 2024. These are the same items we discussed in our January call and we thought it would be good to show these again for reference so you can track our progress against these areas as we go through the year. On Slide 5, turning to the first quarter highlights. We're off to a really good start so far in 2024. As summarized, we exceeded our guidance for first quarter copper sales. Gold sales were in line with our estimates and consolidated unit net cash costs were better than forecast. We generated strong margins and cash flows during the quarter with $2.5 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1.9 billion in operating cash flows, and that was at an average copper price of $3.94 per pound. Capital expenditures, excluding $0.5 billion for the Indonesian smelter project totaled $800 million in the quarter, and we reduced our net debt. We made great progress on several important initiatives, including on the Indonesian smelter, which is scheduled to start up in June, building momentum in our innovative copper leach initiative and continuing to build optionality in our organic growth pipeline. Market conditions are increasingly positive. They are growing recognition of factors, driving favorable fundamentals in copper and we've also seen a rise in gold prices year-to-date. Recall that Grasberg is one of the world's largest mines in terms of both copper and gold production. Moving to copper markets, starting on Slide 6, the growing intensity of use of copper in the global economy is supported by secular trends, particularly in electrification. Copper is a foundational, essential metal when it comes to electrification, and the world is becoming more and more focused on copper-intensive energy applications. New massive investment in the power grid, renewable generation, technology infrastructure and transportation are driving increased demand for copper and forecasts call for above-trend growth and demand for the foreseeable future. This is occurring at a time when there are constraints on existing supplies, an absence of major new copper development projects and extended multiyear lead times for supply development, pointing to tight market conditions for an extended period of time. Copper producers, including us, at Freeport have been citing physical market tightness for some time. And in the last several weeks, the copper price has risen to reflect the reality of the market situation. Based on historical periods of above trend growth in demand, we may be in the early stages of a repricing for long-term copper prices. And we illustrate this on Slide 7, where we show how copper prices responded 20 years ago when China emerged as a major consumer of copper. You can see on this chart that within 12 months, the copper price increased by 40% and was up nearly four times within a three-year period. During 2023, the secular drivers for copper demand provide a growth in demand despite weakness in some of the more cyclical drivers of copper demand. In the fourth quarter of last year, industry announcements of sizable supply disruptions tightened the market significantly. This is clearly evident when you look at the physical concentrate markets where smelters drop TC, treatment charges, sharply as a result of the shortage of concentrate supply. Notably, recent manufacturing data points also indicate that the global economy is recovering. Recently improved macroeconomic sentiment, combined with physical market conditions have driven prices higher, copper prices higher year-to-date, and many analysts are now projecting significantly higher copper prices in the future. At Freeport, our financial performance is highly levered to copper prices, as you'll see from our sensitivities; we'll review later in the presentation. We're not predicting where prices will go from here, and recognize there will be volatility. But clearly, the fundamentals point to an extended period of deficits and significantly higher copper prices over the long term. That's very positive for a company like ours with large-scale, long-life producing assets and organic development opportunities. Now I will cover the operating highlights from the quarter. This is presented on Slide 8. We are summarizing the key operating highlights by geographic region. In the U.S., we continue to work to mitigate the impact of lower ore grades by focusing on initiatives to improve efficiency and reliability of our equipment, the productivity of our workforce and sharpening our focus on cost reduction. We're making progress in these areas, but we still have work to do to regain our goal of being at the top of the industry in terms of efficiency and productivity. Our innovative leach initiative is providing incremental volumes and has helped us mitigate the impact of lower ore grades. As we previously reported, we reached over our 200 million pound per annum run rate, we've got several initiatives in progress to scale this to the 300 million-pound to 400 million-pound per annum range over the next two years. We're also continuing to take advantage of new technologies and automation across the portfolio, which we believe have a lot of potential to move the needle as we go forward. In South America, we \u2013 our ore milled was slightly below 400,000 metric tons of ore per day at Cerro Verde. Team worked through several challenges during the quarter associated with material types, which required optimizing mill throughput to address recoveries. And the team was successful in achieving copper volume targets by increasing mine rates and accessing higher than planned grades. Our moly byproduct volumes were impacted, however, by low recoveries associated with the material types and progress is being made to address this. At our El Abra mine in Chile, we had a good quarter, and we met expectations. We are also pleased to report that Cerro Verde recently finalized an agreement for a new four-year labor agreement with its workforce. In Indonesia, we had another exceptional quarter of performance. Both copper and gold production exceeded our forecast with higher mill rates, higher ore grades and recoveries. Our net unit cash costs for the quarter in Indonesia was a net credit of $0.12 per pound. That means our gold byproduct credits more than offset all of the cash production costs. Our underground ore mined, which is the largest block-cave mine district in the world averaged 220,000 tons per day that was above the fourth quarter of 2023 and significantly above last year's first quarter. The Grasberg Block Cave mine is our largest in the district, and it continues to achieve strong performance. We've also increased our rates at the extra high-grade smaller mine at Big Gossan by nearly 30%. Our new SAG mill, which we installed at the end of last year, is performing very well. We're nearing completion of a mill recovery project, and that will enable higher mill recoveries in the future. And our team there is just doing outstanding work in sustaining and optimizing value from this large resource position. Topping it off the PT-FI team recently finalized a new two-year labor agreement with our workforce. Give a report on Slide 9 of where we stand with our smelter project and the completion of this new smelter in Indonesia is a very important catalyst for us, as we work to secure an extension of our long-term operating rights in Indonesia. We made substantial progress in the first quarter and now we're focused on the remaining critical path and transitioning to commissioning and start-up activities. We're on track to begin hitting the furnaces during June, followed by concentrate process in August and first cathode in October. We're working closely with the Indonesian government to continue to export concentrates and anode slimes until the smelter and precious metals are fully operational, and we expect that by year-end when we will become a PT-FI, a fully integrated metals producer. Discussions with the government to-date are positive and that's supported by the project status and the startup plans. In terms of our startup, we have a very talented local team who will be supported by a large team of Freeporters from around the globe, including from our Spanish operations and our U.S. smelting operations to support an efficient startup. We're very focused on our growth and optionality in our growth pipeline, and we've got a summary on Slide 10, where we go through where we stand on the various projects. We have dedicated teams working on advancing opportunities to grow production in the future. And here, you'll see the update for each of the major initiatives underway, starting with the innovative leach initiative where our team has several work streams in progress to take our initial success and build substantial scale. This project has the highest net present value potential of any project we have seen historically because of low capital intensity, low incremental operating costs. And at Freeport, we're uniquely positioned to capture this value with our sizable existing footprint, technical know-how and new technologies available to us. At our Bagdad operation in Northwest Arizona, we talked about it on our last call. And now we're continuing to take steps to derisk the brownfield expansion project by converting the existing haul truck fleet to fully autonomous, expanding housing infrastructure at the site and expanding our tailings facilities. We're also continuing to monitor labor market conditions in Arizona and hope to be in a position to make an investment decision by the end of next year. From there, the project would take about three to four years to construct. At our Lone Star, Safford brownfield project in Eastern Arizona, we're commencing a pre-feasibility study this year to define and frame a major expansion. As we've been talking about over many quarters, we have a sizable resource here and expect this district will become a major cornerstone asset for us in Arizona during the next decade. At El Abra, in Chile, we have a large resource that can support a new concentrator of scale and we're looking at a concentrator similar to the size of the Cerro Verde concentrator expansion we installed nearly 10 years ago. We've done substantial work to define the project, and we're currently in the process of retesting the economics and taking a hard look at capital costs in light of the recent industry experience in Chile. We're working to be in a position to file an environmental impact statement by the end of next year, and this project would require seven to eight years of lead time because of permitting requirements. In Indonesia, we're continuing to advance our large-scale Kucing Liar development to commence production by 2030. We also have several additional exploration targets in the district and expect to have additional long-term development options that would become available with an extension of our operating rights beyond 2041. We're going to continue to be disciplined in our approach, targeting opportunities that can be executed efficiently and profitably and where we think we can create value for our shareholders. We wanted to take you through a little bit of our leach history on Slide 11 that provides history of what we've achieved to-date on this innovative project. We started on this journey two years ago with data analytics and new operating practices to tap into our large stockpiles to recover copper from material that was previously mined. Through a combination of actions to achieve greater heat retention in the stockpiles, gaining access to areas of the stockpiles that had not been optimally leached historically, and through the use of better identification of trap potential, we've been successful in adding incremental copper previously thought to be unrecoverable. This initiative has grown now to be a major value driver for our Americas business, particularly for our largest U.S. mine in Morenci. As we mentioned, we achieved our initial target for an annual run rate of 200 million pounds per annum, now focused on doubling this or scaling what we've learned to date. To date, the success has largely been operationally driven, complemented by new data and technology. At the same time, in parallel, we're advancing studies on new additives that could boost recoveries and we're exploring options for adding heat to existing stockpiles to generate incremental copper. In the aggregate, these initiatives have the potential to reach 800 million pounds per annum and that's the equivalent of a large-scale copper mine with low capital intensity, low cost and a low carbon footprint. About half of this can be achieved through further scaling, as we mentioned, and the other half relates to technology under development. The value potential is very attractive, particularly for Freeport given our large quantities of suitable materially \u2013 material that we previously mined. In terms of our timing of all this on Slide 12, we summarized potential growth and that we frame it in near-term, medium-term and longer-term horizons. We've outlined identified projects in the Americas, totaling 1.7 billion pounds and the Kucing Liar project currently in development in Indonesia, and that's expected to continue to support long-term production profiles in the Grasberg District. In the two to three-year category, we set our focus on incremental production, on scaling our leach initiatives and operational improvement projects. Together, the potential from these opportunities total 400 million pounds and do not require significant investment or long lead times. In three to five-year category, we've got the Bagdad expansion opportunity and the additional potential from our leach initiatives. El Abra is reflected in the seven to eight-year category and Lone Star is not on here, but it's also a major opportunity, which we're currently defining. It's likely a bit further out, but we feel it will be a major new opportunity for us as we go forward. The KL development in Indonesia is proceeding on schedule. We expect to commence production before 2030 and ramp up to over 500 million pounds of copper and 500,000 ounces of gold, which is meaningful operation. In Indonesia, an extension of our rights beyond 2041 would open substantial opportunity for reserve and resource expansion and continuation of large-scale mining in one of the world's largest and highest grade copper and gold mining districts. We're in a strong position, as you see here, to continue our leadership role in supplying copper to a world with growing requirements. On Slide 13, as we usually do, we show our three-year outlook for sales volume of copper, gold and molybdenum. We've increased our 2024 copper sales by about 1.5%, reflecting the first quarter outperformance. The rest of the guidance is similar to our outlook at the start of the year. We're also estimating consolidated net unit cash costs to approximate $1.57 per pound on a consolidated basis that's slightly below our previous guidance of $1.60 per pound. We've got some details of the makeup of this average presented on Slide 25 in the restaurants materials. With a strong cash flow generator, as you can see on Slide 14, where we show modeled results for our EBITDA and cash flows at various copper prices ranging from $4 per pound to $5 per pound for the average of 2025 and 2026. We're using our current volume estimates for 2025 and 2026, our cost estimates and we're holding gold flat here at $2,300 per ounce and molybdenum at $20 an ounce for illustration. Under this scenario, annual EBITDA would range from almost $11 billion per annum at $4 copper to in excess of $15 billion per annum at $5 copper and our operating cash flows would range from over $7.5 billion per year at $4 copper and over $11 billion per year at $5 per pound copper. We've got sensitivities to the various commodities on the right with long life reserves, large-scale production; we're extremely well-positioned to benefit from improved pricing, providing substantial cash flow for investments in our organic growth and cash returns to shareholders on our performance-based payout framework. On Slide 15, we show our current estimates for capital expenditures for 2024 and 2025. Not much has changed since our last update. $3.6 billion is projected for 2024, which is consistent with our prior guidance. And in 2025, we estimate CapEx will total about $3.9 billion. That's about $100 million higher than the January estimate and reflects timing changes for our Kucing Liar project spend for 2025. During this period \u2013 during this two-year period, discretionary projects totaled $2.5 billion. This is \u2013 this category reflects the capital investments we're making in new projects that under our financial policy, are funded with the half of available cash that is not distributed. And these projects are all value-enhancing initiatives, and we've got some details in the back \u2013 in the reference materials. Finally, getting to financial policy on Slide 16. We reiterate the policy priorities centered on a strong balance sheet, cash returns to shareholders and investments and value-enhancing growth projects. Balance sheet continues to be very strong. We've got great metrics \u2013 credit metrics and significant flexibility within our debt targets to execute on our projects. As indicated here, we've distributed about $4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share purchases since starting this new financial policy and we've got a very attractive future long-term portfolio that will enable us to continue to build long-term value for shareholders. A sustained higher price for copper will drive higher cash returns to shareholders while allowing us to invest in future value-oriented growth. We're going to continue to actively monitor the market conditions. We'll carefully manage the timing of our projects and make sure that our financial flexibility remains strong. In closing, our global team is driven by value, and we continue to focus on what matters in our business by executing our plans responsibly, safely and efficiently and maximizing the value of our vast resources. We thank you all for your attention, and we'll now open up the call for questions. Good morning. Thanks, Liam. In terms of the U.S. operations, what we're faced with right now is very low ore grades, the lowest ore grades we've had in \u2013 since 2010. So that is structurally a challenge for us. Over the last couple of years, we've also been dealing with labor shortages in the U.S. and needing to make sure that our people are trained and can gain the efficiencies that we've had in 2019 before COVID. We're making really good progress with the work that we're doing. It's not easy work. It's hard work every single day, but we know what the work is. And we've got to make sure that our equipment is operating that we're getting the asset efficiencies in our equipment that we should be getting. If we look back over the last couple of years, we haven't gotten the asset efficiencies that we've had historically. And so we've been working on that. We've been working on maintenance to make sure that our equipment health is strong; we're working on training of a workforce that's less experienced. And it's just basic blocking and tackling, but the headwind is the ore grades. And we're really happy with the results of the leach initiative, and that's provided us with some benefits as we've gone through these lower ore grades. But we still think we have a lot of potential. And we're making the progress. We've got detailed scorecards of what we're doing every day in all the drivers of what makes us efficient. Everybody is focused on it. We're also focused on technology advancements. You read about the advancements we have at Bagdad, where we're looking to convert the haul truck fleet there to fully autonomous. We've got all kinds of technology initiatives available to us that we haven't had historically. And I think that is a key driver for us also as we look at improving our North American operations. But we think we do have opportunities within the portfolio, within the North American portfolio to increase production as we gain productivity and that's the 200 million pound a year range. And that's a focus of ours and I think we're on the path. It doesn't happen overnight, but it takes working every day and discipline around it. But we know what to focus on. Regarding your question at Bagdad, we've got the study done. What we're focused on there is really this workforce situation where we want to make sure that when we go forward with the project that we can do it efficiently and that we can deliver the project within the capital cost estimates and within the timeframes. And so we want to take our time in doing additional work, de-risking the plan as we go forward over the next 18 months. And then once we get this autonomous fleet converted, we'll be in a position to reassess the situation and be in a position to move forward. It's not \u2013 in an ordinary environment, it's not a complex project. It's a brownfield project where we have a substantial history in the district. The issue really gets to the labor market conditions and also, we want to continue to monitor the copper markets, et cetera, as we always do. But this is a very executable plan if we can deal with the workforce challenges that we have in Arizona, which is a very competitive place right now given all the activity in the state. With respect to El Abra, we're looking at the current operation, which is very small relative to the size of Freeport, has got life to it over the next several years and will start to decline, probably give us another 10 years, but we have some water. We've got to get some water extensions and things that we're working on there. But the El Abra project is very exciting from the standpoint of the resource. It's very large. It's not in our current reserves. And so we have the ability to add reserves of scale. In terms of the overall project, like I mentioned, we've done a lot of work on it. We feel very good about being able to execute it. But the things that we're working on there are really going back and looking at our capital cost estimates really stress testing those, understanding what happened at other projects in Chile and figuring out, make sure we're comfortable that the economics of the project are as good as they look initially. And that's what we're testing now. The long lead time in Chile is because of the permitting requirements. It takes an extended period of time to get the data necessary to file the application. And then as you know, there's a review period that can span two to three years. And I know Chile is working to streamline its permitting that would be helpful for us as well. But really, what we're focused on there is getting to a point where we can file the environmental impact statement and then that will give us additional optionality. But there's good value in that project for us. In terms of the leaching initiatives, when you look at our reported cash costs, you have to consider that until we add additional pounds to the stockpiles. What we're recording as our average cost is reflective of our average cost of per unit and stockpiles. So as we gain more confidence, the denominator will drop, so we're pulling those pounds out now out of the stockpiles are reflecting like a $3 average cost. When in reality, the incremental cost is closer to $1. So as we get more confidence and we're able to add more pounds, multiyear amounts of this leach reserve, you'll see that unit costs come down. But in terms of your analysis, it may be shy of the $4 you're talking about, but we are in a lower grade area of the North America right now. And so our unit costs are relatively high compared to historical levels. We've had cost inflation as everybody has seen, but the other area where we're focused on is more on the things that we can control. And we've seen some of the inflationary pressures moderate, but the things that we want to continue to work on is to avoid unplanned maintenance, to avoid \u2013 to reduce our maintenance costs. And also as we get more workers within our own team, and we get those workers trained up, it will reduce our reliance on contractors, which has been a big cost for us. And that's what we've had to do during this period of the labor challenges is rely more on contractors, and so right now, we're really rationalizing contractors and training up our people to be able to do this work. So the leach opportunity, big picture, is really going to be a step change, though, as we go forward in the U.S. And if we're able to be successful in adding another 200 million pounds from the leach initiative at a very low incremental cost and improving our technology \u2013 I mean, our productivity gains, you'll see our costs start to trend a lot lower in the U.S., and that's what we're focused on. That's what Josh and his team are focused on. Maree is very focused on it as well and her team. So we're all over this, Chris. Yes. It's just coming out at the average when we report it. And the way it will come down on our financial books is with an increase in estimates and future estimates, because the costs are spread over what's remaining in the stockpiles. And as we add more volumes to the stockpiles, that will reduce the incremental cost and be reflective really truly of what's really occurring. From a cash flow standpoint, it doesn't affect cash flow. So the cash flow, we really are getting the benefit of the incremental cost below $1. Duty. Yes. Well, we have been executing under the policy. We've distributed since we started the policy, 50% of our available cash flow. And so all the items that you cite and that excludes the smelter, but all the items that you cite are building to give us more cash that will be available for distribution. And we'll continue to file that policy of higher prices is going to be more cash flows and more cash returns to shareholders. And that is the policy. Thanks, Chris. Hi, Mike. Yes. I think those issues have moderated a bunch, and we're getting more into a stable situation, while it's higher than it has been. It is more stable. For instance, when we were going out for bids for things a year or two ago, you might get one bidder on a project. And now things are opening up some more for us. So on that part, I think it's stabilized now. We'll continue to test it. And whenever we run our projects and run our economics, we always look at a range of what the capital costs are and what the sensitivities are to higher or lower capital spend. But in terms of the extremes that we have seen in the recent years, we're not encountering that right now. And in terms of commodity input costs and things, they've been more moderate and more stable than we've seen in some time. We all know that that can change, but it has been more stable. The things that we need to work on are particularly in the U.S. of this issue I mentioned with respect to the labor force and the experience levels and with contractors. And the third thing, and one of the most important is reliable asset efficiency. And so those are the challenges that we have and we're working on them. I feel very confident that we're turning the corner on that. We're continuing to make good progress on really driving efficiency within the U.S. operations. We haven't had the issue in South America and in Indonesia. We've got a much more stable workforce, much more experienced workforce. We've also benefited there from a stronger dollar. So many of our \u2013 much of our labor cost is in foreign currency. So we have benefited there from a stronger dollar and have not seen, obviously haven't seen that benefit in the U.S. But we do believe there are some things within our control that we're focused on now. And now that things have moderated some with inflation. We've got a clear focus on being as efficient as we can, recognizing that low grades becomes a challenge. But we want to do better than inflation. I mean, that's what we want to make sure that we can overcome inflation in our costs with productivity gains and efficiency gains. And we've got technologies available to us that we haven't had in the past. And I think as a company, we're going to be leaning a lot more into innovation as a tool to help us with productivity. Hey, Bill. Hey, Bennett. Well, the transition doesn't take place until October, and we're continuing to work with the existing administration. We've got some matters that we're working together on with respect to the concentrate license that we talked about earlier as well as the IUPK extension. And so we're continuing to work with the current administration on these matters. We have a long history in Indonesia. We just celebrated 57 years of operation there. And we've worked with many governments over the years and many administrations. And we feel very confident that we'll continue to have good relations with the new administration. And what we focus on, we're not \u2013 we don't get involved in politics. So we focus on what we do there to be a good citizen of Indonesia, to provide benefits to the national government, the local government, all of our workforce, the community and stakeholder work that we do there is very important and that's \u2013 that lasts that survives administrations. And so we really focus on the things that make the asset good for Indonesia and good for all the stakeholders. And that's what we'll continue. Richard, I don't know if you want to add anything to those comments? And delivery of the smelter is an important part of that. And the government is very pleased with the progress we've made in getting the smelter to a point where it can be commissioned next quarter \u2013 this quarter. Thank you, Bennett. Absolutely. Lawson, it's not without challenges this team has demonstrated, as Richard said, that they can \u2013 they're very resilient team and can deal with a lot of different challenges. But water is something that is always a concern. We did with our expansion almost 10 years ago to put in a water treatment facility, and we provide clean water to the community, and it also supports our own operations. But particularly during this time where we've been through El Nino and droughts and there's always a focus on water, but the ore is there, the resource is there, and the team has got \u2013 we've got the assets there and the team has got really good work practices. And as Richard said, the relationship with the community is top-notch. John, I was just going to point you to the press release. There's some, in the back of the press release, there's some segment analysis, and you can look at the segments we show, how much the U.S. mines contributed, etcetera. And if that doesn't answer your question, just follow up with us afterward. Hi, Marty. Well, we're focused on \u2013 I mean, we've got almost 40 billion pounds in our own in our inventory. And that doesn't include some really old areas where we're not active. But yes, I mean, to answer your question, it does give us some interest in some things that may have this opportunity to be able to apply our know-how to it. But we're really focused on our own organic situation. If an opportunity came available that had this, we would be interested in seeing what we could make out of it. But we've got a lot within our portfolio to be able to get substantial value for our shareholders from. Thanks, everyone, for all your good questions today and your interest in Freeport, and we look forward to reporting in the future on our progress."

            "content": "Thank you, David, and thank you all for joining us. We're really pleased today to report our first quarter results. They reflect a continuation of Freeport's long-running success in executing our business plans. Kathleen will present our results, as David said, and then we'll answer your questions. Kathleen will become Freeport's CEO, effective with our Annual Shareholders Meeting on June 11. I will continue as Chairman and support Kathleen and our management team on important strategic issues and external relations. This will be the most seamless management transition in history. There's been a 20-year transition, in fact. Coincidentally, Kathleen joined Freeport shortly after I did 35 years ago and I've been an adviser to the company for the previous two decades. She advanced through our finance group to become CFO when I became CEO 20 years ago. And since then, she has been integral to the management of the company. When I became Chairman three years ago, I made a personal commitment to build a sustainable Board and a sustainable management team. And since that time, we've added six high-quality independent directors, new directors, which together with our continuing directors comprise a very strong independent board to represent our shareholders. We bolstered our staff with internal promotions and external hires. Freeport is strongly positioned for the future, and I'm personally proud to be able to say that at this point. 20 years ago, we made a strategic commitment to copper based on the fundamentals of supply and demand for the commodity. The validity of that commitment has never been more evident, and the best is yet to come. My personal enthusiasm for Freeport's future has never been stronger. I cannot be more pleased with our Board and with our management team under Kathleen's leadership. Kathleen, I'll turn the call over to you for your slides. Hey, Mike. Let me just add one point on the broader copper market implications of that question. Kathleen described very well the things we're doing within our company. And when you look back at our cost history in relation to general inflation, we've done a good job with our supply chain team. But the shocking amount of overruns on the major project in Chile, but elsewhere and also the political situation in Panama, as I talk with CEOs around the industry, makes us all step back and say we have to be careful. We have to be careful because the overruns are more than just simply inflation. And we're still trying to get our arms around what's going on with these projects to cause them to be delayed and to have the kind of cost situations they have. At the end of the day, this is just another major element for the positive outlook for copper prices. I mean, if these problems were easily solved and this is a tough business, you wouldn't have the supply shortfalls that we're having. And that's been a major factor from seeing the recent run up in copper prices. And it's also something that's very supportive for the longer-term outlook for copper prices. Sure. I've been going to Indonesia now for all my career with Freeport over 35 years, and our relationships have never been better. I was just in Washington Friday evening for a reception to celebrate 75 years of positive relationships between the U.S. government and the Republic of Indonesia and the Finance Minister, Sri Mulyani and the Central Bank Governor Perry were there. And I wish you all could just hear the positive things that were set around this table of a number of companies and a number of Indonesian government officials about the current way that Freeport is viewed and how positive they see our partnership is in building PT-FI, which is an Indonesian company and to be in such a success for all the stakeholders. Let me just say that we have gotten \u2013 we have an agreement with the government on the structure beyond 2041. There's no controversy over that, and there's general support for it. The \u2013 I believe the fact that the election occurred and we just went through Ramadan is having an effect on the timing, but we're very pleased. I mean it's important to know that we currently under our existing permit have no rights to anything beyond 2041. And it makes no sense for any stakeholder to have this operation run without having a long-term plan for it in terms of doing more drilling to understand what resources are there, doing long-term planning or how those resources will be developed. The Indonesian \u2013 our Indonesian shareholder mines ID understands that. The Ministry of Mines understands that the President's Office does as well. So I'm confident we're going to be able to get that. As always, there's uncertainties as to when the actual formalities will be concluded to grant the regulations to allow us to continue. But there's no real controversy about the structure going forward. Thanks, Bannett. Good morning, Lawson. I can't tell you what a great job our team down there has done. I visited recently and I mean, just the spirit, the relationships with the local community. And as you all know, Peru is a very complicated country and has a lot of issues politically and economically to deal with, but it is just an uplifting experience to see what our team has done down there. I had some friends with me and to see an operation where we're moving 400,000 \u2013 over 400,000 metric tons of material a day, that's the equivalent of 80,000 street dump trucks moving material in a single day. And so it's an inspiration quite frank, for me to see it. The community supports us. We've got a great workforce. We're actually bringing some of our Peruvian operating people to work in Arizona and New Mexico to support our operations there, but it's an uplifting place to go for me. Thank you. But one thing, John. Kathleen, let me say one thing to John before you answer the question, Kathleen. And I've seen some of your writings, John, and the minority ownership in PT-FI came about from the Rio Tinto deal in the mid-1990s, and that really hasn't changed. That just was transferred to the government of Indonesia and that joint venture interest was converted to shares. But in 2018, Freeport, through the agreement that we reached, maintained virtually the same economic interest in the mine that we've had all along. So this wasn't something that happened because of the government, but because of a deal that was cut back in the mid-1990s. And you know, the, when you look through it, and I talk with our Americas people and our people in the U.S. about it, because even though our mines in the U.S. are low grade, because of the fact we have a very favorable income tax situation in the U.S., bolstered by net operating loss carryforwards, we own our lands in fees, so there's no royalties. We get community support for schools and hospitals and our workers. We don't have to provide for the same things we do overseas that we do overseas. And so the profitability of those mines is really very attractive. And that's what makes these growth opportunities in the U.S. so attractive for Freeport. You and I both remember a time when people thought the Southwest copper district was dead. And right now it's a big part of the future for our country in terms of providing the copper resource needed for the energy transition and electrification broadly. But also it's a great opportunity for our shareholders to create value for Freeport, to create value for our shareholders. Yes. And a lot is understating it. It is massive, what we have the opportunity to develop from what's already owned by Freeport from our existing stockpiles and Kathleen mentioned our historical stockpiles. So yes, an opportunity came along, but I'm not expecting it. I think that we're going to be able to grow tremendous amounts of value doing with what we have, which now the company really has, others have opportunities. No one else has it in this kind of scale that we do. Thank you, all."
